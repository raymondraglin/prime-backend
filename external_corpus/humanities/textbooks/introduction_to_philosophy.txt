About Introduction to Philosophy

Introduction to Philosophy provides an overview of a common range of philosophical topics for a first- or
second-year general education philosophy course. It is organized thematically, following the principal
categories of academic philosophy (logic, metaphysics, epistemology, theories of value, and history of
philosophy). A recurring theme of Introduction to Philosophy is its incorporation of multicultural and global
perspectives. Texts, thinkers, and concepts from Middle Eastern, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Latin American,
Indigenous, and African philosophy are fully integrated into discussions of concepts and topics, broadening
the study of philosophy beyond the Western tradition. Another goal of the text is to help students develop
critical thinking, reading, and writing skills.
2 Preface

    Reflecting the Full Diversity of Human Understanding

    A multicultural and global perspective is a central organizing principle of Introduction to Philosophy. This text
    explores Eastern, African, and Indigenous perspectives in concert with and, in some cases, in juxtaposition to
    classical Western thinkers. Additionally, the authors have made a special effort to highlight the philosophical
    work of women, who have made important contributions to the history of philosophy in numerous traditions.
    This broader emphasis introduces students to approaches that open up traditional philosophical questions in
    provocative ways, offering fresh possibilities for social and individual understanding. As just one example,
    alongside discussion of the individualistic ways that Hume and Locke attempted to answer the question "what
    is the self" appears discussion of the African concept of ubuntu, sometimes translated as "a person is a person
    through other persons." Discussions of the four noble truths of Buddhism as a path to achieve liberation from
    suffering, the four interrelated concepts at the heart of Mohist ethical theory, and Carol Gilligan's care ethics
    are other examples of well-established answers to deep philosophical questions that provide fresh additions to
    classical Western ways of thinking.

    Providing Students with Transferable Skills

    Introduction to Philosophy is intentionally organized to develop critical thinking, research, reading, and
    writing skills. There is an entire chapter devoted to these transferrable skills associated with philosophy.
    Another chapter addresses logic and reasoning. Additionally, interspersed throughout the text are features
    providing guidance on how to read philosophy effectively, how to conduct research and evaluate sources, and
    how to write philosophy papers. These features aim to be very explicit about the habits and practices that
    enable one to be a good student of philosophy and, by extension, a good critical thinker.

    Reminding Readers that Philosophy Is a Living Discipline

    Calling attention to the fact that philosophy is not just a feature of our human past, Introduction to Philosophy
    discusses the ways contemporary academic philosophers address some of our most pressing ethical and
    moral issues. Examples include discussions of bioethics, emerging issues surrounding genetic engineering
    and communication technologies, what brain science can and cannot tell us about human consciousness, and
    morality pertaining to human treatment of the natural world. Through discussion of these topics and others,
    readers will gain awareness of the range of answers that contemporary philosophers offer to current issues
    and learn to appreciate the type of reasoning that philosophers use. Throughout the text, students are also
    encouraged to critically reflect on philosophical points of view and develop their own philosophical positions.

   Enriching and Engaging Features

    "Doing" Philosophy

    While there is certainly not one method of "doing" philosophy, there are practices and habits that make
    someone a better reader, writer, researcher, and thinker in philosophy. A set of recurring features makes these
    skills explicit and concrete, with guidance geared toward the introductory student.

      · Think Like a Philosopher. These features adopt one of two approaches. Some instances prompt students
          to engage with concepts key to philosophical argument, and thus to critical thinking, either in the form of
          interactive online exercises or as written guidance. Others guide students in formulating their own
          approaches to philosophical questions.

      · Write Like a Philosopher. These features challenge the reader to articulate their own written responses to
          philosophical prompts or to craft their own philosophical arguments. Clear guidance is given on both the
          considerations that should appear in the response and the most effective structure for written
          philosophical discourse.

      · Read Like a Philosopher. These features prompt students to engage with portions of key primary texts,
          such as Plato's Apology or the Daodejing. Clear structure is provided, guiding the reader on what elements
          of the text to pay close attention to and what questions they should hold in their minds while reading.

"How It All Hangs Together"

Philosophy is an inherently interconnected undertaking that speaks to universal human concerns. The broad
questions philosophers ask (e.g., what makes a good life, how does one define morality, how should people
treat one another, what rights should be accorded individuals within society) touch many aspects of our social
and individual existences. A number of features address the interconnectedness of philosophical inquiry and
philosophical thought, as well as its relevance to all lives.

  · Connections features. Throughout the text, callouts direct students to additional coverage of both
      important theories and key thinkers in other chapters.

  · Videos. Video features provide supplemental information from trusted contemporary sources, such as the
     BBC Radio 4 series A History of Ideas and the e-series Wi-Phi Philosophy.

  · Podcasts. Podcast links are provided from engaging series, such as The History of Philosophy without Any
     Gaps and Philosophy Bites.

Pedagogical Framework

An effective pedagogical framework helps students structure their learning and retain information.

  · Chapter Outlines. Each chapter opens with an outline and introduction, familiarizing students with the
      material that will follow. Throughout the chapter, material is chunked into manageable sections of content
      within each of the larger main heads.

  · Learning Objectives. Every main section begins with two to five clear, concise, and measurable learning
      objectives, tagged to Bloom's levels. These objectives are designed to help the instructor decide what
      content to include or assign and to guide student expectations. After completing the textual sections and
      end-of-chapter exercises, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives.

  · Chapter Summaries. Organized by section heads, chapter summaries distill the information presented in
      each chapter to key, concise points.

  · Key Terms. Key terms are bolded and followed by in-text definitions. A glossary of key terms also appears
      at the end of each chapter.

  · Critical Thinking Questions. Each chapter ends with 10 to 20 critical thinking questions, also organized
      by section head. Some of these questions assess recall of key concepts, while others ask students to think,
      read, and write like a philosopher. These more complex questions might prompt students to formulate
      thoughtful critiques of existing philosophical positions or to begin to articulate their own thoughts on
      philosophical questions. Any of these components can be used by instructors to build assessments and
      assignments for their courses.

  · "Further Reading" Suggestions. Each chapter ends with suggested resources for students who wish to
      dive deeper into the thinkers and thoughts discussed in the chapters.

Additional Resources

Student and Instructor Resources

We've compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including an instructor's manual, test
bank, and lecture slides. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can apply for
when you log in or create your account on OpenStax.org. Take advantage of these resources to supplement
Introduction to Philosophy.

  · Comprehensive Instructor's Manual. Designed to provide maximum guidance for delivering content in
      an interesting and dynamic manner, each chapter of the instructor's manual includes an in-depth lecture
      outline, a key terms list, a set of "questions for further thought," and a list of recommended resources for
     further reading and exploration. Authored by Kyle Hirsh, Community College of Aurora.

  · Test Bank. With 500 true/false and multiple-choice questions in our test bank, instructors can customize
      tests to support a variety of course objectives. The test bank is available in Word format. Authored by Steve
     Wyre, American Public University.

  · PowerPoint Lecture Slides. The PowerPoint slides provide outlines, images, and an overview of chapter
     topics as a starting place for instructors to build their lectures. Authored by Gregory Browne, Eastern
     Michigan University.

Academic Integrity

Academic integrity builds trust, understanding, equity, and genuine learning. While students may encounter
significant challenges in their courses and their lives, doing their own work and maintaining a high degree of
authenticity will result in meaningful outcomes that will extend far beyond their college career. Faculty,
administrators, resource providers, and students should work together to maintain a fair and positive
experience.

We realize that students benefit when academic integrity ground rules are established early in the course. To
that end, OpenStax has created an interactive to aid with academic integrity discussions in your course.

FIGURE 1.1 Philosophy begins with dialogue--with friends, with yourself, with other philosophers, and with the
past. (credit: "Conversations Time moves slowly when talking with old friends" by Sagar/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

CHAPTER OUTLINE

1.1 What Is Philosophy?
1.2 How Do Philosophers Arrive at Truth?
1.3 Socrates as a Paradigmatic Historical Philosopher
1.4 An Overview of Contemporary Philosophy

INTRODUCTION For most college students, an Introduction to Philosophy course is their first encounter with
the study of philosophy. Unlike most of your other courses, philosophy is not something usually covered in
high school. Yet you are probably familiar with the term philosophy and may have some preconceived notion
about what philosophy is and what philosophers do. Perhaps you have stayed up late at night talking with
friends or family about topics like free will or the existence of God. Maybe you have a friend who always talks
about big ideas or asks tough questions that sound like riddles. Perhaps you think of them as "philosophical";
you might be right.
In this chapter, we will provide a brief introduction to the field of philosophy as a historical and academic
discipline. This first chapter should prepare you for your philosophy course and give you a better idea of what
it means to be a philosopher. As with all introductions, this one is just a start. Your job is to explore more, think
more, read more, and write more like a philosopher. Soon you may even find that you are doing philosophy.
8 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

   1.1 What Is Philosophy?

      · Explain the connection between ancient philosophy and the origin of the sciences.
      · Describe philosophy as a discipline that makes coherent sense of a whole.
      · Summarize the broad and diverse origins of philosophy.

    It is difficult to define philosophy. In fact, to do so is itself a philosophical activity, since philosophers are
    attempting to gain the broadest and most fundamental conception of the world as it exists. The world includes
    nature, consciousness, morality, beauty, and social organizations. So the content available for philosophy is
    both broad and deep. Because of its very nature, philosophy considers a range of subjects, and philosophers
    cannot automatically rule anything out. Whereas other disciplines allow for basic assumptions, philosophers
    cannot be bound by such assumptions. This open-endedness makes philosophy a somewhat awkward and
    confusing subject for students. There are no easy answers to the questions of what philosophy studies or how
    one does philosophy. Nevertheless, in this chapter, we can make some progress on these questions by (1)
    looking at past examples of philosophers, (2) considering one compelling definition of philosophy, and (3)
    looking at the way academic philosophers today actually practice philosophy.

   Historical Origins of Philosophy

    One way to begin to understand philosophy is to look at its history. The historical origins of philosophical
    thinking and exploration vary around the globe. The word philosophy derives from ancient Greek, in which the
    philosopher is a lover or pursuer (philia) of wisdom (sophia). But the earliest Greek philosophers were not
    known as philosophers; they were simply known as sages. The sage tradition provides an early glimpse of
    philosophical thought in action. Sages are sometimes associated with mathematical and scientific discoveries
    and at other times with their political impact. What unites these figures is that they demonstrate a willingness
    to be skeptical of traditions, a curiosity about the natural world and our place in it, and a commitment to
    applying reason to understand nature, human nature, and society better. The overview of the sage tradition
    that follows will give you a taste of philosophy's broad ambitions as well as its focus on complex relations
    between different areas of human knowledge. There are some examples of women who made contributions to
    philosophy and the sage tradition in Greece, India, and China, but these were patriarchal societies that did not
    provide many opportunities for women to participate in philosophical and political discussions.

    The Sages of India, China, Africa, and Greece

    In classical Indian philosophy and religion, sages play a central role in both religious mythology and in the
    practice of passing down teaching and instruction through generations. The Seven Sages, or Saptarishi (seven
    rishis in the Sanskrit language), play an important role in sanatana dharma, the eternal duties that have come
    to be identified with Hinduism but that predate the establishment of the religion. The Seven Sages are partially
    considered wise men and are said to be the authors of the ancient Indian texts known as the Vedas. But they
    are partly mythic figures as well, who are said to have descended from the gods and whose reincarnation
    marks the passing of each age of Manu (age of man or epoch of humanity). The rishis tended to live monastic
    lives, and together they are thought of as the spiritual and practical forerunners of Indian gurus or teachers,
    even up to today. They derive their wisdom, in part, from spiritual forces, but also from tapas, or the
    meditative, ascetic, and spiritual practices they perform to gain control over their bodies and minds. The
    stories of the rishis are part of the teachings that constitute spiritual and philosophical practice in
    contemporary Hinduism.

    Figure 1.2 depicts a scene from the Matsya Purana, where Manu, the first man whose succession marks the
    prehistorical ages of Earth, sits with the Seven Sages in a boat to protect them from a mythic flood that is said
    to have submerged the world. The king of serpents guides the boat, which is said to have also contained seeds,

plants, and animals saved by Manu from the flood.

Despite the fact that classical Indian culture is patriarchal, women figures play an important role in the earliest
writings of the Vedic tradition (the classical Indian religious and philosophical tradition). These women figures
are partly connected to the Indian conception of the fundamental forces of nature--energy, ability, strength,
effort, and power--as feminine. This aspect of God was thought to be present at the creation of the world. The
Rig Veda, the oldest Vedic writings, contains hymns that tell the story of Ghosha, a daughter of Rishi Kakshivan,
who had a debilitating skin condition (probably leprosy) but devoted herself to spiritual practices to learn how
to heal herself and eventually marry. Another woman, Maitreyi, is said to have married the Rishi Yajnavalkya
(himself a god who was cast into mortality by a rival) for the purpose of continuing her spiritual training. She
was a devoted ascetic and is said to have composed 10 of the hymns in the Rig Veda. Additionally, there is a
famous dialogue between Maitreyi and Yajnavalkya in the Upanishads (another early, foundational collection
of texts in the Vedic tradition) about attachment to material possessions, which cannot give a person
happiness, and the achievement of ultimate bliss through knowledge of the Absolute (God).

Another woman sage named Gargi also participates in a celebrated dialogue with Yajnavalkya on natural
philosophy and the fundamental elements and forces of the universe. Gargi is characterized as one of the most
knowledgeable sages on the topic, though she ultimately concedes that Yajnavalkya has greater knowledge. In
these brief episodes, these ancient Indian texts record instances of key women who attained a level of
enlightenment and learning similar to their male counterparts. Unfortunately, this early equality between the
sexes did not last. Over time Indian culture became more patriarchal, confining women to a dependent and
subservient role. Perhaps the most dramatic and cruel example of the effects of Indian patriarchy was the
ritual practice of sati, in which a widow would sometimes immolate herself, partly in recognition of the "fact"
that following the death of her husband, her current life on Earth served no further purpose (Rout 2016).
Neither a widow's in-laws nor society recognized her value.
10 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

     In similar fashion to the Indian tradition, the sage (sheng) tradition is important for Chinese philosophy.
      Confucius, one of the greatest Chinese writers, often refers to ancient sages, emphasizing their importance for
      their discovery of technical skills essential to human civilization, for their role as rulers and wise leaders, and
      for their wisdom. This emphasis is in alignment with the Confucian appeal to a well-ordered state under the
      guidance of a "philosopher-king." This point of view can be seen in early sage figures identified by one of the
      greatest classical authors in the Chinese tradition, as the "Nest Builder" and "Fire Maker" or, in another case,
     the "Flood Controller." These names identify wise individuals with early technological discoveries. The Book of
     Changes, a classical Chinese text, identifies the Five (mythic) Emperors as sages, including Yao and Shun, who
      are said to have built canoes and oars, attached carts to oxen, built double gates for defense, and fashioned
      bows and arrows (Cheng 1983). Emperor Shun is also said to have ruled during the time of a great flood, when
      all of China was submerged. Yü is credited with having saved civilization by building canals and dams.

      FIGURE 1.3 The Chinese philosopher and historian Han Feizi identified sages with technological discoveries.
      (credit: "Portrait of Han Fei" by unknown author/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
      These figures are praised not only for their political wisdom and long rule, but also for their filial piety and
      devotion to work. For instance, Mencius, a Confucian philosopher, relates a story of Shun's care for his blind
      father and wicked stepmother, while Yü is praised for his selfless devotion to work. In these ways, the Chinese
      philosophical traditions, such as Confucianism and Mohism, associate key values of their philosophical
      enterprises with the great sages of their history. Whether the sages were, in fact, actual people or, as many
      scholars have concluded, mythical forebearers, they possessed the essential human virtue of listening and
     responding to divine voices. This attribute can be inferred from the Chinese script for sheng, which bears the
      symbol of an ear as a prominent feature. So the sage is one who listens to insight from the heavens and then is
      capable of sharing that wisdom or acting upon it to the benefit of his society (Cheng 1983). This idea is similar
     to one found in the Indian tradition, where the most important texts, the Vedas, are known as shruti, or works
      that were heard through divine revelation and only later written down.
      Although Confucianism is a venerable world philosophy, it is also highly patriarchal and resulted in the
      widespread subordination of women. The position of women in China began to change only after the
      Communist Revolution (1945-1952). While some accounts of Confucianism characterize men and women as

emblematic of two opposing forces in the natural world, the Yin and Yang, this view of the sexes developed over
time and was not consistently applied. Chinese women did see a measure of independence and freedom with
the influence of Buddhism and Daoism, each of which had a more liberal view of the role of women (Adler
2006).
A detailed and important study of the sage tradition in Africa is provided by Henry Odera Oruka (1990), who
makes the case that prominent folk sages in African tribal history developed complex philosophical ideas.
Oruka interviewed tribal Africans identified by their communities as sages, and he recorded their sayings and
ideas, confining himself to those sayings that demonstrated "a rational method of inquiry into the real nature
of things" (Oruka 1990, 150). He recognized a tension in what made these sages philosophically interesting:
they articulated the received wisdom of their tradition and culture while at the same time maintaining a
critical distance from that culture, seeking a rational justification for the beliefs held by the culture.

     CONNECTIONS

The chapter on the early history of philosophy covers this topic in greater detail.

FIGURE 1.4 Engraving of Greek historian Diogenes Laërtius from a 1688 edition of his Lives and Opinions of
Eminent Philosophers. (credit: "Diogenes Laërtius, ancient Greek writer" by Unidentified engraver/Wikimedia

Among the ancient Greeks, it is common to identify seven sages. The best-known account is provided by
Diogenes Laërtius, whose text Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers is a canonical resource on early
Greek philosophy. The first and most important sage is Thales of Miletus. Thales traveled to Egypt to study with
the Egyptian priests, where he became one of the first Greeks to learn astronomy. He is known for bringing
back to Greece knowledge of the calendar, dividing the year into 365 days, tracking the progress of the sun
from solstice to solstice, and--somewhat dramatically--predicting a solar eclipse in 585 BCE. The eclipse
occurred on the day of a battle between the Medes and Lydians. It is possible that Thales used knowledge of
Babylonian astronomical records to guess the year and location of the eclipse. This mathematical and
astronomical feat is one of Thales's several claims to sagacity. In addition, he is said to have calculated the
12 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

      height of the pyramids using the basic geometry of similar triangles and measuring shadows at a certain time
      of day. He is also reported to have predicted a particularly good year for olives: he bought up all the olive
      presses and then made a fortune selling those presses to farmers wanting to turn their olives into oil. Together,
      these scientific and technical achievements suggest that at least part of Thales's wisdom can be attributed to a
      very practical, scientific, and mathematical knowledge of the natural world. If that were all Thales was known
      for, he might be called the first scientist or engineer. But he also made more basic claims about the nature and
      composition of the universe; for instance, he claimed that all matter was fundamentally made of up water. He
      also argued that everything that moved on its own possessed a soul and that the soul itself was immortal.
      These claims demonstrate a concern about the fundamental nature of reality.

      Another of the seven sages was Solon, a famed political leader. He introduced the "Law of Release" to Athens,
      which cancelled all personal debts and freed indentured servants, or "debt-slaves" who had been consigned to
      service based on a personal debt they were unable to repay. In addition, he established a constitutional
      government in Athens with a representative body, a procedure for taxation, and a series of economic reforms.
      He was widely admired as a political leader but voluntarily stepped down so that he would not become a tyrant.
      He was finally forced to flee Athens when he was unable to persuade the members of the Assembly (the ruling
      body) to resist the rising tyranny of one of his relatives, Pisistratus. When he arrived in exile, he was reportedly
      asked whom he considered to be happy, to which he replied, "One ought to count no man happy until he is
      dead." Aristotle interpreted this statement to mean that happiness was not a momentary experience, but a
      quality reflective of someone's entire life.

      Beginnings of Natural Philosophy

      The sage tradition is a largely prehistoric tradition that provides a narrative about how intellect, wisdom, piety,
      and virtue led to the innovations central to flourishing of ancient civilizations. Particularly in Greece, the sage
      tradition blends into a period of natural philosophy, where ancient scientists or philosophers try to explain
      nature using rational methods. Several of the early Greek schools of philosophy were centered on their
      respective views of nature. Followers of Thales, known as the Milesians, were particularly interested in the
      underlying causes of natural change. Why does water turn to ice? What happens when winter passes into
      spring? Why does it seem like the stars and planets orbit Earth in predictable patterns? From Aristotle we
      know that Thales thought there was a difference between material elements that participate in change and
     elements that contain their own source of motion. This early use of the term element did not have the same
      meaning as the scientific meaning of the word today in a field like chemistry. But Thales thought material
      elements bear some fundamental connection to water in that they have the capacity to move and alter their
      state. By contrast, other elements had their own internal source of motion, of which he cites the magnet and
      amber (which exhibits forces of static electricity when rubbed against other materials). He said that these
      elements have "soul." This notion of soul, as a principle of internal motion, was influential across ancient and
     medieval natural philosophy. In fact, the English language words animal and animation are derived from the
     Latin word for soul (anima).

      Similarly, early thinkers like Xenophanes began to formulate explanations for natural phenomena. For
      instance, he explained rainbows, the sun, the moon, and St. Elmo's fire (luminous, electrical discharges) as
      apparitions of the clouds. This form of explanation, describing some apparent phenomenon as the result of an
      underlying mechanism, is paradigmatic of scientific explanation even today. Parmenides, the founder of the
      Eleatic school of philosophy, used logic to conclude that whatever fundamentally exists must be unchanging
      because if it ever did change, then at least some aspect of it would cease to exist. But that would imply that
      what exists could not exist--which seems to defy logic. Parmenides is not saying that there is no change, but
      that the changes we observe are a kind of illusion. Indeed, this point of view was highly influential, not only for
      Plato and Aristotle, but also for the early atomists, like Democritus, who held that all perceived qualities are
      merely human conventions. Underlying all these appearances, Democritus reasoned, are only atomic,
      unchanging bits of matter flowing through a void. While this ancient Greek view of atoms is quite different
      from the modern model of atoms, the very idea that every observable phenomenon has a basis in underlying

pieces of matter in various configurations clearly connects modern science to the earliest Greek philosophers.
Along these lines, the Pythagoreans provide a very interesting example of a community of philosophers
engaged in understanding the natural world and how best to live in it. You may be familiar with Pythagoras
from his Pythagorean theorem, a key principle in geometry establishing a relationship between the sides of a
right-angled triangle. Specifically, the square formed by the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is
equal to the sum of the two squares formed by the remaining two sides. In the figure below, the area of the
square formed by c is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares formed by a and b. The figure represents
how Pythagoras would have conceptualized the theorem.

FIGURE 1.5 The Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle as
demonstrated by the ancient Greek philosopher, Pythagoras. (credit: modification of "Pythagorean right angle" by
Marianov/Wikimedia Commons, CC0)
The Pythagoreans were excellent mathematicians, but they were more interested in how mathematics
explained the natural world. In particular, Pythagoras recognized relationships between line segments and
shapes, such as the Pythagorean theorem describes, but also between numbers and sounds, by virtue of
harmonics and the intervals between notes. Similar regularities can be found in astronomy. As a result,
Pythagoras reasoned that all of nature is generated according to mathematical regularities. This view led the
Pythagoreans to believe that there was a unified, rational structure to the universe, that the planets and stars
exhibit harmonic properties and may even produce music, that musical tones and harmonies could have
healing powers, that the soul is immortal and continuously reincarnated, and that animals possess souls that
ought to be respected and valued. As a result, the Pythagorean community was defined by serious scholarship
as well as strict rules about diet, clothing, and behavior.
Additionally, in the early Pythagorean communities, it was possible for women to participate and contribute to
philosophical thought and discovery. Pythagoras himself was said to have been inspired to study philosophy by
the Delphic priestess Themistoclea. His wife Theano is credited with contributing to important discoveries in
the realms of numbers and optics. She is said to have written a treatise, On Piety, which further applies
Pythagorean philosophy to various aspects of practical life (Waithe 1987). Myia, the daughter of this illustrious
couple, was also an active and productive part of the community. At least one of her letters has survived in
which she discusses the application of Pythagorean philosophy to motherhood. The Pythagorean school is an
example of how early philosophical and scientific thinking combines with religious, cultural, and ethical
beliefs and practices to embrace many different aspects of life.

How It All Hangs Together

Closer to the present day, in 1962, Wilfrid Sellars, a highly influential 20th-century American philosopher,
wrote a chapter called "Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man" in Frontiers of Science and Philosophy. He
opens the essay with a dramatic and concise description of philosophy: "The aim of philosophy, abstractly
formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the
14 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

      broadest possible sense of the term." If we spend some time trying to understand what Sellars means by this
      definition, we will be in a better position to understand the academic discipline of philosophy. First, Sellars
      emphasizes that philosophy's goal is to understand a very wide range of topics--in fact, the widest possible
      range. That is to say, philosophers are committed to understanding everything insofar as it can be understood.
      This is important because it means that, on principle, philosophers cannot rule out any topic of study.
      However, for a philosopher not every topic of study deserves equal attention. Some things, like conspiracy
      theories or paranoid delusions, are not worth studying because they are not real. It may be worth
      understanding why some people are prone to paranoid delusions or conspiratorial thinking, but the content of
      these ideas is not worth investigating. Other things may be factually true, such as the daily change in number
      of the grains of sand on a particular stretch of beach, but they are not worth studying because knowing that
      information will not teach us about how things hang together. So a philosopher chooses to study things that are
      informative and interesting--things that provide a better understanding of the world and our place in it.

      To make judgments about which areas are interesting or worthy of study, philosophers need to cultivate a
      special skill. Sellars describes this philosophical skill as a kind of know-how (a practical, engaged type of
      knowledge, similar to riding a bike or learning to swim). Philosophical know-how, Sellars says, has to do with
      knowing your way around the world of concepts and being able to understand and think about how concepts
      connect, link up, support, and rely upon one another--in short, how things hang together. Knowing one's way
      around the world of concepts also involves knowing where to look to find interesting discoveries and which
      places to avoid, much like a good fisherman knows where to cast his line. Sellars acknowledges that other
      academics and scientists know their way around the concepts in their field of study much like philosophers do.
      The difference is that these other inquirers confine themselves to a specific field of study or a particular
      subject matter, while philosophers want to understand the whole. Sellars thinks that this philosophical skill is
      most clearly demonstrated when we try to understand the connection between the natural world as we
      experience it directly (the "manifest image") and the natural world as science explains it (the "scientific
      image"). He suggests that we gain an understanding of the nature of philosophy by trying to reconcile these two
      pictures of the world that most people understand independently.

              READ LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

     "Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man"

      This essay, "Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man (https://openstax.org/r/psim)" by Wilfrid Sellars, has been
      republished several times and can be found online. Read through the essay with particular focus on the first section.
      Consider the following study questions:

        · What is the difference between knowing how and knowing that? Are these concepts always distinct? What does
            it mean for philosophical knowledge to be a kind of know-how?

        · What do you think Sellars means when he says that philosophers "have turned other special subject-matters to
            non-philosophers over the past 2500 years"?

        · Sellars describes philosophy as "bringing a picture into focus," but he is also careful to recognize challenges
            with this metaphor as it relates to the body of human knowledge. What are those challenges? Why is it difficult
            to imagine all of human knowledge as a picture or image?

        · What is the scientific image of man in the world? What is the manifest image of man in the world? How are they
            different? And why are these two images the primary images that need to be brought into focus so that
            philosophy may have an eye on the whole?

      Unlike other subjects that have clearly defined subject matter boundaries and relatively clear methods of
      exploration and analysis, philosophy intentionally lacks clear boundaries or methods. For instance, your
      biology textbook will tell you that biology is the "science of life." The boundaries of biology are fairly clear: it is
      an experimental science that studies living things and the associated material necessary for life. Similarly,

biology has relatively well-defined methods. Biologists, like other experimental scientists, broadly follow
something called the "scientific method." This is a bit of a misnomer, unfortunately, because there is no single
method that all the experimental sciences follow. Nevertheless, biologists have a range of methods and
practices, including observation, experimentation, and theory comparison and analysis, that are fairly well
established and well known among practitioners. Philosophy doesn't have such easy prescriptions--and for
good reason. Philosophers are interested in gaining the broadest possible understanding of things, whether
that be nature, what is possible, morals, aesthetics, political organizations, or any other field or concept.

1.2 How Do Philosophers Arrive at Truth?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify philosophical methods of inquiry.
  · Explain the role of logical consequences in assessing a philosophical position.
  · Define conceptual analysis, coherence, argument, intuition, and experimental philosophy.
  · Explain the importance of trade-offs in establishing a philosophical position.

We have seen some examples of how philosophy emerged in antiquity, its relationship to natural philosophy
and modern science, and one goal of philosophy, specifically--to provide a coherent story of how the world as it
appears to us can be explained in a way that also makes sense of what the sciences tells us. In this section, we
describe in greater detail the specific strategies and tools that philosophers use to arrive at truth.

Sources of Evidence

Even though philosophy is not an empirical science, philosophical claims require evidence, and philosophers
ought to have reasons for the claims they make. There are many different types of philosophical evidence,
some of which follow.

History

A basic but underappreciated source of evidence in philosophy is the history of philosophy. As we have already
seen, philosophical thinking has its origins around the world, from the beginning of recorded history.
Historical philosophers, sages, natural philosophers, and religious thinkers are often a source of insight,
inspiration, and argument that can help us understand contemporary philosophical questions. For instance,
the Greeks recognized early on that there is a difference between the way we use language to talk about things,
with generic terms that apply to many different things at the same time (like cat, tree, or house), and the things
as they actually exist--namely, as specific, individual beings or objects. Philosophers ask, what is the
relationship between the general terms we use and the specific things that exist in the world? This sort of
question is a perennial philosophical question. Today's philosophers have their own response to this sort of
question, and their answers often respond to and are informed by the historical treatment of these issues.
16 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

      FIGURE 1.6 European philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau influenced the framing of the United States
      Constitution. (credit: "Jean Jacques Rousseau. Né en Genêve en 1708 (https://openstax.org/r/digitalcollections)" by
      Maurice Quentin de La Tour/New York Public Library)
      While you may expect questions about the natural world to change over time (and certainly they have changed
      due to scientific progress), questions of morality and social organization do not change as much. What
      constitutes the good life? How should communities be organized to benefit all the members of that
      community? These sorts of questions stay with us throughout time. In the United States, it is common for
      political leaders to appeal to the "founding fathers" of the US Constitution. People like Thomas Jefferson,
      Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington were heavily influenced by early modern European philosophers
      like John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Thomas Hobbes. In similar fashion, the current Chinese leader,
      Xi Jinping, is fond of reading and citing the foundational philosopher Confucius. Most of Xi's addresses include
      quotations from Confucius, and Xi stresses the importance of reading classical Chinese philosophers (Zhang
      2015). For Chinese political leaders, Confucius provides an important reminder of the role of virtue and a
      sense of belonging among the Chinese people. There is a widespread belief among the Chinese political class
      that their intellectual heritage is an important factor in their contemporary political success, in much the same
      way as American political leaders trace their success back to the founding fathers. Given the influence of
      philosophy on world history, it is worthwhile to engage with the writings of past philosophers to inform our
      understanding of pressing philosophical questions of today.
      Intuition
      One of the hallmarks of philosophical thinking is an appeal to intuition. What philosophers today mean by
     intuition can best be traced back to Plato, for whom intuition (nous) involved a kind of insight into the very
      nature of things. This notion has had religious connotations, as if the knowledge gained through intuition is
      like catching a glimpse of divine light. But intuition does not have to involve faith. René Descartes defined
      intuition in the following manner: "By intuition [I mean] . . . the conception of a clear and attentive mind, which
      is so easy and distinct that there can be no room for doubt about what we are understanding" (Descartes 1985,
      14). This concept of intuition is clearest in mathematical examples. Importantly, it is quite different from the
     way that many people use the word intuition today to mean something like "gut feeling" or "hunch." When
      philosophers talk about intuition, they mean something much more definite. Consider the equation 2 + 2 = 4.

Examine the equation in your mind. Could it possibly be false? So long as we operate under the assumption
that these numbers represent counting numbers, it seems impossible that this equation could be false. More
than that, there is a kind of clarity and certainty about the equation. It is not just that you have learned 2 + 2 = 4
by habit. You could easily perform the counting operation in your head and verify that the answer is correct.
The truth of this mathematical sentence is so clear that if it turned out to be wrong, you would have to give up
core beliefs about the nature of numbers, addition, and equality. This kind of clarity is a paradigm of intuition.

Intuition operates in other realms besides mathematics, such as in the use of language. For instance, it is
obvious that a three-legged stool has three legs or that the tallest building is taller than any other building.
These statements are true in an obvious way that is similar to the mathematical sentence above. We can
branch out further, to say, for instance, that a camel is a mammal. We might intuitively know this statement is
true, but we may also recognize that we are on slightly less certain ground. After all, whether a camel is a
mammal is based on some understanding of the anatomy of a camel as well as the biological classification
system that assigns animals to different classes. So the definition of camel as "a mammal" is not the same as "a
three-legged stool has three legs." Here, we can see that some statements are intuitively true by virtue of their
definition. Others are intuitively true by virtue of some mental operation that we can perform very easily. Still
others are intuitively true in that they rely on a body of knowledge that is commonly accepted and foundational
for our understanding of the world.

There are many other places outside of pure linguistic analysis and mathematics where intuitions are helpful.
Consider morality: the proposition that "it is better to be good than to be bad" may seem similar to the
statement that "a three-legged stool has three legs," but the former introduces the words good and bad, which
are fraught terms that produce disagreement among people. Nonetheless, while it may be difficult to agree on
what constitutes "good" or "bad," everyone probably recognizes that whatever is good ought to be better than
what is bad. That seems intuitively true. On this basis, we might imagine that there are intuitive truths even in
morality. As we gain confidence in the ability of intuition to reveal truth, we might be tempted to extend
intuitions even further. However, when intuitions extend into areas where there is no consensus on what is
true, we have to be cautious. At that point, we might be using the term intuition to stand in for belief or
perspective. Such "intuitions" do not have the same force as the intuition that 2 + 2 = 4. It is not always easy to
distinguish between intuitions that are certain and evident and those that are mere feelings or hunches;
recognizing that distinction is part of the practical know-how philosophers try to develop.

Common Sense

We ought not to neglect a third source of evidence in philosophy, namely, common sense. The idea of common
sense is frequently used to describe a basic set of facts or common knowledge that any adult human being
ought to possess. But common sense is rarely defined. When philosophers talk about common sense, they
mean specific claims based on direct sense perception, which are true in a relatively fundamental sense. In
other words, philosophical champions of common sense deny that one can be skeptical of certain basic claims
of sense perception.

Famously, early-20th-century British philosopher G. E. Moore argued that a perfectly rigorous proof of the
external world could be given by simply making the appropriate gesture toward his right hand and saying,
"Here is one hand." So long as it is granted that the sensory perception of a hand is evidence of the existence of
a hand and that there is such a thing as a hand in the external world, then it must be granted that there is an
external world. Such an argument trades on the idea that knowledge of the existence of one's own hands is
something that does not need further proof; it is something we can know without proof. This idea is not
something that all philosophers accept, but it is, in many cases, an important source of evidence in
philosophical inquiry. At a certain point, it may be necessary to stop demanding proofs for the things we can
plainly see, such as the fact that this is a hand (as we hold a hand in front of our faces and examine it). Common
sense may be questioned by further philosophical interrogation, but the common-sense philosopher may
respond that such interrogation is either unnecessary, excessive, or misses the point.

Experimental Philosophy

Experimental philosophy is a relatively recent movement in philosophy by which philosophers engage in
empirical methods of investigation, similar to those used by psychologists or cognitive scientists. The basic
idea motivating experimental philosophy is that philosophers use terms and concepts that can be tested in a
laboratory. For instance, when philosophers talk about free will, they frequently cite the idea that free will is
necessary to assign moral responsibility; thus, moral responsibility is one reason to believe in the existence of
free will. Consequently, you might wonder whether most people do, in fact, believe that the existence of free
will is necessary to assign moral responsibility. This claim can be tested, for instance, by posing problems or
scenarios to research subjects and asking them whether the absence of free choice removes moral
responsibility. Similar strategies have been applied to causation, philosophy of biology, consciousness,
personal identity, and so forth. In these areas, philosophers use experimental methods to find out what
average people think about philosophical issues. Since common sense and intuition are already a source of
evidence in philosophical reasoning, it makes sense to confirm that what philosophers ascribe to common
sense or intuition aligns with what people generally think about these things.

Such experimental research is subject to many of the same issues that confront experimentation in the social
sciences. These studies need to be replicable and ought to fall within a psychological or biological theory that
helps explain them. When philosophers tread into experimental philosophy, they behave a lot more like
scientists than philosophers, and they are held to the same rigorous standards as other researchers in similar
experimental disciplines.

Results from Other Disciplines

The relevance of experimental methods for philosophy suggests a broader source of evidence for philosophical
claims, namely, the results of scientific disciplines. When philosophers make claims about the natural world,
they ought to be aware of what the natural sciences say. When philosophers make claims about human nature,
they ought to be aware of what biology and the social sciences say. As we have already seen, there is an
important difference between philosophical investigation and these various disciplines. Yet, given that
philosophers attempt to gain some understanding of truth as a whole, they ought to welcome evidence from
other disciplines that can help them better understand portions of that whole truth.

TABLE 1.1 Types of Philosophical Evidence

Logic

One of the first and most reliable ways that philosophers have of verifying and analyzing claims is by using
logic, which is, in some sense, the science of reasoning. Logic attempts to formalize the process that we use or
ought to use when we provide reasons for some claims. By interpreting the claims we make using logic, we can
assess whether those claims are well founded and consistent or whether they are poorly reasoned. The chapter
on logic and reasoning will provide much more detail about the nature of logic and how it is used by
philosophers to arrive at truth.

     CONNECTIONS

The chapter on logic and reasoning covers this topic of logic in greater detail.

Argument

The first and most important move in logic is to recognize that claims are the product of arguments. In
particular, a claim is just the conclusion of a series of sentences, where the preceding sentences (called
premises) provide evidence for the conclusion. In logic, an argument is just a way of formalizing reasons to
support a claim, where the claim is the conclusion and the reasons given are the premises. In normal
conversation and even philosophical writing, arguments are rarely written so clearly that one can easily
identify the premises and the conclusion. Nevertheless, it is possible to reconstruct any argument as a series of
sentences with clearly identified premises and conclusions. This process is the first step in analyzing an
argument: identify the claim that is being made, then identify the sentences that provide supporting evidence
for the argument. This process will necessarily require some interpretation on the part of the reader.
Therefore, it is important to try to remain faithful to the original intention of the argument and outline the
premises and conclusions in such a way that they display the reasoning of the person making that claim.

Once the premises and conclusion are identified and written in order, it is possible to use formal techniques to
evaluate the argument. Formal techniques will be covered in the chapter on logic and reasoning. For now, it is
sufficient to note that there is a process for evaluating whether claims are well supported by using the
techniques of logic. Poorly supported claims may be true, but without good reasons to accept those claims, a
20 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

      person's support of them is irrational. In philosophy, we want to understand and evaluate the reasons for a
      claim. Just as a house that is built without a solid foundation will rapidly deteriorate and eventually fall, the
      philosopher who accepts claims without good reasons is likely to hold a system of beliefs that will crumble.

      Explanation

      While arguments can be thought of as building blocks to construct a solid foundation for beliefs about the
      world, arguments can also be understood as explanations for phenomena that are evident but not well
      understood. To generate well-founded beliefs, we start with evidence in the form of premises and infer a
      conclusion from that evidence. To explain observed phenomena, we start with a conclusion in the form of
      some observation and reason backward to the evidence that explains why the observation is true. For example,
      we infer that there is a fire based on the appearance of smoke, or we infer lightning when we hear thunder,
      even if we do not see the lightning. We can compare the way we reason about explanations to the way a
      detective might reconstruct a crime based on the evidence found at a crime scene. By reconstructing the
      premises that led to a given conclusion, a philosopher can explain the reasons for a conclusion that are evident
      through observation. In summary, logical reconstruction can be used to investigate the world around us,
      providing a rational explanation for why the world is the way it appears.

      Coherence

      Finally, logic provides philosophers with a powerful technique for assessing a set of claims or beliefs. We can
      ask whether a set of beliefs is logically consistent with one another. Given that we expect our beliefs to present
      to us a world that makes rational sense, we want those beliefs to be internally consistent. A set of beliefs or
      statements is coherent, or logically consistent, if it is possible for them to all be true at the same time. If it is
      not possible for statements or beliefs to be true at the same time, then they are contradictory. It seems
      unreasonable for a person to accept contradictory claims because a contradiction is a logical impossibility. If a
      person holds contradictory beliefs, then they must be wrong about at least some of their beliefs.
      Metaphorically, the house of beliefs in which they live must be poorly founded, at least in some places. When
      you are reading philosophy, you should be aware of places where the author says things that appear to be
      inconsistent. If you discover inconsistencies, that is a good indication that at least one of their claims is false.
      You may not know which claim is false, but you can know it is logically impossible for all claims to be true.

      When faced with the possibility of incoherent beliefs, the philosopher will need to either revise those beliefs so
      that they become consistent, or they will need to give up some beliefs to preserve others. Logical consistency
      cannot tell us that a set of beliefs is true; a complete fiction might be logically consistent. But logical
      consistency can tell us what is not true. It is impossible for a logically inconsistent set of beliefs to be wholly
      true.

     Conceptual Analysis

      One of the techniques that philosophers use to clarify and understand philosophical statements (either
      premises or conclusions) is conceptual analysis. Conceptual analysis involves the analysis of concepts,
     notions, or ideas as they are presented in statements or sentences. The term analysis has been a part of
      philosophical terminology and methodology since its beginning. In its most basic sense, analysis refers to the
      process of breaking apart complex ideas into simpler ones. Analysis also involves a cluster of related strategies
      that philosophers use to discover truths. Each of these techniques attempts to arrive at a clearer and more
      workable definition of the concepts in question.

      When students are asked to give a definition of some concept or term, they frequently go to a dictionary. But a
      dictionary provides only a description of how a concept is used in ordinary speech. A dictionary cannot tell us
      what the word means in a fundamental sense because dictionary definitions never ask whether that common
      usage is coherent, accurate, or precise. It is up to the person engaged in reflection on the concept to figure out
      what the term means and whether that meaning fits within a larger understanding of the world. The next
      section illustrates four methods of analysis.

Predicates
When philosophers today talk about concepts, they are usually referring to a notion that comes from the work
on logic done by German philosopher Gottlob Frege. Frege demonstrated that any sentence in natural
language could be translated into a formal, symbolic language, provided that we consider the sentence to be a
kind of function that describes a relationship between names (or objects) and concepts. This symbolic
language is what has become modern logic. Frege modeled his logic on mathematics, with the idea that he
could eliminate the ambiguity and vagueness of natural language by translating it into a purely symbolic
notation. Following Frege, we can break sentences into parts, including names, or object identifiers, and
concepts, or predicates.

FIGURE 1.7 Young Gottlob Frege in about 1879. (credit: "Young Frege" by Unknown author/Wikimedia Commons,
Public Domain)
Predicates are descriptive terms, like "yellow," "six feet tall," or "faster than a speeding bullet." Simple
sentences like "the flower is yellow," or "Superman is faster than a speeding bullet" can be easily analyzed into
object terms and predicates. But any sentence can be analyzed in multiple ways. And some sentences express
multiple relations between predicates and objects. So the role of conceptual analysis is to identify the right
predicates for analysis and to clarify the relationship between them. Predicates can help us clarify statements.
For any sentence, we can ask, what is being predicated, and how is it being predicated?
Descriptions
While the concepts that describe or categorize objects can be analyzed using predicates, the objects
themselves can be analyzed by using descriptions. Bertrand Russell identified definite descriptions as the way
to analyze proper names or objects. His idea is that in a sentence like "the flower is yellow" or "my dog likes
naps," the subject term--"flower" or "dog"--can be substituted with a descriptive sentence that uniquely
identifies this particular flower or dog. There are unique characteristics that differentiate my dog from all
others, for instance: my dog was born on a certain day, lives in a certain city, belongs to me, or occupies a
specific location. Similarly, the flower can be identified by its position in a garden, field, or particular
geographical location. One of Russell's insights was that proper names, such as "Max" (suppose it is the name I
22 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

      use to call my dog), are definite descriptions in disguise. That is, any proper name can be substituted with a
      description that identifies the one and only thing named.

      A definite description is a way of analyzing names and object terms for the purpose of making them more like
      predicates. This way we can clarify what we are talking about without resorting to gestures, context, or direct
      experience. You probably do this in your everyday life when you encounter confusion about a name. For
      instance, suppose a coworker says, "Kevin used up all the paper in the printer." If there is more than one Kevin
      in the office, you might answer, "Which Kevin?" And your coworker may then respond, "The one with brown
      hair whose workspace is right next to the entrance." "Oh," you might reply, "You mean the one with the picture
      of his kids on his desk?" In a sense, this process of disambiguating the reference for the name "Kevin" is a
      process of seeking a more definite description to supplement the proper name. Understanding that language is
      composed of definite descriptions and predicates can help us remove some of the ambiguity and vagueness
      that is a natural part of speech.

      Enumeration

      Sometimes, to understand the meaning of a concept, it is helpful to enumerate its component parts. For
      instance, we may say that a governmental body is composed of its legislature, its executive, and its judicial
      branches. Or we might recognize that a cell is composed of a nucleus, a cell wall, and organelles. The process of
      enumeration can help us specify the nature of the thing we are talking about. In effect, we are identifying the
      parts that make up a whole. Since claims about the whole can be analyzed as claims about its parts and claims
      about how the parts pertain to the whole, it is helpful to enumerate the parts and consider how claims about
      the whole relate to claims about the parts.

      Just as enumeration is helpful in understanding material things, it can be used to understand abstract
      concepts. For example, Aristotle says that wisdom is composed of scientific knowledge, plus understanding,
      where understanding is the grasp of first principles and scientific knowledge is the grasp of demonstrated
      reasoning that follows from first principles. Whether or not Aristotle is correct, his enumeration may help us
      understand the nature of wisdom.

      Thought Experiments

      When philosophers want to clarify the relationship between concepts, they often consider hypothetical
      scenarios meant to isolate one or more features of a concept and place it in the appropriate relationship with
      other concepts. Such hypothetical scenarios are called thought experiments. These imaginative scenarios
      allow us to test or compare concepts to better understand their connections and logical consequences.
      Philosophers have used thought experiments for as long as we have a written record of philosophical thought.
     For instance, Plato devised an elaborate thought experiment in The Republic, in which he depicts Socrates and
      several of his friends describing an ideal city. The premise of this thought experiment is that if the
      philosophers could describe an ideal city in detail, they would be able to identify which part of the city gives
      rise to justice.

      Aristotle, a Greek philosopher who followed Plato, arrives at the famous claim that "nature abhors a vacuum"
      (i.e., nature would not allow empty space between matter) by constructing a thought experiment. To argue for
      this conclusion, Aristotle assumes that there is such a void and then asks, how could one know the distance
      between two points in a vacuum? If there is any distance between two points, Aristotle reasons, that distance
      would have to be the property of something. But, by hypothesis, there is nothing between the two points: it is a
      pure void. Aristotle bases his reasoning on the idea that it is impossible for properties to exist without
      something they are the property of. This argument reveals that Aristotle thinks distance is a property of
      matter. Accordingly, it is impossible to measure distance in a pure void. Therefore, Aristotle reasons, it is not
      possible for a void to exist because it would occupy a distance that has no measure. Puzzles like this one can
      prompt fruitful philosophical reflection. What do you think about it?

      Thought experiments are also common in ethics as a way of testing out moral theories. A moral theory could

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                   1.2 · How Do Philosophers Arrive at Truth? 23

be supported by a thought experiment if the result of applying the theory to a hypothetical case made good
moral sense. On the other hand, the thought experiment might undermine the moral theory by demonstrating
that when the theory is applied, it results in an absurd or immoral outcome. In any case, thought experiments
can help us clarify the relationship between our concepts and theories.

Table 1.2 summarizes these four methods of conceptual analysis.

Trade-offs

Conceptual analysis, logic, and sources of evidence together help philosophers compose a picture of the world
that helps them get a better grasp of truth. Recall that philosophers are attempting to understand how things
hang together in the broadest possible sense. However, it is unlikely that any single philosophical picture of the
world will turn out to be so obviously compelling that it completely satisfies all criteria of logic, evidence, and
conceptual analysis. It is much more likely that there will be competing pictures, each with strong reasons for
believing in it. This situation is the basis for philosophical discussions. No one picture is so obviously true that
all others can be discarded. Instead, we have to evaluate each picture of the world and understand the trade-
offs that these pictures impose on us. We have to consider the practical and logical implications of the beliefs
we hold to fully understand whether those beliefs are true and right.

              READ LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

     Excerpt from "Thinking and Moral Considerations" by Hannah Arendt

      Hannah Arendt was a German-Jewish philosopher who fled Germany in the 1930s and eventually settled in New
      York City, where she became a prominent public intellectual. She is best known for her work on totalitarianism,
     power, and the notion of evil. She coined the phrase "the banality of evil" when reporting for the New Yorker
      magazine on the Nuremberg trial of Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann. The Nuremberg trials were a series of trials
      held in Nuremberg, Germany, after World War II in which Nazi leaders were held accountable for their war crimes
      before the international community. Subsequently, Arendt wrote the article "Thinking and Moral Considerations," in
      which she describes the ways that Eichmann's inability or unwillingness to consider the real, moral consequences of
      his actions caused him to behave in radically immoral ways. Arendt diagnoses the core problem of a person like
      Eichmann as "not stupidity but a curious, quite authentic inability to think." She considers thought to involve
      aesthetic and moral judgments; thus, for a person to engage in evil action, they must necessarily disregard self-
      reflection and conscientious thought.

      Read this article, particularly focusing on the first two paragraphs and the last four paragraphs. You may be able to
      obtain a copy of the article through JSTOR (https://openstax.org/r/jstor) if you access this database through your
      college library. Then consider the following questions:

        · In what sense does thinking require consideration of moral and aesthetic concerns? What is the relationship
            between thought and judgment?

        · How does the word conscience function in Arendt's analysis? What is important about this word for
            understanding the nature of thought?

        · How does the figure of Socrates function in Arendt's analysis to reveal the role of thinking?
        · Why is thinking, in the sense that Arendt considers it, so easily disregarded by society? When does thinking

            matter most?

      "Biting the Bullet"

      Sometimes when weighing the trade-offs of a particular view and its logical consequences, you may decide to
      "bite the bullet." This means that you are willing to accept the negative consequences of the view because you
      find the view attractive for other reasons. For instance, on the topic of free will, a philosopher might be
      committed to the idea that past events fully determine the future. In such a case, the philosopher is willing to
      accept the negative implication that free will is an illusion. In ethics, some philosophers are committed to the
      view that morality is entirely determined by the total quantity of effects caused by an action. Such
      philosophers may be willing to accept things that would otherwise seem immoral, like harming an individual
      person, if that action results in a greater quantity of positive effects in the end. No view is going to be perfect,
      and it is difficult to make sense of the world in terms that we can explain and understand. Nonetheless, we
      must be honest about the logical and moral consequences of the views we hold. If you are ultimately willing to
      accept those consequences to maintain the view, then you can bite the bullet.

      Reflective Equilibrium

      Another method for assessing the logical and moral consequences of our thinking is to use judgments about
      particular cases to revise principles, rules, or theories about general cases. This process of going back and
      forth between an assessment of the coherence of the theory and judgments about practical, applied cases is
      called reflective equilibrium. This process requires the revision of a theoretical and principled stance based
      on practical judgments about particular cases. Reflective equilibrium is achieved when you are able to
      establish some coherence between your theoretical and practical beliefs. Reflective equilibrium is a kind of
      coherence method: that is, reflective equilibrium justifies beliefs by assessing their logical consistency. As
      opposed to a traditional coherence approach, however, reflective equilibrium encourages the use of practical

and applied judgments about cases as part of the set of beliefs that is logically consistent. Reflective
equilibrium is an important method for introductory students to understand because students are frequently
tempted to think they need to solve theoretical issues first before they can consider applications. Or they may
choose a theory and then try to apply it to cases. Reflective equilibrium emphasizes that this procedure is
likely neither possible nor desirable. Instead, a philosopher should be aware of both the theoretical
commitments and the practical concerns of their position and use their understanding of each to inform the
final analysis of their beliefs.

1.3 Socrates as a Paradigmatic Historical Philosopher

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain Socrates's appreciation for the limits of human knowledge.
  · Identify Socrates's primary moral principles.
  · Describe Socrates's life, death, and philosophical interests.
  · Compare Socrates's moral philosophy with classical Indian philosophy.

Socrates is a foundational figure for Western philosophy. Even though he did not write any works himself, his
life and thought are captured by three different, contemporary sources whose works we still have. Socrates is
depicted in several of Aristophanes's comedic plays. Aristophanes, an accomplished Athenian playwright, won
several dramatic competitions of his day. Eleven of his 40 plays survive, and in three of them--The Clouds, The
Frogs, and The Birds--Socrates appears as a main character. Aristophanes's depiction of Socrates is ridiculous,
and Plato appears to think that this depiction is partially responsible for Socrates's ultimate trial and death.
Another contemporary of Socrates, the historian Xenophon, wrote an account of Socrates's trial and death in
his Memorabilia. Finally, and most important, Socrates's student and friend Plato made Socrates the central
figure in nearly all of his dialogues. Plato and Aristotle are the most influential of the Athenian philosophers
and have had a profound influence on the development of Western philosophy. Plato wrote exclusively in the
form of dialogues, where his characters engage in discussion centered on philosophical issues. Most of what
we know about Socrates is derived from Plato's depiction of him as the primary questioner in most of the
dialogues. Therefore, even though Socrates did not write works of his own, his life--and death--remain a
testament to his profound and impactful philosophical life. For that reason, it is useful for us to consider the
figure of Socrates as a paradigm of the philosophical life.

      In particular, Socrates's defense of himself during his trial is in many ways a defense of the philosophical life.
      Socrates was accused by a young, upstart politician named Meletus of corrupting the youth and undermining
      the gods of the city. These crimes were considered to be a kind of treason that undermined the legitimacy and
      future of Athenian democracy. The speech Socrates gave in his own defense to the Athenians, as recorded by
      Plato, remains a vivid and compelling defense of the sort of life he lived. In the end, his defense was not
      successful. He was convicted, imprisoned, and killed in 399 BCE. Plato provides accounts of the trial and
     death, not only in the Apology, but also in the Crito, where Socrates argues with his friend Crito that it would be
     unjust for him to escape from prison, and in the Phaedo, where Socrates engages in a debate with several close
      friends, arguing in his jail cell just before he dies that the soul is immortal.

              READ LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

     This excerpt from Plato's Apology (https://openstax.org/r/platosapology), translated by Benjamin Jowett, records
      one account of Socrates's defense at his trial. He is responding to accusations made against him in front of the
      Assembly, which was the main governing body and jury for trials in Athens. This body was composed of 500 citizens.

            I dare say, Athenians, that someone among you will reply, "Why is this, Socrates, and what is the origin of
            these accusations of you: for there must have been something strange which you have been doing? All this
            great fame and talk about you would never have arisen if you had been like other men: tell us, then, why
            this is, as we should be sorry to judge hastily of you." Now I regard this as a fair challenge, and I will
            endeavor to explain to you the origin of this name of "wise," and of this evil fame. . . . I will refer you to a
            witness who is worthy of credit, and will tell you about my wisdom--whether I have any, and of what
            sort--and that witness shall be the god of Delphi. You must have known Chaerephon; he was early a friend
            of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he shared in the exile of the people, and returned with you. Well,
            Chaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in all his doings, and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the

oracle to tell him whether--as I was saying, I must beg you not to interrupt--he asked the oracle to tell him
whether there was anyone wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered that there was no man
wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself, but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the truth of this story.

Why do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why I have such an evil name. When I heard
the answer, I said to myself, "What can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of this riddle? for I
know that I have no wisdom, small or great. What can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men?
And yet he is a god and cannot lie; that would be against his nature." After a long consideration, I at last
thought of a method of trying the question. I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then
I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand. I should say to him, "Here is a man who is wiser than I
am; but you said that I was the wisest." Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom, and
observed to him--his name I need not mention; he was a politician whom I selected for examination--and
the result was as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking that he was not really
wise, although he was thought wise by many, and wiser still by himself; and I went and tried to explain to
him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated me, and
his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. So I left him, saying to myself, as I went
away: "Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am
better off than he is--for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows. I neither know nor think that I know.
In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him." Then I went to another, who
had still higher philosophical pretensions, and my conclusion was exactly the same. I made another enemy
of him, and of many others besides him.

After this I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which I provoked, and I
lamented and feared this: but necessity was laid upon me--the word of God, I thought, ought to be
considered first. And I said to myself, "Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out the meaning of the
oracle." And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I swear!--for I must tell you the truth--the result of my
mission was just this: I found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that some
inferior men were really wiser and better. I will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the "Herculean"
labors, as I may call them, which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. When I left the
politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And there, I said to myself, you will be
detected; now you will find out that you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of
the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of them--thinking that
they would teach me something. Will you believe me? I am almost ashamed to speak of this, but still I must
say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did
themselves. That showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius
and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand
the meaning of them. And the poets appeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed
that upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in
which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving myself to be superior to them for the same reason that
I was superior to the politicians.

At last I went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure
that they knew many fine things; and in this I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which I
was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good artisans
fell into the same error as the poets; because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all
sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom--therefore I asked myself on
behalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance,
or like them in both; and I made answer to myself and the oracle that I was better off as I was.

This investigation has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most dangerous kind, and has given
occasion also to many calumnies, and I am called wise, for my hearers always imagine that I myself
28 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

            possess the wisdom which I find wanting in others: but the truth is, O men of Athens, that God only is wise;
            and in this oracle he means to say that the wisdom of men is little or nothing; he is not speaking of
            Socrates, he is only using my name as an illustration, as if he said, "He, O men, is the wisest, who, like
            Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing." And so I go my way, obedient to the god, and
            make inquisition into the wisdom of anyone, whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if he
            is not wise, then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is not wise; and this occupation quite
            absorbs me, and I have no time to give either to any public matter of interest or to any concern of my own,
            but I am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the god.

     "The Life Which Is Unexamined Is Not Worth Living"

      After Socrates is convicted and has a chance to address the jury to persuade them to offer him a sentence or
      punishment other than death, he considers and then rejects the idea of exile. If he lived in exile, Socrates
      believed he would no longer be able to carry on his work as a philosopher because a foreign city would be even
      less welcoming of his strange questioning than his hometown. In speaking about this alternative, he says the
      following:

            Someone will say: "Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue, and then you may go into a foreign
            city, and no one will interfere with you?" Now I have great difficulty in making you understand my
            answer to this. For if I tell you that this would be a disobedience to a divine command, and therefore
            that I cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I am serious; and if I say again that the greatest
            good of man is daily to converse about virtue, and all that concerning which you hear me examining
            myself and others, and that the life which is unexamined is not worth living--that you are still less
           likely to believe. (Plato, Apology)

      This idea--that a life that is "unexamined" is not worth living--strikes at the heart of what Socrates tells us
      motivates him to live a philosophical life. The statement ought to make us pause and reflect, not only because
      Socrates himself demonstrates his commitment to a particular kind of life, to the point of accepting death, but
      also because the charge that an unexamined life is not worth living rightly seems like such a serious thing. To
      have lived a life that is not worth living: What could be worse? Given the stakes, we ought to wonder, what does
      Socrates mean by an unexamined life? Or, alternatively, what would it look like to examine one's life in the
      appropriate way?

      Examination of the Self

      The first form of examination that Socrates clearly advises is self-examination. At the temple to the oracle at
      Delphi, one of three maxims engraved in stone is the phrase "know thyself." Like most oracular statements, it
      is not clear what is meant by this phrase. Plato suggests it may be a kind of warning to those who enter the
      oracle: "Know your position relative to the gods!" Alternatively, it may be a command to understand your own
      nature and your own mind before you seek to understand other people or the things of the world. Based on our
      reading of Socrates's life and works, we can assume that he considers this saying to be a command to
      investigate our beliefs and knowledge, to appreciate the limits of our own knowledge, and to strive to eliminate
      inconsistencies. After all, Socrates's method of questioning as it is described in Plato's dialogues (and as
      Socrates himself describes in the excerpted passage) is exactly such an inquiry.

      Socrates questions others about whether their beliefs are consistent and whether they have adequate
      justification for the beliefs they hold. This line of questioning suggests that Socrates holds such consistency
      and internal justification in high regard. We can imagine that Socrates considers an unexamined life to be one
      in which a person holds beliefs without justification or holds beliefs that are inconsistent with one another. We
      may then speculate that an unexamined is not worth living because it is dictated by beliefs and ideas that have
      never been tested, justified, or accounted for. You might respond that endless questioning is boring or difficult,
      or you may respond that "ignorance is bliss." For a philosopher, this attitude is not only undesirable, but it also

approaches irrationality. It seems that, whatever makes life worth living for creatures capable of rational
thought, a minimum requirement is that we believe things worth believing in, hold positions we can defend,
and understand why we do what we do. To do that, we need to engage in self-examination.

politician and orator Pericles, and Aspasia, a well-known Milesian woman who gained political and philosophical
influence as Pericles' romantic partner. (credit: "Drawing, Socrates, Pericles, Alcibiades, Aspasia in Discussion" by
Felice Giani/Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, Public Domain)
Examination of Nature
Even though Socrates himself did not develop an account of nature and the cosmos like many of the pre-
Socratic philosophers, we may imagine that living an examined life requires us to understand the world
around us. Socrates himself was well aware of the various natural philosophical accounts that were prominent
in his day. Plato frequently records Socrates quoting or citing another philosopher's account of the planets and
stars, natural change, or other natural phenomenon when he is questioning others. Indeed, several of the
dialogues place Socrates in conversations about the nature of the soul, the nature of causality, the classification
of animals and plants, and so forth, all of which could fall under the examination of nature. Why might such a
process of examination be important for a life worth living? We might speculate that it is important for us
remain curious. The capacity to reason gives human beings the ability to investigate how things work--to
discover truths about the world around them. Neglecting that drive to understand the world around us is like
neglecting a natural skill. Methods of philosophical reflection can help us make sense of the world around us.
Such investigation is characteristic of the ancient philosophers and may be considered part of a life worth
living.

Human Wisdom Is Worth Little or Nothing

In the excerpt from Plato's Apology, Socrates investigates the oracle's strange response that he is the wisest of
men. First, Socrates attempts to prove the oracle wrong by finding someone wiser than he. But, after a time, he
comes to realize that the oracle's response was a kind of riddle. He interprets the oracle as saying that Socrates
is wisest because he alone realizes that human wisdom is worth little or nothing. This realization is important
for Socrates's own self-examination and provides an important lesson for philosophy students.
30 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

      Understanding the Limits of Knowledge

      Perhaps one of the greatest lessons you can learn from a well-rounded college education is just how much
      more there is to know about the world. Even the most respected scientists, philosophers, mathematicians, and
      historians recognize that the scope of their expertise is extremely limited. A lifetime of study can, at best, give
      a person deep insight into a tiny fraction of the universe of human knowledge. Beyond that, there is a vast
      domain of things that no human has yet discovered or understood. Consequently, it is a good idea to practice
      Socrates's advice: to be aware of what you do not know and not to assert knowledge where you lack it. People
      are often resistant to taking this position because they want answers. Someone who can convince others that
      they know the solution to their problems or personal dilemmas can exert a great deal of power over them. But
      we ought to recognize the dangers of asserting knowledge where we lack it. In technical areas, a refusal to
      admit ignorance can result in the failure of equipment, the malfunctioning of machines, and in the worst
      cases, injury and loss of life. In the moral and political arenas, asserting knowledge where you lack it may lead
      to unnecessary disagreements and polarization, or it may result in ill-considered actions that result in ethical
      mistakes or harm to others. Most importantly, if you are not aware when you lack knowledge, you will not seek
      to acquire the knowledge you lack. If you believe you already know something, you will not listen to the
      evidence that disproves what you believe. As a result, you will miss out on learning the truth.

      The Socratic Method

      Socrates engaged in a particular method of questioning, sometimes known as the Socratic method, that was
      characterized by his asking questions of others rather than explaining his own beliefs. Socrates is typically
      hesitant to offer his own ideas about the topic under discussion. Instead, he asks the people he is questioning
      to supply the subject matter for their discussion. Socrates's use of this strategy may be puzzling. One
     explanation may be that he is following the god's command, as he says in the Apology. Another explanation is
      that he does not claim to have knowledge about the topic in question and is genuinely happy to learn from
      others. Yet another possibility is that Socrates feigns ignorance and is being insincere. Perhaps his true goal is
      to trap or humiliate the other person by discovering some inconsistency or obvious falsehood in what they
      believe. It is hard to know which of these is the most likely explanation, but we will focus for a moment on a
      fourth possibility, namely, a pedagogical one.

      In two different Platonic dialogues, Socrates explains what he is doing by using an analogy: he compares his
      method of questioning to the role taken by a midwife during childbirth. In fact, Plato tells us that Socrates's
      mother was a midwife and that he assumes her role in philosophical conversation. The goal of Socratic
      questioning, then, is to assist the person being questioned in discovering the truth on their own. By asking
      questions and examining the claims made by another person, Socrates allows that person to go through a
      process of self-discovery. This method provides an interesting lesson for teaching and learning. Often,
      students believe that their role is to simply receive knowledge from the teacher. But Socrates reminds us that
      real learning comes only through self-discovery and that the role of the teacher is to be an assistant, providing
      the kind of critical examination and evaluation necessary to help the student discover truth on their own.

     The Importance of Doing No Harm

      Even though many early philosophers were concerned with understanding nature, Socrates is much more
      concerned with ethics, or how to live a good life. He considers the primary purpose of philosophy to make one's
      life better by making the philosopher a better person. Even though Socrates rarely claims to have knowledge
      about anything at all, the few instances where he does profess knowledge relate directly to morality. In
      particular, Socrates asserts a pair of moral principles that are quite controversial and may appear at first
      glance false. However, upon closer inspection, you may find that these principles bear some truth that is worth
      consideration.

      Socrates's Harm Principle

      Socrates's harm principle claims the following:

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                               1.3 · Socrates as a Paradigmatic Historical Philosopher 31

1. No one willingly chooses what is harmful to themselves.
2. When a person does harm to others, they actually harm themselves.

The first principle is sometimes stated as "no one intentionally chooses evil," but for the purposes of this
discussion, it will be clearer to consider the above formulation. The important thing to understand about the
first principle is that Socrates believes that when people choose bad things, they do so out of ignorance. The
reason he thinks so is that he believes all people desire what is good. For Socrates, it is intuitively true that
whatever someone desires, that desire is always directed at something that appears good to them, which
means a person cannot choose what is harmful for its own sake. Instead, Socrates reasons, when individuals
do harmful things, they believe that what they are doing will bring about some good for them. In other words,
when people choose evil, they do so in the belief that it is good or will bring about something good. If, in fact,
they are wrong, then that was the fault of ignorance, not a desire to do evil. If they had better understood the
consequences of their actions, Socrates reasons, they would not have chosen something harmful.

The second principle derives from the fact that Socrates thinks the greatest harm that can come to anyone is
for their soul--or their character--to become corrupted. Since a corrupted soul is the result of making the
kinds of choices that produce harm, it follows that whenever someone does something harmful, they corrupt
their soul, so they harm themselves. At the end of the Apology, Socrates argues that it is not possible to harm a
good man because, even though you might kill him, you cannot harm his character or make him do evil.
Socrates seems to regard physical suffering, and even death, as a temporary and minor harm. Moreover, he
regards the harm to one's character by living a life of ignorance or malevolence as far worse than physical
death.

         THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

  · Do you agree with the first principle of Socrates, which leads him to claim that no one willingly does harm? Why
      do you agree or disagree with him?

  · Can you think of examples from your own life or experience that demonstrate that people deliberately do harm
      for harm's sake?

  · Is the second claim true or false? Can you think of examples to prove the second claim true? False?
  · Why might Socrates believe that harm to one's character is more significant than even death? Is Socrates

      mistaken? If you believe he is mistaken, on what do you base your claim?

When you answer these questions, be sure to give Socrates the benefit of the doubt. After all, there is no question
that Socrates was a smart person. He lived at a different time and may appear strange to you, but you will find that
his ideas are still relevant if you give them some consideration. After you take Socrates seriously, can you still find an
error in Socrates's thinking?

Comparison of Socrates's Harm Principle with Ahimsa in the Indian Tradition

It may be instructive to consider the possible connection between the core concept of ahimsa in classical
Indian philosophy and Socrates's harm principle as discussed above. Etymologically, the word ahimsa, in
Sanskrit, literally means "the absence of doing injury or harm." The concept is found throughout Hindu, Jain,
and Buddhist texts and likely has its origins deep in classical Indian thought. A well-known illustration of
ahimsa comes from Jainism, where the concept is taken to what most of us would consider to be extreme
measures--at least in the case of Jain ascetics observing ahimsa as one of the "great vows." Such ascetic Jains
must take the greatest possible care not to cause harm, intentionally or unintentionally, to any creature,
including insects, plants, and microbes. At the end of their lives, a devout Jain may even fast to death (stop
eating) in one final renunciation of doing harm. Another well-known example of ahimsa can be seen the
philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, who used the concept to establish a nonviolent civil disobedience movement
that some say helped speed the colonial British departure from India.
32 1 · Introduction to Philosophy

     Ahimsa is identified as one of the highest virtues in the Vedic tradition (the Vedas are the most sacred
     scriptures of India) and is one of the loftiest teachings in Indian philosophy. The idea of ahimsa informs animal
     ethics, just-war theory, and interpersonal relations. On a metaphysical level, ahimsa is connected with
      karma--the causal law that links causes to effects, even across lifetimes. This informs the belief that an
     individual will bear a future burden for harms committed in the present through the process of samsara, or
      transmigration and rebirth of the soul. According to this religious and philosophical theory, the soul brings
      both its good and bad karma (fruit of action) with it from life to life and will either enjoy the fruits of prior good
      actions or suffer the consequences of bad ones. Because of the laws of karma and reincarnation, any action
      resulting in violence, injury, or harm has the direct consequence of chaining an individual's soul to a process of
      rebirth and material suffering. Insofar as a person causes injury and suffering to others, they increase the total
      negative effects in nature. In summary, the individual creates bad effects for themselves by acting badly. From
      the perspective of Indian philosophy, there is a natural connection among all beings, so causing harm or injury
      to one entity is like harming a family member or even a part of oneself. Additionally, because individual
      experience is governed by the laws of karma, harm and injury to others has the result of causing injury to
      oneself.

     However, ahimsa does not focus only on the problem of causing harm. The practice of ahimsa also calls for the
      practice of love and compassion toward all beings. Following the same principles of karma and samsara, acts
      of love, kindness, and generosity have the effect of increasing the total amount of good in the world, of
      recognizing that we are, in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., "caught in an inescapable network of
      mutuality" and "tied in a single garment of destiny" (1963). The practice of love and compassion increases the
      possibility of liberation from material suffering.

     It may be useful to consider possible comparisons between the Indian notion of ahimsa and Socrates's harm
      principle. Both doctrines teach that by causing harm, acting through violence, or causing suffering to others,
      we actually harm ourselves. They describe different mechanisms for how that harm comes to us. Which do you
      think sounds more likely to be true? Are there other advantages or disadvantages to either view?

      Additionally, Socrates says that no one directly desires to cause harm or do evil; harm is the product of
      ignorance. For Indian philosophers, there is a connection between harm or suffering and ignorance as well.
      For them, suffering is caused by attachment to temporary things, both material and immaterial, including
      feelings, goals, or ideals. The remedy for attachment is enlightenment, which comes from recognizing that all
      perceptions, feelings, and desires emerge from prior causes and that the chain of causes continues without
      end. All things that are part of the chain of causes, according to Indian philosophers, are temporary. Once a
      person has this realization, they ought to recognize the harm that comes from attachment, from trying to hold
      on to any product of the unending chain of causes. The connection between ignorance and harm is quite
      different for each philosophy, but it may be worthwhile to consider how and why they are different. It may also
      be worthwhile to reflect on whether there is a connection between harm and ignorance and what it might be.

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Identify the role of professional philosophers in academics and beyond.
        · Identify the structure, organization, and thematic goals of the textbook.

      Contemporary academic philosophy bears minimal resemblance to the classical traditions we have discussed
      in the previous sections. Philosophers today, like other academics, focus on specific areas of research
      expertise with the goal of producing new research that advances our philosophical understanding of specific
      problems or topic areas. That said, philosophical investigation is still motivated by the same desire to make
      sense of things in the most general way possible. In this section, we will introduce you to what philosophy
      majors do. Additionally, we will provide a brief summary of the themes and organization of the textbook.

What Can You Do with a Philosophy Major?

Majoring in philosophy is a great way to complete a liberal arts degree. Philosophy will introduce you to
fascinating ideas and teach you to think analytically and creatively. If you enjoy the topics in this book, you
should consider a philosophy major.

Becoming a Philosophy Teacher

To pursue a career in academic philosophy, you must major in philosophy as an undergraduate and continue
your studies in the field by doing some graduate work. Community colleges and some four-year schools
employ instructors with a master's degree in philosophy. However, it is very common for these jobs to be
occupied almost entirely by people with PhDs. Academic jobs, particularly in the humanities and liberal arts,
are extremely competitive. Even with a PhD, it will be difficult to find a job in an academic department. That
said, it is much more common to find jobs teaching than doing research, but many teaching jobs still require
some research. A philosophy professor or instructor may be asked to teach on a wide variety of subjects,
depending on the needs of the school. By contrast, when doing research, academic philosophers tend to focus
on a very specific area with the goal of becoming an expert in that topic. Expertise is generally marked by the
production of research work, such as a dissertation, book, or several research articles on the topic. Academic
research jobs are typically secured with tenure, meaning that there are strong protections against unjustified
firing. However, recent studies of federal data show that 73 percent of all academic jobs are not on the tenure
track (meaning there is no chance to secure tenure). Additionally, 40 percent of all academic teaching
positions are occupied by part-time faculty. The distribution of tenured, tenure-track, non-tenure track, and
part-time employees varies greatly by institution type, with community colleges employing far more part-time
instructors and far fewer tenured and tenure-track instructors. Meanwhile, research universities employ more
tenured and tenure-track faculty and fewer part-time faculty (AAUP 2018).

Alternatives to Academic Philosophy

Philosophy undergraduate and graduate degree majors have many options outside of teaching and research in
an academic environment. There is a widespread and somewhat mistaken belief that the purpose of selecting
a college major is to prepare you for a specific career. While that may be true for some technical degrees, like
engineering or nursing, it is generally not true for degrees in the liberal arts and sciences. Many students enter
college with a desire to pursue a career in some area of business or commerce. Others plan to go on to a
professional graduate school in medicine or law. While it may seem like the best career decision would be to
major in business, premed, or prelaw, this notion is probably misguided.

The original idea behind a liberal arts and sciences education was that high school graduates could study a
broad range of fields in the core areas of knowledge that are foundational for our culture, society, and
civilization--areas like the natural and social sciences, literature, history, religion, and philosophy. By studying
these fields, students gain insights into the key ideas, methods of investigation, questions, and discoveries that
underlie modern civilization. Those insights give you a perspective on the world today that is informed by the
history and learning that make today's world possible. And that perspective can have a transformative effect
that goes far beyond job preparation.

When philosophy majors are compared to other majors in terms of their long-term career earnings, it appears
that philosophy majors do very well. While the starting salaries of philosophy majors are lower than some
other majors, their mid-career salaries compare very favorably with majors in areas like finance, engineering,
and math.

     more, on average, than those majoring in many other areas. (source: Wall Street Journal) (attribution: Copyright Rice
      University, OpenStax under CC BY 4.0 license)
      Additionally, philosophy majors have some of the highest LSAT and GMAT scores of any major (these are the
      tests generally required for admission to law school and business school, respectively). Quite a few former
      philosophy majors have gone on to become CEOs of large corporations, such as Reid Hoffman, cofounder of
      LinkedIn, and Carly Fiorina, CEO of Hewlett-Packard (Chideya 2015).
      Many philosophers who have earned a graduate degree in philosophy and held positions as professors and
      instructors have made successful transitions to other careers, including start-ups, technology, business, ethics
      review boards, and public philosophy. Nigel Warburton, a former philosophy professor, started the philosophy
      podcast "Philosophy Bites" that is one of the most downloaded podcasts on academic topics. He also is an
     editor-in-chief of the online magazine Aeon. David Barnett, a former philosophy professor, founded the
      company PopSockets in 2012 after leaving academia. That company now employs over 200 people and
      generates hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue. Additionally, there are a growing number of
      technology, neuroscience, and medical firms that are specifically looking to hire philosophers to help with
      research and ethics reviews. Marcus Arvan maintains a public directory of academic philosophers who have
      found work outside of academia at Philosophers in Industry (https://openstax.org/r/philosopher). In short,
      philosophers can be found nearly everywhere doing useful work and making good money. You should not let
      concerns about career prospects drive you away from studying philosophy.

     An Overview of Your Philosophy Textbook

      This textbook is organized in a way that generally reflects the broad areas of specialization in contemporary
      academic philosophy. Areas of specialization can be grouped into the following fields: historical traditions;

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                          1.4 · An Overview of Contemporary Philosophy 35

metaphysics and epistemology; science, logic, and mathematics; and value theory. The fields of science, logic,
and mathematics include research into contemporary symbolic logic as well as interdisciplinary work in the
philosophy of mathematics and the sciences; these areas are closely related to metaphysics and epistemology.
Value theory includes metaethics and the meaning of value, aesthetics, normative moral theories (ethics), and
political philosophy. This textbook aims to provide a general overview of each of these areas. We give students
a theoretical survey of each field in philosophy and introduce applications of these areas of study to
contemporary issues of interest. Additionally, we have an explicitly multicultural focus. We emphasize that
philosophy has been studied and practiced throughout the world since the beginning of recorded history. In
doing so, we are attempting to confront the Eurocentric bias that has been inherent to the study of philosophy
in the West and create a more inclusive curriculum.

Throughout this text, we introduce you to the stunning array of philosophers and ideas from ancient Greece,
Rome, and China, the classical Islamic and the late medieval European worlds, Africa, India, Japan, and Latin
America. We help situate you within the different regions and time periods using timelines and other tools.

Whether you go on to study philosophy or this is the only philosophy course you take, the habits of mind and
techniques of philosophical thought you will learn can have a transformative effect. When you allow yourself to
reflect on how a certain situation connects to the whole, when you critically examine your own biases and
beliefs, when you investigate the world with an open mind, informed by rational methods of investigation, you
will arrive at a richer sense of who you are and what your place is in the world.
36 1 · Summary

Summary

1.1 What Is Philosophy?

The word "philosophy" derives from ancient Greek, in which the philosopher is a lover or pursuer (philia) of
wisdom (sophia). The earliest Greek philosophers were not known as philosophers; they were simply known as
sages. The sage tradition is a largely prehistoric tradition that provides a narrative about how intellect,
wisdom, piety, and virtue lead to the innovations central to the flourishing of ancient civilizations. Particularly
in Greece, the sage tradition blends into a period of natural philosophy, where ancient scientists or
philosophers try to explain nature using rational methods.

Wilfrid Sellars emphasizes that philosophy's goal is to understand a very wide range of topics--in fact, the
widest possible range. That is to say, philosophers are committed to understanding everything insofar as it can
be understood. A philosopher chooses to study things that are informative and interesting--things that provide
a better understanding of the world and our place in it. To make judgments about which areas are interesting
or worthy of study philosophers need to cultivate a special skill. Sellars describes this philosophical skill as a
kind of know-how. Philosophical know-how has to do with knowing your way around the world of concepts and
being able to understand and think about how concepts connect, link up, support, and rely upon one
another--in short, how things hang together.

1.2 How Do Philosophers Arrive at Truth?

The goal of philosophy is to provide a coherent story of how the world as it appears to us can be explained in a
way that also makes sense of what the sciences tells us. Given the influence of philosophy on world history, it is
worthwhile to engage with the writings of past philosophers to inform our understanding of pressing
philosophical questions of today.

What philosophers today mean by intuition can best be traced back to Plato, for whom intuition (nous)
involved a kind of insight into the very nature of things. This notion has had religious connotations, as if the
knowledge gained through intuition is like catching a glimpse of divine light.

When philosophers talk about common sense, they mean specific claims based on direct sense perception,
which are true in a relatively fundamental sense. In other words, philosophical champions of common sense
deny that one can be skeptical of certain basic claims of sense perception.

Experimental philosophy is a relatively recent movement in philosophy by which philosophers engage in
empirical methods of investigation, similar to those used by psychologists or cognitive scientists. Philosophers
use experimental methods to find out what average people think about philosophical issues. Since common
sense and intuition are already a source of evidence in philosophical reasoning, it makes sense to confirm that
what philosophers ascribe to common sense or intuition aligns with what people generally think about these
things.

Logic attempts to formalize the process that we use or ought to use when we provide reasons for some claims.
The first and most important move in logic is to recognize that claims are the product of arguments. In
particular, a claim is just the conclusion of a series of sentences, where the preceding sentences (called
premises) provide evidence for the conclusion. In logic, an argument is just a way of formalizing reasons to
support a claim, where the claim is the conclusion and the reasons given are the premises.

A set of beliefs or statements is coherent, or logically consistent, if it is possible for them to all be true at the
same time. If it is not possible for statements or beliefs to be true at the same time, then they are contradictory.
It seems unreasonable for a person to accept contradictory claims because a contradiction is a logical
impossibility. If a person holds contradictory beliefs, then they must be wrong about at least some of their
beliefs.

One of the techniques that philosophers use to clarify and understand philosophical statements (either
premises or conclusions) is conceptual analysis. Conceptual analysis involves the analysis of concepts,

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                  1 · Key Terms 37

notions, or ideas as they are presented in statements or sentences. The term analysis has been a part of
philosophical terminology and methodology since its beginning. In its most basic sense, analysis refers to the
process of breaking apart complex ideas into simpler ones. Analysis also involves a cluster of related strategies
that philosophers use to discover truths. Each of these techniques attempts to arrive at a clearer and more
workable definition of the concepts in question.

1.3 Socrates as a Paradigmatic Historical Philosopher

Most of what we know about Socrates is derived from Plato's depiction of him as the primary questioner in
most of the dialogues. The idea that a life which is "unexamined" is not worth living strikes at the heart of what
Socrates tells us motivated him to live a philosophical life. The first form of examination that Socrates clearly
advises is self-examination. Even though Socrates rarely claims to have knowledge about anything at all, the
few instances where he does profess knowledge relate directly to morality. In particular, Socrates asserts a pair
of moral principles that are quite controversial and may appear at first glance false. Socrates claims the
following: 1) No one willingly chooses what is harmful to themselves; 2) When a person does harm to others,
they actually harm themselves.

Socrates engaged in a particular method of questioning, sometimes known as the "Socratic method," which
was characterized by his asking questions of others rather than explaining his own beliefs. The goal of Socratic
questioning is to assist the person being questioned in discovering the truth on their own. By asking questions
and examining the claims made by another person, Socrates allows that person to go through a process of self-
discovery.

1.4 An Overview of Contemporary Philosophy

Contemporary academic philosophy is different from the classical traditions, although the motivation for
doing philosophy remains the same. If you are interested in pursuing a career in academic philosophy, a
graduate degree--most likely a PhD--is required. However, philosophy majors at any level can have fulfilling
and rewarding careers in a variety of fields.

This textbook is organized in a way that generally reflects the broad areas of specialization in contemporary
academic philosophy. Areas of specialization can be grouped into the following fields: historical traditions;
metaphysics and epistemology; science, logic, and mathematics; and value theory. The fields of science, logic,
and mathematics include research into contemporary symbolic logic as well as interdisciplinary work in the
philosophy of mathematics and the sciences; these areas are closely related to metaphysics and epistemology.
Value theory includes metaethics and the meaning of value, aesthetics, normative moral theories (ethics), and
political philosophy. This textbook aims to provide a general overview of each of these areas.

INTRODUCTION You have likely heard the term "critical thinking" and have probably been instructed to
become a "good critical thinker." Unfortunately, you are probably also unclear what exactly this means because
the term is poorly defined and infrequently taught. "But I know how to think," you might say, and that is
certainly true. Critical thinking, however, is a specific skill. This chapter is an informal and practical guide to
critical thinking and will also guide you in how to conduct research, reading, and writing for philosophy
classes.
Critical thinking is set of skills, habits, and attitudes that promote reflective, clear reasoning. Studying
philosophy can be particularly helpful for developing good critical thinking skills, but often the connection
between the two is not made clear. This chapter will approach critical thinking from a practical standpoint,
42 2 · Critical Thinking, Research, Reading, and Writing

      with the goal of helping you become more aware of some of the pitfalls of everyday thinking and making you a
      better philosophy student.
      While you may have learned research, reading, and writing skills in other classes--for instance, in a typical
      English composition course--the intellectual demands in a philosophy class are different. Here you will find
      useful advice about how to approach research, reading, and writing in philosophy.

    2.1 The Brain Is an Inference Machine

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe the role of emotion in thought.
        · Explain how cognitive systems produce inferences without conscious thought.
      One of the first steps to becoming a more critical and reflective thinker is to understand how and why you are
      prone to making mistakes in thinking. These mistakes are not the result of a lack of intelligence but are a
      function of the way our minds work and how they naturally lead us astray.
      From a biological perspective, we have been shaped by hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, which
      have primed our brains to become extremely effective inference machines. An inference is the mental process
      that allows us to draw conclusions from evidence. While we tend to think of inference as a deliberative and
      conscious process, we infer all kinds of things unconsciously, effortlessly, and immediately; in fact, most of
      sense perception is a kind of inference. Inference making has been crucial to human survival, but our
      conclusions are not always correct. By becoming aware of how our brains function to ward off threats and
      provide us with "cognitive ease," or a feeling of well-being and comfort, we can begin to correct for and guard
      against faulty thinking.

     The Brain's Adaptive Ability to Plan Ahead

      One insight of evolutionary biology is that every cell and organ in our body is adapted to its local environment
      for the purpose of making it more likely that our genes will survive into the next generation. Consequently, it's
      helpful to think about the brain's role in propagating our genes. Our brains facilitate our survival and promote
      our ability to find a partner and reproduce by using thought, calculation, prediction, and inference. For this
      reason, our natural and genetically primed ways of thinking do not necessarily serve the goals of philosophy,
      science, or truth.

FIGURE 2.2 The "mind-brain" problem points to the unclear relationship between our thoughts, feelings, and
perceptions, and the neurological and electrochemical interactions that take place in the brain. (attribution:

Philosophical Caveats about "Brain Talk"
Before we get much further, note that it is important to be cautious when we talk about brains and minds,
which are distinct concepts. In fact, the relationship between mind and brain is one of the central problems of
metaphysics, known as the "mind-body problem," which might just as well be called the "mind-brain
problem." Briefly stated, the mind-body problem is the problem of understanding the relationship between the
organic gray and white matter in our skulls (the brain) and the range of conscious awareness (the mind). We
know that the brain and central nervous system provide the physical basis for our thoughts, perceptions,
emotions, imagination, and desire--in short, our entire mental life. But biology does not tell us what the
relationship is between our private mental life and the neurological, electrochemical interactions that take
place in the brain. Is the relationship of the mind to the brain like the relationship between lightning and
electrical discharge or a rainbow and the refraction of light through water droplets? In other words, is "the
mind" just the term we use to label certain kinds of brain activity? Some philosophers think so. However,
mental activity is not easily associated with any specific brain activity. Additionally, there seems to be
something about the subjective experience of our mental life that is lost when we attempt to explain it fully in
terms of brain activity. So other philosophers maintain that the mind is something different from the brain.
Nonetheless, the mind and the brain are closely and somewhat mysteriously connected. As a result, it can be
helpful to use the resources of psychology and cognitive science (the study of the brain's processes) to help us
understand how to become better thinkers. We can think of the resources from psychology and cognitive
science as providing us with a description of how the brain actually behaves. By contrast, when we study
critical thinking, we are interested in how we ought to think. Being aware of how we do think may help us
devise effective strategies for how we ought to think, but we should understand that the descriptions provided
by psychology are not determinative. In this chapter, we explore psychological findings that can help you
become more reflective about the ways your thinking can go wrong.

      Representation as Projection
      While you may consider thinking to be made up of ideas or thoughts, philosophers and cognitive scientists use
      the term representation to describe the basic elements of thinking. Representations are information-bearing
      units of thought. This notion of representation can be traced back to Aristotle and has played a significant role
     in the history of philosophy, but in contemporary philosophy the term representation is more precise. When
      we think about things, whether through perception, imagination, memory, or desire, we represent those
      things. What is represented may be something present and real, or it may be fictitious, imagined in the future,
      or remembered from the past. Representations may even be unconscious. That is, the mind may have some
      defined content that is directed toward an object without the person being aware that they have produced such
      a representation.
      During the process of representation, even in a relatively simple case of visual perception, the brain makes a
      complex set of inferences. For instance, consider the checkerboard below. You might imagine that when you
      perceive something like a checkerboard, your brain passively takes a mental picture of the grid. In this
      analogy, the eye functions like the lens of a camera, and the brain develops the picture to present to the mind.
      But there are several problems with this model. First, where is the picture in your brain? Who is viewing the
      picture in your head? There are further problems with the camera analogy that can be revealed when we
      examine optical illusions. Look at the checkered set of squares in Figure 2.2. Are the horizontal lines parallel?

      FIGURE 2.3 The horizontal lines on this grid are parallel, but unless you look at the image from the side, it is
      impossible to "see" this. This is one of many examples of common perceptual illusions. (credit: "Optical Illusion" by
      Selena N. B. H. CC BY 2.0)
      In fact, the horizontal lines are parallel, but unless you look at the image from the side, it is impossible to
      visualize this. There are countless examples of these types of perceptual illusions. We represent the world
      outside as a stable picture that is completely filled in, in full focus, and uniformly colored. In reality, our visual
      field is limited and hazy around the edges, and colors change dramatically depending on lighting conditions,
      distance, movement, and a host of other factors. In fact, your brain is not passively capturing the world, like a
      camera, but is actively projecting the world so that it makes sense to you. In the illusion above, your brain is
      automatically adjusting your perception of the colored squares by accounting for the shadow cast by the
      cylinder. So your brain presents square B as if it is lighter than A by adjusting the hue of B to account for the
      shadow.
      Neuroscientist David Eagleman (2011) uses the analogy of the front page of a newspaper to describe how
      perception works. The front page is a representation of the world's events for a given day. Of course, it does not

present a full or complete picture of the world, but a summary intended to highlight the events of
consequence, those that have changed, and those that we are most likely to care about. Like a newspaper
editor, your brain is working overtime to project an image of the world based on what is relevant to your
survival. You unconsciously adjust the images you perceive to give you the impression that they are far away,
nearby, moving, and so forth. Instead of the fully formed, three-dimensional image of the world we seem to
see, we actually perceive a kind of sketch, highlighting what we need to know to navigate safely in our
environment and obtain what we need. You probably think that sense perception is the clearest and most
certain way you can know the world around you. As the adage says, "Seeing is believing." To become a better
critical thinker, however, you will need to become skeptical of some of your basic beliefs. There are times when
you absolutely should not believe your lying eyes.

Emotions and Reason: Homeostasis and Allostasis

In addition to the editorial license of mental representation, thinking is not always as rational as we imagine.
The neuroscientist Antonio Damasio (1994) was one of the first to popularize the notion that rational thought is
tempered by emotions. He is critical of what he perceives as the philosophical bias against emotion in the
history of philosophy. In Descartes' Error, he says modern philosophers have neglected the role of emotions in
thought, imagining that the goal of rational thinking is to eliminate the influence of emotions. Instead, his
years of clinical work with patients revealed to him that emotions cannot be separated from reason. Our most
rational thoughts are, in fact, guided, informed, and influenced by emotions. According to Damasio, reasoning
and intelligence function best when we care about something. Without feelings, says Damasio, we are less
rational, not more rational.

Damasio (1994) explains that emotions serve to maintain homeostasis in the brain through the chemical
messengers known as neurotransmitters. Homeostasis is the biological tendency to find a neutral state of
equilibrium (the word stasis means "standing still," and homeo means "same or similar"). This process relies
on a feedback loop where current bodily states are monitored, observed, and then altered to bring the body
back into balance. Most homeostatic processes in the body are unconscious, but emotions are linked to
conscious awareness. For instance, when your blood sugar is low and your body needs calories, there is a
series of chemical processes that give rise to the feeling of hunger. This is a conscious signal that you need to
eat; it promotes behavior that ensures survival. Similarly, a rustling sound in the bushes at night will trigger a
series of physiological responses (heightened senses, increased heart rate, pupil dilation, etc.) that correspond
to the feeling of fear and promote behavior, such as fight or flight, that are necessary for survival. What
Damasio demonstrates is that emotions have their own feedback mechanism, so that an idea or image can
generate physiological responses even in the absence of an external stimulus. Because emotional responses
and conscious thought are closely linked, decision-making can be influenced by this emotional-physiological
feedback mechanism. Our thinking can go astray because we are afraid of bad outcomes, and that fear
dominates a more rational calculation about which course of action is most beneficial (1994, 172-175).

In addition to maintaining equilibrium, the brain also anticipates future events and circumstances by
projecting likely scenarios based on a catalog of past experiences and concepts generated through social
norms and social interactions. The process of regulation that prepares the body to anticipate future needs
before they arise is called allostasis (allo means "other or different"). Psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett (2017)
explains that the brain stores neural pathways that are triggered by external or internal stimuli to provide the
closest match to the current situation. The neural pathways form a kind of template of action, promoting
behavior like increased heart rate, pupil dilation, or motion. Feelings are a goal-oriented response to certain
situations: they prepare us to behave and react in certain ways that promote what is beneficial to the body and
sharpen and shape our awareness of the world.

In summary, the brain makes inferences about the world through perceptions, emotions, and concepts that are
largely unconscious and deeply ingrained in our psyches. This process allows us to navigate fluidly and
accurately through a world with so many and varied stimuli. Our reactions to stimuli are partially homeostatic,
46 2 · Critical Thinking, Research, Reading, and Writing

      meaning that the body tends to bring itself back into an optimal state of equilibrium, and partially allostatic,
      meaning that the body prepares for and anticipates future situations. Together, these impulses construct a
      picture of the world that we experience seamlessly and dynamically. Our experience is far more complicated
      than the crude mental model we imagine. We are projecting and constructing the world we experience as
      much as we are recording and viewing it. And that fact has important consequences for the kind of reflective
      and critical thought we ought to engage in when we try to think clearly about the world.

     The Evolutionary Advantage of Shortcuts

      Human beings have evolved to navigate the world most effectively and efficiently by engaging conscious
      awareness only when necessary. For that reason, you can walk through the grocery store while thinking about
      what you are going to cook for dinner. You do not have to consciously think about where to go, how to slow
      down to make way for other people, or how hard to push the shopping cart so that it maintains momentum in
      front of you even as its weight changes as you add groceries to the basket. All that biomechanical activity can
      be outsourced to unconscious mechanisms as you scan your shopping list. The brain is quite good at engaging
      in habitual activities without the assistance of conscious thought. And that is a good thing because conscious
      thought is expensive in energy terms. Consider the picture that follows.

      FIGURE 2.4 Many inferences can be made about this woman's inner experience based on her expression and
      posture. While such inferences can be made quickly, they cannot be verified without further investigation, and they
      are highly susceptible to error, bias, and stereotyping. (credit: "CL Society 226: Woman with mobile phone" by
      Francisco Osorio/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
      You are probably immediately able to provide complex inferences about this picture, such as the woman is
      worried, concerned, or anxious about something. The inferences you make about this image are easy, fast, and
      complex. They are driven by the kind of emotional and conceptual thought processes that are unconscious and
      efficient. While these inferences are quick and easy, you may also be aware that they are provisional without
      more information. Given more data about the circumstances surrounding this picture, you might revise your
      perception about what is going on. This is exactly the sort of thinking that drives the emotional projections
      discussed in the previous section.

A different type of thinking is required to solve a math problem. The following example comes from
psychologist Daniel Kahneman's book Thinking Fast and Slow (2013). Try to solve the following in your head:

                                                                        24 × 14 =

Do you know the answer? For most people, multiplying two-digit numbers without pen and paper (or a
calculator) is quite difficult. You might need perhaps 10 or 20 seconds of effortful thinking to solve the problem
in your head since you do not have the unconscious mechanisms to do so automatically. Long-term social and
evolutionary pressures have shaped our brains to find efficient solutions to complex questions about facial
expressions. The same cannot be said for math problems. Knowing the solution to a math problem may be
useful, but it is not the sort of thing generally required for survival and reproduction. On the other hand,
quickly reading other people's emotions is at times vital for survival. There are other interesting differences
between these two kinds of thinking. While it is difficult to solve the math problem, once you solve it, you can
be 100 percent certain the answer is correct. By contrast, it is easy to generate a story about facial expressions,
but this story is highly susceptible to error, bias, and stereotyping. As a result, critical thinkers should be
careful not to jump to the first, most obvious solution.

Energy Demands on Deliberate Thinking

Solving a math problem requires rational thought and effort. When we engage in rational thought, our brains
use up precious energy stores that may be required for the maintenance of the body. Because evolutionary
pressures seek to keep us alive long enough to pass our genes to the next generation, we have a biological
tendency to avoid effortful thinking. In a sense, it is evolutionarily wise to be lazy.

The resources demanded by conscious thought can be understood in terms of the familiar notion of
"attention." When a task requires significant attention, it places increased energy demands on the brain.
Periods of high-attention activity can be stressful, as the body increases blood flow to the brain, delivering
more glucose and oxygen for increased mental activity. Additionally, attention is limited and focused on
specific tasks. Consider the "selective attention test" developed by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris.
Watch the video below and see how you perform on this test.

     VIDEO

Selective Attention Test

inference-machine)

How many passes did you count? Did you miss anything in the process? When our attention is focused on a
novel and complex task, we become less aware of other stimuli outside the specific area of focus. Additionally,
we may become fatigued, stressed, or anxious while engaged in paying close attention. Not surprisingly, our
brains prefer automated shortcuts.

Heuristics and Learning

Kahneman (2013) calls these mental shortcuts heuristics, or rules of thumb for drawing inferences. Problem-
solving with heuristics is largely unconscious, automated, effortless, and efficient, but it is not always correct.
Rational thinking or computation requires conscious attention and effort and may not even be possible
without some practice. We are forced to engage in effortful thinking when confronted with something new and
possibly dangerous--or even with something slightly outside of our normal routine. For example, you have
probably driven home from work or school along a familiar route on "autopilot," preoccupied with your
thoughts. Maybe you have even gotten home and felt as if you cannot remember how you got there. By contrast,
you have probably experienced the stress of navigating a new, unfamiliar city. In the first case, navigation can
be carried out using easy, largely automatic processing, whereas in the second case, navigation requires the
intense resources of active attention and rational calculation.
48 2 · Critical Thinking, Research, Reading, and Writing

      Sometimes complex activities can become effortless, but unlike when we are on "automatic pilot," such
      activities feel pleasant and fulfilling. When you become fully immersed in a complex activity to the point at
      which it becomes effortless, you have entered the state of "flow" (Csikszentmihalyi 2008).
      Flow states are possible only for someone who has achieved some level of proficiency at a task. They are
      characterized by intense concentration and awareness as well as a sense of personal control or agency, but
      they are pleasurable because the challenge of engaging in the task is commensurate with your ability. By
      contrast, a novice may find the same tasks stressful and frustrating. This phenomenon can be illustrated using
      the notion of the "learning curve" that describes how a novice grows in proficiency.
      What this means is that a person may be able to rely on intuitions, gut reactions, and other automatic
      responses in a field in which they are an expert, but the novice should be skeptical of these methods of
      thinking. As a novice, your mental heuristics are frequently faulty, so you are susceptible to prejudice, implicit
      bias, and error.
      Consider the case of buying a car. Someone who is deeply familiar with the automobile market as either a
      buyer or a seller may be able to estimate the true value of a car easily, but the average person would need to do
      a great deal of research to arrive at a true estimate. Because of the effort required for nonexperts to appraise
      car value, they are easily influenced by dealer incentives, marked-up list prices, financing options, and other
      tricks of the trade. Given that we are all susceptible to these types of errors, it seems like a good idea to try to
      become more self-aware and critical and not rely exclusively on gut reactions or intuitions when encountering
      new material. Since you are probably a novice in philosophy if you are reading this textbook, you ought to be
      suspicious of your gut reactions to and intuitions about philosophical questions. Keep an open mind, and don't
      assume you already understand the philosophical problems you will encounter in the chapters that follow.
      Being open to new ideas and allowing yourself to admit some degree of ignorance are important first steps in
      becoming a better thinker.
      Heuristics and Substitution in Decision-Making

      The cognitive biases that we will examine in the next section are based on a more fundamental "substitution
      heuristic." This term describes our tendency to answer a difficult question or problem by substituting it with
      an easier question to answer. While substitution often results in an incorrect or inappropriate response, it
      gives us a sense of satisfaction or "cognitive ease" in thinking we have solved a problem. For instance, when
      you are asked to evaluate something complex and uncertain, like the future value of an investment or the
      political prospects of a politician, you are likely to substitute that complex calculation for an easier one. In
      particular, you may substitute your positive or negative feelings toward the politician or the investment
      product. But your feelings are likely to be guided by your preconceptions.
      When the brain defaults to heuristics that produce a less-than-optimal result or even an incorrect decision, it
      is operating with a cognitive bias. A cognitive bias is a pattern of "quick" thinking based on the "rule of
      thumb." A person operating under a cognitive bias does not use logic or careful reasoning to arrive at a
      conclusion. Cognitive biases are like perceptual illusions. Just like perceptual illusions, cognitive biases are the
      result of the natural and, ordinarily, efficient operation of the brain. Even though mental heuristics often work
      perfectly well to help give us an estimation of reality without the mental effort required to generate a more
      comprehensive picture, cognitive biases are the result of misleading and faulty patterns that arise from this
      process.

2.2 Overcoming Cognitive Biases and Engaging in Critical Reflection

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Label the conditions that make critical thinking possible.
  · Classify and describe cognitive biases.
  · Apply critical reflection strategies to resist cognitive biases.

To resist the potential pitfalls of cognitive biases, we have taken some time to recognize why we fall prey to
them. Now we need to understand how to resist easy, automatic, and error-prone thinking in favor of more
reflective, critical thinking.

Critical Reflection and Metacognition

To promote good critical thinking, put yourself in a frame of mind that allows critical reflection. Recall from
the previous section that rational thinking requires effort and takes longer. However, it will likely result in
more accurate thinking and decision-making. As a result, reflective thought can be a valuable tool in
correcting cognitive biases. The critical aspect of critical reflection involves a willingness to be skeptical of
your own beliefs, your gut reactions, and your intuitions. Additionally, the critical aspect engages in a more
analytic approach to the problem or situation you are considering. You should assess the facts, consider the
evidence, try to employ logic, and resist the quick, immediate, and likely conclusion you want to draw. By
reflecting critically on your own thinking, you can become aware of the natural tendency for your mind to slide
into mental shortcuts.

This process of critical reflection is often called metacognition in the literature of pedagogy and psychology.
Metacognition means thinking about thinking and involves the kind of self-awareness that engages higher-
order thinking skills. Cognition, or the way we typically engage with the world around us, is first-order
thinking, while metacognition is higher-order thinking. From a metacognitive frame, we can critically assess
our thought process, become skeptical of our gut reactions and intuitions, and reconsider our cognitive
tendencies and biases.

To improve metacognition and critical reflection, we need to encourage the kind of self-aware, conscious, and
effortful attention that may feel unnatural and may be tiring. Typical activities associated with metacognition
include checking, planning, selecting, inferring, self-interrogating, interpreting an ongoing experience, and
making judgments about what one does and does not know (Hackner, Dunlosky, and Graesser 1998). By
practicing metacognitive behaviors, you are preparing yourself to engage in the kind of rational, abstract
thought that will be required for philosophy.

Good study habits, including managing your workspace, giving yourself plenty of time, and working through a
checklist, can promote metacognition. When you feel stressed out or pressed for time, you are more likely to
make quick decisions that lead to error. Stress and lack of time also discourage critical reflection because they
rob your brain of the resources necessary to engage in rational, attention-filled thought. By contrast, when you
relax and give yourself time to think through problems, you will be clearer, more thoughtful, and less likely to
rush to the first conclusion that leaps to mind. Similarly, background noise, distracting activity, and
interruptions will prevent you from paying attention. You can use this checklist to try to encourage
metacognition when you study:

  · Check your work.
  · Plan ahead.
  · Select the most useful material.
  · Infer from your past grades to focus on what you need to study.
  · Ask yourself how well you understand the concepts.
  · Check your weaknesses.
  · Assess whether you are following the arguments and claims you are working on.

     Cognitive Biases

      In this section, we will examine some of the most common cognitive biases so that you can be aware of traps in
      thought that can lead you astray. Cognitive biases are closely related to informal fallacies. Both fallacies and
      biases provide examples of the ways we make errors in reasoning.

      biases-and-engaging-in-critical-reflection)

      Confirmation Bias

      One of the most common cognitive biases is confirmation bias, which is the tendency to search for, interpret,
      favor, and recall information that confirms or supports your prior beliefs. Like all cognitive biases,
      confirmation bias serves an important function. For instance, one of the most reliable forms of confirmation
      bias is the belief in our shared reality. Suppose it is raining. When you first hear the patter of raindrops on your
      roof or window, you may think it is raining. You then look for additional signs to confirm your conclusion, and
      when you look out the window, you see rain falling and puddles of water accumulating. Most likely, you will not
      be looking for irrelevant or contradictory information. You will be looking for information that confirms your
      belief that it is raining. Thus, you can see how confirmation bias--based on the idea that the world does not
      change dramatically over time--is an important tool for navigating in our environment.

      Unfortunately, as with most heuristics, we tend to apply this sort of thinking inappropriately. One example that
      has recently received a lot of attention is the way in which confirmation bias has increased political
      polarization. When searching for information on the internet about an event or topic, most people look for
      information that confirms their prior beliefs rather than what undercuts them. The pervasive presence of
      social media in our lives is exacerbating the effects of confirmation bias since the computer algorithms used
      by social media platforms steer people toward content that reinforces their current beliefs and
      predispositions. These multimedia tools are especially problematic when our beliefs are incorrect (for
      example, they contradict scientific knowledge) or antisocial (for example, they support violent or illegal
      behavior). Thus, social media and the internet have created a situation in which confirmation bias can be
      "turbocharged" in ways that are destructive for society.

      Confirmation bias is a result of the brain's limited ability to process information. Peter Wason (1960)
      conducted early experiments identifying this kind of bias. He asked subjects to identify the rule that applies to
      a sequence of numbers--for instance, 2, 4, 8. Subjects were told to generate examples to test their hypothesis.
      What he found is that once a subject settled on a particular hypothesis, they were much more likely to select
      examples that confirmed their hypothesis rather than negated it. As a result, they were unable to identify the
      real rule (any ascending sequence of numbers) and failed to "falsify" their initial assumptions. Falsification is
      an important tool in the scientist's toolkit when they are testing hypotheses and is an effective way to avoid
      confirmation bias.

      In philosophy, you will be presented with different arguments on issues, such as the nature of the mind or the
      best way to act in a given situation. You should take your time to reason through these issues carefully and
      consider alternative views. What you believe to be the case may be right, but you may also fall into the trap of
      confirmation bias, seeing confirming evidence as better and more convincing than evidence that calls your

beliefs into question.

Anchoring Bias

Confirmation bias is closely related to another bias known as anchoring. Anchoring bias refers to our
tendency to rely on initial values, prices, or quantities when estimating the actual value, price, or quantity of
something. If you are presented with a quantity, even if that number is clearly arbitrary, you will have a hard
discounting it in your subsequent calculations; the initial value "anchors" subsequent estimates. For instance,
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) reported an experiment in which subjects were asked to estimate the number
of African nations in the United Nations. First, the experimenters spun a wheel of fortune in front of the
subjects that produced a random number between 0 and 100. Let's say the wheel landed on 79. Subjects were
asked whether the number of nations was higher or lower than the random number. Subjects were then asked
to estimate the real number of nations. Even though the initial anchoring value was random, people in the
study found it difficult to deviate far from that number. For subjects receiving an initial value of 10, the median
estimate of nations was 25, while for subjects receiving an initial value of 65, the median estimate was 45.

In the same paper, Tversky and Kahneman described the way that anchoring bias interferes with statistical
reasoning. In a number of scenarios, subjects made irrational judgments about statistics because of the way
the question was phrased (i.e., they were tricked when an anchor was inserted into the question). Instead of
expending the cognitive energy needed to solve the statistical problem, subjects were much more likely to "go
with their gut," or think intuitively. That type of reasoning generates anchoring bias. When you do philosophy,
you will be confronted with some formal and abstract problems that will challenge you to engage in thinking
that feels difficult and unnatural. Resist the urge to latch on to the first thought that jumps into your head, and
try to think the problem through with all the cognitive resources at your disposal.

Availability Heuristic

The availability heuristic refers to the tendency to evaluate new information based on the most recent or most
easily recalled examples. The availability heuristic occurs when people take easily remembered instances as
being more representative than they objectively are (i.e., based on statistical probabilities). In very simple
situations, the availability of instances is a good guide to judgments. Suppose you are wondering whether you
should plan for rain. It may make sense to anticipate rain if it has been raining a lot in the last few days since
weather patterns tend to linger in most climates. More generally, scenarios that are well-known to us,
dramatic, recent, or easy to imagine are more available for retrieval from memory. Therefore, if we easily
remember an instance or scenario, we may incorrectly think that the chances are high that the scenario will be
repeated. For instance, people in the United States estimate the probability of dying by violent crime or
terrorism much more highly than they ought to. In fact, these are extremely rare occurrences compared to
death by heart disease, cancer, or car accidents. But stories of violent crime and terrorism are prominent in the
news media and fiction. Because these vivid stories are dramatic and easily recalled, we have a skewed view of
how frequently violent crime occurs.

Tribalism

Another more loosely defined category of cognitive bias is the tendency for human beings to align themselves
with groups with whom they share values and practices. The tendency toward tribalism is an evolutionary
advantage for social creatures like human beings. By forming groups to share knowledge and distribute work,
we are much more likely to survive. Not surprisingly, human beings with pro-social behaviors persist in the
population at higher rates than human beings with antisocial tendencies. Pro-social behaviors, however, go
beyond wanting to communicate and align ourselves with other human beings; we also tend to see outsiders as
a threat. As a result, tribalistic tendencies both reinforce allegiances among in-group members and increase
animosity toward out-group members.

Tribal thinking makes it hard for us to objectively evaluate information that either aligns with or contradicts

      real or is based on some superficial feature of the person--for instance, the way they look or an article of
      clothing they are wearing. A related bias is called the bandwagon fallacy. The bandwagon fallacy can lead you
      to conclude that you ought to do something or believe something because many other people do or believe the
      same thing. While other people can provide guidance, they are not always reliable. Furthermore, just because
      many people believe something doesn't make it true. Watch the video below to improve your "tribal literacy"

      Sunk Cost Fallacy

      Sunk costs refer to the time, energy, money, or other costs that have been paid in the past. These costs are
      "sunk" because they cannot be recovered. The sunk cost fallacy is thinking that attaches a value to things in
      which you have already invested resources that is greater than the value those things have today. Human
      beings have a natural tendency to hang on to whatever they invest in and are loath to give something up even
      after it has been proven to be a liability. For example, a person may have sunk a lot of money into a business
      over time, and the business may clearly be failing. Nonetheless, the businessperson will be reluctant to close
      shop or sell the business because of the time, money, and emotional energy they have spent on the venture.
      This is the behavior of "throwing good money after bad" by continuing to irrationally invest in something that
      has lost its worth because of emotional attachment to the failed enterprise. People will engage in this kind of
      behavior in all kinds of situations and may continue a friendship, a job, or a marriage for the same
      reason--they don't want to lose their investment even when they are clearly headed for failure and ought to cut
      their losses.

      A similar type of faulty reasoning leads to the gambler's fallacy, in which a person reasons that future chance
      events will be more likely if they have not happened recently. For instance, if I flip a coin many times in a row, I
      may get a string of heads. But even if I flip several heads in a row, that does not make it more likely I will flip
      tails on the next coin flip. Each coin flip is statistically independent, and there is an equal chance of turning up
      heads or tails. The gambler, like the reasoner from sunk costs, is tied to the past when they should be
      reasoning about the present and future.

      There are important social and evolutionary purposes for past-looking thinking. Sunk-cost thinking keeps
      parents engaged in the growth and development of their children after they are born. Sunk-cost thinking
      builds loyalty and affection among friends and family. More generally, a commitment to sunk costs encourages
      us to engage in long-term projects, and this type of thinking has the evolutionary purpose of fostering culture
      and community. Nevertheless, it is important to periodically reevaluate our investments in both people and
      things.

      In recent ethical scholarship, there is some debate about how to assess the sunk costs of moral decisions.
      Consider the case of war. Just-war theory dictates that wars may be justified in cases where the harm imposed
      on the adversary is proportional to the good gained by the act of defense or deterrence. It may be that, at the
      start of the war, those costs seemed proportional. But after the war has dragged on for some time, it may seem
      that the objective cannot be obtained without a greater quantity of harm than had been initially imagined.
      Should the evaluation of whether a war is justified estimate the total amount of harm done or prospective harm
      that will be done going forward (Lazar 2018)? Such questions do not have easy answers.

      Table 2.1 summarizes these common cognitive biases.

TABLE 2.1 Common Cognitive Biases

         THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

As we have seen, cognitive biases are built into the way human beings process information. They are common to us
all, and it takes self-awareness and effort to overcome the tendency to fall back on biases. Consider a time when
you have fallen prey to one of the five cognitive biases described above. What were the circumstances? Recall your
thought process. Were you aware at the time that your thinking was misguided? What were the consequences of
succumbing to that cognitive bias?

Write a short paragraph describing how that cognitive bias allowed you to make a decision you now realize was
irrational. Then write a second paragraph describing how, with the benefit of time and distance, you would have
thought differently about the incident that triggered the bias. Use the tools of critical reflection and metacognition to
improve your approach to this situation. What might have been the consequences of behaving differently? Finally,
write a short conclusion describing what lesson you take from reflecting back on this experience. Does it help you
understand yourself better? Will you be able to act differently in the future? What steps can you take to avoid
cognitive biases in your thinking today?

    2.3 Developing Good Habits of Mind

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Define epistemic humility and the Dunning-Kruger effect.
        · Identify three strategies to increase the ability to think objectively.
        · Analyze emotional responses to information.

      One of the ways to respond to cognitive biases is to develop good habits of mind. There are no quick fixes or
      easy solutions to cognitive biases. Remember, these biases are a result of the way the brain works.
      Nevertheless, metacognition and critical reflection, as well as good mental habits, can help combat these
      natural tendencies in thought that otherwise leads us astray. The strategies outlined below can help you
      become a better philosopher. You should compare them with the methods philosophers use to arrive at truth,
      covered in Chapter 1.

          CONNECTIONS

      See the introduction to philosophy chapter to learn more about how philosophers arrive at the truth.

     Strive for Objectivity

      We are likely to assume that our experience or our perspective is generally true for others. To be more
      objective in thinking about issues, problems, or values, we should actively engage in strategies that remove us
      from our naturally subjective mindset. In this section, we will explore several strategies for approaching
      philosophical problems with less subjective bias.

      Abstract from Specific Circumstances

      Most people's point of view is based on generalizing from their specific circumstances and experiences.
      However, if your view of morality, consciousness, or free will is tied to notions that come from a specific time or
      location, then your view is not likely to be objective. Your personal experience has limitations when it comes to
      understanding what is going on in the world at large. To arrive at more general and representative notions, use
      your imagination to separate the specific properties of your experience from your worldview. This process of
      abstraction can make the concept appropriately general. For instance, if you wish to imagine a governing
      arrangement among citizens, you will probably default to the governmental organizations you are familiar with
      in your community, state, or nation. But these institutions differ from the way government works in other
      countries or in different eras of history. So when you think about justice in political organizations, it is
      important to imagine those not limited by your personal experience, moment in history, or location.

      In some cases, however, the specific features of your experience are indispensable to the philosophical
      position you wish to take. In such instances, your specific experience provides critical information that needs
      to be preserved. For example, the prevailing views in philosophy as well as any other subject are biased in that
      they reflect the views of the dominant cultural group who wrote the texts. If you are a person who belongs to a
      nondominant or minority group or a group that has been historically marginalized, your personal experience
      may shed new light on a problem. In such cases, specific experience can help you, as well as others, reshape
      the general view so that it is more comprehensive and inclusive. In these cases, abstracting from the particular
      circumstances may not be useful.

      Promote Alternative Points of View

      Actively considering points of view contrary to your own is most useful in political or ethical areas of
      philosophy. But a similar strategy may also be useful in metaphysics or epistemology. For instance, when
      considering issues in metaphysics, you may believe that parts of experience--like consciousness, God, or free
      will--cannot be explained by the natural sciences. Or, conversely, you may think there is a scientific

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                        2.3 · Developing Good Habits of Mind 55

explanation for everything. When considering these views philosophically, try to actively promote the
alternative point of view. Sometimes this strategy is called steelmanning the opposing argument. When you
steelman an argument, you make the strongest possible case in favor of it. This is the opposite of
strawmanning an argument, in which you construct a weaker version of the argument to easily defeat it. You
may be tempted to strawman arguments you naturally disagree with, but you will become a better philosopher
when you steelman those arguments instead.

     CONNECTIONS

Learn more about the strawman fallacy in the chapter on logic and reasoning.

Identify Counterexamples

Generating counterexamples is an effective way to test your own or others' claims. A counterexample is an
instance that renders an argument invalid by satisfying all the premises of the claim but demonstrating the
conclusion is false. Suppose someone wants to argue that the only legitimate way to know something is to have
direct experience of it. To produce a counterexample to this claim, we must imagine something that everyone
knows is true but that would be impossible to experience directly. Here is an example: I know my mother was
born. Clearly, given that I was born, I had a mother, and she, too, must have been born to have given birth to
me. My mother's birth necessarily preceded my birth by many years, so it would be impossible for me to have
any direct experience of my mother's birth. And yet, just as surely as I know I was born, I know that my mother
was born. Counterexamples are powerful tools to use in evaluating philosophical arguments. If you practice
using this tool, you will become a better critical thinker.

     CONNECTIONS

See the section on counterexamples in the chapter on logic and reasoning for more discussion of this topic.

Maintain Skepticism of Strong Emotions

While emotions play an important role in thinking, they can also cloud judgment. Strong reactions to claims
made by philosophers, other students, your professor, or anyone else may prevent you from considering the
argument objectively. You should be wary of any strong attachment or aversion you feel toward a philosophical
claim. Emotions can guide us, but they may threaten our ability to objectively consider the arguments being
made.

To respond to strong emotions, use the tools of metacognition to reflect on the source of those emotions and
attempt to manage them. There may be good reasons for your emotions, but recognize that those reasons, not
the emotions themselves, are philosophically relevant. Manage emotions by taking a step back from your
personal investment in the issue and considering it from another perspective. Sometimes a short break can
allow the immediate emotional reaction to subside. Sometimes imaginative strategies can help; for example,
substitute the features of the problem that trigger strong emotions for features that are more neutral. This
advice is not to suggest that emotions are harmful or have no place in philosophical thinking. Instead, the
purpose of this strategy is to remind you that the way to derive meaning and guidance from your emotions is to
reflect on them and think through the causes, origins, or reasons for the emotions.

Adopt Epistemic Humility

A final concept that is a critical component for becoming a better critical thinker is adopting a stance of
epistemic humility. As we have already seen, our thinking can be clouded by cognitive biases. Additionally,
our perspective on the world is always colored by our own experience and rooted in the particular place and
time in which we live. Finally, even our best scientific knowledge of the universe explains only a fraction of it,
and perhaps even less of our own experience. As a result, we should recognize these limitations of human
56 2 · Critical Thinking, Research, Reading, and Writing

      knowledge and rein in our epistemic confidence. We should recognize that the knowledge we do possess is
      fragile, historical, and conditioned by a number of social and biological processes.

      FIGURE 2.5 The principle of epistemic humility calls upon us to recognize that the knowledge we possess is fragile,
      fallible, and colored by our own experiences. (credit: "Life is a long lesson in humility." by e.r.w.i.n./Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
      Question Yourself: Do I Really Know What I Think I Know?
      We retain all sorts of beliefs from many different sources: memory, testimony, sense perception, and
      imagination. Some of these sources may be reliable, while others may not. Often, however, we forget the source
      of our beliefs and claim to "know" something simply because we have believed it for a long time. We may
      become very confident in believing something that never happened or did not happen in the way we
      remember it. In other cases, we may have been told something repeatedly, but the ultimate source of that
      information was unreliable. For instance, most people recommend wearing warm clothes outside when the
      temperature drops so that they do not "catch a cold." This is the sort of wisdom that may have been passed
      down through generations, but it makes little sense from a medical standpoint. There are not many ways that
      getting a chill or even lowering the body temperature will lead to a respiratory infection. Colds are caused by
      viruses, not by a drop in temperature. Without thinking through the source of the belief that "if you get cold,
      you may catch a cold," you end up believing something that is not true.
      Be Aware of the Dunning-Kruger Effect
      An even more pernicious form of epistemic overconfidence is revealed in the psychological phenomenon
      known as the Dunning-Kruger effect. David Dunning and Justin Kruger demonstrated a widespread illusion
      in which incompetent people or novices rate their own knowledge of a subject more highly than they ought to,
      while highly competent people or experts rate their knowledge slightly lower than they ought to. These
      findings do not mean that the experts considered themselves to be less competent than novices. In fact,
      experts are fairly accurate in rating their own knowledge. However, they tend to assume that everyone else has
      a similar level of expertise. By contrast, novices consider themselves to be far more competent in comparison
      to others and misrepresent their own incompetence, which can be a dangerous in many situations.
      The lesson from the Dunning-Kruger effect is that you should be extremely wary when assessing your
      expertise about anything, but especially about something that is a new area of learning for you. The reality is
      that your intuitive sense of your own knowledge is likely to be inaccurate. It takes time to build expertise in a
      subject area, and the expert is more capable of assessing their own knowledge accurately.

2.4 Gathering Information, Evaluating Sources, and Understanding Evidence

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify four moves for fact-checking.
  · Apply fact-checking to specific exercises.

Start with a Strong Foundation

When you are learning a new concept or writing a paper, you probably do some internet research to locate
information about the topic. However, as you probably know, not all internet sources are reliable. Philosophy
students are fortunate to have two online philosophy encyclopedias that provide excellent information about a
wide array of topics. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (https://openstax.org/r/ieputmedu) provides
good general topic coverage of the major areas of philosophy. The IEP is a traditional encyclopedia, and its
articles are written for new students without a lot of prior knowledge. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
(https://openstax.org/r/platostanford) provides in-depth, up-to-date articles on a wide range of topics and
includes both general and specific coverage. The articles in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy are well
written, but they typically go into greater depth and sometimes include technical terms or information you will
have to look up. These articles provide an excellent, free introduction to a wide range of specific topics in
philosophy. As with all encyclopedia entries, students should start with the article itself and then move on to
sources cited in the article. Think of these articles as an entry point into research.

Wherever possible, read articles and books written by philosophers on the topics you are interested in. You can
usually find these resources at your college or university library. You may want to cast a wider net on the
internet itself by tapping into YouTube channels, podcasts, and other websites that can help you understand
philosophical issues or provide information for philosophy papers. However, be discriminating when selecting
material. In this section, we will outline some tools and habits that can make you a better, more critically
engaged online researcher.

Finally, many instructors in philosophy will encourage their students to engage only with the assigned texts in
the class. This can be a valuable technique for learning philosophy since philosophical thinking is cultivated by
serious, critical engagement with good philosophical writing. If you can learn to engage directly with primary
sources (texts written by philosophers about philosophy), you will be a better philosophy student. However, we
acknowledge that most students are accustomed to using the internet for research when they are learning
something new. So this section is intended to provide some guidance for students who want to supplement
their class readings with information gleaned from online sources.

The SIFT Method (Four Moves for Student Fact Checkers)

Information literacy scholar Michael Caulfield came to realize that the methods of research taught by
librarians and information literacy educators often did not work well for students. Typically, students are
encouraged to assess the quality of information using an acronym like CRAAP: currency, relevancy, authority,
accuracy, and purpose. But these criteria are not always useful in spotting misinformation turned up through
search engines. After all, many sources that provide misinformation appear current and relevant and are
generated by organizations that appear to be authoritative while they conceal a hidden agenda.

To find out how students evaluate sources they find on Google, Caulfield relies on the empirical research of
Sam Wineburg and Sarah Mcgrew (2016). The researchers compared the behavior of Stanford University
students to trained fact-checkers at newspapers and magazines. Not surprisingly, the online fact-checkers
used search engines more effectively. Based on this research, Caulfield developed his own protocol to make
students better researchers.

The first thing to know about using a search engine like Google is that results are not ranked by authority,
accuracy, or relevance. Internet companies are notoriously secretive about the algorithms (mathematical
58 2 · Critical Thinking, Research, Reading, and Writing

      procedural rules) they use to generate search engine results, but we know that they prioritize paid
      advertisements, popularity, and web interconnectivity (the degree to which key words and links from a website
      are shared with other websites). Thus, websites interested in sharing misinformation can use the same search
      engine optimization tools that legitimate companies or media sources use to move up the ranks of search
      results. So you need to learn to use the search engine to your advantage. Caulfield recommends using the
      acronym SIFT, or the "four moves" of student fact checkers.

      FIGURE 2.6 The four moves for student fact checkers: stop; investigate the source; find better coverage; and trace
      the claims to the original context. (credit: "SIFT (The Four Moves)" by Michael Caulfield/hapgood.us, CC BY 4.0)
      Stop
      The first move reiterates something we have already discussed: to become a better critical thinker, slow down
      the quick and efficient thinking that leads to errors and engage in critical reflection and metacognition. By
      stopping, slowing down, or taking your time to allow for critical reflection, you will be using rational and
      reflective thinking to assess claims. Additionally, after some searching, you will want stop, return to your
      original source, and check its claims again. When you circle back after going down a bit of a rabbit hole, you
      will have a new perspective from which to evaluate these claims.
      Investigate the Source
      Next, investigate the source of your information. Internet searches will often lead you through a series of links,
      in which you jump from one document to another. Strive to understand this electronic paper trail. Who wrote
      each document? What are their credentials? You can prioritize academic sources, such as web pages of
      philosophy faculty members, and you can discount sites that aggregate student papers or provide content
      without clear authorship. But investigating authorship does not mean that you should just read the "About"
      page on a website. Rather, Wineburg and Mcgrew (2016) found that fact-checkers used search tools to check
      the reputation of the sites they were investigating, a move they called "reading laterally." You do not have to
      spend a lot of time on the site itself. Instead, search reviews or critiques of the website and the authors on the
      site. Find out what other authoritative sources say about the site. Is this a website that is approved by other
      people you trust? Or do people you trust indicate that the website or its information are questionable?
      Find Better Coverage
      Check the claims and information on the site you are reading. What do other sources say about the same
      information? Is there other coverage on the same topic? This move is particularly important for controversial
      claims you might find on social media, where the original source is frequently obscured. Is this information
      being covered elsewhere, and does the coverage agree with what you have read? This move can help in
      evaluating your original source or gaining familiarity with the claims being made. If the claims by one source
      do not match up with what you are reading elsewhere, be skeptical.

Trace Claims, Quotes, and Media to the Original Context
Frequently, claims made on the internet are divorced from their original context. It is important to trace those
claims back to the original source. This advice holds for online research in philosophy. You may discover a
claim or quote about a philosopher that lacks context. To evaluate the claim, you need its original context,
which will reveal whether the claim or quote was mischaracterized or portrayed in a misleading way. Look for
citations, and then follow those citations to the original publication. If the source you have found does not have
citations, then you will need to search key terms or phrases in quotation marks to see if you can locate the
claim or quote using another method. Good academic sources ought to provide citations so you can verify the
original source of the claim. If it is hard to verify a claim or quote, that should be a red flag to not trust the
source making those claims or providing those quotes.

         THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

Here are three examples of claims made online. Use the four moves to assess whether these claims are true. You
have been provided with a screen capture of a headline, so you do not have links back to a website. Therefore, use
search tools on the web to verify the claims being made. In each case, find a source that either verifies or debunks
the claim. The source you use to verify or debunk the claim should be reputable and authoritative.

To be successful in a philosophy course, you must be able to read primary and secondary sources in
philosophy. Many students in their first philosophy class struggle with the required readings. You may find
yourself rereading a passage several times without having a clear notion of what the author is trying to say. Or
you may get lost in the back-and-forth of arguments and counterarguments, forgetting which represent the
author's opinion. This is a common problem. Using the strategies described below, you can track the key
claims and arguments in your reading. Eventually, you will reach the point where you can begin to reflect on,
evaluate, and engage with the philosophical concepts presented.

Prepare to Read

Preparing your reading space will help you focus and improve the chances of retaining the reading material.
Read at a table with a comfortable chair instead of on a couch or in a bed. Sitting up straight improves
concentration. Have something to drink nearby, and avoid distractions, like TV or music with lyrics. Some
people find it helpful to have a little bit of bustle around them (for example, you might choose to work in a café
or library), while others find this distracting. Some people like music; others prefer silence. Find the setting
that helps you concentrate.

Next, choose an annotation tool. You will need to write notes, underline, and flag portions of the reading, so use
text you can alter whenever possible. If you are working with a printed text, use a pencil so that you can erase
and rewrite notes in the margin. Many students use highlighters when reading text, but readers have a
tendency to highlight too much, which makes the highlighting useless when you go back and reread. A better
system is to write marginal notes or markers to flag and identify key passages. You can devise a simple coding
system using symbols to identify different parts of a text: for example, main ideas or topics, examples,
arguments, references to other philosophers, questions, and quotations to use in papers. If you are working
with a digital text, there are many tools you can use to write notes and place markers in the text. OpenStax
provides a useful annotation tool for its web-based textbooks, allowing you to create notes that link passages
and even to review your notes all together. The purpose of annotation is to create a visual trail you can come
back to for easy tracking of an argument. This will ensure you do not need to reread large portions of the text to
find key information for studying or writing a paper. Annotations allow you to move quickly through a text,
identifying key passages for quotes or citations, understanding the flow of the argument, and remembering the
key claims or points made by the author.

Engaging with Philosophical Texts

The purpose of philosophical writing is to engage the reader in a sequence of thoughts that either present a
problem to be considered, prompt reflection on previous ideas and works, or lead to some insight or
enlightenment. Philosophy consists of ideas and arguments. Your goal is to engage with those ideas and
arguments to arrive at your own understanding of the issues. You may critically engage with the author, or you
may have your perspective changed by reading the author. In either case, your goal ought to be to reach a new
understanding. This is somewhat different from writing in most other disciplines, in which the purpose may
be to convey information, evoke emotions, tell a story, or produce aesthetic enjoyment. While engaging with
philosophical ideas can be pleasurable and may involve understanding some basic information, the primary
purpose of the writing is to engage thought and reflection. This means that you should read the work as fast or
slow as you need to engage thoughtfully with it. The speed of reading will depend on how quickly you grasp the
ideas and arguments presented or how familiar you are with the claims being made. It is not as important to
read sequentially for plot or narrative; much more important is to follow the sequence of ideas and arguments.
Consequently, it may make sense to cross-reference passages, jumping from one section to another to
compare claims, and link ideas that appear in different places in the text.

Philosophical Methods at Work

Look for philosophical methods at work in your readings. Recall that philosophers use a variety of methods to
arrive at truth, including conceptual analysis, logic, and the consideration of trade-offs. Philosophers may also
62 2 · Critical Thinking, Research, Reading, and Writing

      draw on a variety of sources of evidence, including history, intuition, common sense, or empirical results from
      other disciplines or from experimental philosophy. In any case, most philosophical works will be attempting to
      develop a position through argumentation. Sources of evidence will be used to bolster premises for the
      purpose of reaching a desired conclusion. Additionally, the author may use a variety of methods to make an
      argument. If you can identify these methods, strategies, and sources of evidence, you will be able to better
      evaluate the text.
      The Principle of Charity
      The principle of charity is an interpretative principle that advises the reader to interpret the author's
      statements in the most rational and best way possible. Sometimes a philosopher's argument may be unclear or
      ambiguous. For example, philosophers from older historical periods may use terminology and expressions
      that are difficult for a modern reader to understand. In these cases, the reader should start from the
      assumption that the author is putting forward a rational, thoughtful view. The reader's goal should be to
      understand that view in the best light possible. This does not mean that you should ignore difficulties or avoid
      criticizing the author. Rather, when you encounter difficulties, look for an interpretation that makes the most
      sense of what the author is saying. All the primary- and secondary-source authors you will read are smart,
      thoughtful people. Therefore, assume the author has a response to simple or obvious objections, and look for
      that response. Try to understand the work on its own terms, and then critically engage with the best version of
      that work.
      Working with the Dialectic
      The dialectical process that is common to many philosophical writings is initially confusing for many students.
      Dialectic, a method for discovering truth through dialogue, involves an exchange of ideas with the goal of
      arriving at a position that more accurately reflects the truth. In practical terms, philosophers will frequently
      move back and forth between the view they are advancing and competing views that they may or may not
      support. These alternative views may provide criticisms, or they may represent views that are common in
      philosophy. The author's goal is to present alternative perspectives--in addition to their own--to demonstrate
      the range of perspectives on the problem. If one view emerges through this dialectical process, there is a
      greater chance that it has some share of the truth since it has survived the criticisms and contrary opinions of
      others.
      When reading a philosophical work that uses a dialectical method, pay attention to tracking different strands
      of argument. Do not assume that every argument or claim in what you are reading is the considered opinion of
      the author. Rather, various claims may represent contrasting views that will eventually be rejected. Track the
      back-and-forth between views to grasp the thread of argument that the author endorses.

Pre-reading

Start your reading with a pre-read. This is a very useful practice when tackling academic works. So much
information can be learned simply by reviewing the surrounding features of the article, book, or chapter.
Spend some time reviewing these elements to grasp the context for what you are about to read. Start with these
elements.
Title, Author, and Publication
What does the title and author tell you about the work? When was it written? Who has published the text--an
academic press or a popular press? If you do not know this information, you may want to do some preliminary
internet searches to try to find out. Where does this work fit into the author's broader body of work? What can
you learn or what do you know about the author? What are the author's main contributions to philosophy?
Table of Contents and Bibliography
Develop a mental outline for the work by looking carefully at the table of contents, usually at the front of the
book. For a shorter work, scan through the article, looking for section headings and breaks. If the headings are
labeled, you may have enough information to track the general flow of the article just by reading them. If the
headings are not helpful or there are no headings, quickly skim the first and last paragraph, and pick out topic
sentences or words that indicate what individual paragraphs are about to get a sense of where the overall
argument is going.
At this stage, you want to look at the bibliography or references. Depending on the length and style of the work,
the reference list may be very long. As a novice, you may not be able to get much information from a
bibliography, but as you become more familiar with your subject, you will get a sense from titles and authors in
the bibliography about the perspective that informs this author's writing.

First Read

You may need to read material more than once to become engaged in critical reflection. However, because you
are planning to do multiple readings, do not linger too long on the first read. Move quickly and purposefully
through the material with the goal of understanding the flow of the argument. Use the information you gleaned
from pre-reading to fill in gaps in knowledge where possible, and flag places for follow-up.
Identify Key Claims
During the first read, you should identify the key claims in the text. In a traditional academic article, these
64 2 · Critical Thinking, Research, Reading, and Writing

      claims ought to be highlighted in the introduction or abstract. In a book or historical work, these key claims
      may be harder to find. Look for sentences that introduce claims with expressions such as, "I aim to show,"
      "What this chapter will demonstrate," or "The purpose of this work is." Mark key claims so that you can come
      back to them easily. Ask yourself what the author is trying to say; what does the author hope the reader will
      take away from reading?

      Identify Sources of Evidence and Methods of Argument

      Look for the evidence the author is providing to support the key claims. What methods does the author use to
      generate this evidence? Is the author using logical argumentation? Are there thought experiments or other
      forms of conceptual analysis? Does the author provide empirical evidence to back up the claims? In the best-
      case scenario, evidence will be provided shortly before or after the claim is announced. However, sometimes
      evidence and claims are mixed together. During this stage, try to flag the dialectic in the argument. Is the
      author presenting their own view, a rival view, a criticism, or a supporting view?

      Flag for Follow-Up

      Use annotation flags to chart the course of the argument and claims being made. Use a simple notation system
      that works for you. But you should consider flagging things like thesis, definition, claim, evidence, argument,
      question, counterargument, objection, response, and so forth. Flagging should also be used to identify words
      or ideas you do not understand. When you are moving quickly, you may ask questions that you later
      understand, or you may flag something incorrectly and need to revise your notes. This is fine. You are engaged
      in a process of gradually becoming acquainted with the text.

     Close Read

      At this stage, you will read for thoughtful engagement with the ideas and arguments presented in the text. Now
      is when you critically reflect on, evaluate, and understand the author's writing.

      At this point, you should not move any more quickly than you can think alongside the author. Use this time to
      follow up on questions you posed during flagging. Look up terms; do some research on concepts you do not
      understand. You do not need to understand the article perfectly, but you should understand it well enough to
      think about it. If you have a good understanding of what you read, you will have something to say about the
      material after you finish reading it.

      Reading slowly and actively involves asking the author questions: How does this claim follow from that one?
      Where is the evidence to support this assertion? Is the evidence adequate to support the claim being made?
      What are the implications of this claim? How does this idea fit with the overall emphasis on some other set of
      ideas? If something in the text does not sit well with you, try to articulate what is bothering you. Write a short
      objection in the margin. Even if you are not sure, try to work out why you do not agree with the author. The
      more you can articulate your concerns and think through your own reactions, the more you will understand
      the material and your own reaction to it.

      The close reading is intended to prepare you for talking and writing about the author's work. That means you
      are preparing yourself to do philosophy alongside and with the author. Hold yourself to the same standards to
      which you hold the author. Provide reasons for your claims, support your opinions with adequate evidence,
      and consider possible objections.

              READ LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

      Identify a reading from Chapter 1 (or another introductory reading from this course). This exercise will work best if
      the reading is a fairly short, primary source reading from someone who is doing philosophy. Follow the three-step
      method for reading:

  · Pre-read
  · Fast read with flagging
  · Close read and revise flagging

Consider the following prompts in writing a short review of the article (no more than two paragraphs in length):

  · Provide a brief synopsis of the argument and dialectical structure of the text.
  · What are the primary claims that the author makes?
  · What evidence does the author provide to support those claims?
  · What methods does the author use to generate evidence or make arguments?
  · Is the evidence adequate to support the claims the author makes?
  · Where do you think the evidence falls short?
  · Do you agree with the author's claims?
  · Where do you disagree, and why?

When you are writing philosophy papers, you should plan the structure of your argument in advance, spend
time thinking about a thesis, and focus on an achievable aim relative to the length of your paper.

2.6 Writing Philosophy Papers

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify and characterize the format of a philosophy paper.
  · Create thesis statements that are manageable and sufficiently specific.
  · Collect evidence and formulate arguments.
  · Organize ideas into a coherent written presentation.

This section will provide some practical advice on how to write philosophy papers. The format presented here
focuses on the use of an argumentative structure in writing. Different philosophy professors may have
different approaches to writing. The sections below are only intended to give some general guidelines that
apply to most philosophy classes.

Identify Claims

The key element in any argumentative paper is the claim you wish to make or the position you want to defend.
Therefore, take your time identifying claims, which is also called the thesis statement. What do you want to say
about the topic? What do you want the reader to understand or know after reading your piece? Remember that
narrow, modest claims work best. Grand claims are difficult to defend, even for philosophy professors. A good
thesis statement should go beyond the mere description of another person's argument. It should say
something about the topic, connect the topic to other issues, or develop an application of some theory or
position advocated by someone else. Here are some ideas for creating claims that are perfectly acceptable and
easy to develop:

  · Compare two philosophical positions. What makes them similar? How are they different? What general
      lessons can you draw from these positions?

  · Identify a piece of evidence or argument that you think is weak or may be subject to criticism. Why is it
      weak? How is your criticism a problem for the philosopher's perspective?

  · Apply a philosophical perspective to a contemporary case or issue. What makes this philosophical position
      applicable? How would it help us understand the case?

  · Identify another argument or piece of evidence that might strengthen a philosophical position put forward
      by a philosopher. Why is this a good argument or piece of evidence? How does it fit with the philosopher's
      other claims and arguments?

  · Consider an implication (either positive or negative) that follows from a philosopher's argument. How does
66 2 · Critical Thinking, Research, Reading, and Writing

            this implication follow? Is it necessary or contingent? What lessons can you draw from this implication (if
            positive, it may provide additional reasons for the argument; if negative, it may provide reasons against
            the argument)?

              THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

      The following multiple-choice exercises will help you identify and write modest, clear philosophical thesis
      statements. A thesis statement is a declarative statement that puts forward a position or makes a claim about some
      topic.

      1. Which of the following is a declarative statement that puts forward a position or claim?
      a. How does Aristotle think virtue is necessary for happiness?
      b. Is happiness the ultimate goal of human action?
       c. Whether or not virtue is necessary for happiness.
      d. Aristotle argues that happiness is the ultimate good of human action and virtue is necessary for happiness.

      2. Which of the following declarative statements goes beyond mere description?
      a. René Descartes argues that the soul or mind is the essence of the human person.
      b. Descartes shows that all beliefs and memories about the external world could be false.
       c. Some people think that Descartes is a skeptic, but I will show that he goes beyond skepticism.
      d. In the meditations, Descartes claims that the mind and body are two different substances.

      3. Which of the following statements proposes a comparison between two philosophical views?
      a. Descartes says that the mind is a substance that is distinct from the body, but I disagree.
      b. Contemporary psychology has shown that Descartes is incorrect to think that human beings have free will and

            that the mind is something different from the brain.
       c. Thomas Hobbes's view of the soul is materialistic, whereas Descartes's view of the soul is nonphysical. In this

            paper, I will examine the differences between these two views.

      4. Which of the following statements identifies a weakness in a philosopher's argument and proposes a criticism
            of that argument?

      a. John Stuart Mill reasons that utilitarian judgments can be based on qualitative differences as well as the
            quantity of pleasure, but ultimately any qualitative difference must result in a difference in the quantity of
            pleasure.

      b. Mill's approach to utilitarianism differs from Bentham's by introducing qualitative distinctions among pleasures,
            where Bentham only considers the quantitative aspects of pleasure.

       c. J. S. Mill's approach to utilitarianism aligns moral theory with the history of ethics because he allows qualitative
            differences in moral judgments.

      5. Which of the following is an example of a statement that applies a philosophical idea to a contemporary issue or
            problem?

      a. Rawls's liberty principle ensures that all people have a basic set of freedoms that are important for living a full
            life.

      b. The US Bill of Rights is an example of Rawls's liberty principle because it lists a set of basic freedoms that are
            guaranteed for all people.

       c. While many people may agree that Rawls's liberty principle applies to all citizens of a particular country, it is
            much more controversial to extend those same basic freedoms to immigrants, including those classified by the
            government as permanent residents, legal immigrants, illegal immigrants, and refugees.

         WRITE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

Use the following templates to write your own thesis statement by inserting a philosopher, claim, or contemporary
issue:

1. [Name of philosopher] holds that [claim], but [name of another philosopher] holds that [another claim]. In this
      paper, I will identify reasons for thinking [name of philosopher]'s position is more likely to be true.

2. [Name of philosopher] argues that [claim]. In this paper, I will show how this claim provides a helpful addition to
      [contemporary issue].

3. When [name of philosopher] argues in favor of [claim], they rely on [another claim] that is undercut by
      contemporary science. I will show that if we modify this claim in light of contemporary science, we will
      strengthen or weaken [name of philosopher]'s argument.

Collect Evidence and Build Your Case

Once you have identified your thesis statement or primary claim, collect evidence (by returning to your
readings) to compose the best possible argument. As you assemble the evidence, you can think like a detective
or prosecutor building a case. However, you want a case that is true, not just one that supports your position.
So you should stay open to modifying your claim if it does not fit the evidence. If you need to do additional
research, follow the guidelines presented earlier to locate authoritative information.

If you cannot find evidence to support your claim but still feel strongly about it, you can try to do your own
philosophical thinking using any of the methods discussed in this chapter or in Chapter 1. Imagine
counterexamples and thought experiments that support your claim. Use your intuitions and common sense,
but remember that these can sometimes lead you astray. In general, common sense, intuitions, thought
experiments, and counterexamples should support one another and support the sources you have identified
from other philosophers. Think of your case as a structure: you do not want too much of the weight to rest on a
single intuition or thought experiment.

Consider Counterarguments

Philosophy papers differ from typical argumentative papers in that philosophy students must spend more
time and effort anticipating and responding to counterarguments when constructing their own arguments.
This has two important effects: first, by developing counterarguments, you demonstrate that you have
sufficiently thought through your position to identify possible weaknesses; second, you make your case
stronger by taking away a potential line of attack that an opponent might use. By including counterarguments
in your paper, you engage in the kind of dialectical process that philosophers use to arrive at the truth.

Accurately Represent Source Material

It is important to represent primary and secondary source material as accurately as possible. This means that
you should consider the context and read the arguments using the principle of charity. Make sure that you are
not strawmanning an argument you disagree with or misrepresenting a quote or paraphrase just because you
need some evidence to support your argument. As always, your goal should be to find the most rationally
compelling argument, which is the one most likely to be true.

     Organize Your Paper

      Academic philosophy papers use the same simple structure as any other paper and one you likely learned in
      high school or your first-year composition class.
      Introduce Your Thesis
      The purpose of your introduction is to provide context for your thesis. Simply tell the reader what to expect in
      the paper. Describe your topic, why it is important, and how it arises within the works you have been reading.
      You may have to provide some historical context, but avoid both broad generalizations and long-winded
      historical retellings. Your context or background information should not be overly long and simply needs to
      provide the reader with the context and motivation for your thesis. Your thesis should appear at the end of the
      introduction, and the reader should clearly see how the thesis follows from the introductory material you have
      provided. If you are writing a long paper, you may need several sentences to express your thesis, in which you
      delineate in broad terms the parts of your argument.
      Make a Logical and Compelling Case Using the Evidence
      The paragraphs that follow the introduction lay out your argument. One strategy you can use to successfully
      build paragraphs is to think in terms of good argument structure. You should provide adequate evidence to
      support the claims you want to make. Your paragraphs will consist of quotations and paraphrases from
      primary and secondary sources, context and interpretation, novel thoughts and ideas, examples and analogies,
      counterarguments, and replies to the counterarguments. The evidence should both support the thesis and
      build toward the conclusion. It may help to think architecturally: lay down the foundation, insert the beams of
      your strongest support, and then put up the walls to complete the structure. Or you might think in terms of a
      narrative: tell a story in which the evidence leads to an inevitable conclusion.

          CONNECTIONS

      See the chapter on logic and reasoning for a developed account of different types of philosophical arguments.

      Summarize Your Argument in the Conclusion
      Conclude your paper with a short summary that recapitulates the argument. Remind the reader of your thesis
      and revisit the evidence that supports your argument. You may feel that the argument as written should stand
      on its own. But it is helpful to the reader to reinforce the argument in your conclusion with a short summary.

Do not introduce any new information in the conclusion; simply summarize what you have already said.

The purpose of this chapter has been to provide you with basic tools to become a successful philosophy
student. We started by developing a sophisticated picture of how the brain works, using contemporary
neuroscience. The brain represents and projects a picture of the world, full of emotional significance, but this
image may contain distortions that amount to a kind of illusion. Cognitive illusions produce errors in
reasoning, called cognitive biases. To guard against error, we need to engage in effortful, reflective thinking,
where we become aware of our biases and use logical strategies to overcome them. You will do well in your
philosophy class if you apply the good habits of mind discussed in this chapter and apply the practical advice
that has been provided about how to read and write about philosophy.
70 2 · Summary

Summary

2.1 The Brain Is an Inference Machine

Our brains facilitate our survival and promote our ability to find a partner and reproduce by using thought,
calculation, prediction, and inference. For this reason, our natural and genetically primed ways of thinking do
not necessarily serve the goals of philosophy, science, or truth.

The relationship between mind and brain is one of the central problems of metaphysics, known as the "mind-
body problem." The mind-body problem is the problem of understanding the relationship between the organic
gray and white matter in our skulls (the brain) and the range of conscious awareness (the mind). Biology does
not tell us what the relationship is between our private mental life and the neurological, electrochemical
interactions that take place in the brain.

It can be helpful to use the resources of psychology and cognitive science (the study of the brain's processes) to
help us understand how to become better thinkers. Your brain is not passively capturing the world, like a
camera, but is actively projecting the world so that it makes sense to you. When the brain defaults to ways of
thinking that produce a less than optimal result or even an incorrect decision, it is operating with a cognitive
bias. A cognitive bias is a pattern of "quick" thinking based on the `rule of thumb.' Cognitive biases are like
perceptual illusions.

2.2 Overcoming Cognitive Biases and Engaging in Critical Reflection

Metacognition means thinking about thinking and involves the kind of self-awareness that engages higher
order thinking skills. Cognition, or the way we typically engage with the world around us, is first-order
thinking, while metacognition is higher-order thinking.

One of the most common cognitive biases is confirmation bias, which is the tendency to search for, interpret,
favor, and recall information that confirms or supports your prior beliefs. Anchoring bias refers to our
tendency to rely on initial values, prices, or quantities when estimating the actual value, price, or quantity of
something. If you are presented with a quantity, even if that number is clearly arbitrary, you will have a hard
time discounting it in your subsequent calculations; the initial value "anchors" subsequent estimates. The
availability heuristic refers to the tendency to evaluate new information based on the most recent or most
easily recalled examples. The availability heuristic occurs when people take easily remembered instances as
being more representative than they objectively are (i.e., based on statistical probabilities).

Another more loosely defined category of cognitive bias is the tendency for human beings to align themselves
with groups with whom they share values and practices. Tribal thinking makes it hard for us to objectively
evaluate information that either aligns with or contradicts the beliefs held by our group or tribe. A related bias
is called the bandwagon fallacy. The bandwagon fallacy can lead you to conclude that you ought to do
something or believe something because many other people do or believe the same thing.

The sunk cost fallacy is thinking that attaches a value to things in which you have already invested resources
that is greater than the value those things have today. A similar type of faulty reasoning leads to the gambler's
fallacy, in which a person reasons that future chance events will be more likely if they have not happened
recently.

2.3 Developing Good Habits of Mind

One of the ways to respond to cognitive biases is to develop good habits of mind. There are no quick fixes or
easy solutions to cognitive biases, but some strategies can be helpful.

To be more objective in thinking about issues, problems, or values, we should actively engage in strategies that
remove us from our naturally subjective mindset. When considering philosophical views, try to actively
promote the alternative point of view. Another good strategy is to identify counterexamples - instances that
render an argument invalid by satisfying all the premises of the claim but demonstrating the conclusion is

false. To respond to strong emotions, use the tools of metacognition to reflect on the source of those emotions
and attempt to manage them.

A final concept that is a critical component for becoming a better critical thinker is adopting a stance of
epistemic humility. We should recognize these limitations of human knowledge and rein in our epistemic
confidence. We should recognize that the knowledge we do possess is fragile, historical, and conditioned by a
number of social and biological processes.

2.4 Gathering Information, Evaluating Sources, and Understanding Evidence

Effective internet research requires knowing how to find information and evaluate the quality of sources. The
SIFT method for evaluating sources teaches students how to become seasoned fact-checkers when searching
online. The four moves for student fact checkers are: stop, investigate the source, find better coverage, trace
the claims to the original context.

2.5 Reading Philosophy

Read at a table with a comfortable chair, instead of on a couch or in a bed. Sitting up straight improves
concentration. Have something to drink nearby, and avoid distractions, like the TV or music with lyrics. Next,
choose an annotation tool. You will need to write notes, underline, and flag portions of the reading, so use text
you can alter whenever possible.

Philosophy consists of ideas and arguments. Your goal is to engage with those ideas and arguments to arrive at
your own understanding of the issues. It is not as important to read sequentially for plot or narrative; it is
much more important to follow the sequence of ideas and arguments. The author may use a variety of methods
to make an argument. If you can identify these methods, strategies, and sources of evidence, you will be able to
better evaluate the text.

An effective method for reading philosophy involves three key steps: pre-read, first read, and close read. When
encountering a new philosophical text, students who use this systematic method will better understand
challenging content.

2.6 Writing Philosophy Papers

Most philosophy papers require students to produce an argument in support of a claim about the readings in
philosophy class. The first and most important step to writing a good argumentative paper is to find a clear,
defensible thesis. The next step is to construct an argument using evidence from assigned readings and
external research, original arguments, and applied cases. However, the goal of writing in philosophy is to
approach truth, not just to win an argument.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

3.1 Indigenous Philosophy
3.2 Classical Indian Philosophy
3.3 Classical Chinese Philosophy
INTRODUCTION As discussed in previous chapters, the figure of the sage, the individual found in early
societies around the world who mediated between the everyday and the transcendent realm, is an important
precursor to philosophy. In most societies, this figure predates the recognition of the philosopher as the
individual seeker of wisdom by many hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Justin E. H. Smith (2016) argues
that philosophical thought requires abstract thinking of the sort required for the bureaucratic administration
of society and that many societies developed philosophical traditions out of these practices of abstract
reasoning. These traditions furnished shared beliefs about ethics, metaphysics, and other realms of
philosophical inquiry.
Homo sapiens have inhabited the earth for at least 250,000 years, originating in the Blue Nile rift region of
northern Africa. However, the oldest forms of human writing were discovered in ancient Sumer, in
76 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

      Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers where they enter the Persian Gulf, dating to around
      3500 BCE (approximately 5,500 years ago). The vast period of time between the emergence of biological
     humans and the emergence of human writing is typically called prehistory. This term does not imply that early
      human beings lacked a sense of their past and the lessons they may draw from it. We know from studying
      modern aliterate societies that many of them possess oral traditions of storytelling that provide historical
      perspective. However, whatever perspective prehistoric humans gained from oral history is completely lost to
      us.

      The use of writing to record human thought marks the transition from prehistory to history. The first recorded
      texts include genealogies, accounts of heroic and everyday actions by human beings, and legal codes. These
      earliest writings offer a glimpse into early human systems of government and everyday life. Writing expressing
      philosophical questions came later, primarily in the form of religious and mythological stories, and this is
      where we begin. There is concrete evidence that at this turning point in human history, people were aware of
      and concerned with history; engaged in questions of the origins of nature and the self; speculating about the
      goals and purposes of human life, whether moral or spiritual; and reasoning about right, wrong, justice, and
      injustice. This turning point is what German intellectual Karl Jaspers (1883-1969) has called the "Axial
      Period" (1953), more commonly translated as the "Axial Age." Jaspers observed that this "axis" of the
      emergence of philosophical thought occurred during a somewhat well-defined period, between 800 BCE and
      200 BCE, in multiple locations around the world, principally the Mediterranean region, Mesopotamia, India,
      and China. Remarkably, human beings in these disparate locations appear to have made roughly simultaneous
      transitions, first from prehistory to history, and then from a mythological and religious understanding of
      human beings and their place in the world to a more systematic study of human beings and the world around
      them. This chapter will cover the period of time from the so-called axial age to the development of rich
      philosophical traditions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.

    3.1 Indigenous Philosophy

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Identify challenges in the study of Indigenous philosophies.
        · Describe metaphysical and epistemological ideas explored by Indigenous African philosophies.
        · Describe metaphysical and epistemological ideas explored by Indigenous Native American philosophies.
        · Describe metaphysical and epistemological ideas explored by Mesoamerican philosophies.

      Some of the best-known ancient texts, connected to many of the great civilizations around the world, are
      religious or mythological in nature. Examples include the Vedas of India, the earliest literature of China, and
      the Jewish Talmud. These texts introduce aspects of philosophical inquiry--such as questions concerning the
      origins of the cosmos and the nature and purpose of human life, morality, justice, human excellence,
      knowledge, and so forth--in terms of stories and explanations that rely on the supernatural. These stories
      provide context, meaning, and direction for human life within a framework that assumes that the natural
      world is infused with supernatural importance. Such texts are a testament to the fundamental and binding
      nature of religion in human societies.

      When humans shift from religious answers to questions about purpose and meaning to more naturalistic and
      logical answers, they move from the realm of myth to the realm of reason. In Greek, this movement is
     described as a move from mythos to logos, where mythos signifies the supernatural stories people tell, while
     logos signifies the rational, logical, and scientific stories they tell. This distinction may lead one to believe that
      there is a clear transition from religious thought to philosophical or scientific thought, but this is not the case.
      The earliest philosophers in Greece, Rome, India, China, and North Africa all used mythological and analogical
      (analogy-based) stories to explain their rational systems, while religious texts from the same period often
      engage in serious, logical argumentation. Rather than seeing a decisive break between mythological thinking
      and rational thinking, one should understand the transition from mythos to logos as a gradual, uneven, and

zig-zagging progression. This progression teaches that there are close connections between religion,
philosophy, and science in terms of the desire to understand, explain, and find purpose for human existence.

Challenges in Researching Indigenous Philosophy

There is growing interest in Indigenous philosophy in contemporary academic philosophy, as a way of
engaging with both the historical and present-day thought of Indigenous peoples around the world. Indigenous
philosophy broadly refers to the ideas of Indigenous peoples pertaining to the nature of the world, human
existence, ethics, ideal social and political structures, and other topics also considered by traditional academic
philosophy. Unlike the philosophies of ancient Greece, India, and China, Indigenous philosophies did not
spread across vast territorial empires or feature centers of formal learning that documented and developed
philosophical ideas over hundreds or thousands of years. The study of Indigenous philosophies, or
ethnophilosophy, often must rely on different methods than typical academic philosophy. Indigenous
philosophy is not usually recorded in texts that can be read and analyzed. Instead, those seeking to understand
Indigenous philosophical thinking must engage in the kind of research often used in ethnographic and
sociological study, including identifying individuals who hold and transmit cultural knowledge about
philosophical thought and recording interviews and conversations with them. Most of the philosophy of
Indigenous peoples has been passed down through oral traditions, in much the same way that prehistoric
thought was transmitted.

There are additional challenges to studying Indigenous philosophy. The discipline of academic philosophy has
traditionally dismissed or ignored the philosophical thought of Indigenous peoples, considering it to lie
outside the realm of logos. The long history of erasure of Indigenous philosophical thought in academic
philosophy makes it difficult to engage in academic discussion with it. There is an absence of past scholarship
in this field in the West. Indigenous peoples have also been subjected to racist practices, such as forced
education in languages other than their own, that make it difficult for them to retain a lively philosophical
tradition. Furthermore, many Indigenous customs have been lost because of the loss of life and cultural
heritage among Indigenous peoples following colonization by Europeans and Americans.

Indigenous African Philosophy

If the transition from mythos to logos is predicated on the development of written language, then this
transition may have first occurred in Africa. Africa was home to the development of many ancient writing
systems, including the system of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics that developed during the fourth millennium
BCE. The modern Western understanding of the deep history of philosophy is severely hampered by the lack of
scholarship in English and other European languages, the loss of collective cultural knowledge exacerbated by
colonialism, and the sometimes deliberate destruction of historical records, such as the burning of the Library
of Alexandria. As a result, research has relied heavily on oral traditions or the rediscovery and translation of
written evidence. The philosophical legacy of ancient Egypt is discussed in the chapter on classical philosophy.
This chapter will examine research into ethnophilosophy from other regions of Africa.

The seizure of the city of Ceuta, bordering present-day Morocco, by the Portuguese in 1415 marks the first
attempts by Europeans to colonize Africa. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European nations were
engaging in what is called the "scramble for Africa." Prior to this period, European settlement in Africa had
been limited by the mosquito-borne disease malaria, the inappropriateness of African terrain to equine
(horse-based) conquest, and the power of strong coastal states. European nations now gained access to the
interior of Africa with the help of the discovery of quinine to treat malaria and the development of mechanized
vehicles and advanced weaponry. During the colonial era, young Africans identified as having intellectual
promise were sent to study at European universities, where they read Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and other
Western philosophers. Whether the intent was to help these communities enter the modern age or to create
local administrations that would further the interests of Western parties--or both--the result was the failure to
preserve knowledge about the history and thought of localities and regions.
78 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

      In later decades, some Western-educated Africans began to engage directly with African philosophies. In 1910,
      Congolese philosopher Stefano Kaoze (c. 1885-1951) described the thought of the Bantu people pertaining to
      moral values, knowledge, and God in an essay entitled "The Psychology of the Bantus" (Dübgen and Skupien,
     2019). Bantu is a blanket term for hundreds of different ethnic groups in Central and Southern African that
      speak what are referred to as Bantu languages and share many cultural features (see Figure 3.2). In later
      writings, Kaoze explored other African thought systems, arguing that these systems had much to teach
      Western thought systems grounded in Christianity (Nkulu Kabamba and Mpala Mbabula 2017).

      FIGURE 3.2 Approximate territory of Bantu peoples. Bantu is a blanket term for hundreds of different ethnic groups
      that speak what are referred to as Bantu languages and share many cultural features. (attribution: Copyright Rice
      University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
     It was not until 1945, when Belgian missionary Placide Tempels (1906-1977) published Bantu Philosophy,
      that the topic of African philosophy gained significant attention in the West. Tempels rejected the
      characterization of African philosophy and theology as consisting of magic, animism, and ancestor worship,
      instead exploring the richness of Bantu thought pertaining to individuals, society, and the divine. Tempels
      described Bantu peoples as believing in a "vital force," the source of which is God. He observed that what
      Western thinkers envisioned as a divine being, the Bantu understood as various forces, including human
      forces, animal forces, and mineral forces. They viewed the universe as comprising all of these forces, and these
      forces could directly impact the "life force" of an individual (Okafor 1982, 84).
      Later African scholars and theologians, such John Mbiti (1931-2019) and Alexis Kagame (1912-1981),
      indicated that Tempels was somewhat inventive in his descriptions and interpretations. They engaged in a
      more authentic study of Bantu philosophy, recording and analyzing African proverbs, stories, art, and music to
      illuminate what they presented as a shared worldview. One example of this shared worldview is the Zulu term
     ubuntu, which can be translated as "humanity." Variations on the term appear in many other Bantu languages,
      all referring to a similar concept, expressed through maxims such as "I am because we are." The concept of
     ubuntu holds that human beings have a deep natural interdependence, to the point that we are mutually
     dependent on one another even for our existence. The notion of ubuntu has inspired a uniquely African
      approach to communitarian philosophy, which refers to ideas about politics and society that privilege the
      community over the individual.
      Nigerian philosopher Sophie Olúwlé (1935-2018) was a practitioner and scholar of Yoruba philosophy. The
      Yoruba are a prominent ethnic group in Nigeria and other locations in sub-Saharan Africa. Among other

accomplishments, Olúwlé translated the Odu Ifá, the oral history concerning the pantheon and divination
system of Ifá, the religion of the Yoruba peoples. Olúwlé proposed that Orunmila, the high priest featured in
the Odu Ifá, was a historical figure and the first Yoruba philosopher. She argued that Orunmila had an equal
claim to that of Socrates as the founder of philosophy. In Socrates and Orunmila: Two Patron Saints of Classical
Philosophy (2015), Olúwlé compares the two philosophers and finds many similarities. Both are considered
founders of philosophical traditions. Neither wrote anything down during their lifetimes. They both placed a
primacy on the concepts of virtue and learning to live in keeping with virtue. Surprisingly, they shared
cosmological views, such as a belief in reincarnation and predestination. Olúwlé compiled quotes from each
philosopher on specific topics, some of which are listed in Table 3.1. Olúwlé argues that Yoruba ideas as
conveyed through the Odu Ifá should be given full standing as a philosophy.

Topic       Socrates's Quote                               Orunmila's Quote

The nature "But the highest truth is that which is         "Truth is what the Great Invisible God uses in

The limits  "And I am called wise for my hearers           "When they turned to me and said: `Bàbá, we now

Human       "No man voluntarily pursues evil, or that      "No one who knows that the result of honesty is always

TABLE 3.1 Olúwlé's Comparison of Socrates's and Orunmila's Ideas. (source: Olúwlé 2015)

Olúwlé does identify one important distinction between the ideas of Socrates and Orunmila. Socrates held a
binary metaphysical theory of matter and ideas, contrasting the unchanging eternal with the forms in which
the eternal manifests itself in the physical world. By contrast, Orunmila taught that matter and ideas are
inseparable. Similarly, while Socrates distinguished the concepts of good and bad, Orunmila held that they are
"an inseparable pair" (Olúwlé 2015, 64). The strict binary of the Greeks and of the West, Olúwlé concludes,
leads to an either-or perspective on truth and debate. The Yoruba, she contends, maintain a complementary
dualist view of reality.

80 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

      In the 1970s, Kenyan philosopher Henry Odera Oruka (1944-1995) launched a field study to record the
      philosophical thoughts of sages in modern-day Kenya. Researchers interviewed individual thinkers from
      various ethnic groups and questioned them about their views on central concepts in Western philosophy and
      issues related to applied ethics. Among other aims, this project was intended to demonstrate that philosophy is
      not an undertaking that is unique to the literate world. Odera Oruka's findings were published in 1990, but no
      systematic attempt has been made to analyze them (Presbey 2017).

      As these philosophers and their work demonstrate, African philosophy has emerged as a body of thought that
      stands on its own. The philosophy of African peoples, both those living on the African continent and those
      elsewhere in the world, is rooted in and developed out of concepts that both complement and challenge the
      Western tradition.

          CONNECTIONS

      The chapter on classical philosophy discusses Egyptian and Ethiopian philosophers who contributed to the
      development of classical philosophy in the ancient and early modern worlds.

     Indigenous North American Philosophical Thought

      Work on Native American philosophy has expanded in recent years, as philosophers, many of them Native
      American themselves, have engaged in collective research on Native American thought. This work has
      included the development of academic societies and journals devoted to the topic. Like many Indigenous
      African peoples, Native American peoples did not rely on written documents to preserve their history and
      culture but instead preserved knowledge through oral tradition. These oral traditions included rituals,
      ceremonies, songs, stories, and dance. What is known about Native American philosophy comes from this oral
      tradition as well as the experiences and thoughts of contemporary Native American people.

      Any attempt to define Indigenous North American philosophical thought is further complicated by the fact that
      thousands of distinct societies have existed on the continent, each with their own ideas about how the world
      was created, what are the basic elements of reality, what constitutes the self, and other metaphysical issues.
      There is a rich expanse of philosophical views to synthesize--and for every possible generalization, there are
      exceptions. Still, some generalizations of Indigenous North American philosophy are true more often than not.
      One such generalization is the perception that the creative process of the universe is akin to the thought
      process. Another is that more than one being is responsible for the creation of the universe--and that these
      beings do not take on anthropomorphic forms (Forbes 2001).

      Additionally, there are a number of characteristics common to Indigenous North American metaphysical
      concepts. Many Native American peoples, for example, emphasize balance, complementarity, and exchange
      between the different entities that make up the world. For instance, the Diné see breath as a fundamental force
      in nature, with the exchange of the internal and the external passing through all natural processes. Similarly,
      the Zuni note that twins, such as the twin Evening Star and the Morning Star--both of which are actually Venus
      - share a complementary and mirrored existence, serving as a reminder that there can be multiple
      manifestations of the same thing in nature. Additionally, concepts such as gender identity are understood as
      animated, nonbinary, and non-discrete, such that gender may develop and change over time (Waters 2004,
      107). These generalizations point to a Native American metaphysics that is based on animate processes that
      are complementary, interactive, and integrated.

      North American Indigenous peoples also have views of the self that differ from the European tradition. The
      Pueblo possess a sense of personal and community identity shaped by both place and time. Known as a
      transformative model of identity, this social identity is understood to spiral both outward and inward
      through expanding and retracting influences over a certain area of land (Jojola 2004). Extant petroglyphic
      spirals show the migration of a clan outward to the boundaries of its physical and spiritual territory as well as
      the inward journey homeward. These journeys also reflect a temporal component, as they were coordinated

with the cycles of the solstice calendar. Such metaphysical understandings are reflected in the tendency of
many Native American cultures to build moral and ethical concepts on the idea that human beings are
fundamentally social rather than individual--a "we," not an "I."

journeys. The boxy spiral shown here likely represents the path that many Southwestern tribes believe they took
when they emerged from the earth. Many contemporary scholars identify this with the geographic feature of the
Grand Canyon. (credit: "Anasazi Indian Petroglyphs (~600 to 1300 A.D.) (Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, USA)

Mesoamerican Philosophy

Mesoamerican peoples include an array of tribes and cultures, speaking multiple languages, that developed
several sophisticated civilizations between 2000 BCE and the arrival of European colonialists in the 1500s CE.
This area of the world developed both pictographic/hieroglyphic and alphabetic/phonetic forms of writing that
allowed them to record thoughts and ideas, providing modern scholars access to some of the philosophical
reflection that occurred within these societies. This section will examine some examples of the thought of
Mesoamerican peoples by looking at the preserved writings of the Maya and the Aztec. Though the
philosophical thought of each civilization is examined as if it were uniform, note that each encompassed many
diverse tribes and cultures with a variety of languages, cultural practices, and religious beliefs.

      Mayan Writings
      The Maya first settled in villages in the area that runs from southern Mexico through Guatemala and northern
      Belize around 1500 BCE. Between 750 and 500 BCE, large city-states arose and established a trading network.
      At the height of their civilization, between approximately 250 CE and 900 CE, the Maya possessed a written
      language that appears to have been a combination of an alphabetic/phonetic language and a pictographic/
      hieroglyphic language, used not only by the priesthood but also by the urban elite. This writing appears on
     stone slabs, pottery, and sculptures as well as in books called codices (plural of codex), written on a paper
      made from tree bark.
      The Maya possessed advanced knowledge of mathematics and natural philosophy. However, following the
      Spanish conquest of this territory, Catholic priests burned almost all of the Maya codices as well as their
     scientific and technical manuals (Yucatan Times 2019). In the years that followed the conquest, the Maya lost
      their written language. However, some writings in clay did survive, providing scholars a glimpse into Maya
      thought. They implemented a numerical system using symbols that allowed for representation of very large
      numbers, and they may have been the first to use the number 0 in mathematics. This numerical system
      enabled the Maya to gain insights into arithmetic and geometry that surpassed those of the Egyptians. Their
      knowledge of astronomy was so advanced that they could correctly predict the timing of solar eclipses. Unlike
      other early civilizations, the Maya had a highly sophisticated calendar and a unique conception of time.

Maya Calendar
The Maya developed a calendar that tracked many cycles simultaneously, including the solar year and the
"calendar round," a period of 52 years. The calendar played a central role in Maya rituals and sacred
celebrations. Astronomical events, in particular the position of Venus relative to the sun and moon, have been
noted to align with the dates of historical battles, causing some to hypothesize that the Maya may have
scheduled battles to coincide with these cycles. The Maya placed great importance on customs and rituals
surrounding the solar calendar. Using these calendars, the Maya were able to record complex histories of their
civilization.
Maya Concept of Time and Divinity
The Maya had a complex understanding of time. They recognized an experiential or existential aspect of
time--for instance, observing that disinterest or concentration can elongate or shorten time. The experience of
"awe" was considered particularly important because of its ability to bring a person into the present moment,
increasing their awareness of the immediate effect of fundamental forces such as the energy of the sun and
making them more capable of clear thinking, decision-making, and understanding.
Although the Maya worshipped an array of gods, they believed in a single godlike force, the sun's force or
energy, called K'in. This force was understood in terms of the position of the sun relative to the planets and the
moon during different periods of the calendar. The king served as a conduit through which this divine force,
the solar energy, passed to subjects. The Maya also believed that time is the expression of K'in. The ability of
rulers and priests to predict natural events, such as an eclipse or the coming of spring, and thus seemingly to
control time served to secure the allegiance of their subjects and legitimized their rule.
Aztec Metaphysical Thought
For the Aztecs, the fundamental and total character of the universe was captured by the concept of teotl, a
godlike force or energy that is the basis for all reality. They considered this energy to be a sacred source fueling
all life, actions, and desires as well as the motion and power of inanimate objects. In this sense, Aztec
metaphysics adopted a view of the world that was pantheistic and monist, meaning that it viewed all reality as
composed of a single kind of thing and that thing was divine in nature. However, teotl is not an agent or moral
force, like the Abrahamic God, but rather a power or energy that is entirely amoral.
Teotl is not a static substance but a process through which nature unfolds. It changes continually and develops
through time toward an endpoint or goal, a view that philosophers call teleological. For the Aztecs, time was
not linear but rather cyclical. Thus, even though teotl tends toward an end point and there is an end of
humanity and Earth as we know it, from the point of view of the universe, this is part of a cycle, just like leaves
84 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

     fall from trees before winter. Moreover, because teotl is both the matter from which everything in the universe
      is made and the force by which things are created, change, and move, it is an all-encompassing, dynamic, and
      immanent force within nature (Maffie 2013).

     Teotl has three different shapes, aspects, or manifestations, each with different characteristics, including
     different motions, powers, and goals. These three aspects of teotl have been assigned metaphorical positions
      related to weaving, aligning an important cultural practice of the Aztecs with their conception of fundamental
      reality.

      Aztec Epistemological Thought

      Philosophers use the term epistemology to refer to the study of knowledge involving questions such as how we
      know what we know, what is the nature of true knowledge, and what are the limits to what humans can know.
      Aztec epistemology understood the concept of knowledge and truth as "well-rootedness." To say that someone
      knows or understands the truth is to say that they are well-grounded or stably founded in reality. The Aztecs
      understood truth not in reference to some belief or proposition of reality but as a property of one's character
      when one is well-grounded. Being well-grounded means understanding the ways reality presents itself and
      being capable of acting according to what reality dictates. Being well-rooted in reality allows one to grow and
      develop, following the metaphor of a plant that is able to thrive because of its well-rootedness in the soil. This
      concept has both an epistemological aspect (relating to knowledge) and an ethical aspect (providing the means
      by which people may flourish).

     In Aztec culture, rooting oneself in the constantly changing and growing power of teotl was considered
      necessary because existence on Earth was considered to be "slippery," meaning that it is part of a process of
      cyclic change that is constantly evolving. The fundamental question for human beings is, How does one
      maintain balance on the slippery earth? This question motivates the need to develop the type of character that
      allows one to remain well-rooted and to find stability and balance, given the shifting and changing nature of
      Earth.

      wisdom that "the earth is slippery, slick." In response to this state of affairs, Aztec thinkers advocated for living a

    3.2 Classical Indian Philosophy

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Identify key Indian metaphysical concepts.
        · Distinguish between major schools of Indian thought.
        · Compare and contrast Indian philosophical writings with other areas of philosophy.

      The philosophical depth and richness of Indian philosophy rivals that of European philosophy, and to do
      justice to it would require a book-length survey. Still, this introductory discussion is intended to show the
      richness of various Indian philosophical traditions that are more ancient than the Greek origins of European
      philosophy. Beginning with the Vedic texts, which date from between the seventh and sixth centuries BCE,
      Indian philosophical traditions are a few centuries older than the earliest European philosophical traditions.

                                                                                                                                              3.2 · Classical Indian Philosophy 85

An important parallel between Greek and Roman philosophy and Indian philosophy lies in their respective
conceptions of philosophy. Philosophers from both of these traditions understand philosophy as something
more than a theoretical activity. For all of these ancient philosophical traditions, philosophy is a practical
endeavor. It is a way of life.

The Vedic Tradition

The earliest philosophical texts in India constitute the Vedic tradition. The four Vedas are the oldest of the
Hindu scriptures. They are the Rigveda, the Samaveda, the Yajurveda, and the Atharvaveda. The four Vedas
were composed between 1500 and 900 BCE by the Indo-Aryan tribes that had settled in northern India. The
Vedas are also called Shruti, which means "hearing" in Sanskrit. This is because for hundreds of years, the
Vedas were recited orally. Hindus believe that the Vedas were divinely inspired; priests were orally
transmitting the divine word through the generations.

The Rigveda is the most ancient of the four Vedic texts. The text is a collection of the "family books" of 10 clans,
each of which were reluctant to part with their secret ancestral knowledge. However, when the Kuru monarchs
unified these clans, they organized and codified this knowledge around 1200 BCE. The Brahmanic, or priestly,
culture arose under the Kuru dynasty (Witzel 1997) and produced the three remaining Vedas. The Samaveda
contains many of the Rigveda hymns but ascribes to those hymns melodies so that they can be chanted. The
Yajurveda contains hymns that accompany rites of healing and other types of rituals. These two texts shine
light on the history of Indo-Aryans during the Vedic period, the deities they worshipped, and their ideas about
the nature of the world, its creation, and humans. The Atharvaveda incorporates rituals that reveal the daily
customs and beliefs of the people, including their traditions surrounding birth and death. This text also
contains philosophical speculation about the purpose of the rituals (Witzel 1997).

The Later Texts and Organization

Later Hindu texts developed during the Vedic and post-Vedic periods were integrated into the four Vedas such
that each Veda now consists of four sections: (1) the Samhitas, or mantras and benedictions--the original
hymns of the Vedas; (2) the Aranyakas, or directives about rituals and sacrifice; (3) the Brahmanas, or
commentaries on these rituals; and (4) the Upanishads, which consists of two Indian epics as well as
philosophical reflections.

The Upanishad epics include the Bhagavad Gita (Song of the Lord), which is part of a much longer poem called
the Mahabharata, and the Ramayana. The Mahabharata is an epic depicting the battles of the noble house of
Bharata, while the Ramayana focuses on the ancient king Rama during his 14-year exile. There are 13
principal Upanishads and more than 100 minor ones, composed between 800 and 200 BCE in a mix of prose
and verse. Upanishad derives from the Sanskrit words upa (near), ni (down), and shad (to sit), which comes
from the fact that these texts were taught to students who sat at their teachers' feet. Additionally, the term
signifies that these texts reveal esoteric doctrines about the true nature of reality beyond the realm of sense
perception. The Upanishads became the philosophical core of Hinduism.

Metaphysical Thought in the Vedic Texts

The Vedic texts state that through reflection on the self, one comes to understand the cosmos. Like the Greeks
much later, these texts claim that there is a structural analogy between the self and the universe, with one
sharing the form of the other. Through inner reflection on oneself, one can then understand the nature of the
world.
86 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

      FIGURE 3.6 The Vedic texts state that reflection on the self can lead to knowledge of the cosmos, proposing that
      the two share the same form. (credit: "Nightfall" by Mike Lewinski/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     The Rigveda examines the origin of the universe and asks whether the gods created humanity or humans
      created the gods--a question that would later be posed by the Greek philosopher Xenophanes. More than half
     of the verses in the Rigveda are devoted to metaphysical speculation concerning cosmological theories and the
      relationship between the individual and the universe. The idea that emerges within Hinduism is that the
      universe is cyclical in nature. The cycle of the seasons and the cyclical nature of other natural processes are
      understood to mirror the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth among humans and other animals. Related to this
      conception is the philosophical question of how one puts an end to this cycle. The Hindus suggest that the
      answer lies in purification, with ascetic rituals provided as means to achieve freedom from the cycle of
      reincarnation.
      Another area of similarity between the universe and humanity is that both are understood to have a
      hierarchical structure. Hindu theology assigns a rigid hierarchy to the cosmos, with the triple deity, Vishnu,
      Brahma, and Shiva, standing above the other gods. India first developed its hierarchical caste system during
      the Vedic period. Vedic rituals cemented caste hierarchies, the remnants of which still structure Indian society
      today.

     Classical Indian Darshanas

     The word darshana derives from a Sanskrit word meaning "to view." In Hindu philosophy, darshana refers to
      the beholding of a god, a holy person, or a sacred object. This experience is reciprocal: the religious believer
      beholds the deity and is beheld by the deity in turn. Those who behold the sacred are blessed by this
     encounter. The term darshana is also used to refer to six classical schools of thought based on views or
      manifestations of the divine--six ways of seeing and being seen by the divine. The six principal orthodox
     Hindu darshanas are Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa, and Vedanta. Non-Hindu or heterodox
     darshanas include Buddhism and Jainism.
      Samkhya
     Samkhya is a dualistic school of philosophy that holds that everything is composed of purusha (pure, absolute
     consciousness) and prakriti (matter). An evolutionary process gets underway when purusha comes into
     contact with prakriti. These admixtures of mind and matter produce more or less pure things such as the

human mind, the five senses, the intellect, and the ego as well as various manifestations of material things.
Living beings occur when purusha and prakriti bond together. Liberation finally occurs when mind is freed
from the bondage of matter.

     CONNECTIONS

The chapter on metaphysics explores Hindu and Buddhist views of self that emerged from Samkhya
metaphysics.

Western readers should take care not to reduce Samkhya's metaphysics and epistemology to the various
dualistic systems seen in, for example, the account of the soul in Plato's Phaedo or in Christian metaphysics
more generally. The metaphysical system of creation in Samkhya is much more complex than either of these
Western examples.
When purusha first focuses on prakriti, buddhi, or spiritual awareness, results. Spiritual awareness gives rise
to the individualized ego or I-consciousness that creates five gross elements (space, air, earth, fire, water) and
then five fine elements (sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste). These in turn give rise to the five sense organs,
the five organs of activity (used to speak, grasp, move, procreate, and evacuate), and the mind that coordinates
them.

terms for various poses, the movement has largely lost its cultural and spiritual vitality as it has become
popular in the West. It originally developed during the Vedic period and influenced Buddhist meditation
practices.

First mentioned in the Rigveda, Yoga is the mental process through which an individual's soul joins with the
supreme soul. Originally a part of the Samkhya school, it emerged as a practice during the first millennium
BCE. The teachings of the sage Patanjali, who lived circa 400 BCE, regarding ancient Yoga traditions and
beliefs were compiled into approximately 200 Yoga sutras. The purpose of Yoga is the stopping of the
movement of thought. Only then do individuals encounter their true selves, and only then is the distinction
between the observer and that which is being observed overcome (Rodrigues 2018).

Yoga involves eight limbs. The first involves the observance of the yamas, moral restraints that keep
individuals from being violent, lying, stealing, hoarding, and squandering vital energies (often interpreted as a
practice of celibacy). The second limb consists of personal codes of conduct, known as the niyamas--purity,
discipline, self-study, contentment (gratitude and nonattachment), and surrender to the higher being. The
third and fourth limbs, familiar to Western practitioners, are the postures, asana, and breath control,
pranayama. The fifth and sixth limbs involve the mastering of the senses needed to achieve a peaceful mind
and focus, the ability to concentrate deeply on one thing--a mental image, a word, or a spot on the wall
(Showkeir and Showkeir 2013). The seventh limb involves meditation, which allows one to reach the eight
limb, samadhi, the oneness of the self and true reality, the supreme soul.

During the Upanishadic period (900-200 BCE), Yoga was incorporated into the new philosophic traditions that
gave rise to Jainism and Buddhism. Yoga influenced the emergence of Bhakti and Sufism within Islamic
culture in the 15th century CE following the conquest of India by Islamic leaders. New schools and theories of
Yoga evolved. Swami Vivekananda's translations of scriptures into English facilitated the spread of Yoga in the
West in the 19th century. Today, Yoga is practiced as a form of spirituality across the globe (Pradhan 2015).

Nyaya

Nyaya, which can be translated as "method" or "rule," focuses on logic and epistemology. Scholars seek to
develop four of the Hindu pramanas, or proofs, as reliable ways of gaining knowledge: perception, inference,
comparison, and testimony. Practitioners seek liberation from suffering through right knowledge. They believe
that everything that exists could be directly perceived and understood if only one had the proper method for
doing so. False knowledge is delusion that precludes purification and enlightenment.

Vaisheshika

The Vaisheshika system developed independently of Nyaya but gradually came to share many of its core ideas.
Its epistemology is simpler, allowing for only perception and inference as forms of reliable knowledge. It is
known for its naturalism, and scholars of the Vaisheshika school developed a form of atomism. The atoms
themselves are understood to be indestructible in their pure state, but as they enter into combinations with
one another, these mixtures can be decomposed. Members of the Vaisheshika school believe that only
complete knowledge can lead to purification and liberation.

Mimamsa

The Mimamsa school was one of the earliest philosophical schools of Hinduism, grounded in the
interpretation of the Vedic texts. It seeks to investigate dharma, or the duties, rituals, and norms present in
society. The gods themselves are irrelevant to this endeavor, so there are both theistic and atheistic aspects of
this school. Scholars of the Mimamsa school carefully investigate language because they believe that language
prescribes how humans ought to behave.

Vedanta

Vedanta comprises a number of schools that focus on the Upanishads, and the term itself signifies the end or
culmination of the Vedas. All the various Vedanta schools hold that brahman exists as the unchanging cause of
90 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

     the universe. The self is the agent of its own acts (karma), and each agent gets their due as a result of karma. As
      with the other Hindu schools, adherents of Vedanta seek liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth.

      Like many philosophical traditions, classical Indian philosophy casts the living world as something to
      ultimately escape. Practices and teachings such as Yoga provide a particularly explicit set of instructions on
      how one might go about achieving this transcendent aim. The incorporation of these teachings into other
      traditions and cultures, in both the past and the present, points to their broad and enduring appeal.

    3.3 Classical Chinese Philosophy

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Distinguish the three main schools of classical Chinese philosophy: Confucianism, Mohism, and Daoism.
        · Explain the five constant virtues of Confucian moral philosophy.
        · Identify the key principles of Mohism.
        · Evaluate Daoism's approach to ethics.

      In 2013, archaeologists made a remarkable discovery--Chinese characters on a stone axe dating to 5,000 years
      ago (Tang 2013). Previously, the earliest known Chinese characters had been dated to approximately 1600
      BCE. The stone axe suggests that a written language was in use much earlier than previously thought.

      The first written records referring to names, dates, and accounts that were part of Chinese prehistory, like the
      details of other prehistoric periods around the world, are unverifiable. But this discovery of very early writing
      suggests that what were once considered myths of Chinese history may have a basis in reality. The so-called
      Five Emperors and the great leaders Yao, Shun, and Yu are frequently referenced in early writings. These great
      leaders are identified as sages and are said to have invented the key tools for agrarian civilization, including
      traps, nets, the plow, and river dams to provide a stable water supply.

          CONNECTIONS

      Read more about the role of sages in the chapter on introduction to philosophy.

      That early sages were rulers and inventors of key technological advances is typical of Chinese thought, which
      emphasizes the practical importance of wisdom. Classical Chinese philosophers were less interested in
      questions of epistemology and logic; instead, the most enduring impact of classical Chinese philosophy
      pertained to ethics. Chinese philosophers were less concerned with bridging the gap between internal thought
      (subjectivity) and the external world (objectivity) than with understanding how the individual fits in a larger
      social system so that each may act in the best possible way. This section will examine how the main schools of
      Chinese philosophy--Confucianism, Daoism, and Mohism--address these questions.

     Early Chinese Philosophical Thought prior to Confucius

      Philosophical thought in China initially developed during an epoch known as the Spring and Autumn period,
      between the eighth and fifth centuries BCE. The period gets its name from a historical document attributed to
     Confucius called the Spring and Autumn Annals. This period was characterized by the rise of a sophisticated
      feudal system and relative stability in Chinese politics. Despite advances in government, agriculture, art, and
      culture, the earliest Chinese texts reveal a concern with the supernatural and highlight the connections that
      were thought to exist between human beings and the spiritual realm. Great rulers governed not only the affairs
      of human beings but also the spiritual forces that influence human affairs (Fung 1952). Similarly, the arts of
      divination, astrology, and magic were celebrated as evidence of the capacity of some human beings to
      manipulate spiritual forces to benefit humanity.

      Magical and mystical thinking of this early period was connected to scientific and philosophical thought. For
      instance, it was thought that there were five fundamental elements: earth, wood, metal, fire, and water. It was

believed that there was connection between these five elements and the five visible planets (Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) as well as the five constant virtues (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom,
and trustworthiness). The connections between human virtues, the planets, and the material elements
provided some rational basis for belief in spiritual and magical forces (Fung 1952).

Emperor" by Gan Bozong/Wellcome Collection, Public Domain)
Early Chinese writings often refer to the concept of heaven in opposition to the earth, but the word has a
meaning that is likely unfamiliar to a modern Western audience. In these texts, the word heaven might refer to
a material or physical space, like the sky; a ruling or presiding power, like the emperor; something over which
human beings have no control, like fate; nature as a whole; or a moral principle guiding human action. Some of
these resemble the familiar Western religious concept, but others are quite different. Nonetheless, records of
great speeches in the Zuozhuan suggest that even in the sixth century BCE, leading thinkers of the period
encouraged people to move away from a concern with heavenly matters and toward a greater interest in
human affairs on Earth (Fung 1952).
Writings from this period also show the beginnings of the theory of yin and yang, the two fundamental forces
that are characterized as male and female, or dark and light, or inactivity and activity. The move toward a
theory that explains natural phenomena through fundamental forces rather than through spiritual or heavenly
forces characterizes a shift from a more mythological and religious age to a more rational and philosophical
age.
Another key concern of early Chinese texts is distinguishing between identity and harmony, where harmony is
understood to produce new things, while identity does not. The point seems to be that whereas the same
matter or form repeated does not generate anything novel, two or more different things, when combined
together in a harmonious way, can produce something new. To illustrate, consider the fact that there is no
music if there is only one note, but many different notes in harmony with one another can produce beautiful
92 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

      melodies. A wise and powerful ruler combines elements in harmonious ways to influence their citizens and
      exercise their power. Whether the elements are five tastes; five colors; the six notes of the pitch pipe; the
      ingredients of soup; the forces of wind, weather, or seasons; or the five virtues, a wise leader institutes a
      harmonious relation between these elements, and that relation is what is said to be responsible for the leader's
      success.

     Confucianism

      Confucius (551-479 BCE) was the founder of Confucianism, a philosophy that has influenced society, politics,
      and culture in East Asia for more than 2,000 years. Confucius lived just before the beginning of what is called
      the Warring States period, a time in Chinese history plagued with violence and instability. Though not a
      member of the aristocracy, Confucius rose from lowly positions to become the minister of justice of Lu, a
      province in eastern China. He challenged three powerful families that were trying to wrest control of the
      government. After a clash, Confucius left his home with a small group of followers, hoping to serve as an
      adviser for rulers in other provinces. After 14 years, he returned to Lu and was able to provide some advice to
      government ministers, but he never achieved his goal of finding a leader to carry out his ideas (Huang 2013).
      Confucius is credited with authoring or editing the Chinese classical texts that became the core educational
      curriculum for hundreds of years, though it was only after his death that Emperor Wudi of the Han dynasty
      first adopted Confucianism as the official state ideology.

      One measure of the immediate impact of Confucius's success is that he spawned an entire class of scholars
     known as shih, who were trained in classical studies and language and were only suited for teaching and
      government work. They maintained their livelihood through a system of patronage. This system has had an
      enduring impact in China. Contemporary exams for government officials include testing on traditional
      knowledge about classical Chinese philosophy and literature (Fung 1952).

      Though Confucius was labeled an atheist and considered an innovator, he was in other ways culturally
      conservative. He believed in a well-ordered society where rules and guidance come from the very top (the
      emperor or "the heavens," as it may be). Scholars today identify Confucianism as a form of virtue ethics
      because it is an approach to ethics that focuses on personal virtue or character.

      Benevolence and Reciprocity

     The Confucian concept of de is closely related to moral virtue in the sense that de identifies characteristics of a
      person, understood to be formed through habitual action, that make it more likely the person will act in
     morally excellent ways. In Confucianism, the five constant virtues are ren, yi, li, zhi, and xin. Each of these
      terms is difficult to translate consistently, having varied meanings. Loose translations are sometimes given as
     follows: ren is benevolence, yi is righteousness, li is propriety, zhi is wisdom, and xin is trustworthiness. More
     broadly, ren means something like shared humanity, empathy, or care for others. Similarly, the
     institutionalized rituals of the Zhou dynasty are captured in the Chinese word li, which is translated as both
      propriety and ritual. Though Confucius emphasized the importance of ritual and tradition in daily practice, he
      also recognized that such actions are empty if they do not have a solid foundation in benevolence. These terms
     can be seen related in the following passage: "If a man is not ren [benevolent], what can he do with li [ritual]? If
     a man is not ren, what can he do with music?" (Confucius 2015, p. 9, 3.3).

      To emphasize the relational and communal character of Confucian ethics, it is worth noting that alongside the
      five virtues, Confucius highlights three fundamental bonds or relationships: father and son, lord and retainer,
      and husband and wife. These bonds designate the fundamental relationships that are necessary for social life
      (Knapp 2009, 2252). The ethical obligations of children to their parents are frequently captured in the notion

                                                                                                                                            3.3 · Classical Chinese Philosophy 93

of filial piety, or simply filiality, which is a widespread Chinese value. Even though Confucius emphasizes that
there is a subordinate relation between sons and their fathers, wives and their husbands, and subjects and
their lords, he also recognizes that the superior party has obligations to the subordinate one. These obligations
can be characterized by the virtue of benevolence, wherein the good and upstanding person demonstrates
goodwill toward those with whom they have relations. Whereas the virtue of benevolence emphasizes the
common humanity of all people and seems to advise a common concern for all, filial piety introduces the idea
of care with distinctions, where the moral and right thing to do is to show compassion to all human beings but
to recognize that some people are owed more than others. In the case above, Confucius clearly advises that
greater concern is due to one's family members, then to one's local community, and finally to the state.

An important concept in Confucianism is zhong, usually translated as "loyalty." Later commentators have
defined zhong as "the `exhaustion of one's self' in the performance of one's moral duties" (Fung 1952, 71); it
might also be translated as conscientiousness or devotion. Another related virtue is reciprocity. Confucius
explains reciprocity with a version of the Golden Rule: "Zigong asked, `I[s] there a single saying that one may
put into practice all one's life?' The Master said, `That would be "reciprocity": That which you do not desire, do
not do to others'" (Confucius 2015, p. 85, 15.24).

Each of these virtues is identified as fundamental, but they all are expressions of the underlying virtue of
benevolence. The importance of benevolence runs through the relational and community-driven nature of
Confucian ethics. This is quite different from Western ethics, particularly modern Western ethics, which
emphasizes the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of individuals.

Wisdom and the Dao

The Chinese concept of dao is another difficult-to-translate term. Often, it is interpreted as "way" or "path,"
but in Confucius, it is just as frequently translated as "teaching." One can see the goal of Confucius's teaching
as relating a way or pattern of behavior that could be adopted by careful students. The wisdom gained through
reading and, more importantly, living according to the dao is a kind of natural awareness of what is good and
right and a distaste for what is wrong. Confucius also recognizes that a rejection of materiality is a sign of one
who follows the dao. He frequently cites poverty, the ability to enjoy simple foods, and a lack of concern for the
trappings of wealth as signs of one who is devoted to the right path or right ethical teachings.

Propriety and Junzi

One of the five constant virtues is propriety, in the sense of following the appropriate rituals in the appropriate
contexts. Rituals include wearing ceremonial dress, reading and reciting the classic poetry of the Shijing,
playing music, and studying culture. However, Confucius also makes clear that the foundations of ritual lie in
filial respect for parents and elders, demonstrating care and trustworthiness, and having good relations with
people in general (Confucius 2015, pp. 1-2, 1.6). Acting according to propriety or ritual is connected to the idea
of the junzi, a person who represents the goal or standard of ethical action and acts as a model for others. One
can observe key characteristics of virtue by listening to Confucius's description of the junzi. For instance, he
suggests that a junzi is someone who is thoughtful, but decisive: "The junzi wishes to be slow of speech and
quick in action" (Confucius 2015, p. 17, 4.24). Similarly, Confucius frequently comments on the lack of
material desires or a rejection of material wealth as a sign of the junzi's virtue: "The junzi does not hem his
upper robes with crimson or maroon. He does not employ red or purple for leisure clothes. In hot weather, he
always wears a singlet of fine or coarse hemp as an outer garment." (Confucius 2015, p. 47, 10.6).

These virtuous characteristics are connected to propriety and one's obligations toward others in interesting
ways. Confucius articulates what is required in order to become a junzi as an ordered series of obligations. The
best and highest sense of a junzi is one who serves their lord faithfully and without shame, the next best is one
who is thought to be filial by their local community, and the least of the junzi is one who can keep their word
and follow through on their actions. This suggests that personal responsibilities to others--keeping one's word
and following through on one's actions--are the minimum, most basic requirements for being a junzi; next is
94 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

      being known as one who is respectful of one's parents and elders in one's local community, and greater than
      that is being loyal and trustworthy to the regional government.

     In a famous passage on filial piety, Confucius introduces a potential moral dilemma for the junzi: "The Lord of
      She instructed Confucius, saying, `There is an upright man in my district. His father stole a sheep, and he
      testified against him.' Confucius said, `The upright men in my district are different. Fathers cover up for their
      sons and sons cover up for their fathers. Uprightness lies therein'" (Confucius 2015, p. 70, 13.18). Here,
      Confucius suggests that the appropriate way to resolve the dilemma is to favor familial relations over relations
      with the state. This is consistent with the previous passage, where Confucius suggests that good family
      relations are the most necessary relations to maintain, while relations with the state are the highest relations.
      What Confucius means is that it is a sign of the highest standards of conduct that one can act in accordance
      with his obligations to the state, but it is essential for one to maintain obligations to family, so if the two are in
     conflict, then the junzi should uphold the relations within the family.

              THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

      Consider the moral dilemma presented here. One of your parents has stolen money from their employer, and you are
      approached by law enforcement asking what you know about the theft. Do you lie to protect your parent, or do you
      tell the truth? Which is the more ethical thing to do? Confucius gives one answer here, but philosophy texts
     elsewhere offer other answers. For instance, Plato's Euthyphro dialogue begins with Euthyphro telling Socrates that
      he is prosecuting his father for killing a worker in his fields, claiming that the pious thing to do is to prosecute people
      who commit murder no matter who they are. Socrates is shocked to hear this and questions Euthyphro on the
      nature of piety. What do you think? If your obligation to protect a parent is in conflict with your obligation to tell the
      truth about a theft and follow the law, which obligation do you choose to uphold? Why?

      The Legacy of Confucius

      It is difficult to overstate the importance of Confucius for Chinese culture, philosophy, and history. After his
      death, many of Confucius's disciples became influential teachers. The greatest among them were Mencius
      (372-289 BCE) and Xunzi (c. 310-c. 235 BCE).

      Mencius expanded and developed Confucius's teachings, spreading the ideas of Confucianism more widely
      and securing the philosophical foundations of Confucius's legacy. One of the doctrines for which he is best
      known is the idea that human beings are innately benevolent and have tendencies toward the five constant
      virtues. This view led Mencius to argue, for instance, that human beings have a natural disposition toward
      concern for a child in need or an obviously suffering human being or animal. In one famous example, he
      argues that all human beings have hearts that are "not unfeeling toward others":

            Suppose someone suddenly saw a child about to fall into a well: anyone in such a situation would have
            a feeling of alarm and compassion--not because one sought to get in good with the child's parents, not
            because one wanted fame among one's neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike the
            sound of the child's cries. (quoted in Van Norden 2019)

      Given that human beings are innately good, it remains for them to develop the appropriate knowledge of how
      to act on that goodness in order to become virtuous. In order to do so, Mencius encourages people to engage in
      reflection and the extension of their natural compassion for some to others. For instance, in one account, he
      tries to convince a king to care for his subjects by reminding the king of a time he felt compassion for an ox
      that was being led to slaughter. The reflection necessary for extending one's compassion from those for whom
      one naturally feels compassion to others requires an awareness that is grounded in practical motivation. In
      this sense, Mencius holds that virtue is the result of knowledge grounded in the caring motivations and
      relations that individuals have with one another. He locates this grounding in a process of reflection that, he
      says, is the natural function of the heart.

                                                                                                                                            3.3 · Classical Chinese Philosophy 95

By contrast with Mencius, Xunzi held that human beings have an innately detestable nature but that they have
the capacity to become good through artifice--that is, by acquiring traits and habits through deliberate action.
Unlike Mencius, Xunzi did not believe that goodness came from reflection on one's innate tendency toward
compassion. Rather, he held that one's innate emotional attachments would lead one to harmful behavior
toward others, but through teaching in accordance with Confucian principles, one can become virtuous and
ultimately transform those innate tendencies into something beneficial for humankind. This difference in
perspective led Xunzi to emphasize the importance of external forces to guide behavior. He thought that the
best guide toward virtue was the rituals that were handed down by ancient sages. Along these lines, Xunzi
emphasizes the importance of music for developing an appreciation for ritual. Ultimately, rituals are the
signposts that help mark the way, which flows from the constant and enduring guidance of heaven. Here, Xunzi
returns to Confucius's appreciation for tradition (Goldin 2018).
Long after Confucius's death, in the eighth century CE, a new school of Chinese philosophy known as Neo-
Confucianism became prominent. Thinkers such as Han Yu and Li Ao reinvigorated classical Confucianism
with less emphasis on tradition and religion and a greater emphasis on reason and humanism. Neo-
Confucianism engages critically and seriously with the traditions of Buddhism and Taoism, which had become
prominent in Chinese thought. These schools of thought are distinct from Confucius's own philosophy, but
they explicitly link their ideas with his. Classical Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism continue to influence
modern philosophical writing in China, and their influence extends even beyond China, to Korea, Japan, and
Vietnam.

many elements of what most consider a religion. This contemporary Confucian temple in Urumqi, Xinjiang, China,
features shrines, altars, and spaces for offerings. (credit: "Confucian Temple" by David Stanley/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Confucius remains a central and celebrated cultural figure in China. His teachings have produced a following
that at times resembles a religion. The degree to which Confucianism is entrenched in Chinese political and
cultural life suggests that it performs the function of what has been called a "civil religion"--namely, a set of
cultural ideals without the specific doctrinal components that typically characterize religion that nevertheless
provides a common basis for moral norms and standards of conduct in political speech and political life
(Bellah 1967).

Daoism

The dao as a philosophical concept or a school of philosophical thought is associated primarily with the texts
the Daodejing, commonly attributed to Laozi or the "Old Master," and the Zhuangzi, attributed to Zhuangzi (c.
96 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

      fourth century BCE). Many contemporary scholars question whether Laozi actually existed. It is likely that both
      texts are collections of writings from a variety of thinkers who belonged to a common school known as
      Daoism. Daoism is a belief system developed in ancient China that encourages the practice of living in
     accordance with the dao, the natural way of the universe and all things. Daoism is associated with a
      countercultural religious movement in ancient China, contrary to the dominant, traditionalist Confucianism.
      The religious movement of Daoism varied depending on the region, but the unifying theme among Daoist
      religions is a focus on a naturalistic, nontheological view of the underlying basis for morality and goodness.
     Part of the attraction and variability of Daoism is the fact that the dao is commonly understood to be empty of
      content, equally open to interpretation by anyone. This perspective leads to a kind of anarchism, resisting
      traditional hierarchies and authorities.

     Daoism is highly critical of Confucianism, as can be seen from passages such as the following in the Doadejing:
     "When the Great Dao was discarded, only then came ren and right. When wisdom and insight emerged, only
      then came the Great Artifice. When the six kinship classes fell out of harmony, only then came filiality and
      parental kindness. When the state is darkened with chaos, only then do the loyal ministers appear" (Eno 2010,
      p. 15, 18). Here, the author criticizes the five constant virtues of Confucius by suggesting that these emerged
     only after China had lost its way and been separated from the dao. Similarly, the Daodejing is highly critical of
     Confucian benevolence (ren) and sagehood. It sees the notions of right, virtue, and goodness as concepts that
     distract the masses and obscure their awareness of the dao. Consequently, it recommends a kind of antisocial
      tendency to reject the way of the masses and act contrary to conventional wisdom.

      The Dao as a Metaethical Concept

      One of the ways in which Daoism differs from Confucianism and Mohism is that it emphasizes the grounds for
      moral norms but refrains from offering specific moral guidelines for action. Daoism starts with a certain
      conception of the natural world that serves as the basis for an ethical perspective on life, whereas
      Confucianism largely ignores any description of nature untouched, focusing directly on moral behavior. The
     dao itself is understood as a natural force that guides all life: "Men emulate earth; earth emulates heaven (tian);
      heaven emulates the Dao; the Dao emulates spontaneity" (Eno 2010, p. 17, 25). The general moral guidance of
     Daoism involves becoming aware of the dao and ensuring that one's action doesn't oppose natural forces.

     In a general sense, the dao is considered to be an order governing the universe from its beginnings through the
      various forces of nature and reaching into human affairs. The human condition sets human beings against the
     dao and places them in opposition to this underlying force, so most of the Daodejing is focused on attempts to
     bring human beings back into alignment with the dao. The text warns, "As a thing the Dao is shadowed,
      obscure" (Eno 2010, p. 16, 21b). The problem is that the typical strategies for illuminating and clarifying things
     further obscure the dao because the dao itself appears contradictory: "To assent and to object--how different
      are they? Beauty and ugliness--what is the distinction between them?" (Eno 2010, p. 15, 20).

     Language and rational concepts pull one away from the dao, which is either contentless and empty or
      contradictory: "When the Dao is spoken as words, how thin it is, without taste" (Eno 2010, p. 21, 35). This is
     why followers of the dao should resist attempts to categorize it in a determinative way: "Those who know do
     not speak; those who speak do not know" (p. 27, 56). Instead, the one who follows the dao is capable of
      embracing contradiction: "One who knows white but preserves black becomes a standard for the world. Such a
      one never deviates from constant virtue and returns again to being limitless" (p. 18, 28a). Here, it is evident
      how Daoists draw lessons about the study and mastery of morality from their understanding of metaphysics. If
      reality is fundamentally contradictory and escapes the human capacity to capture it in language, then the
      person who wants to remain closest to fundamental reality should refrain from attempting to categorize it and
      should be willing to live with contradiction.

      That said, this teaching leads to several tensions. It seems difficult to derive ethical prescriptions from nature
     when nature itself seems to lack a prescriptive force. The dao is simply the total forces of nature, neither good
      nor bad. Yet when Daoists advise one to allow the forces of nature to govern all activity, they themselves must

refrain from theorizing. Nevertheless, in order to provide guidance, the Daoist must speak or write. This leaves
the reader in a difficult interpretive position (Hansen 2020).

Skepticism, the belief that one can never attain certain knowledge, is entrenched in Daoism. It's not clear,
however, whether the reason for skepticism is that there is no ultimate answer, that there is an answer but it
cannot be known, or that the answer can be known but it cannot be communicated. The Daodejing suggests
that the best path is to recognize the limits of human knowledge: "To know you do not know is best; not to
know that one does not know is to be flawed. / One who sees his flaws as flaws is therefore not flawed" (Eno
2010, p. 32, 71).

     CONNECTIONS

The chapter on epistemology takes a deeper look at Daoism and other forms of skepticism.

The Ethics of Wuwei

Daoist texts teach readers to adopt a stance that is typically called wuwei, meaning nonaction, softness, or
adaptiveness to the circumstances at hand. Wuwei is contrasted with action, assertion, and control. In the
Zhuangzi, followers of the dao are characterized in a way that resembles the psychological state known as flow,
where they find themselves completely absorbed in their task, losing awareness of themselves as a distinct ego
and becoming completely receptive to the task at hand. The Zhuangzi tells the story of Cook Ding, a butcher
who was so skillful that he had used the same knife without sharpening it for 19 years. He never dulled the
blade by striking bone or tendon. Instead, he was able to find the gaps in the joints and cut through with the
thin edge of his blade, no matter how small the gaps. He explains, "At the beginning, when I first began carving
up oxen, all I could see was the whole carcass. After three years I could no longer see the carcass whole, and
now I meet it with my spirit and don't look with my eyes" (Eno 2019, p. 23, 3.2). The metaphor of flow also
resembles descriptions of wuwei that compare it to water: "Nothing in the world is more weak and soft than
water, yet nothing surpasses it in conquering the hard and strong--there is nothing that can compare" (Eno
2010, p. 34, 78).

Moreover, being in a state of nonaction, softness, and flow allows one to be spontaneous and reactive to
circumstances. Spontaneity is another characteristic of someone who follows the dao: "To be sparse in speech
is to be spontaneous" (Eno 2010, p. 17, 23). Here, speech seems to be associated with control. This may be
because speech exercises a certain control over the world by placing names on things and identifying them as
similar to or different from other things, grouping them in categories, and assembling these categories and
things into chains of reason. For the Daoists, this puts a distance between humanity and the fundamental
forces of nature. The Zhuangzi states, "The Dao has never begun to possess boundaries and words have never
yet begun to possess constancy" (Eno 2019, p. 23, 2.13). The attempt to use language to provide distinctions in
the dao obscures the dao. This is a function of the nature of words to be true or false, allowable or unallowable.
The implication is that these distinctions are foreign to the nature of the dao. In another section, the Zhuangzi
reiterates this principle with the slogan "A this is a that; a that is a this" (Eno 2019, p. 16, 2.7). The point is that
anything that can be designated as a "this" could also be designated as a "that," which the author takes to
imply that language is relative to the perspective of the speaker.

As a result, the Daoists instruct one to surrender their attempts to understand and control nature: "The wish to
grasp the world and control it--I see its futility. The world is a spiritlike vessel; it cannot be controlled. One who
would control it would ruin it; one who would grasp it would lose it" (Eno 2010, p. 19, 29a). Inaction and the
lack of a desire to grasp or comprehend the nature of the world are characteristic of wuwei: "He who acts, fails;
he who grasps, loses. / Therefore the sage takes no action (wuwei) and hence has no failure, does no grasping
and hence takes no loss" (p. 30, 64c). In contrast with Confucius, the Daoists link inaction and the lack of
reason (spontaneity) with virtue: "The highest virtue does not act (wuwei) and has no reason to act; the lowest
virtue acts and has reason to act" (p. 21, 38).

              WRITE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

      Philosophers from around the world believe in the human ability to use reason to create both individual and social
      flourishing. Describe the qualities an individual has to possess to achieve ethical well-being in Aztec, Confucian, and
      Daoist thought. Then discuss what qualities you personally believe an individual needs to accomplish this goal.

     Mohism

      The school of Mohism is named after the philosopher Mozi (c. 470-391 BCE), who lived immediately after
      Confucius and was critical of the Confucian school. Less is known about Mozi than Confucius because even the
      earliest Chinese histories relegated him to relative obscurity. He appears to have been a tradesman who was
      skilled in his craft and slowly rose through the ranks of civil society. He was trained in Confucianism but
      resisted the way Confucius was overly wedded to ritual and hierarchy. Mozi was a universalist, insisting on the
      equal value of all people, without preferential treatment for family, neighbors, and country. He was followed
      enthusiastically by his disciples, many of them tradespeople who found solace in his egalitarian approach to
      philosophical questions.

      Mozi's followers, known as Mohists, were numerous and intensely loyal during his life and immediately
      afterward. Stories from this time indicate that he held strict control over his disciples (Fung 1952). Mohism has
      had a much smaller influence on classical Chinese ethics and philosophy than Confucianism. The absence of
      immediate cultural relevance should not indicate that Mohism lacks philosophical importance. In fact, it may
      be argued that in many ways, Mozi is more philosophical in the contemporary sense of the word than
      Confucius. Whereas Confucius transmitted and codified the ritualistic values and customs of the Zhou dynasty,
      Mozi challenged traditional values by insisting on a more rational approach to ethics and a rejection of
      hierarchical norms. He derived his ethical system from first principles rather than tradition. Followers of
      Mohism developed an interest in traditional areas of philosophy that were neglected by the Confucians, such
      as logic, epistemology, and philosophy of language.

     What is known of Mohism is derived from a collection of texts with obscure authorship, simply titled Mozi. The
      collection originally consisted of 71 texts written on bamboo strip scrolls, though 18 are missing and many
      have been corrupted through natural degradation. It is unclear how many of the texts were written by Mozi
      himself or even during his lifetime. It is likely that many of the doctrines surrounding epistemology, logic, and
      philosophy of language are later developments. The core of the texts consists of 10 three-part essays
      expounding on and defending the 10 main doctrines of the Mohist school. Those doctrines are presented in
      five pairs of principles: "Promoting the Worthy" and "Identifying Upward," "Inclusive Care" and "Condemning
      Aggression," "Moderation in Use" and "Moderation in Burial," "Heaven's Intent" and "Understanding Ghosts,"
      and "Condemning Music" and "Condemning Fatalism" (Fraser 2020a). The doctrines of inclusive care and
      anti-aggression are discussed below.

      Inclusive Care and Anti-aggression

      Perhaps the most central doctrine of Mohist philosophy is the principle that every human being is valued
     equally in the eyes of heaven (tian). With minimal religious or theological commitments, Mohists believe that
      heaven constitutes the eternal and ideal beliefs of a natural power or force that created and governs the
      universe. According to Mohists, it is apparent that heaven values every individual human being with exactly
      the same worth. In contrast to Confucius, who emphasized the importance of care with distinctions, Mozi
      advanced the doctrine of inclusive or impartial care, sometimes translated as "universal love."

      The doctrine of inclusive care leads directly to the doctrine of anti-aggression because the greatest threat to
      human well-being and care is aggression and war. Mozi lived during the period known as the Warring States
      period, immediately following the decline of the Zhou dynasty. During this period, local rulers fought for power
      in the absence of a strong central government. Mozi reasoned that the greatest calamities of the world are the

result of wars between states, aggression between neighbors, and a lack of respect among family members.
These calamities are the result of partiality in care--that is, thinking that one group of people has a greater
value than another. Partiality of care is the basis of loyalty among families and nations, but it is also the source
of enmity and hostility between families and nations (Fung 1952).

In defense of the principle of inclusive care, Mozi offers a sophisticated philosophical argument, developed in
dialogue form. He starts with the observation that if other states, capitals, or houses were regarded as if they
were one's own, then one would not attack, disturb, or harm them. If one did not attack, disturb, or harm
others, this would be a benefit to the world. Those who benefit and do not harm others are said to care for
others and, therefore, to express inclusive or universal rather than partial care. Thus, inclusive care is the
cause of benefit, while partial care is the cause of harm. The virtuous person should benefit the world, so the
virtuous person should adopt inclusive care (Fung 1952). Mozi adds another argument by thought experiment:
Imagine two people who are sincere, thoughtful, and otherwise identical in thought, word, and deed, except
one of them believes in inclusive care while the other believes in partial care. Suppose you had to put your
trust in one of the two people to protect yourself and your family. Which would you choose? He concludes that
everyone would choose the person who believes in inclusive care, presumably because it would guarantee that
their family would be protected and cared for just the same as anyone else. Trusting someone who believes in
partial care only works if you know that the person is partial to you.

One of the key aspects of Mohist ethics is that Mozi asks about the appropriate rational basis for moral
principles. Instead of starting from tradition and developing a system of ethics that conforms to and explains
traditional views, as Confucius had, Mozi prefers to seek a rational ground for his ethical views. In particular,
he asks about the appropriate "model" for ordering and governing society. He rejects any of the usual models,
such as parents, teachers, and rulers, concluding that one cannot be certain that any of these people actually
possess benevolence and therefore provide the right standard for ethical action. Instead, Mozi insists on
finding an objective standard that is not fallible in the way a particular person or cultural tradition may be.
Ultimately, the only acceptable model is heaven, which is entirely impartial in its concern for all human
beings.

This sort of rational reasoning has led scholars to classify Mohism as a form of consequentialism, a
philosophical approach that looks at the consequences of an action to determine whether it is moral.

         THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

What doctrines within Mohism and Confucianism might have made Confucianism the more popular choice for
Chinese rulers?

Mohist Epistemology

The search for "models" sets Mohism apart in terms of its philosophical grounding. Mohists consider a wide
range of possible candidates for models, including a rule, law, or definition; a person (i.e., a role model); and a
tool or measuring device, such as a yardstick or compass. There are three different types of standards or
models for assessing the value of anything: its root (the historical precedent), its source (the empirical basis),
and its use (whether it produces benefit). The third standard has priority and reinforces the pragmatic
character of Mohism. The purpose of a model is to help a student better follow the way (dao). The fact that there
are so many different types of models reflects the fact that there are so many different practical contexts in
which one needs to understand the appropriate way to act. Models are applied to practical situations not as a
100 3 · The Early History of Philosophy around the World

       principle or premise in an argument but rather as a prototype for the purpose of selecting things of a certain
       kind and casting off things that do not conform to that prototype. "The central questions for early Chinese
       thinkers are not What is the truth, and how do we know it? but What is the dao (way), and how do we follow it?"
       (Fraser 2020a).
       Knowledge, for Mohists, is based on the concept of "recognition" or "knowledge of." This sort of knowledge
       involves being able to reliably pick out what a given word means rather than understanding or conceptualizing
       the word. This can be illustrated by a passage in which Mozi says that the blind do not know white and black,
       not because they are unable to use the terms white and black correctly, but because they are not able to select
       the things that are white and differentiate them from the things that are black. For Mohists, there is little value
       in investigating the conceptual or ideal nature of terms like white and black. The focus is, instead, entirely
       practical: they want to be able to distinguish the things that are white from the things that are black. It is not
       necessary to know the essence or nature of something in order to be able to reliably distinguish it from other
       things. Similarly, Mohists have little interest in seeking justifications or foundations of knowledge. Such
       justifications are unnecessary in order to make the correct distinctions, which is the primary aim of
       knowledge. Reliable and consistently correct identification is what counts as knowledge, not having access to
       the right rational justifications or definitions (Fraser 2020a).

Summary

3.1 Indigenous Philosophy

When humans shift from religious answers to questions about purpose and meaning to more naturalistic and
logical answers, they move from the realm of myth to reason. In Greek, this movement is described as a move
from mythos to logos, where mythos signifies the supernatural stories we tell, while logos signifies the rational,
logical, and scientific stories we tell. Rather than seeing a decisive break from mythological thinking to rational
thinking, we should understand the transition from mythos to logos as a gradual, uneven, and zig-zagging
progression.

Indigenous thought has in the past been seen as wisdom lying outside the realm of academic discussion;
however, recent scholarship has challenged this assumption. The philosophies of Indigenous African and
North American peoples provide understandings of the self and of society that complement and challenge
traditional Western ideas. The Maya possessed advanced understandings of mathematics and astronomy as
well as metaphysical concepts of a solar life force. The Aztec had a highly developed epistemology that
grounded truth within an understanding of an individual's character and recognized the fundamental and total
character of the universe as a godlike force or energy.

3.2 Classical Indian Philosophy

Indian philosophical traditions are a few centuries older than the earliest European philosophical traditions.

Philosophers from both Greek and India see philosophy as not just a theoretical activity but also a practical
endeavor--a way of life. The earliest philosophical texts in India are the four Vedas. The Upanishads, a body of
scripture added later, contain much of the philosophical core of these Hindu scriptures. According to this
tradition, there is a rigid hierarchy to the cosmos that is reflected in the earthly world. Six darshanas, or
schools of thought, emerged in Hindu philosophy, each pointing to a different path to seeing and being seen by
a sacred being or beings.

The six principal darshanas are Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa, and Vedanta. Samkhya holds
that everything is composed of purua (pure, absolute consciousness) and prakriti (matter). Liberation occurs
when the mind is freed from the bondage of matter. The purpose of yoga is the stopping of the movement of
thought. Only then do individuals encounter their true selves. Nyaya, which can be translated as "method" or
"rule," focuses on logic and epistemology. The Vaisheshika system developed independently of Nyaya, but
gradually came to share many of its core ideas. Its epistemology was simpler, allowing for only perception and
inference as the forms of reliable knowledge. The Mimamsa school was one of the earliest philosophical
schools of Hinduism, and it was grounded in the interpretation of the Vedic texts. It sought to investigate
dharma or the duties, rituals, and norms present in society.

3.3 Classical Chinese Philosophy

Early Chinese writings show the beginnings of the theory of yin and yang, the two fundamental forces that are
characterized as male and female, dark and light, inactivity and activity. In Confucianism, the five constant
virtues are benevolence (ren), righteousness (yi), propriety (li), wisdom (zhi), and trustworthiness (xin). The
unifying theme among Daoist religions is a focus on a naturalistic, nontheological view of the underlying basis
for morality and goodness. The general moral guidance of Daoism involves becoming aware of the dao, or the
natural way of things, and ensuring that one's actions don't oppose those natural forces.

The most central doctrine of Mohist philosophy is the principle that every human being is valued equally in the
eyes of heaven (tian). In contrast to Confucius, who emphasized the importance of care with distinctions, Mozi
advanced the doctrine of inclusive care, following the principle that every human being has equal value in the
eyes of heaven. The doctrine of inclusive care leads directly to the doctrine of anti-aggression because the
greatest threat to human well-being and care is mutual aggression and war.

4.2 Classical Philosophy
4.3 Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Philosophy
INTRODUCTION Scholars long regarded ancient Greece as the birthplace of Western philosophy. After all, the
word philosophy itself derives from the ancient Greek words philos (affection) and sophos (wisdom)--and
indeed, ancient Greece produced the great minds of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Yet the path of classical
philosophy begins in North Africa, reaches Greece and Rome, jumps back across the Mediterranean, and
spreads from Persia to Spain before it emerges to support what is frequently called the birth of modernity. This
chapter examines that path.
In order to consider the historical path of philosophy across these various cultures, we need to begin with a
brief account of how philosophers have studied the history of philosophy and how we might consider the
practice of philosophy throughout history before turning to these historical traditions themselves.

     4.1 Historiography and the History of Philosophy

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · List and briefly describe three different approaches to the history of philosophy.
         · Identify the strengths of each of the three different approaches to the history of philosophy.
         · Identify the weaknesses of each of the three different approaches to the history of philosophy.

       We will begin our discussion of the history of philosophy and the historiography of philosophy, or the study of
       how to conduct history pertaining to philosophy, with two fundamental questions: Why should one study the
       history of philosophy? And how should one study the history of philosophy? In response to the first question,
       the history of philosophy has both intrinsic and instrumental value. It can give us a more accurate
       understanding of our philosophical past while also informing contemporary approaches to philosophy.
       Historical authors provide a source of arguments, ideas, and theories that inform contemporary debates.
       Historical writings may inspire us. Finally, understanding the process by which philosophical ideas have
       developed can help contemporary philosophers better understand the debates and ideas that are important to
       them. In response to the second question: How should one study the history of philosophy? We may
       distinguish, broadly, between three main approaches to the history of philosophy--the presentist approach,
       the contextualist approach, and the hermeneutic approach.

      Presentist Approach

       A presentist approach to the history of philosophy examines philosophical texts for the arguments they
       contain and judges whether their conclusions remain relevant for philosophical concerns today. A presentist
       approach concerns itself with the present concerns of philosophy and holds past philosophers to present
       standards. This approach allows us to benefit from a rich body of past wisdom--even in our everyday lives. We
       might, for example, find strength from the Confucian proverb "Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in
       rising every time we fall." Inspired by the maxim of English philosopher Edmund Burke (1729-1797)--as
       restated by President John F. Kennedy--"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do
       nothing," we might volunteer, donate, or take action to help a cause. When attempting to understand a
       challenging situation, we might apply Occam's razor, the idea that the most likely explanation is the one that
       requires the fewest assumptions.

       The main limitation to this approach is that it neglects various contexts in which past philosophers lived and
       worked. This does not mean that the arguments found in philosophical texts are not important and that we
       should not focus on them. But the focus on arguments at the exclusion of anything else causes problems. It
       downplays the various ways that philosophers communicate their ideas and try to persuade readers of their
       truth.

       In addition to reading philosophical texts too narrowly, the exclusive focus on arguments has been criticized
       for yielding a profoundly ahistorical understanding of the development of philosophy. Past philosophers are
       judged by contemporary standards instead of being understood in relation to the historical and cultural
       contexts in which they lived and wrote. Philosophers are found wanting because they do not contribute to
       contemporary debates in subfields such as epistemology (the study of the basis for knowledge) and
       metaphysics (the study of the nature of reality). Additionally, ideas from contemporary philosophy may be
       attributed to historical philosophers in a way that does not accurately apply to them. This ignores the
       differences in time, culture, and context between contemporary philosophers and historical philosophers, an
       error known as anachronism.

       An example will clarify these points. Plato's Allegory of the Cave, which describes humanity as prisoners within
       a cave reacting to shadows on the wall, might be read in terms of how it contributes to debates in epistemology
       or metaphysics. However, it is anachronistic and inaccurate to claim that this is exclusively what it is about, as
       the Allegory of the Cave also has political significance specific to Plato's time and social context. We can only

grasp the political significance once we understand the situation in Plato's home city of Athens during his
lifetime. Athens had suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Following the
war, Athens's democratic government was replaced with a group of wealthy tyrants who were sympathetic to
Sparta, called the Thirty Tyrants. Plato, who had relatives among the Thirty Tyrants, was thought to be
sympathetic to the Thirty Tyrants and suspicious of those who were advocating for democracy. But when we
realize that the Thirty Tyrants were the government responsible for Athens's humiliating defeat and for the
death of Plato's beloved teacher Socrates, we understand why Plato questions the limits of human
understanding. Plato's political project becomes easier to understand as well, for in questioning the limits of
human knowledge and seeking a deeper understanding of the truth, the Allegory of the Cave attempts to solve
what Plato sees as the problems inherent in both tyrannical and democratic forms of government. Plato's hope
is to foster generations of individuals who have a greater understanding of truth and will serve capably in
government.

     CONNECTIONS

The chapter on metaphysics covers the Allegory of the Cave in more detail.

Contextualist Approach

The contextualist approach to philosophical texts aims to be more sensitive to the history surrounding their
creation. This approach attempts to understand historical philosophy on its own terms, using concepts and
ideas that would have been appropriate to the time period in which they were written. Contextualist
understandings of philosophy are interested in getting the history right. They give us a richer understanding of
philosophical ideas and help avoid misinterpretation.

For example, an often-misunderstood passage from the Hebrew Bible is "an eye for an eye." Many today
interpret this passage as a justification for violence, not realizing that the passage reflects a body of laws meant
to restrict retaliation. For millennia, when a wrong was done to an individual, a family or another group to
which the individual belongs would often seek retribution. This retribution was viewed as a means both of
achieving justice and of dissuading others from wronging the family or group in a similar way in the future.
The biblical law, which was eventually adopted widely across the Middle East, meant that the wrongdoer or the
group to which the wrongdoer belonged was not to be made to pay more than an eye for an eye. In this way, a
justice system might prevent the extralegal cycle of increasingly violent retribution that still takes place
between some groups, such as in gang or underworld warfare. Moreover, the biblical law also set monetary
equivalents for specific wrongdoings so that physical harm, as a form of punishment, could be avoided. By
understanding the context of the phrase "an eye for an eye," we gain greater insight into human behavior and
how systems of justice can prevent violence from cycling out of control.

While the contextualist approach makes possible this detailed and rich type of understanding, there is a
danger that contextualist historians might fall into the trap of antiquarianism. This means that they might
become interested in the history of philosophy for history's sake, ignoring the instrumental value of historical
philosophy for contemporary philosophers.

Hermeneutic Approach

A third approach to the history of philosophy attempts to address problems inherent to the presentist and
contextualist approaches. The hermeneutic approach takes the historical context of a text seriously, but it
also recognizes that our interpretation of history is conditioned by our contemporary context. The
hermeneutic historian of philosophy recognizes both that a contemporary philosopher cannot abandon their
contemporary framework when interpreting historical texts and that the context of historical authors deeply
influenced the way that historical texts were written. Additionally, hermeneutic philosophers contend that
philosophical ideas are historical in nature; that is, no philosophical concept can be understood if it is
completely abstracted from the historical process that generated it. However, a hermeneutic approach to
110 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

philosophy can fall prey to a tendency to think about history as culminating in the present. This view of history
might be summarized as an account of history that says, "a, then b, then c, then me." While this may be the way
things look now, it's important to remember that our contemporary perspective will be eclipsed by future
historians of philosophy. Also, we ought not assume that history has a purpose or progression. It may be that
the sequence of historical events lacks any goal.

Table 4.1 summarizes these three approaches, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each.

TABLE 4.1 Three Different Approaches to Studying the History of Philosophy

4.2 Classical Philosophy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Evaluate the influence of Egyptian scholarship on classical Greek philosophy.
  · Describe the key ideas of the most influential Greek philosophers.
  · Describe the key ideas of the most influential Roman philosophers.
  · Distinguish between major schools of classical thought.

Egyptian Origins of Classical Philosophy

The understanding that the roots of classical thought lie, at least in part, in Egypt is as old as the ancient
Greeks themselves. In The Histories of Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484-425 BCE)
traces Greek beliefs about the gods, religious practices, and understanding of the natural world to Egypt.
Herodotus claimed the ancient Greeks adopted practices and ideas as diverse as solemn processions to
temples, the belief in an immortal soul, and the knowledge of geometry and astrology from the Egyptians.
Herodotus notes that the people of Heliopolis, one of the largest cities in ancient Egypt, "are said to be the most
learned in records of the Egyptians" (Herodotus 1890, 116). Plato spent 13 years in Heliopolis, and Pythagoras
(c. 570-495 BCE) studied mathematics in Heliopolis for more than two decades (Boas 1948).

FIGURE 4.2 This obelisk, erected in Heliopolis, Egypt, in approximately 1200 BCE, was transported to Rome in the
16th century and made part of that city's public environment. Similarly, many of the ideas of what is now considered
classical Greek philosophy can be traced back to Egyptian origins. (credit: "Egyptian Obelisk (Metres 25), Erected at
Heliopolis" by Carlo Raso/Flickr, Public Domain)
Egyptian and Babylonian Mathematics
Could Pythagoras have learned, rather than discovered, the "Pythagorean" theorem--the law of relationships
between the sides and hypotenuse of a right triangle--in Egypt? Almost assuredly. A Babylonian clay tablet
dating to approximately 1800 BCE, known as Plimpton 322, demonstrates that the Babylonians had knowledge
not only of the relationship of the sides and hypotenuses of a right triangle but also of trigonometric functions
(Lamb 2017). Further, the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus provides evidence that the Egyptians had advanced
knowledge of algebra and geometry as early as 1550 BCE, presenting problems that include calculating the
volume of cylindrical granaries and the slope of pyramids. The Berlin Papyrus 6619, usually dated between
1800 BCE and 1649 BCE, contains a solution to a problem involving the Pythagorean theorem and evidence
that the Egyptians could solve quadratic equations. Pythagoras studied with the priests of Heliopolis more than
1,000 years after these documents were created. It is possible that this Egyptian mathematical knowledge had
been lost and that Pythagoras rediscovered the relationship during or after his studies in Heliopolis. However,
given what we know now about Greek individuals visiting and residing in Egypt, it seems more likely that he
was introduced to the knowledge there. As with mathematics, there are specific philosophical ideas that can be
traced back to Egypt. This is particularly the case within metaphysics, the branch of philosophy that studies
reality, being, causation, and related abstract concepts and principles.
Akhenaten's Metaphysics
In the mid-14th century BCE, Akhenaten became pharaoh in Egypt. Partly in an attempt to undercut the
growing power of the priests, Akhenaten abolished all other gods and established Aten, the sun god, as the one
true god. Akhenaten held that solar energy was the element out of which all other elements evolved or
emanated (Flegel 2018). In proposing this idea, Akhenaten established an unseen divinity responsible for
causation. Aten became the one true substance that created the observable world. One hymn reads, "You
112 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

       create millions of forms from yourself, the one, / cities and towns / fields, paths and river" (Assmann [1995]
       2009, 154). Although the Egyptian elite quickly reestablished the temples and the practices of the full
       pantheon of gods after Akhenaten's death, theological thought incorporated this idea of an all-powerful
       invisible first cause. This idea evolved, with the phrase "one and the millions" coming to signify the sun god as
       the soul and the world as its body (Assmann 2004, 189). As you will see later in this chapter, this same
       concept--a single, invisible, unchanging substance expressing itself through forms to give rise to the material
       world--is the key principle in Plato's metaphysics.

       The Egyptian Origins Controversy

       Scholars have long puzzled over to what extent the origins of classical thought can be said to lie in Egypt. In
       recent years, a heated debate has erupted over this question. In the three-volume text Black Athena: The
       Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization, Martin Bernal, a contemporary American professor specializing in
       modern Chinese political history, argued that the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians played a foundational
       role in the formation of Greek civilization and philosophy. He further claimed that an "ancient model"
       recognizing the African and Middle Eastern origins of Greece was widely accepted until the 19th century, when
       it was replaced by a racist "Aryan model" proposing Indo-European origins instead. Mary Lefkowitz, a
       contemporary professor of classical studies, has famously critiqued Bernal's work. Lefkowitz's position is that
       though it is important to acknowledge the debt the Greeks owe to Egyptian thought, Greek philosophy was not
       wholly derived from Egypt, nor did Western civilization arise from Africa. A bitter academic war of words has
       ensued, with Lefkowitz and other prominent scholars noting significant errors in Bernal's scholarship.
       Lefkowitz authored Not Out of Africa: How Afrocentrism Became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History in 1997.
       Bernal responded with Black Athena Writes Back in 2001. This exchange reflects a much broader
       phenomenon in which academics spar over the accuracy of historical narratives and the interpretation of
       philosophical ideas, often presenting the issues as ethical questions. By thinking critically about these
       disagreements, we gain deeper insight not only into the topic of study but also into philosophical and political
       discourse today.

       r/teachingancientegyptian)". Identify two arguments from each article, and identify two to three sources that could
       provide evidence to substantiate or refute each argument.

      Ancient Greek Philosophy

       Classical philosophy emerged in ancient Greece, following a procession from what are known as the
       Presocratics; to the three great philosophers, Socrates (470-399 BCE), Plato (c. 428-347 BCE), and Aristotle
       (384-322 BCE); and then to later schools of thought, including the Epicureans and Stoics. As is the case with all
       ancient societies, knowledge of these thinkers is limited by the documentation that has survived. Socrates, for
       example, wrote down nothing. Rather, Plato wrote dialogues featuring his mentor Socrates engaged in
       philosophical debate with various individuals in Athens, some of them his fellow citizens and other prominent
       visitors to the city. The material that has survived from ancient Greece has fueled philosophical discourse for
       two millennia.

      The Presocratics

       The term Presocratics is somewhat problematic. At least a few of the thinkers considered part of this school
       were contemporaries of Socrates and are mentioned in Plato's dialogues. Foremost among these are the
       Sophists, traveling teachers of rhetoric who serve as foils for Plato's philosophers. Plato sought to distinguish

philosophers, seekers of truth, from Sophists, whom he regarded as seeking wealth and fame and peddling in
fallacious arguments. Indeed, one of the most prominent Sophists, Protagoras, is a main character in the
dialogue that bears his name.
Researching the Presocratics is difficult because so little of their work has survived. What we have is
fragmentary and often based on the testimony of later philosophers. Still, based on the work that is available,
we can characterize the Presocratics as interested in questions of metaphysics and natural philosophy, with
many of them proposing that nature consisted of one or more basic substances.
The fragments of the works of these early philosophers that have come down to us focus on metaphysical
questions. One of the central debates among the Presocratics is between monism and plurism. Those who
think nature consisted of a single substance are called monists, in contrast to pluralists, who see it as
consisting of multiple substances. For example, the monist Thales of Miletus thought that the basic element
that comprised everything was water, while Empedocles the pluralist sought to show that there were four basic
elements (earth, air, fire, and water) that were resolved and dissolved by the competing forces of love and strife.

FIGURE 4.3 A central debate among PreSocratic Greek philosophers concerned whether nature consisted of a
single substance--an approach taken by the monists--or was made up of a number of substances--a position taken
by the pluralists. One prominent monist, Thales of Miletus, posited that all of nature was made of water.
Empedocles, a pluralist, argued instead that the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water formed the basis of the
natural world. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Prominent Monists
Presocratic philosophers who sought to present a unified conception of nature held that nature ultimately
consists of a single substance. This proposition can be interpreted in various ways. The claim proposed by
Thales of Miletus (620-546 BCE) that the basic substance of the universe was water is somewhat ambiguous. It
might mean that everything is ultimately made of water, or it might mean that water is the origin of all things.
Thales and two of his students, Anaximander and Anaximenes, made up the monist Milesian school.
Anaximander thought that water was too specific to be the basis for everything that exists. Instead, he thought
the basic stuff of the universe was the apeiron, the indefinite or boundless. Anaximenes held that air was the
basic substance of the universe.
Parmenides, one of the most influential Presocratic monists, went so far as to deny the reality of change. He
presented his metaphysical ideas in a poem that portrays himself being taken on a chariot to visit a goddess
who claims she will reveal the truths of the universe to him. The poem has two parts, "the Way of the Truth",
which explains that what exists is unified, complete, and unchanging, and "the Way of Opinion", which argues
that the perception of change in the physical world is mistaken. Our senses mislead us. Although it might seem
to us that Parmenides's claim that change is not real is absurd, he and his student Zeno advanced strong
arguments. Parmenides was the first person to propose that the light from the moon came from the sun and to
114 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

       explain the moon's phases. In this way, he showed that although we see the moon as a crescent, a semicircle, or
       a complete circle, the moon itself does not change (Graham 2013). The perception that the moon is changing is
       an illusion.
       Zeno proposed paradoxes, known as Zeno's paradoxes, that demonstrate that what we think of as plurality
       and motion are simply not possible. Say, for example, that you wish to walk from the library to the park. To get
       there, you first must walk halfway there. To finish your trip, you must walk half of the remaining distance (one
       quarter). To travel that final quarter of the distance, you must first walk half of that (an eighth of the total
       distance). This process can continue forever--creating an infinite number of discrete distances that you must
       travel. It is therefore impossible that you arrive at the park. A more common way to present this paradox today
       is as a mathematical asymptote or limit (Figure 4.4). From this point of view, you can never reach point a from
       point b because no matter where you are along the path, there will always be a distance between wherever you
       are and where you want to be.

       FIGURE 4.4 For the function y = 1/x, neither x nor y can have a value of zero because y approaches infinity as x
       approaches zero and x approaches infinity as y approaches zero. Other functions show these same characteristics,
       which are called asymptotes or limits. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

       Prominent Pluralists
       Parmenides and Heraclitus (525-475 BCE) held diametrically opposed views concerning the nature of the
       universe. Where Parmenides saw unity, Heraclitus saw diversity. Heraclitus held that nothing remains the
       same and that all is in flux. One of his most well-known sayings illustrates this well: "[It is not possible to step
       twice into the same river]. . . . It scatters and again comes together, and approaches and recedes" (quoted in
       Curd 2011, 45).
       Anaxagoras (500-428 BCE) and Empedocles (494-434 BCE) were substance pluralists who believed that the
       universe consisted of more than one basic kind of "stuff." Anaxagoras believed that it is mind, or nous, that
       controls the universe by mixing and unmixing things into a variety of different combinations. Empedocles held
       that there were four basic substances (the four elements of air, earth, fire, and water) that were combined and
       recombined by the opposing forces of love and strife.

Finally, there are the schools of the atomists, who held the view that the basic substance of the universe was
tiny, indivisible atoms. For the atomists, all was either atoms or void. Everything we experience is a result of
atoms combining with one another.

     CONNECTIONS

The chapter on metaphysics covers monism and pluralism across cultures.

Presocratic Theology

The Presocratic philosopher Pythagoras (570-490 BCE) and his followers, known as the Pythagoreans,
comprised a rational yet mystical sect of learned men. The Pythagoreans had a reputation for learning and
were legendary for their knowledge of mathematics, music, and astronomy as well as for their dietary practices
and other customs (Curd 2011). Like Socrates, Pythagoras wrote nothing, so scholars continue to debate which
ideas originated with Pythagoras and which were devised by his disciples.

Among the Pythagoreans' key beliefs was the idea that the solution to the mysteries of the universe was
numerical and that these numerical mysteries could be revealed through music. A reminder of their
mathematical legacy can be found in the Pythagorean theorem, which students continue to learn in school.
Pythagoreans also believed in the transmigration of souls, an idea that Plato would adopt. According to this
doctrine, the soul outlives the body, and individuals are reborn after death in another human body or even in
the body of a nonhuman animal.

Another important Presocratic philosopher who produced novel theological ideas is Xenophanes (c. 570-478
BCE). Xenophanes, who was fascinated by religion, rejected the traditional accounts of the Olympian gods. He
sought a rational basis of religion and was among the first to claim that the gods are actually projections of the
human mind. He argued that the Greeks anthropomorphized divinity, and like many later theologians, he held
that there is a God whose nature we cannot grasp.

Socrates and Plato

As Socrates never wrote anything, he is remembered today because thinkers like Plato featured him in their
writings. Plato deliberately dramatized the life of his teacher Socrates. One of the key questions of Plato's
scholarship is exactly how many liberties he took in depicting the life of his teacher. Scholars generally agree
that the dialogues that Plato wrote early in his career are more faithful to the life of Socrates than later ones.
His writings are usually divided into three periods: early, middle, and late.

The early dialogues feature a skeptical Socrates who refuses to advance any doctrines of his own. Instead, he
questions his interlocutors until they despair of finding the truth at all. These early dialogues tend to be
somewhat short with a simpler composition. One of the dialogues features a young man named Meno who is
the pupil of a prominent Sophist. The dialogue focuses on the nature of virtue and whether virtue can be
taught. At one point in the dialogue, Meno famously compares Socrates to a torpedofish, a fish similar to a
stingray that paralyzes its prey. Socrates does this to his dialogue partners: they begin the discussion believing
that they know something and over the course of the dialogue begin to question whether they know anything at
all.

Gradually, Plato has Socrates give voice to more positive doctrines. These include what comes to be known as
the theory of the forms, a metaphysical doctrine that holds that every particular thing that exists participates
in an immaterial form or essence that gives this thing its identity. The invisible realm of the forms differs
fundamentally from the changing realm we experience in this world. The invisible realm is eternal,
116 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

       unchanging, and perfect. The material things themselves change, but the immaterial forms remain the same.
       Consider, for example, the form of a rectangle: four adjacent straight sides that meet at 90-degree angles. You
       can draw a rectangle, but it is an imperfect representation. The desk or table you are sitting at might be
       rectangular, but are its edges perfectly straight? How perfect was the instrument that cut the sides? If you nick
       the edge of a table, then it changes and becomes less like the form of a rectangle. With the doctrine of forms,
       Plato may be said to combine the metaphysics of Parmenides with that of Heraclitus into a metaphysical
       dualism.

       The philosopher's task is to access the immaterial realm of the forms and try to convince others of its truth.
       Plato further believed that if we understand the true nature of virtues like wisdom, justice, and courage, we
       cannot avoid acting in accordance with them. Hence, rulers of states should be philosopher-kings who have
       the clearest understanding of forms. Yet philosopher-kings never have perfect knowledge because our
       understanding is based on a material realm that is always changing. True knowledge is only possible in the
       abstract realms, such as math and ethics.

       In the dialogues, Socrates claims that he was divinely inspired to question prominent citizens of Athens to
       determine whether their claims to know could be verified. These citizens grow annoyed with Socrates after
       some years of this treatment, eventually bringing charges against him for corrupting the youth and making the
       weaker argument appear the stronger. The proceedings of the resulting trial were immortalized in Plato's
       Apologia, where Socrates presents his defense of his life's work as a philosopher. The dialogue's name derives
       from the Greek apologia, meaning "defense"--Socrates never apologizes for anything! He is found guilty and
       sentenced to death. Socrates becomes a martyr to philosophy, put to death by the democratic government of
       Athens.

      Aristotle

       During the Middle Ages, people referred to Plato's most famous pupil Aristotle as simply "the Philosopher."
       This nickname is a testament to his enduring fame, as well as to the fact that he was driven by philosophical
       curiosity to try to understand everything under the sun. The first sentence of his famous work Metaphysics
       states, "Philosophy begins in wonder." He exemplified this claim in his writing. His works ranged widely across
       all the main areas of philosophy, including logic, metaphysics, and ethics. In addition, he investigated natural
       philosophy, the fields of study that eventually gave rise to science. Aristotle also researched topics that would
       today be classified as biology and physics. Stylistically, his work was very different from that of his teacher.
       While Plato's work was literary and even dramatic, Aristotle's writings are presented as lecture.

       Plato and his successors were prone to mysticism. It was easy to translate the philosophical theory of the forms
       into a mystical doctrine in which the forms were known by the mind of God. Aristotle resisted this trend. At the
       center of Aristotle's work was his doctrine of the four causes. He believed that the nature of any single thing
       could be understood by answering four basic questions: "What's it made of?" (material cause), "What shape
       does it have?" (formal cause), "What agent gave it this form?" (efficient cause), and, finally, "What is its end
       goal?" (final cause). Not only can we explain the nature of anything by answering these four basic questions, we
       can also understand the nature of the universe. Aristotle's universe is a closed system that is comprehensible
       to humanity because it is composed of these four causes. Each cause leads to another, until we get to the first

cause or prime mover at the head of it all. Somewhat obscurely, Aristotle claims that this first cause is "thought
thinking itself."
In addition to the doctrine of the four causes, it is important to understand Aristotle's account of the soul.
Unlike Plato, who held that the soul is an eternal substance that is reborn in various bodies, Aristotle has a
functional conception of the soul. He defined the soul based upon what the soul does. In Aristotle's
understanding, all living things have souls. Plants have a vegetative soul that promotes growth and the
exchange of nutrients. The animal soul, in addition to taking in nutrients and growing, experiences the world,
desires things, and can move of its own volition. Added to these various functions in humans is the ability to
reason.

FIGURE 4.5 Aristotle believed that all living beings had souls, but that the souls of various types of creatures
differed in their abilities. The soul of a plant promotes growth and the exchange of nutrients. The animal soul allows
for everything a plant can do, with the additional ability to desire things and move of its own volition. Only the human
soul makes possible the ability to reason. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
With the four causes and the functional conception of the soul, we can begin to understand Aristotle's ethics.
Aristotle systematized Plato's conception of ethics based upon his conception of the self and his four causes.
Since everything that exists has a purpose, one of the basic questions for ethics is "What is the purpose of the
human being?" After considering such candidates as pleasure and power, Aristotle settles on the answer
"happiness" or, more accurately, "eudaimonia." Rather than a fleeting emotional state, eudaimonia is better
understood as "flourishing." So the question at the heart of Aristotle's ethics is "How should humans best
achieve happiness?" His basic answer is that we achieve eudaimonia by cultivating the virtues. Virtues are
habits of character that help us to decide what action is preferable in a particular moment. Cultivating these
virtues will helps us to lead a fulfilling life.
It is generally true to say that Plato tended to be more focused on the transcendental world of the forms while
Aristotle and his followers were more focused on this worldly existence. They shared a belief that the universe
was comprehensible and that reason should serve as a guide to ordering our lives.

      Epicureans

       In the wake of the giants of Greek philosophy--Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle--some philosophers turned away
       from Plato's ideal forms and toward materialism. In this, they can be seen as furthering a trend already present
       in the thinking of Aristotle. For Aristotle, there can be no immaterial forms--everything that exists has some
       material basis, though he allows an exception for his first cause, the unmoved mover.

       The Epicureans steadfastly rejected the existence of immaterial forms, unmoved movers, and immaterial
       souls. The Epicureans, like Aristotle, embraced empiricism, which means that they believed that all
       knowledge was derived from sense experience. This view was the basis of the revival of empiricism in 18th-
       century British thought and scientific practice. They espoused an ethical naturalism that held that in order to
       live a good life we must properly understand human nature. The ultimate goal of life is to pursue pleasure.
       Despite their disagreements with Plato and, to a lesser extent, Aristotle, the Epicureans agreed with their
       predecessors that human existence ought to be guided by reason.

       The two principal Greek Epicureans were Epicurus himself (341-270 BCE) and his Roman disciple Lucretius
       (c. 99-55 BCE). Although Epicurus's views are characterized as hedonistic, this does not mean that he believed
       that we ought to be indiscriminate pleasure-seekers. Instead, he proposed that people could achieve fulfilling
       lives if they were self-sufficient and lived free from pain and fear. Of course, complete self-sufficiency is just as
       impossible as a life utterly free from pain and fear, but Epicurus believed that we should strive to minimize our
       dependence upon others while limiting the pain in our lives. Epicureans thought that the best way to do this
       was to retire from society into philosophical communities far from the hustle and bustle of the crowd. Epicurus
       and Lucretius saw the fear of death as our most debilitating fear, and they argued that we must overcome this
       fear if we were going to live happy lives.

       Lucretius developed Epicurean philosophy in a poem called De Rerum Natura (On the nature of things). This
       poem discusses ethical ideas, but physics provides its focus. Lucretius adopts a material atomism that holds
       that things are composed of atoms in motion. Rejecting religious explanations, he argues that the universe is
       governed by chance and exemplified by these atoms in motion. Although the Epicurean philosophers were
       critically responding to the work of Plato and Aristotle, it should be evident that they also have antecedents in
       Presocratic thought. We can see this in their atomism and their religious skepticism, which hearkens back to
       Xenophanes.

      Roman Philosophy

       Just as Hellenistic philosophy developed in the long shadows cast by Plato and Aristotle, Roman philosophy
       also used these two giants of Greek philosophy as reference points. While Roman philosophical traditions were
       built upon their Greek forebearers, they developed in a Roman cultural context. Rome began as a republic
       before becoming an empire, and Roman philosophy was affected by this political transformation. Still, Roman
       philosophical schools were thoroughly grounded in Greek philosophy, with many Roman philosophers even
       choosing to write in Greek rather than Latin, since Greek was viewed as the language of scholarship.

       Rhetoric and Persuasion in Politics

       Recall that Plato defined philosophy in opposition to sophistry. Whereas the philosopher sought the truth in a
       dispassionate way using reason as a guide, the Sophist addressing a crowd was indifferent to truth, seeking
       power and influence by appealing to the audience's emotions. This harsh critique of rhetoric, which can be
       defined as the art of spoken persuasion, softened with subsequent philosophers. Indeed, Aristotle wrote a text
       called Rhetoric in which he sought to analyze rhetoric as the counterpart to philosophy. The tension never
       disappears entirely, however, and the relationship between philosophy and rhetoric and, more generally, the
       relationship between philosophy and politics remains a perennial question.

       Despite the fact that his ideal statesman was a philosopher, Plato generally sought to keep philosophy distinct
       from the grubbiness of real politics and was concerned about the messiness of democratic politics in

particular. In the Roman political context, this ambivalence becomes less apparent. Examples of philosophers
who were also statesmen include Cicero (106-43 BCE) and Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE). Marcus Aurelius
even served as emperor of Rome from 161 to 180 CE. However, as the Roman Republic gave way to the Roman
Empire, philosophers shifted inward by focusing on things that were in their control.

Stoicism

Aristotle held that eudaimonia is worthwhile at least in part because it helps us to better deal with various
inevitable misfortunes. The Roman Stoics further developed this idea, proposing four core virtues: courage,
justice, temperance, and wisdom. The Stoics were wary of the type of false judgments that might arise from the
emotions. They were also uneasy with the loss of control associated with strong emotions, observing that some
people can become enslaved to their passions. The Stoics prized rational self-control above everything else.
This constant work at maintaining inner freedom epitomizes the Stoic conception of philosophy (Hadot 2002).

         WRITE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

Marcus Aurelius was both a Roman emperor and a Stoic philosopher. His writings, which he meant only for himself,
were eventually published in Meditations, a work that serves as one of the major sources of Stoic thought. Although
much of Marcus Aurelius's reign fell under a period known as the Pax Romana, when the empire enjoyed relative
stability and peace, the end of his reign occurred during a period of major wars and a plague. This famous passage,
taken from Book VII, Section 47 of the Meditations, provides advice about how to deal with pain or grief called by an
external source. Translate it into your own language. Then explain why you agree or disagree with Marcus Aurelius's
conclusions.

      If you are grieved about anything external, 'tis not the thing itself that afflicts you, but your judgment about
      it; and it is in your power to correct this judgment and get quit of it. If you are grieved at anything in your
      own disposition; who hinders you to correct your maxims of life? If you are grieved, because you have not
      accomplished some sound and virtuous design; set about it effectually, rather than be grieving that it is
      undone. "But some superior force withstands." Then you have no cause of sorrow; for, the fault of the
      omission lies not in you. "But, life is not worth retaining, if this be not accomplished." Quit life, then, with
      the same serenity, as if you had accomplished it; and with good-will, even toward those who withstand you.

The Stoics were systematic philosophers whose writings focused on ethics, physics, logic, rhetoric, and
grammar. For the Stoics, the world consists of material bodies in motion, causally affecting each other. Real
entities are those capable of causally affecting one another. The Stoic god is a material entity who exists in
nature and meticulously manages it, the material first cause of the universe, Aristotle's unmoved mover
incarnated as a material entity. In other words, God is an animating reason that gives life to the universe.
Unlike the Christian God who transcends the universe, the Stoic god is found within it, a force immanent to the
universe who combines and recombines the four elements into things we can experience because they act
upon us and we upon them. Stoicism developed at a time when politics in the Roman world was increasingly
seen as something outside individuals' power to change. So Stoics let politics go. While turning away from
politics may indeed promote a tranquil life, it also promotes passivity. Thus, Stoicism reached a conclusion
similar to that reached by Daoism, as explored in the chapter on early philosophy.

Stoic ideas are enjoying something of a revival, as evidenced by the popularity of Ran Holliday's Daily Stoic

Academic Skepticism

Academic Skepticism is another aspect of Roman philosophy that developed out of a tendency found in earlier
120 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

       Greek thought. Recall that Socrates questioned whether we could ever know anything at all. The Academic
       Skeptics opposed the Stoic claims that sense impressions could yield true knowledge, holding instead that
       knowledge is impossible. Instead of knowledge, Academic Skeptics articulated the idea of degrees of belief.
       Things are more or less believable based on various criteria, and this degree of believability is the basis for
       judgment and action. Disciples of the Greek philosopher Pyrrho (c. 360-270 BCE) held that we had to suspend
       judgment when it comes to knowledge claims, going so far as to say that we cannot even reliably claim that we
       cannot know anything. Rather than suspending all judgment, Academic Skeptics sought to demonstrate that
       knowledge claims lead us to paradoxical conclusions and that one can argue cogently both for and against the
       same proposition.
       The philosopher, orator, and statesman Cicero (106-43 BCE) was the most prominent of the Academic
       Skeptics. His works provide much of the information we have about the school. He had a decisive influence on
       Latin style and grammar and was decisive in the introduction of Hellenistic philosophy into Rome. The
       rediscovery of his work in the 15th century ushered in the European Renaissance.

       FIGURE 4.6 This Flemish illuminated manuscript, dated to approximately 1470, is a French translation of Cicero's
       philosophical treatise De amicitia. The rediscovery of Cicero's work in the 15th century has been connected to the

       Neoplatonism
       Plotinus (c. 204-270) led a revival of Plato's thought in the late Roman Empire that lasted until Emperor
       Justinian closed Plato's Academy in 529. Plotinus believed that he was simply an expositor of Plato's work, but
       the philosophy he developed, known as Neoplatonism, expanded on Plato's idea. Neoplatonism arose during a
       time of cultural ferment in the Roman Empire, incorporating ideas borrowed from sources such as Judaism
       and early Christianity. The key metaphysical problem in Neoplatonism was accounting for how a perfect God
       could create a universe that was manifestly imperfect. Plotinus solved this problem by applying ideas similar
       to Plato's theory of forms. The perfect, unchanging realm is the one inhabited by God, but creation inhabits the
       changing realm, which only mirrors forms imperfectly. Plotinus claims that creation emanates from God, but

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe what constitutes Jewish, Christian, and Islamic philosophy.
  · Outline the historical path of classical ideas up until the early modern era.
  · Identify the ideas of key philosophers in Africa and Europe.

Greek and Roman imperialism in the Middle East and North Africa brought Jews--and later, Christians--into
the intellectual sphere of Hellenism. Early on, Jewish and Christian scholars incorporated ideas of classical
Greek and Roman philosophy into their theological studies. As Arab conquerors and traders expanded into the
Middle East and Africa, the Muslim world also came into contact with classical philosophy and the natural
sciences, adopting and advancing many key ideas. At the same time, religious centers of learning were
developing their own philosophies of metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Within these institutions, people
engaged in deep and often contentious debate about the nature of humans, of the world, and--more
generally--of being. There were also active epistemological debates attempting to determine the boundaries of
what could and could not be known. These thinkers developed ethical systems that adherents put into practice.
Yet a tension runs through most of these works, as philosophers tried to balance theological revelation with
freedom of intellectual exploration.

Defining Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Philosophy

The previous chapter on the early history of philosophy examined how and whether organized philosophies
differ from Indigenous belief systems and religions. It was mentioned that the emergence of a philosophy has
been described as a transition from a system of myths (mythos) to a rational system of ideas (logos). If this
distinction appears blurry at times, how much more difficult might it be to untangle theology from
philosophy--or to determine what constitutes Jewish, Christian, or Islamic philosophy?

In a provocative article, 20th-century rabbi and scholar Eliezer Berkovits (1908-1992) tackles the question of
what is Jewish philosophy and who should be considered a Jewish philosopher (Berkovits 1961). Is a Jewish
philosopher anyone who is both a Jew and a philosopher? Consider, for example, the Sephardic Jew Baruch
Spinoza, often cast as a Dutch philosopher. Inspired by the French philosopher René Descartes, Spinoza
developed a metaphysical model of God, humans, and the world that challenged religious orthodoxy and
established a moral philosophy that functions independently of scripture, laying the foundation for a rational,
democratic society. Excommunicated by his own community, Spinoza emerged as one of the most important
thinkers of the early modern era (Nadler 2020). Should Spinoza be considered a Jewish philosopher? Or, even
more on point, should Spinoza's work be considered Jewish philosophy?

Berkovits did not think so. He argued that unlike Descartes, who created a new philosophy--a modern
epistemology that gave rise to advancements in politics and science--Jewish philosophers have not been
involved in the project of creating something from scratch. They did not have a blank slate to start from. A
Jewish philosopher--and the same could be said for a Christian or Muslim philosopher--always works with a
partner, i.e., the events and facts central to the religion. For example, all three of these monotheistic religions
have foundational texts that claim that God created the world. This is a metaphysical starting point for Jewish,
Christian, and Muslim philosophers--and it runs counter to Aristotle's supposition that the universe has
always existed, emanating from the unmoved mover.

Whereas each of the three monotheistic religions produced rich bodies of thought that address the nature of
reality (metaphysics) and ethics, this section examines those Jewish, Christian, and Islamic thinkers who
carried the mantle of the Greek philosophical tradition into the early modern age, often in partnership with
their own traditions.
122 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

      Early Jewish Philosophy

       After Alexander the Great, a student of Aristotle, conquered Persia in 332 BCE, his generals divided the
       empire's vast lands in Asia, the Levant, northern Africa, and Europe into three states and spread Greek culture
       and ideas into these territories, Hellenizing these areas. As a result, wealthier Jews gained exposure to the
       Greek classics.
       Philo of Alexandria
       Born into a wealthy, Hellenized family in the Roman province of Egypt, Philo of Alexandria (20 BCE-50 CE)
       published both his philosophical treatises and his personal accounts of his political experiences. Philo served
       as ambassador to Emperor Gaius Caligula on behalf of the one million Jews dwelling in Egypt. His work
       represents the first systematic attempt to make use of ideas developed by Plato and other Greek philosophers
       to explain and justify Jewish scripture. In Plato's metaphysical vision, true reality is unchanging and eternal,
       with the world we experience only a temporary reflection of these eternal forms. But, Philo asked, how can the
       creation of a physical world be explained? How can eternal forms express themselves in a physical world? In
       reconciling Jewish and Greek doctrines of creation, Philo identifies Plato's forms as logos, or the thoughts of
       God. Separate from the eternal divinity--Aristotle's unmoved mover--logos serves as the mediator between
       God and the physical world. When in the Book of Genesis, God says, "Let there be light," this is the logos of the
       unmoved mover. Philo's fusion of Greek and Jewish philosophy lays the foundation for early Christian doctrine.
       In fact, his scholarship was preserved by the Christian community and only rediscovered by the Jewish
       community in the 16th century.

       FIGURE 4.7 Philo identified Plato's forms as logos, or the thoughts of God. In this view, when God says, "Let there
       be light," this is the logos of the unmoved mover. This interpretation is typical of Philo's blending of Greek and
       Jewish philosophy. (credit: "Let There Be Light, and There Was Light" by rippchenmitkraut66/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
       Early Jewish Ethics and Metaphysics
       At the time of Philo, the Jewish Bible consisted of the five books of Moses, known as the Pentateuch, the
       Prophets, and the later books that make up the Tanakh. Much of Jewish theological, legal, and philosophical
       thought was passed down orally. Following the Roman Empire's destruction of Jerusalem and the Kingdom of
       Judah in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin, a semiautonomous Jewish legal and judicial body that had been forcibly
       relocated to northern Israel, began transcribing the oral traditions so as not to lose them. These writings would
       later become the Talmud. Among these writings is the text Ethics of Our Fathers, which provides a moral guide
       to everyday life. Later, Jewish scholars also began to explore metaphysics, culminating in the Kabbalah, which
       examines the relationship between God--defined as the infinite, unchanging, and eternal--and the finite world

we experience. Eventually, the brutal repression of Jews who remained in their homeland led to the collapse of
the Hellenized Jewish communities throughout the Roman Empire. As a result, the continuation of Philo's
work fell to a subgroup of Jews whose new religion, Christianity, would be adopted by Rome.

Early Christian Philosophy

Late antiquity witnessed the gradual demise of the Roman Empire in the West, a political development
accompanied by great social turmoil and uncertainty. The Catholic Church gradually filled this political and
cultural void, as it sought to make itself the legitimate heir of Roman power. Philosophy reflects this
transformation in Western European society, with the uncertainty and turmoil of the period reflected in the
work of philosophers of late antiquity such as Augustine and Boethius. The triumph of Christianity can be seen
in the grand edifice of scholasticism that developed later, reflected in the writings of Thomas Aquinas.

Augustine

Augustine (354-430 CE) was one of the most influential philosophers and theologians of late antiquity. In his
Confessions, he used his own life and the story of his initially reluctant turn to Christianity as an allegory for
understanding God's universe and humanity's place within it. His narrative begins with a discussion of his
struggles with faith, particularly with sexual desire. In later books, he turned to considerations of history and
the nature of time. Augustine famously posits a theory of time that holds that we experience the temporal
present in three different ways: the present anticipates the future and bleeds into the recent past.

As Bishop of Hippo, Augustine sought to defend theological orthodoxy against various heresies. He wrote
against the Pelagian heresy, which held that humans could achieve salvation themselves without divine grace,
and the Manichean heresy, which held that the universe was a battlefield between the forces of good and evil
that are equal in power. In contrast, Augustine held that all of creation was good simply by virtue of the fact
that God had created it. Nothing in God's creation was evil: things that appeared evil to us were all part of God's
providential plan. Even Satan's rebellion was part of God's plan.

Augustine's ideas raise interesting issues with respect to free will. How can we reconcile individual human
freedom in a world where an all-powerful God knows all? In opposition to the strict determinism of the
Manicheans, Augustine sought to make room for some amount of human freedom. Despite the original sin of
Adam and Eve discussed in the Christian and Jewish Bible and the fall from grace that this entails, Augustine
held that it is within our power to choose the good. Augustine sees this conflict as one between two rival wills,
one that wills the good and one that desires sinfulness. Only divine grace can ultimately resolve this, though it
is within our power to choose whether to sin.

Not only did Augustine articulate Christian doctrine that shaped medieval European philosophy for centuries
to come, but he raised questions that are still being pondered today. Queries about the nature of time and
temporality as well as agency and free will remain relevant for philosophers today, as does Augustine's
development of possible answers.

Boethius

Like Augustine, Boethius (c. 477-524 CE) was a philosopher who straddled the late Roman and Christian
worlds. Indeed, he serves as one of the most important intermediaries between these two very different
worlds. A Roman statesman and Christian theologian, Boethius is best known for his work The Consolation of
Philosophy. Boethius was imprisoned on conspiracy charges and subsequently executed by the ruler he had
served, the Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great. Prior to his imprisonment, he had translated and written
commentaries on Aristotle's work, logic, music theory, astronomy, and mathematics that were influential for
medieval philosophers. However, while imprisoned, he wrote The Consolation of Philosophy, which takes the
form of a dialogue between Boethius and philosophy personified by a beautiful woman who visits him in his
cell. The text starts out with a bitter Boethius complaining of his fall from power to Lady Philosophy. She
consoles him by showing Boethius that happiness remains possible for him even in his wretched state. She

       argues that Boethius has not lost true happiness, or the true Platonic form of happiness, as these are not found
       in material possessions or high stature, but in family, virtuous actions, and wisdom. She then reminds him that
       true good--and so true happiness--is found in God. Extremely popular throughout the Middle Ages and
       Renaissance (Marenbon 2020), The Consolation never makes mention of Christianity. In facing death, Boethius
       turns to Plato. His work and influence exemplify how Catholicism incorporated classical philosophy into its
       worldview.

                THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

       When Lady Philosophy says that true goodness is God, she is referring to Plato's idea about the form of goodness.
       Read this excerpt from Plato's The Republic, an exchange between Socrates and Glaucon that begins with a
       discussion of what allows us to see beauty. Glaucon initially answers that it is sight that allows us to see beautiful
       things but through questioning recognizes that it is both eyes and light--or the sun--that enables us to see. This
       leads Socrates toward a discussion of goodness. What do Socrates--and so Plato--believe is the form of goodness?
       Is this form of goodness similar to how Christianity or other religions or philosophical approaches that you've
       encountered view God? Do you agree with Plato's conclusion? How would you define the form of goodness?

             Socrates: You know that, when we turn our eyes to things whose colors are no longer in the light of day but
             in the gloom of night, the eyes are dimmed and seem nearly blind, as if clear vision, were no longer in them.
             Glaucon: Of course.
             Socrates: Yet whenever one turns them on things illuminated by the sun, they see clearly, and vision
             appears in those very same eyes.
             Glaucon: Indeed.

      Socrates: Well, understand the soul in the same way: When it focuses on something illuminated by truth
      and what is, it understands, knows, and apparently possesses understanding, but when it focuses on what
      is mixed with obscurity, on what comes to be and passes away, it opines and is dimmed, changes its
      opinions this way and that, and seems bereft of understanding.

      Glaucon: It does seem that way.

     Socrates: So that what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower is the form of
     the good. And though it is the cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge. Both
     knowledge and truth are beautiful things, but the good is other and more beautiful than they. In the visible
      realm, light and sight are rightly considered sunlike, but it is wrong to think that they are the sun, so here it
      is right to think of knowledge and truth as good like but wrong to think that either of them is the good--for
      the good is yet more prized.

Anselm

Anselm (1033-1109) served as Bishop of Canterbury and sought to extend the reach of Christianity into the
British Isles. Philosophically, he is best known for his formulation of what has come to be known as a proof for
the existence of God, which he elaborated in his written meditation the Proslogion. Anselm is an early
proponent of--and some say the founder of--the philosophical school of Scholasticism, which anticipates the
writings of prominent Scholastics such as Thomas Aquinas. Like later Scholastics, Anselm believed that a
rational system of thought reflects the rationality inherent in the universe and that reason and logic can lead
people to God.

Islamic Philosophy

The rise of Islam is linked to the decline of the Roman and Persian Empires. More specifically, the ruinous wars
that the two once-great powers fought left both weak. In 622 CE, the Prophet Muhammed led his followers out
of Mecca to Medina, which signaled the birth of Islam as a political power (Adamson 2016, 20). In the early
years of Islam, theologians prohibited the teaching of Aristotle and other Greek philosophers on the grounds
that they were contrary to the true Muslim faith. This restriction began to give way in the eighth century CE,
which led to the flourishing of philosophy in the Islamic world.

As the Roman Empire declined, the Muslim world safeguarded ancient philosophical Greek and Latin texts
through major centers of learning in Alexandria, Baghdad, and Cordova. Islamic philosophers published major
works in metaphysics, epistemology, and natural philosophy. Key Islamic scholars who carried classical
philosophy forward include Ibn Sina (whose Latin name became Avicenna), Ibn Rushd (whose name was
Latinized to Averroes), and Al-Gazali. Of these three, Ibn Sina is the linchpin of Muslim philosophy. His genius
inaugurates the shift from an early period focused on the consolidation of Greek learning to a later period of
philosophical and scientific innovation (Adamson 2016).

Ibn Sina (Avicenna)

Ab-Al al-usayn ibn-Abdallh Ibn-Sn (c. 970-1037 CE) was a Persian polymath who published works in
philosophy, medicine, astronomy, alchemy, geography, mathematics, Islamic theology, and even poetry.
Because of the vast scope of Ibn Sina's intellectual endeavors, he is considered the linchpin between Islamic
philosophy's formative phase and its more creative phase during the Golden Age of Islam, which extends from
roughly the 8th through the 13th centuries. During this period, Islamic culture and learning flourished, and
the Muslim-ruled lands spread from the Middle East, through Northern Africa, and into the Iberian Peninsula.
Taking his cue from Aristotle, Ibn Sina sought to present a complete philosophy that would address both
theoretical and practical philosophy. Some have estimated that Ibn Sina published as many as 450 works,
though others place the figure at under 100 (Namazi 2001).

Ibn Sina's work was highly influential within both the Muslim and the Christian world. His proof of the
126 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

existence of God became predominant. Called the Proof of the Truthful, the argument proposed that existence
requires that there be a necessary entity--an entity that cannot not exist. Elements of the material
world--animals, plants, rivers, mountains--are contingent--that is, they come and go. They may have existed in
the past but do not exist now, or they may exist now but will not exist in the future. Therefore, they can not
exist. Therefore, there must be a nonmaterial entity that causes this material world to come into existence.

Much like Aristotle, Ibn Sina believed that the rational order of the universe was comprehensible by our human
minds, and his well-ordered and complete philosophical project demonstrated this (Gutas 2016). Ibn Sina's
most influential book is the Canon, a five-volume medical encyclopedia that--translated into Latin and
Hebrew--became the textbook for the study of medicine in European universities from the 12th to the 17th
century (Amr and Tbakhi 2007). Ibn Sina's epistemology--and in particular, his development of an empiricism
that advances far beyond the Epicureans and is, in fact, comparable to that of John Locke--has received less
attention.

Ibn Sina, similar to Locke, proposed that humans are born with a rational soul that is a blank slate. The child
possesses the five external senses associated with the animal soul (sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch) and
two internal senses of the human rational soul, memory and imagination. The child gathers and stores
information from the senses and is able to abstract intelligible concepts about the world from this sensual data
and about the human soul (rationality) through reflection (which Locke later calls experience). So, a child in a
high chair might drop food and observe that it falls to the floor, based on experience, but a child through
reflection also observes a causal relationship. For Ibn Sina, gravity exists both in the materialist realm of the
senses and in the cognitive realm of the mind or soul. Like gravity, numbers exist in both realms, the abstract
concept of the number two and concrete pairs of objects, such as two shoes or two apples. He explains in The
Metaphysics of Healing, "Number has an existence in things and an existence in the soul" (quoted in Tahiri
2016, 41).

The child's mind organizes this information--making generalizations, separating out the essential from the
nonessential, and affirming or negating relationships. Through this process, the child forms definitions and
propositions that reflect the logical and mathematical modes of rational thought (Gutas 2012).

Ibn Sina stated that all knowledge is a result either of forming concepts or acknowledging the truth of
propositions. He distinguished different types of propositions, each of which have different sources and
therefore different ways to prove or disprove the proposition. Table 4.2 lists 5 of Ibn Sina's 16 types of
propositions and examples (Gutas 2012).

Type of Proposition                                             Example

Sense data                                     Grass is green.

TABLE 4.2 Types of Propositions Proposed by Ibn Sina

Some types of propositions, such as sense data and data based on reflection, are knowledge based on the
external or internal senses. Tested data, however, can be accepted as true only after repeated observation and
attribution to a cause. For example, "fire causes burns" would be based on the observations that fire is hot, hot
things burn objects (cause), and flesh is an object. The truth of data provided by multiple reports can only be

confirmed if it has been reported by so many sources that it is highly unlikely to be a falsehood.
Building on Aristotle's idea of induction conveyed in Posterior Analytics, Ibn Sina developed a scientific
methodology of experimentation in his treatise "On Demonstration" within his Book of Healing. Induction
involves making an inference based on observations. Ibn Sina stated that--unlike untested
induction--experimentation provides the basis of certain knowledge. He used the example of the relationship
between consuming the plant scammony and purging (vomiting). He noted that the observation of a positive
correlation does not prove that the relationship exists but rather that the lack of observation of a negative
correlation (cases in which scammony did not cause purging) provides stronger evidence. Ibn Sina's
experimentation involved a search for falsification of a correlation--just like the scientific method used today,
which, for example incorporates control groups (McGinnis 2003). Furthermore, Ibn Sina insisted that a causal
term be inserted into the relationship that is observed. It is not scammony that causes purging but a property
that scammony has that requires further investigation. So Ibn Sina's argument is (1) scammony has the power
to purge, (2) scammony causes purging, (3) a power to purge causes purging. Exactly what the power to purge
is remains uncertain until further investigation. In the first example above, the cause is established: (1) fire
burns flesh, (2) fire is hot, (3) heat burns flesh.
As advancement of experimental knowledge challenged Islamic theology, debate emerged over how to
reconcile faith and science.

Ibn Rushd (Averroes)
Ibn Rushd (1126-1198), known as Averroes in the Latin world, was born into a family of jurists in Cordova in
Andalusia, or Muslim-ruled Spain. Like Ibn Sina, his philosophy took its inspiration from Aristotle. Like Ibn
Sina and Aristotle, his work ranged across a number of domains, from metaphysics and logic through
medicine and natural philosophy. Much of this work took the form of commentaries on Aristotle. He thought
that the Neoplatonic interpretation of Aristotle had distorted the original meaning of Aristotle's work and
sought a return to Aristotle's original works in his commentaries. Ibn Rushd was pivotal to the revival of
Aristotle in Europe. The tradition of commentary on Aristotle's works that developed among Islamic
philosophers developed Aristotle's thought in fascinating ways and kept Aristotle scholarship alive.
Ibn Rushd saw demonstration as the key to logic and the condition for philosophical certainty and scientific
reasoning (Ben Ahmed and Pasnau 2021). This had important theological implications and led to
128 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

       confrontations with theologians who believed that philosophical reflection was at odds with the Muslim faith.
       He sought to demonstrate the existence of God by showing that his creation was fine-tuned for humans in a
       way that could not be simply a matter of chance. In addition, he advanced an argument, taken up today by
       intelligent design advocates, that holds that it is not possible to explain the complexity of living beings without
       a creator.

       Even as philosophy gained ground in the Islamic world, theological traditionalists remained influential. These
       traditionalists denied that reason could bring one closer to God. Ibn Rushd was among a number of
       philosophers who opposed this traditionalism and sought to show the compatibility of faith and reason. Not
       only did Ibn Rushd seek to show that reason was compatible with faith, he went further and cited Quranic
       scripture to show that religion required philosophical reflection. He wrote, "Many Quranic verses, such as
       `Reflect, you have a vision' (59.2) and `they give thought to the creation of heaven and earth' (3:191), command
       human intellectual reflection upon God and his creation" (quoted in Hiller 2016).

       Al-Ghazali, The Incoherence of the Philosophers

       Al-Ghazali (c.1056-1111) was one of the most prominent Sunni Muslim theologians and philosophers. Writing
       in a period after the initial establishment of the Sunni sect, he sought to refute various challenges to its
       teachings from both Shi'ite religious scholars and philosophers. In his most well-known work, The
       Incoherence of the Philosophers, Al-Ghazali sought to refute these challenges while also strengthening the
       theological basis for Sunnism. Ibn Rushd wrote a refutation of Al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the
       Philosophers. In it, he argues against Al-Ghazali's claim that philosophical reflection must remain distinct
       from the Muslim faith and that mystical union with Allah or God is the only true path to religious
       enlightenment. This dispute between Al-Ghazali and Ibn Rushd represents the conflict between faith and
       reason that characterized medieval Islam. This same conflict remains relevant in the present.

      Late Medieval Philosophy in Christian Europe

       Christian philosophy during this period is influenced by the development of two institutions: the university
       and the monastery. The development of these institutions influenced the form that philosophy would take
       during this period. It was in these institutions that a systematic effort was made to combine philosophy and
       theology in the Christian world. The attempt to reconcile challenges posed to theology by philosophy is
       illustrated in the voluminous work of Bonaventure (1221-1274) and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274).

       Bonaventure

       Bonaventure, a Franciscan friar from Italy, traveled to the University of Paris in 1235, where he encountered
       Aristotle, the Islamic philosophers, and a rigorous course of logic. Bonaventure fused Augustinian ideas with
       Aristotle. In his illumination argument, he argued that God is the source of all knowledge but that "knowledge
       of the divine truth is impressed on every soul" (quoted in Houser 1999, 98). The acquisition of knowledge
       proceeds from effect, the outward world that we observe, to its cause, God. Knowledge is acquired through
       reasoning, using abstract ideas, propositions, and observed correlations, but certainty about this knowledge is
       only obtained through Augustine's process of inner reflection or meditation through which we see the
       unchangeable divine light.

       Thomas Aquinas

       Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) is the quintessential Scholastic philosopher, whose many works determined the
       course of European philosophy for generations. Somewhat like Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) several centuries
       later, philosophers after Aquinas knew that they would have to contend with his writings, either by extending
       his project or critiquing it. Aquinas saw that Scholastic philosophy needed to be reinvigorated, and he
       introduced the work of Jewish and Islamic philosophers to medieval Christian thought, bringing new ideas and
       approaches to philosophy (Van Norden 2017).

       Aquinas is probably best known for his five ways to demonstrate the existence of God. The five ways are

                                                                                                                          4.3 · Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Philosophy 129

considered natural theology because Aquinas does not depend upon the authority of the church to justify the
existence of God. Instead, he writes that we can define God in five ways: as an unmoved mover, first cause,
necessary being, absolute being, and grand designer. In order to avoid an infinite regress, we must assume an
unmoved mover who put all the entities into motion. Similarly, God is the first cause of everything that exists,
or else we face an infinite causal regress. Everything that exists has contingent existence, save for God. God is
the necessary being upon which every contingent being depends. Contingent beings have qualities that are
relative to one another (bigger and smaller, etc.), which entails an absolute being to whom all these are relative.
Finally, the evidence of design in the world implies a grand designer. All natural bodies act to achieve an end.
For example, an acorn gives rise to a tree. However, not all natural bodies are aware of and able to direct
themselves to achieve this end. Therefore, an intelligent being must exist to guide these natural beings toward
their end.

We can see Aristotle's influence in the metaphysics and epistemology of Aquinas as well as in his ethics and
political philosophy. Aristotle defined God as the prime mover and "thought thinking itself." We can discern
the influence of this idea in Aquinas's Five Ways. Aquinas also adopted Aristotle's virtue ethics and adapted
them to his Christian context.

Jewish Philosophers in the Christian and Islamic Worlds

Although Jewish people did not enjoy equal status in Europe, Africa, and Asia, they did contribute to medieval
philosophy in both the Christian and Islamic worlds. Perhaps the two most notable Jewish scholars of this
period were Moses Maimonides and Levi ben Gershom.

Moses Maimonides

Moses ben Maimon, or Maimonides (1138-1204), was a physician, Torah scholar, and astronomer in addition
to being a philosopher. Born in Cordova in Muslim-ruled Spain, he served as the personal physician of Saladin,
the political and military leader of Muslim forces during the Second and Third Crusades.

Like many medieval thinkers across the various traditions of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, Maimonides's
philosophical work begins with the question concerning the relationship between theology and philosophy. His
most well-known work, The Guide for the Perplexed (1190), is addressed to a student trying to decide which
field of inquiry to pursue.

To the ancient Greek philosophers, God is the unmoved mover that sets into motion all other existence in a
universe that has always existed. This conception of God conflicts with both the story of creation and with the
idea of miracles, which necessitate intervention. These conflicts created perplexity in the minds of
Maimonides's student and other Jews. This conflict came about, Maimonides proposed, because philosophers
developed doctrines that do not follow from objective evidence and reason, whereas theologians erroneously
interpreted religious texts literally (Bokser 1947).

Maimonides claimed that biblical literalism was the main reason people could not get closer to God. Instead,
biblical texts ought to be interpreted figuratively. Typical of medieval thinkers in these traditions, Maimonides
was a systematic thinker who held that ultimate truths akin to Platonic forms remain forever true in the mind
of God, which our finite minds seek to apprehend. Adam and Eve comprehended these truths prior to the Fall,
but in the post-Fall world, we can only approximate them. Literalism and a materialist conception of God are
the two forces keeping us from a fuller knowledge.

Maimonides presents a demythologized conception of the divine that influences later thinkers, Spinoza among
them. Like Xenophanes before him, Maimonides rejects anthropomorphic religious elements, such as God in
human form. Although Maimonides grants that picturing the divine in human terms may be necessary for
young believers, adherents should get over this tendency as they mature, as it obscures the true nature of the
divine. The true nature of the divine is captured in the central prayer of Jewish faith, the Sh'ma: "Hear, oh,
Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one." God is one--unity that is expressed in the biblical reference to God as
130 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

       ein sof--without end. Maimonides argued that God cannot be broken into parts or assigned attributes. The
       Bible refers to God's rod and staff, but this is figurative and should not be taken literally (Robinson 2000).
       When the Bible refers to God as merciful or gracious, these are not moral attributes of God. Rather,
       Maimonides explained, God has performed actions--set into motion events--that if performed by a human, we
       would perceive as merciful or gracious (Putnam 1997).

       FIGURE 4.10 Although deeply religious, Maimonides opposed both literal interpretations of the Bible and
       anthropomorphized images of God, arguing that God cannot be imagined or even assigned attributes. This statue of
       Maimonides stands in his birthplace of Cordoba, Spain. (credit: "Maimónides" by Marco Chiesa/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
       Just as often we often understand God's attributes as analogous to human attributes, we often liken God's
       knowledge to human knowledge. This sort of analogical thinking is misguided, Maimonides argued. Human
       knowledge is finite and quantifiable, as is human power. God's knowledge and power are infinite and hence not
       the finite knowledge and power familiar to us. We may perceive God as gracious, but what we see as gracious is
       not God but an attribute of his action. "Every attribute that is found in the books of the deity . . . is therefore an
       attribute of His action and not an attribute of His essence" (Maimonides 1963, 121). This leads Maimonides to
       a radical negative theology asserting that human knowledge cannot conceive of what God is but only of what
       God is not. Humans can only ascribe attributes to God's actions and not God's essence. The role of revelation,
       as transmitted through the Jewish Bible, was not to acquaint us with knowledge of God but rather to guide us to
       our highest ends--and in doing so, we come as close to God as is possible (Bokser 1947). Maimonides's
       negative theology was radical and was challenged, perhaps most notably, by St. Thomas Aquinas.
       Levi ben Gershom (Gersonides)
       Like Maimonides, Gersonides (1288-1344) sought to demonstrate the compatibility between Jewish faith and
       reason. His most well-known work, Wars of the Lord, takes up the problem of the relationship between Torah
       or Jewish scripture on the one hand and reason on the other. Gersonides also made major contributions to the
       scientific study of astronomy. Applying mathematical calculations to data he collected using tools that he
       himself created, Gersonides concluded that several principles advanced by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy
       were wrong. For Gersonides, reason was both mathematical and empirical. He built upon the work of

Maimonides and Averroes, and his work can be read as an effort to understand Aristotle through these
predecessors.

The Rise of Reason in the Early Modern Era

Although scholars agree that the early modern era ended with the 1789 French Revolution, there is still much
debate about when it began. Some mark the beginning as the 1453 Ottoman conquest of Constantinople that
drove scholars of the East into the West, carrying with them knowledge of Islamic intellectual advances. Some
look to the Age of Discovery sparked by the Ottoman victory and the subsequent closing down of European
access to trade routes (Goldstone 2009). Others point to the 1543 publication of Nicolas Copernicus's text On
the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, refuting the heliocentric theory that proposed the solar system
revolved around the sun. In philosophy, the early modern era is delineated by the rapid advancement of
natural philosophy, which in turn sparked the scientific revolution. This development relied upon the ability of
scholars and clerics to openly question religious orthodoxy as the sole, authoritative source of truth and to
instead seek answers through human reason.

Nicolaus Copernicus

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), born in Poland and raised by his uncle who was a bishop in the Catholic
Church, matriculated from the University of Krakow. Although appointed a canon in the Catholic Church, he
was able to continue his studies in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine at universities in Padua and
Bologna in Italy. At the time, the Catholic Church espoused the ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy's geocentric
model of the solar system, in which the sun and the planets revolve around Earth. However, Copernicus's
mathematical analysis of the astronomical data indicated that Earth and other planets revolved around the
sun. As a canon in the Catholic Church, Copernicus feared to publish this data and sat on his discovery for over
two decades. It was only after his colleague and friend Lutheran professor of mathematics Georg Joachim
Rheticus published Copernican ideas in Narratio Prima in 1540 that Copernicus released On the Revolutions
of the Heavenly Spheres in 1543. In an attempt to shield himself and his work, he dedicated the manuscript to
the pope.

         READ LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

Read this excerpt from the preface of On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, which was dedicated to Pope
Paul III. How does Copernicus's use of the word consensus shift the authority for truth from the church to natural
philosophers?

      Those who know that the consensus of many centuries has sanctioned the conception that the earth
      remains at rest in the middle of the heavens as its center, would, I reflected, regard it as an insane
      pronouncement if I made the opposite assertion that the earth moves. . . . Therefore, when I considered
      this carefully, the contempt which I had to fear because of the novelty and apparent absurdity of my view,
      nearly induced me to abandon utterly the work I had begun.

      Therefore, when I considered this carefully, the contempt which I had to fear because of the novelty and
      apparent absurdity of my view, nearly induced me to abandon utterly the work I had begun. Not a few other
      very eminent and scholarly men made the same request, urging that I should no longer through fear refuse
      to give out my work for the common benefit of students of Mathematics. Therefore I would not have it
      unknown to Your Holiness, the only thing which induced me to look for another way of reckoning the
      movements of the heavenly bodies was that I knew that mathematicians by no means agree in their
      investigation thereof.

Zera Yacob

Whereas Copernicus did not directly challenge church authority, the Ethiopian scholar Zera Yacob
132 4 · The Emergence of Classical Philosophy

       (1592-1692) did. Yacob, born in the district of Axum within the Ethiopian Empire, studied Christian, Jewish,
       and Islamic thought. Ethiopia had adopted Christianity as the state religion in 330 CE. The Christian kingdom
       resisted Islamic conquest for hundreds of years. By 1540, however, Ahmed Gragn, supported by the Ottoman
       Empire based in Turkey, succeeded in capturing much of the kingdom. The Ethiopian emperor then appealed
       to Portugal for support. Portugal sent troops that helped Ethiopia regain its territory. In the years that followed,
       Jesuit missionaries from Portugal arrived in Ethiopia and converted Emperor Susenyos from Ethiopian
       Orthodox Christianity to Catholicism. When Ethiopian Emperor Susenyos declared Catholicism the state
       religion in 1622, a civil war broke out. Yacob was forced to flee to the countryside. There, he composed much of
       Hatata (Inquiry), published in 1668 after the emperor's death.
       Although deeply religious, Yacob argued against the supremacy of one religion over another. Rather, he
       counseled that we must rely on reason to evaluate religious tracts and traditions--and in this way, reach God.
       For Yacob, God is not only the master of all things, but he also understands all things: "He is intelligent who
       understands all, for he created us as intelligent from the abundance of his intelligence" (Yacob 1976, 8). God
       had a purpose in creating humans as intelligent beings, and that purpose was for humans "to look for him and
       to grasp him and his wisdom in the path he has opened for [them] and to worship him as long as [they] live"
       (Yacob 1976, 8).
       The method of inquiry Yacob proposed echoes the ideas of Augustine and Aquinas. It involves reflection,
       observation, and connecting to a God-given light, our reason. Yacob explained that "he who investigates with
       the pure intelligence set by the creator in the heart of each man and scrutinizes the order and laws of creation,
       will discover the truth" (Yacob 1976, 9). However, using scrutiny and reason, Yacob rejected some religious
       doctrine, in a manner that Augustine and Aquinas would have seen as sacrilegious. He discarded all beliefs
       that he judged to not agree with the "wisdom of the creator," which he said we can know by observing "the
       order and laws of creation." While accepting Moses as a prophet, Yacob rejected the stories of the miracles
       Moses is said to have performed. Similarly, Yacob called into question Mohammed's miracles. Yacob believed
       that in the beginning, God had established the laws by which the world worked. Why would God violate his own
       laws by allowing some individuals to perform miracles? In Yacob's view, the stories of these miracles arose
       instead from false human understanding.
       Yacob, Copernicus, and others had to challenge religious authorities in arguing for a truth based on reason,
       mathematical logic, and scientific observation. However, by the 18th century, governments began to embrace
       these methods and establish schools and institutes to expand knowledge of the natural world. This period of
       change is known as the Enlightenment. This process, as well as the rapid development and implementation of
       new technologies and the spread of capitalism, is often referred to as modernization.
       Much of the remainder of this text examines the ideas of thinkers who lived during the Enlightenment as well
       as later in the modern era. They laid out the foundations for scientific inquiry, laid down the arguments for
       government based on popular representation rather than divine rule, and proposed economic systems
       designed to create wealth, which freed societies from feudal bonds. In doing so, these thinkers studied the
       works of classical and medieval philosophy while advancing ideas about metaphysics, epistemology, and
       ethics that this text examines in the chapters that are to come.

Summary

4.1 Historiography and the History of Philosophy

Scholars adopt three main approaches to the history of philosophy. The presentist approach to the history of
philosophy examines philosophical texts for the arguments they contain and judges whether their conclusions
remain relevant for philosophical concerns today. While making the wisdom of the past available for present
applications, this approach has been critiqued on two points: 1) in reading philosophical texts too narrowly,
past philosophers are judged by contemporary standards; 2) this approach may also result in anachronistic
errors, as ideas from contemporary philosophy may be inaccurately attributed to historical philosophers. A
contextualist approach interprets philosophy in terms of the historical and cultural contexts in which it was
written. While this approach can yield deep understanding of historical moments and historical ways of
thinking, it can be blind to the lasting value of philosophical inquiry. A hermeneutic approach attempts to take
the best of the presentist and contextualists approaches, viewing the historical context of original texts
seriously but also recognizing that our interpretation of history is connected to and conditioned by our
contemporary context.

4.2 Classical Philosophy

Classical Greek philosophy owes much to Egyptian scholarship emanating from Heliopolis, as both Pythagoras
and Plato are believed to have studied at that center of learning. Indeed, the Plimpton 332 clay tablet reveals
that Babylonian mathematicians knew not only of the Pythagorean theorem of right triangles but also of
trigonometric functions. Classical philosophy emerged in ancient Greece with the Presocratics; the three great
philosophers Socrates (470-399 BCE), Plato (c. 428-347 BCE), and Aristotle (384-322 BCE); and schools of
thought that came after--Epicureans, stoics, and others. From what remains of the works of the Presocratics,
they were primarily interested in questions of metaphysics and natural philosophy. Some Presocratics, such as
Parmenides, were monists while others, such as Heraclitus, were plurists. Plato advanced a theory of the
forms, a metaphysical doctrine that holds that every particular thing that exists participates in an immaterial
form or essence that gives this thing its identity. The invisible realm of the forms differs fundamentally from
the changing realm we experience in this world. The invisible realm is eternal, unchanging, and perfect.
Aristotle's work centers on his doctrine of the four causes: "What's it made of?" (material cause), "What shape
does it have?" (formal cause), "What agent gave it this form?" (efficient cause), and, finally, "What is its end
goal?" (final cause). The four causes can explain nature of all things in this universe, including the universe
itself. Aristotle's universe is a closed system of final causes. Each final cause leads to another, until we get to
the first cause or prime mover.

4.3 Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Philosophy

Greek and Roman imperialism in the Middle East and North Africa brought Jews--and later, Christians--into
the intellectual sphere of Hellenism. Jewish and later Christian scholars incorporated ideas of classical Greek
and Roman philosophy into their own theological studies. As Arab conquerors and traders expanded into the
Middle East and Africa, the Muslim world adopted and advanced classical philosophy and the natural sciences.
Yet a tension at all times runs through these works as philosophers tried to balance theological revelation and
freedom of intellectual exploration. Unlike the classical Greek and Roman philosophers, the Jewish, Christian,
or Muslim philosopher always works with a partner, the events and facts central to the religion. It is only in the
early modern age that philosophers replace the primacy of God as the source of truth with reason.

5.1 Philosophical Methods for Discovering Truth
5.2 Logical Statements
5.3 Arguments
5.4 Types of Inferences
5.5 Informal Fallacies

INTRODUCTION Within the philosopher's toolkit, logic is arguably the most powerful tool, and certainly it gets
the most use. Logic, the study of reasoning, aims to formalize and describe reasoning processes used to arrive
at claims. Logic is a study of both how we do reason and how we ought to reason. Logicians categorize and
explain different forms of successful reasoning along with mistakes in reasoning, with the goal of
understanding what to do right and what to avoid. This chapter seeks to provide you with a general
understanding of the discipline of logic.

     5.1 Philosophical Methods for Discovering Truth

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the role that dialectics plays in logic and reasoning.
         · Define "argument" and "negation of a argument."
         · Define the laws of noncontradiction and the excluded middle.

       Like most academic disciplines, the goal of philosophy is to get closer to the truth. Logic, reasoning, and
       argumentation are the predominant methods used. But unlike many other disciplines, philosophy does not
       contain a large body of accepted truths or canonical knowledge. Indeed, philosophy is often known for its
       uncertainty because it focuses on questions for which we do not yet have ways of definitively answering. The
       influential 20th-century philosopher Bertrand Russell explains that "as soon as definite knowledge concerning
       any subject becomes possible, the subject ceases to be called philosophy, and becomes a separate science"
       (1912, 240).

       Because philosophy focuses on questions we do not yet have ways of definitively answering, it is as much a
       method of thinking as it is a body of knowledge. And logic is central to this method. Thinking like a philosopher
       involves thinking critically about alternative possibilities. To answer the question of whether there is a God (a
       question for which we lack a definitive method of answering), we can look at things we believe we know and
       then critically work through what those ideas entail about the existence or possible characteristics of God. We
       can also imagine God exists or God does not exist and then reason through what either possibility implies
       about the world. In imagining alternative possibilities, we must critically work through what each possibility
       must entail. Changing one belief can set off a cascade of implications for further beliefs, altering much of what
       we accept as true. And so, in studying philosophy, we need to get used to the possibility that our beliefs could
       be wrong. We use reason to do philosophy, and logic is the study of reason. Hence, logic helps us get closer to
       the truth.

      Dialectics and Philosophical Argumentation

       Philosophers love to argue. But this love does not mean that philosophy lectures are loud, contentious events.
       Most people think of an argument as a verbal disagreement, and the term evokes images of raised voices,
       heightened emotions, and possibly bad behavior. However, in philosophy, this word does not have a negative
       connotation. An argument in philosophy is a reasoned position--to argue is simply to offer a set of reasons in
       support of some conclusion. The goal of an individual argument is to support a conclusion. However, the long-
       term goal of argumentation between philosophers is to get closer to the truth. In contemporary academic
       philosophy, philosophers are engaged in dialogue with each other where they offer arguments in the
       publication of articles. Philosophers also engage in argument at conferences and in paper presentations and
       lectures. In this way, contemporary academic philosophers are engaged in a dialectic of sorts.

       A traditional dialectic is a debate or discussion between at least two people who hold differing views. But
       unlike debate, participants in the discussion do not have the goal of "winning," or proving that the other view is
       wrong. Rather, the goal is to get closer to the truth. Thus, dialectics make use of logic and reason, while debates
       often use rhetorical ploys or appeal to the emotions. Because of the tendency of participants to appeal to
       emotion and prejudice in many modern popular debates, philosophers often qualify their words and refer to
       reasoned debate when discussing proper public discourse between people. But even reasoned debates can
       become adversarial, while dialectics are mostly collaborative. The participants in a dialectic, whom
       philosophers refer to as "interlocuters," enter into discourse with the aim of trading their poor or false beliefs
       for knowledge.

       Dialectics usually start with a question. An interlocuter offers an answer to the question, which is then
       scrutinized by all participants. Reasons against the answer are given, and someone may offer a
       counterexample to the answer--that is, a case that illustrates that the answer is wrong. The interlocuters will

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                       5.1 · Philosophical Methods for Discovering Truth 141

then analyze why the answer is wrong and try to locate its weakness. The interlocuters may also examine what
made the answer plausible in the first place. Next, someone offers another answer to the question--possibly a
refined version of the previous answer that has been adjusted in light of the weaknesses and strengths
identified in the analysis. This process is repeated over and over, with each iteration theoretically bringing
participants closer to the truth.

While dialectics aims at the truth, the creation of knowledge is not its sole function. For example, a long, deep
conversation with a friend about the meaning of life should not be viewed as a failure if you do not come up
with a satisfactory answer to life's purpose. In this instance, the process has as much value as the aim (getting
closer to the truth). Contemporary academic philosophers view their practice in the same way.

Indian Dialectics and Debate

Dialectics played an important role in early Indian philosophy. The earliest known philosophical writings
originate in India as sections of the Vedas, which have been dated as far back as 1500 BCE (Mark 2020). The
Vedas are often considered religious texts, but it is more accurate to think of them as religious and
philosophical texts since they explore what it means to be a human being, discuss the purpose and function of
the mind, and attempt to identify the goal of life. The Upanishads, which are the most philosophical of the
Vedic texts, often take the form of dialogues. These dialogues generally occur between two participants--one
who knows a truth and the other who seeks to know and understand the truth. The Vedic dialectics explore
fundamental concepts such as Brahman (the One without a second, which includes the universe as its
manifestation), dharma (an individual's purpose and duty), and atman (an individual's higher self). As in many
dialectics, questioning, reasoning, and realizations that arise through the dialogue are the aim of these texts.

Buddhist philosophical texts that were part of early Indian philosophy also contain narrative dialogues (Gillon
2021). Logical argumentation is evident in these, and as time progressed, texts became more focused on
argument, particularly those relying on analogical reasoning, or the use of analogies. Analogies use an object
that is known to draw inferences about other similar objects. Over time, the analogical arguments used in
Buddhist texts took on structure. When arguments have structure, they rely on a form that captures a specific
manner of reasoning, such that the reasoning can be schematized. As an example, consider the following
argument that appears in the Caraka-sahit (CS 3.8.31) (Gillon 2021). The argument has been slightly altered
to aid in understanding.

Soul Analogical Argument

1. The soul is eternal.
2. Space is eternal and it is unproduced.
3. Therefore, the soul is eternal because it is unproduced.

Analogical Argument Form

1. X has property P.
2. Y has property P and property S.
3. Therefore, X has property S because it has property P

As you will see later in the section on deductive argumentation, relying on argumentative structure is a feature
of logical reasoning.

Classical Indian philosophical texts also refer to the occurrence of reasoned public debates. Public debate was
a further method of rational inquiry and likely the main mode of rational inquiry that most people had access
to. One mode of debate took the form of assemblies in which experts considered specific topics, including
those in politics and law (Gillon 2021). Arguments are the public expression of private inferences, and only by
exposing one's private thoughts through argument can they be tested. Public arguments are a method to
improve one's reasoning when it is scrutinized by others.

       Greek Dialectics and Debate
       Ancient Greek philosophy is also known for its use of dialectic and debate. Socrates, perhaps the most famous
       ancient Greek philosopher, claimed that knowledge is true opinion backed by argument (Plato, Meno).
       "Opinion" here means unjustified belief: your beliefs could be true, but they cannot count as knowledge unless
       you have reasons for them and can offer justifications for your beliefs when questioned by others.
       Furthermore, Socrates's method of gaining knowledge was to engage in dialectics with others. All of what we
       know about Socrates is through the writings of others--particularly the writings of Plato. Quite appropriately,
       Plato uses dialogues in all his works, in which Socrates is almost always a participant.
       Socrates never wrote anything down. In the Phaedrus, one of Plato's dialogues, Socrates criticizes written
       works as being a dead discourse of sorts. Books cannot respond to you when you ask questions. He states,
       "You'd think they were speaking as if they had some understanding, but if you question anything that has been
       said because you want to learn more, it continues to signify just the very same thing forever" (Phaedrus, 275e).
       Clearly, dialectics was central to Socrates's philosophical method.

       Plato's dialogues are a testament to the importance of public discourse as a form of rational inquiry in ancient
       Greece. Based on Greek philosophical writings, we can assume reasoned public debate took place and that
       Socrates preferred it as a method of teaching and learning. In Plato's dialogues, many questions are asked, and
       Socrates's interlocuters offer answers to which Socrates asks further clarifying questions. Through the process
       of questioning, false beliefs and inadequate understanding are exposed. Socrates's goal was not simply to offer
       people truth. Rather, through questioning, Socrates guides people to discover the truth on their own, provided
       they are willing to keep an open mind and admit, when necessary, that they are in the wrong. In Plato's
       dialogues, participants don't always land on a determinate answer, but they as well as readers are always left
       with a clearer understanding of the correct way to reason.
       If any ancient Greek philosopher most embodies the tie between dialectic and logic, it is Aristotle (c. 384-322
       BCE), who was a student of Plato. Aristotle wrote books on the art of dialectic (Smith 2020). And he probably
       participated in gymnastic dialectic--a structured dialectic contest practiced in the Academy (the school
       founded by Plato, which Aristotle attended). But more importantly, Aristotle created a complex system of logic
       upon which skill in the art of dialectic relied. Aristotle's logic is the earliest formal systematized account of
       inference we know of and was considered the most accurate and complete system until the late 19th century
       (Smith 2020). Aristotle's system is taught in logic classes to this day.

The Use of Reason to Discover Truth

Reasoning allows us to hypothesize, work out consequences of our hypotheses, run thought experiments,
assess the coherence of a set of beliefs, and generate plausible explanations of the world around us. As Chapter
1 explained, coherence is the property of consistency in a set of beliefs. Thus, when a set of beliefs is
inconsistent, it is not possible for every belief in the set to be true. We must use reason to determine whether a
set of beliefs is consistent and work out the logical implications of beliefs, given their truth. In this way, reason
can be used to discover truth.
The rules of logic are like the rules of math; you cannot make 1 + 1 = 3. Indeed, math is a form of deductive
reasoning that ensures truth. Answers to problems in math are derived using known functions and rules,
which is also true in logic. Unlike math, however, not all of logic can guarantee correct answers. Nonetheless,
logic supplies means by which to derive better answers--answers that are more likely to be true. Because logic
is the study of proper reasoning, and proper reasoning is an essential tool for discovering truth, logic is
foundational to the pursuit of learning.

Testing Hypotheses

A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for an observed process or phenomenon. Human beings formulate
hypotheses because they wish to answer specific questions about the world. Usually, the sciences come to
mind when we think of the word "hypothesis." However, hypotheses can be created on many subjects, and
chances are that you have created many hypotheses without realizing it. For example, if you often come home
and find that one of your outside potted plants has been knocked over, you might hypothesize that "the wind
must have knocked that one over." In doing so, you answer the question, "Why is that plant often knocked
over?" Generating and testing hypotheses engages different forms of reasoning-- abduction, induction, and
deduction--all of which will be explained in further detail below.
Clearly, simply coming up with a hypothesis isn't enough for us to gain knowledge; rather, we must use logic to
144 5 · Logic and Reasoning

       test the truth of our supposition. Of course, the aim of testing hypotheses is to get to the truth. In testing we
       often formulate if-then statements: "If it is windy, then my plant will get knocked over" or "If nitrogen levels
       are high in the river, then algae will grow." If-then statements in logic are called conditionals and are testable.
       For example, we can keep a log registering the windy days, cross-checked against the days on which the plant
       was found knocked over, to test our if-then hypothesis.
       Reasoning is also used to assess the evidence collected for testing and to determine whether the test itself is
       good enough for drawing a reliable conclusion. In the example above, if on no windy days is the plant knocked
       over, logic demands that the hypothesis be rejected. If the plant is sometimes knocked over on windy days,
       then the hypothesis needs refinement (for example, wind direction or wind speed might be a factor in when
       the plant goes down). Notice that logic and reasoning play a role in every step of the process: creating
       hypotheses, figuring out how to test them, compiling data, analyzing results, and drawing a conclusion.

       FIGURE 5.3 "If it is windy, the plant will be knocked over" is a testable hypothesis. If the plant is found knocked
       over on days that aren't windy, another force may be responsible. Hypotheses help philosophers, as well as
       scientists, answer specific questions about the world. (credit: "strollin' with Fräulein Zeiss - 5" by torne (where's my
       lens cap?)/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
       We've been looking at an inconsequential example--porch plants. But testing hypotheses is serious business in
       many fields, such as when pharmaceutical companies test the efficacy of a drug in treating a life-threatening
       illness. Good reasoning requires researchers to gather enough data to compare an experimental group and
       control group (patients with the illness who received the drug and those who did not). If scientists find a
       statistically significant difference in positive outcomes for the experimental group when compared to the
       control group, they can draw the reasonable conclusion that the drug could alleviate illness or even save lives
       in the future.

      Laws of Logic

       Logic, like the sciences, has laws. But while the laws of science are meant to accurately describe observed
       regularities in the natural world, laws of logic can be thought of as rules of thought. Logical laws are rules that
       underlie thinking itself. Some might even argue that it is only by virtue of these laws that we can have reliable
       thoughts. To that extent, laws of logic are construed to be laws of reality itself. To see what is meant by this, let's
       consider the law of noncontradiction.
       Noncontradiction
       To understand the law of noncontradiction, we must first define a few terms. First, a statement is a sentence
       with truth value, meaning that the statement must be true or false. Statements are declarative sentences like
       "Hawaii is the 50th state to have entered the United States" and "You are reading an online philosophy book."
       Sometimes philosophers use the term "proposition" instead of "statement," and the latter term has a slightly
       different meaning. But for our purposes, we will use these terms as synonyms. Second, a negation of a

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                       5.1 · Philosophical Methods for Discovering Truth 145

statement is the denial of that statement. The easiest way to turn a statement into its negation is to add the
qualifier "not." For example, the negation of "My dog is on her bed" is "My dog is not on her bed." Third, a
contradiction is the conjunction of any statement and its negation. We may also say that any statement and its
opposite are contradictory. For example, "My dog is on her bed" and "My dog is not on her bed" are
contradictory because the second is the negation of the first. And when you combine a statement and its
opposite, you get a contradiction: "My dog is on her bed and my dog is not on her bed."

The law of noncontradiction is a law about truth, stating that contradictory propositions cannot be true in the
same sense, at the same time. While my dog may have been on her bed earlier and now she's off barking at
squirrels, it cannot be true right now that my dog is both on her bed and not on her bed. However, some of you
may be thinking about dogs who lie half on their beds and half on the floor (Josie, the dog belonging to the
author of this chapter, is one of them). Can it not be true that such a dog is both on and not on their bed? In this
instance, we must return to the phrase in the same sense. If we decide that "lying on the bed" means "at least
50% of your body is on the bed," then we must maintain that definition when looking at propositions to
determine whether they are contradictory. Thus, if Josie is half out of the bed with her head on the floor, we can
still say "Josie is on the bed." But notice that "Josie is not on the bed" remains false since we have qualified the
meaning of "on the bed."

For Aristotle, the law of noncontradiction is so fundamental that he claims that without it, knowledge would
not be possible--the law is foundational for the sciences, reasoning, and language (Gottlieb 2019). Aristotle
thought that the law of noncontradiction was "the most certain of all principles" because it is impossible for
someone to believe that the same thing both is and is not (1989, 1005b).

The Excluded Middle

The law of the excluded middle is related to the law of noncontradiction. The law of the excluded middle
states that for any statement, either that statement is true, or its negation is true. If you accept that all
statements must be either true or false and you also accept the law of noncontradiction, then you must accept
the law of the excluded middle. If the only available options for truth-bearing statements are that they are true
or false, and if a statement and its negation cannot both be true at the same time, then one of the statements
must be true while the other must be false. Either my dog is on her bed or off her bed right now.

Normativity in Logic

What if Lulu claims that she is 5 feet tall and that she is 7 feet tall? You'd think that she was joking or not being
literal because this is tantamount to saying that she is both 5 feet tall and not 5 feet tall (which is implied by
being 7 feet tall). The statement "I'm 5 feet tall and not 5 feet tall" is a contradiction. Surely Lulu does not
believe a contradiction. We might even think, as Aristotle did, that it is impossible to believe a contradiction.
But even if Lulu could believe a contradiction, we think that she should not. Since we generally believe that
inconsistency in reasoning is something that ought to be avoided, we can say that logic is normative.
Normativity is the assumption that certain actions, beliefs, or other mental states are good and ought to be
pursued or realized. Normativity implies a standard (a norm) to which we ought to conform. Ethics is a
normative discipline because it is the study of how we ought to act. And because we believe people ought to be
logical rather than illogical, we label logic as normative.

While ethics is normative in the realm of actions and behavior, logic is normative in the realm of reasoning.
Some rules of thought, like the law of noncontradiction, seem to be imperative (a command), so logic is a
command of reasoning. Some philosophers argue that logic is what makes reasoning possible (MacFarlane
2002). In their view, logic is a constitutive norm of reasoning--that is, logic constitutes what reasoning is.
Without norms of logic, there would be no reasoning. This view is intuitively plausible: What if your thoughts
proceeded one after the other, with no connection (or ability to detect a connection) between them? Without
logic, you would be unable to even categorize thoughts or reliably attach concepts to the contents of thoughts.
Let's take a closer look at how philosophers use special logical statements to organize their reasoning.

     5.2 Logical Statements

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the necessary and sufficient conditions in conditionals and universal affirmative statements.
         · Describe counterexamples for statements.
         · Assess the truth of conditionals and universal statements using counterexamples.

       Specific types of statements have a particular meaning in logic, and such statements are frequently used by
       philosophers in their arguments. Of particular importance is the conditional, which expresses the logical
       relations between two propositions. Conditional statements are used to accurately describe the world or
       construct a theory. Counterexamples are statements used to disprove a conditional. Universal statements are
       statements that assert something about every member of a set of things and are an alternative way to describe
       a conditional.

      Conditionals

       A conditional is most commonly expressed as an if-then statement, similar to the examples we discussed
       earlier when considering hypotheses. Additional examples of if-then statements are "If you eat your meat,
       then you can have some pudding" and "If that animal is a dog, then it is a mammal." But there are other ways
       to express conditionals, such as "You can have pudding only if you eat your meat" or "All dogs are mammals."
       While these sentences are different, their logical meaning is the same as their correlative if-then sentences
       above.

       All conditionals include two components--that which follows the "if" and that which follows the "then." Any
       conditional can be rephrased in this format. Here is an example:

             Statement 1: You must complete 120 credit hours to earn a bachelor's degree.

             Statement 2: If you expect to graduate, then you must complete 120 credit hours.

       Whatever follows "if" is called the antecedent; whatever follows "then" is called the consequent. Ante means
       "before," as in the word "antebellum," which in the United States refers to anything that occurred or was
       produced before the American Civil War. The antecedent is the first part of the conditional, occurring before
       the consequent. A consequent is a result, and in a conditional statement, it is the result of the antecedent (if
       the antecedent is true).

       Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

       All conditionals express two relations, or conditions: those that are necessary and those that are sufficient. A
       relation is a relationship/property that exists between at least two things. If something is sufficient, it is always
       sufficient for something else. And if something is necessary, it is always necessary for something else. In the
       conditional examples offered above, one part of the relation is required for the other. For example, 120 credit
       hours are required for graduation, so 120 credit hours is necessary if you expect to graduate. Whatever is the
       consequent--that is, whatever is in the second place of a conditional--is necessary for that particular
       antecedent. This is the relation/condition of necessity. Put formally, Y is a necessary condition for X if and
       only if X cannot be true without Y being true. In other words, X cannot happen or exist without Y. Here are a
       few more examples:

         · Being unmarried is a necessary condition for being a bachelor. If you are a bachelor, then you are
             unmarried.

         · Being a mammal is a necessary condition for being a dog. If a creature is a dog, then it is a mammal.

       But notice that the necessary relation of a conditional does not automatically occur in the other direction. Just
       because something is a mammal does not mean that it must be a dog. Being a bachelor is not a necessary
       feature of being unmarried because you can be unmarried and be an unmarried woman. Thus, the

relationship between X and Y in the statement "if X, then Y" is not always symmetrical (it does not
automatically hold in both directions). Y is always necessary for X, but X is not necessary for Y. On the other
hand, X is always sufficient for Y.
Take the example of "If you are a bachelor, then you are unmarried." If you know that Eric is a bachelor, then
you automatically know that Eric is unmarried. As you can see, the antecedent/first part is the sufficient
condition, while the consequent/second part of the conditional is the necessary condition. X is a sufficient
condition for Y if and only if the truth of X guarantees the truth of Y. Thus, if X is a sufficient condition for Y,
then X automatically implies Y. But the reverse is not true. Oftentimes X is not the only way for something to be
Y. Returning to our example, being a bachelor is not the only way to be unmarried. Being a dog is a sufficient
condition for being a mammal, but it is not necessary to be a dog to be a mammal since there are many other
types of mammals.

FIGURE 5.4 All dogs are mammals, but not all mammals are dogs. Being a dog is a sufficient condition for being a
mammal but it is not necessary to be a dog to be a mammal. (credit: "Sheepdog Trials in California" by SheltieBoy/
Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
The ability to understand and use conditionals increases the clarity of philosophical thinking and the ability to
craft effective arguments. For example, some concepts, such as "innocent" or "good," must be rigorously
defined when discussing ethics or political philosophy. The standard practice in philosophy is to state the
meaning of words and concepts before using them in arguments. And oftentimes, the best way to create clarity
is by articulating the necessary or sufficient conditions for a term. For example, philosophers may use a
conditional to clarify for their audience what they mean by "innocent": "If a person has not committed the
crime for which they have been accused, then that person is innocent."
Counterexamples
Sometimes people disagree with conditionals. Imagine a mother saying, "If you spend all day in the sun, you'll
get sunburnt." Mom is claiming that getting sunburnt is a necessary condition for spending all day in the sun.
To argue against Mom, a teenager who wants to go to the beach might offer a counterexample, or an opposing
statement that proves the first statement wrong. The teenager must point out a case in which the claimed
necessary condition does not occur alongside the sufficient one. Regular application of an effective sunblock
with an SPF 30 or above will allow the teenager to avoid sunburn. Thus, getting sunburned is not a necessary
condition for being in the sun all day.
Counterexamples are important for testing the truth of propositions. Often people want to test the truth of
statements to effectively argue against someone else, but it is also important to get into the critical thinking
148 5 · Logic and Reasoning

       habit of attempting to come up with counterexamples for our own statements and propositions. Philosophy
       teaches us to constantly question the world around us and invites us to test and revise our beliefs. And
       generating creative counterexamples is a good method for testing our beliefs.

      Universal Statements

       Another important type of statement is the universal affirmative statement. Aristotle included universal
       affirmative statements in his system of logic, believing they were one of only a few types of meaningful logical
       statements (On Interpretation). Universal affirmative statements take two groups of things and claim all
       members of the first group are also members of the second group: "All A are B." These statements are called
       universal and affirmative because they assert something about all members of group A. This type of statement
       is used when classifying objects and/or the relationships. Universal affirmative statements are, in fact, an
       alternative expression of a conditional.

       Universal Statements as Conditionals

       Universal statements are logically equivalent to conditionals, which means that any conditional can be
       translated into a universal statement and vice versa. Notice that universal statements also express the logical
       relations of necessity and sufficiency. Because universal affirmative statements can always be rephrased as
       conditionals (and vice versa), the ability to translate ordinary language statements into conditionals or
       universal statements is helpful for understanding logical meaning. Doing so can also help you identify
       necessary and sufficient conditions. Not all statements can be translated into these forms, but many can.

       Counterexamples to Universal Statements

       Universal affirmative statements also can be disproven using counterexamples. Take the belief that "All living
       things deserve moral consideration." If you wanted to prove this statement false, you would need to find just
       one example of a living thing that you believe does not deserve moral consideration. Just one will suffice
       because the categorical claim is quite strong--that all living things deserve moral consideration. And someone
       might argue that some parasites, like the protozoa that causes malaria, do not deserve moral consideration.

     5.3 Arguments

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define key components of an argument.
         · Categorize components of sample arguments.
         · Explain the difference between assessing logic and assessing truth.

       As explained at the beginning of the chapter, an argument in philosophy is simply a set of reasons offered in
       support of some conclusion. So an "arguer" is a person who offers reasons for a specific conclusion. Notice
       that the definition does not state that the reasons do support a conclusion (and rather states reasons are
       offered or meant to support a conclusion) because there are bad arguments in which reasons do not support a
       conclusion.

       Arguments have two components: the conclusion and the reasons offered to support it. The conclusion is what
       an arguer wants people to believe. The reasons offered are called premises. Often philosophers will craft a
       numbered argument to make clear each individual claim (premise) given in support of the conclusion. Here is
       an example of a numbered argument:

        1. If someone lives in San Francisco, then they live in California.
        2. If someone lives in California, then they live in the United States.
        3. Hassan lives in San Francisco.
        4. Therefore, Hassan lives in the United States.

Getting to the Premises

The first step in understanding an argument is to identify the conclusion. Ask yourself what you think the main
point or main idea is. Can you identify a thesis? Sometimes identifying the conclusion may involve a little bit of
"mind reading." You may have to ask yourself "What is this person trying to make me accept?" The arguer may
use words that indicate a conclusion--for example, "therefore" or "hence" (see Table 5.1). After you have
identified the conclusion, try to summarize it as well as you can. Then, identify the premises or evidence the
arguer offers in support of that conclusion. Once again, identifying reasons can be tricky and might involve
more mind reading because arguers don't always explicitly state all of their reasons. Attempt to identify what
you think the arguer wants you to accept as evidence. Sometimes arguers also use words that indicate that
reasons or premises are being offered. In presenting evidence, people might use terms such as "because of" or
"since" (see Table 5.1). Lastly, if it is difficult to first identify the conclusion of an argument, you may have to
begin by parsing the evidence to then figure out the conclusion.

Conclusion indicator  therefore, hence, so, thus, consequently, accordingly, as a result, it follows that, it entails
words and phrases     that, we can conclude, for this reason, it must be that, it has to be that

Premise indicator     given that, since, because, for, in that, for the reason that, in as much as, as indicated by,
words and phrases     seeing how, seeing that, it follows from, owing to, it may be inferred from

TABLE 5.1 Navigating an Argument

Understanding evidence types can help you identify the premises being advanced for a conclusion. As
discussed earlier in the chapter, philosophers will often offer definitions or conceptual claims in their
arguments. For example, a premise may contain the conceptual claim that "The idea of God includes
perfection." Arguments can also contain as premises empirical evidence or information about the world
gleaned through the senses. Principles are also used as premises in arguments. A principle is a general rule or
law. Principles are as varied as fields of study and can exist in any domain. For example, "Do not use people
merely as a means to an end" is an ethical principle.

     CONNECTIONS

See the introduction to philosopher chapter to learn more about conceptual analysis.

The Difference between Truth and Logic

Analysis of arguments ought to take place on the levels of both truth and logic. Truth analysis is the
determination of whether statements are correct or accurate. On the other hand, logical analysis ascertains
whether the premises of an argument support the conclusion.

Often, people focus solely on the truth of an argument, but in philosophy logical analysis is often treated as
primary. One reason for this focus is that philosophy deals with subjects in which it is difficult to determine the
truth: the nature of reality, the existence of God, or the demands of morality. Philosophers use logic and
inference to get closer to the truth on these subjects, and they assume that an inconsistency in a position is
evidence against its truth.

Logical Analysis

Because logic is the study of reasoning, logical analysis involves assessing reasoning. Sometimes an argument
with a false conclusion uses good reasoning. Similarly, arguments with true conclusions can use terrible
reasoning. Consider the following absurd argument:
150 5 · Logic and Reasoning

        1. The battle of Hastings occurred in 1066.
        2. Tamaracks are deciduous conifer trees.
        3. Therefore, Paris is the capital of France.

       The premises of the above argument are true, as is the conclusion. However, the argument is illogical because
       the premises do not support the conclusion. Indeed, the premises are unrelated to each other and to the
       conclusion. More specifically, the argument does not contain a clear inference or evidence of reasoning. An
       inference is a reasoning process that leads from one idea to another, through which we formulate conclusions.
       So in an argument, an inference is the movement from the premises to the conclusion, where the former
       provide support for the latter. The above argument does not contain a clear inference because it is uncertain
       how we are supposed to cognitively move from the premises to the conclusion. Neither the truth nor the falsity
       of the premises helps us reason toward the truth of the conclusion. Here is another absurd argument:

        1. If the moon is made of cheese, then mice vacation there.
        2. The moon is made of cheese.
        3. Therefore, mice vacation on the moon.

       The premises of the above argument are false, as is the conclusion. However, the argument has strong
       reasoning because it contains a good inference. If the premises are true, then the conclusion does follow.
       Indeed, the argument uses a particular kind of inference--deductive inference--and good a deductive
       inference guarantees the truth of its conclusion as long as its premises are true.

       The important thing to remember is that a good inference involves clear steps by which we can move from
       premise to premise to reach a conclusion. The basic method for testing the two common types of
       inferences--deductive and inductive--is to provisionally assume that their premises are true. Assuming a
       neutral stance in considering an inference is crucial to doing philosophy. You begin by assuming that the
       premises are true and then ask whether the conclusion logically follows, given the truth of those premises.

       Truth Analysis

       If the logic in an argument seems good, you next turn to assessing the truth of the premises. If you disagree
       with the conclusion or think it untrue, you must look for weaknesses (untruths) in the premises. If the evidence
       is empirical, check the facts. If the evidence is a principle, ask whether there are exceptions to the principle. If
       the evidence is a conceptual claim, think critically about whether the conceptual claim can be true, which often
       involves thinking critically about possible counterexamples to the claim.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define deductive, inductive, and abductive inferences.
         · Classify inferences as deductive, inductive, or abductive.
         · Explain different explanatory virtues used in abductive reasoning.

       Inferences can be deductive, inductive, or abductive. Deductive inferences are the strongest because they can
       guarantee the truth of their conclusions. Inductive inferences are the most widely used, but they do not
       guarantee the truth and instead deliver conclusions that are probably true. Abductive inferences also deal in
       probability.

      Deductive Reasoning

       Deductive inferences, which are inferences arrived at through deduction (deductive reasoning), can guarantee
       truth because they focus on the structure of arguments. Here is an example:

        1. Either you can go to the movies tonight, or you can go to the party tomorrow.
        2. You cannot go to the movies tonight.

3. So, you can go to the party tomorrow.

This argument is good, and you probably knew it was good even without thinking too much about it. The
argument uses "or," which means that at least one of the two statements joined by the "or" must be true. If you
find out that one of the two statements joined by "or" is false, you know that the other statement is true by
using deduction. Notice that this inference works no matter what the statements are. Take a look at the
structure of this form of reasoning:

1. X or Y is true.
2. X is not true.
3. Therefore, Y is true.

By replacing the statements with variables, we get to the form of the initial argument above. No matter what
statements you replace X and Y with, if those statements are true, then the conclusion must be true as well.
This common argument form is called a disjunctive syllogism.

Valid Deductive Inferences

A good deductive inference is called a valid inference, meaning its structure guarantees the truth of its
conclusion given the truth of the premises. Pay attention to this definition. The definition does not say that
valid arguments have true conclusions. Validity is a property of the logical forms of arguments, and remember
that logic and truth are distinct. The definition states that valid arguments have a form such that if the
premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. You can test a deductive inference's validity by testing
whether the premises lead to the conclusion. If it is impossible for the conclusion to be false when the
premises are assumed to be true, then the argument is valid.

Deductive reasoning can use a number of valid argument structures:

Disjunctive Syllogism:

1. X or Y.
2. Not Y.
3. Therefore X.

Modus Ponens:

1. If X, then Y.
2. X.
3. Therefore Y.

Modus Tollens:

1. If X, then Y.
2. Not Y.
3. Therefore, not X.

You saw the first form, disjunctive syllogism, in the previous example. The second form, modus ponens, uses a
conditional, and if you think about necessary and sufficient conditions already discussed, then the validity of
this inference becomes apparent. The conditional in premise 1 expresses that X is sufficient for Y. So if X is
true, then Y must be true. And premise 2 states that X is true. So the conclusion (the truth of Y) necessarily
follows. You can also use your knowledge of necessary and sufficient conditions to understand the last form,
modus tollens. Remember, in a conditional, the consequent is the necessary condition. So Y is necessary for X.
But premise 2 states that Y is not true. Because Y must be the case if X is the case, and we are told that Y is
false, then we know that X is also false. These three examples are only a few of the numerous possible valid
inferences.

       Invalid Deductive Inferences

       A bad deductive inference is called an invalid inference. In invalid inferences, their structure does not
       guarantee the truth of the conclusion--that is to say, even if the premises are true, the conclusion may be false.
       This does not mean that the conclusion must be false, but that we simply cannot know whether the conclusion
       is true or false. Here is an example of an invalid inference:

        1. If it snows more than three inches, the schools are mandated to close.
        2. The schools closed.
        3. Therefore, it snowed more than three inches.

       If the premises of this argument are true (and we assume they are), it may or may not have snowed more than
       three inches. Schools close for many reasons besides snow. Perhaps the school district experienced a power
       outage or a hurricane warning was issued for the area. Again, you can use your knowledge of necessary and
       sufficient conditions to understand why this form is invalid. Premise 2 claims that the necessary condition is
       the case. But the truth of the necessary condition does not guarantee that the sufficient condition is true. The
       conditional states that the closing of schools is guaranteed when it has snowed more than 3 inches, not that
       snow of more than 3 inches is guaranteed if the schools are closed.

       Invalid deductive inferences can also take general forms. Here are two common invalid inference forms:

       Affirming the Consequent:

        1. If X, then Y.
        2. Y.
        3. Therefore, X.

       Denying the Antecedent:

        1. If X, then Y.
        2. Not X.
        3. Therefore, not Y.

       You saw the first form, affirming the consequent, in the previous example concerning school closures. The
       fallacy is so called because the truth of the consequent (the necessary condition) is affirmed to infer the truth
       of the antecedent statement. The second form, denying the antecedent, occurs when the truth of the
       antecedent statement is denied to infer that the consequent is false. Your knowledge of sufficiency will help
       you understand why this inference is invalid. The truth of the antecedent (the sufficient condition) is only
       enough to know the truth of the consequent. But there may be more than one way for the consequent to be
       true, which means that the falsity of the sufficient condition does not guarantee that the consequent is false.
       Going back to an earlier example, that a creature is not a dog does not let you infer that it is not a mammal,
       even though being a dog is sufficient for being a mammal. Watch the video below for further examples of
       conditional reasoning. See if you can figure out which incorrect selection is structurally identical to affirming
       the consequent or denying the antecedent.

       Testing Deductive Inferences

       Earlier it was explained that logical analysis involves assuming the premises of an argument are true and then
       determining whether the conclusion logically follows, given the truth of those premises. For deductive
       arguments, if you can come up with a scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, you
       have proven that the argument is invalid. An instance of a deductive argument where the premises are all true

but the conclusion false is called a counterexample. As with counterexamples to statements, counterexamples
to arguments are simply instances that run counter to the argument. Counterexamples to statements show
that the statement is false, while counterexamples to deductive arguments show that the argument is invalid.
Complete the exercise below to get a better understanding of coming up with counterexamples to prove
invalidity.

         THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

Using the sample arguments given, come up with a counterexample to prove that the argument is invalid. A
counterexample is a scenario in which the premises are true but the conclusion is false. Solutions are provided
below.

Argument 1:

1. If an animal is a dog, then it is a mammal.
2. Charlie is not a dog.
3. Therefore, Charlie is not a mammal.

Argument 2:

1. All desserts are sweet foods.
2. Some sweet foods are low fat.
3. So all desserts are low fat.

Argument 3:

1. If Jad doesn't finish his homework on time, he won't go to the party.
2. Jad doesn't go to the party.
3. Jad didn't finish his homework on time.

When you have completed your work on the three arguments, check your answers against the solutions below.

Solution 1: Invalid. If you imagine that Charlie is a cat (or other animal that is not a dog but is a mammal), then both
the premises are true, while the conclusion is false. Charlie is not a dog, but Charlie is a mammal.

Solution 2: Invalid. Buttercream cake is a counterexample. Buttercream cake is a dessert and is sweet, which
shows that not all desserts are low fat.

Solution3: Invalid. Assuming the first two premises are true, you can still imagine that Jad is too tired after finishing
his homework and decides not to go to the party, thus making the conclusion false.

Inductive Inferences

When we reason inductively, we gather evidence using our experience of the world and draw general
conclusions based on that experience. Inductive reasoning (induction) is also the process by which we use
general beliefs we have about the world to create beliefs about our particular experiences or about what to
expect in the future. Someone can use their past experiences of eating beets and absolutely hating them to
conclude that they do not like beets of any kind, cooked in any manner. They can then use this conclusion to
avoid ordering a beet salad at a restaurant because they have good reason to believe they will not like it.
Because of the nature of experience and inductive inference, this method can never guarantee the truth of our
beliefs. At best, inductive inference generates only probable true conclusions because it goes beyond the
information contained in the premises. In the example, past experience with beets is concrete information, but
the person goes beyond that information when making the general claim that they will dislike all beets (even
those varieties they've never tasted and even methods of preparing beets they've never tried).
154 5 · Logic and Reasoning

       Consider a belief as certain as "the sun will rise tomorrow." The Scottish philosopher David Hume famously
       argued against the certainty of this belief nearly three centuries ago ([1748, 1777] 2011, IV, i). Yes, the sun has
       risen every morning of recorded history (in truth, we have witnessed what appears to be the sun rising, which
       is a result of the earth spinning on its axis and creating the phenomenon of night and day). We have the
       science to explain why the sun will continue to rise (because the earth's rotation is a stable phenomenon).
       Based on the current science, we can reasonably conclude that the sun will rise tomorrow morning. But is this
       proposition certain? To answer this question, you have to think like a philosopher, which involves thinking
       critically about alternative possibilities. Say the earth gets hit by a massive asteroid that destroys it, or the sun
       explodes into a supernova that encompasses the inner planets and incinerates them. These events are
       extremely unlikely to occur, although no contradiction arises in imagining that they could take place. We
       believe the sun will rise tomorrow, and we have good reason for this belief, but the sun's rising is still only
       probable (even if it is nearly certain).

       While inductive inferences are not always a sure thing, they can still be quite reliable. In fact, a good deal of
       what we think we know is known through induction. Moreover, while deductive reasoning can guarantee the
       truth of conclusions if the premises are true, many times the premises themselves of deductive arguments are
       inductively known. In studying philosophy, we need to get used to the possibility that our inductively derived
       beliefs could be wrong.

       There are several types of inductive inferences, but for the sake of brevity, this section will cover the three most
       common types: reasoning from specific instances to generalities, reasoning from generalities to specific
       instances, and reasoning from the past to the future.

       Reasoning from Specific Instances to Generalities

       Perhaps I experience several instances of some phenomenon, and I notice that all instances share a similar
       feature. For example, I have noticed that every year, around the second week of March, the red-winged
       blackbirds return from wherever they've wintering. So I can conclude that generally the red-winged blackbirds
       return to the area where I live (and observe them) in the second week of March. All my evidence is gathered
       from particular instances, but my conclusion is a general one. Here is the pattern:

                                         Instance1, Instance2, Instance3 . . . Instancen --> Generalization

       And because each instance serves as a reason in support of the generalization, the instances are premises in
       the argument form of this type of inductive inference:

       Specific to General Inductive Argument Form:

        1. Instance1
        2. Instance2
        3. Instance3
        4. General Conclusion

       Reasoning from Generalities to Specific Instances

       Induction can work in the opposite direction as well: reasoning from accepted generalizations to specific
       instances. This feature of induction relies on the fact that we are learners and that we learn from past
       experiences and from one another. Much of what we learn is captured in generalizations. You have probably
       accepted many generalizations from your parents, teachers, and peers. You probably believe that a red "STOP"
       sign on the road means that when you are driving and see this sign, you must bring your car to a full stop. You
       also probably believe that water freezes at 32° Fahrenheit and that smoking cigarettes is bad for you. When you
       use accepted generalizations to predict or explain things about the world, you are using induction. For
       example, when you see that the nighttime low is predicted to be 30°F, you may surmise that the water in your
       birdbath will be frozen when you get up in the morning.

       Some thought processes use more than one type of inductive inference. Take the following example:

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                         5.4 · Types of Inferences 155

      Every cat I have ever petted doesn't tolerate its tail being pulled.
      So this cat probably will not tolerate having its tail pulled.
Notice that this reasoner has gone through a series of instances to make an inference about one additional
instance. In doing so, the reasoner implicitly assumed a generalization along the way. The reasoner's implicit
generalization is that no cat likes its tail being pulled. They then use that generalization to determine that they
shouldn't pull the tail of the cat in front of them now. A reasoner can use several instances in their experience
as premises to draw a general conclusion and then use that generalization as a premise to draw a conclusion
about a specific new instance.
Inductive reasoning finds its way into everyday expressions, such as "Where there is smoke, there is fire."
When people see smoke, they intuitively come to believe that there is fire. This is the result of inductive
reasoning. Consider your own thought process as you examine Figure 5.5.

FIGURE 5.5 "Where there is smoke, there is fire" is an example of inductive reasoning. (credit: "20140803-FS-
UNK-0017" by US Department of Agriculture/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Reasoning from Past to Future
We often use inductive reasoning to predict what will happen in the future. Based on our ample experience of
the past, we have a basis for prediction. Reasoning from the past to the future is similar to reasoning from
specific instances to generalities. We have experience of events across time, we notice patterns concerning the
occurrence of those events at particular times, and then we reason that the event will happen again in the
future. For example:

      I see my neighbor walking her dog every morning. So my neighbor will probably walk her dog this
      morning.
Could the person reasoning this way be wrong? Yes--the neighbor could be sick, or the dog could be at the vet.
But depending upon the regularity of the morning dog walks and on the number of instances (say the neighbor
has walked the dog every morning for the past year), the inference could be strong in spite of the fact that it is
possible for it to be wrong.
Strong Inductive Inferences
The strength of inductive inferences depends upon the reliability of premises given as evidence and their
relation to the conclusions drawn. A strong inductive inference is one where, if the evidence offered is true,
then the conclusion is probably true. A weak inductive inference is one where, if the evidence offered is true,
156 5 · Logic and Reasoning

       the conclusion is not probably true. But just how strong an inference needs to be to be considered good is
       context dependent. The word "probably" is vague. If something is more probable than not, then it needs at
       least a 51 percent chance of happening. However, in most instances, we would expect to have a much higher
       probability bar to consider an inference to be strong. As an example of this context dependence, compare the
       probability accepted as strong in gambling to the much higher probability of accuracy we expect in
       determining guilt in a court of law.
       Figure 5.6 illustrates three forms of reasoning are used in the scientific method. Induction is used to glean
       patterns and generalizations, from which hypotheses are made. Hypotheses are tested, and if they remain
       unfalsified, induction is used again to assume support for the hypothesis.

      Abductive Reasoning

       Abductive reasoning is similar to inductive reasoning in that both forms of inference are probabilistic.
       However, they differ in the relationship of the premises to the conclusion. In inductive argumentation, the
       evidence in the premises is used to justify the conclusion. In abductive reasoning, the conclusion is meant to
       explain the evidence offered in the premises. In induction the premises explain the conclusion, but in
       abduction the conclusion explains the premises.
       Inference to the Best Explanation
       Because abduction reasons from evidence to the most likely explanation for that evidence, it is often called
       "inference to the best explanation." We start with a set of data and attempt to come up with some unifying
       hypothesis that can best explain the existence of those data. Given this structure, the evidence to be explained
       is usually accepted as true by all parties involved. The focus is not the truth of the evidence, but rather what the
       evidence means.
       Although you may not be aware, you regularly use this form of reasoning. Let us say your car won't start, and
       the engine won't even turn over. Furthermore, you notice that the radio and display lights are not on, even
       when the key is in and turned to the ON position. Given this evidence, you conclude that the best explanation is
       that there is a problem with the battery (either it is not connected or is dead). Or perhaps you made pumpkin
       bread in the morning, but it is not on the counter where you left it when you get home. There are crumbs on
       the floor, and the bag it was in is also on the floor, torn to shreds. You own a dog who was inside all day. The dog
       in question is on the couch, head hanging low, ears back, avoiding eye contact. Given the evidence, you
       conclude that the best explanation for the missing bread is that the dog ate it.
       Detectives and forensic investigators use abduction to come up with the best explanation for how a crime was
       committed and by whom. This form of reasoning is also indispensable to scientists who use observations
       (evidence) along with accepted hypotheses to create new hypotheses for testing. You may also recognize
       abduction as a form of reasoning used in medical diagnoses. A doctor considers all your symptoms and any

further evidence gathered from preliminarily tests and reasons to the best possible conclusion (a diagnosis)
for your illness.

Explanatory Virtues

Good abductive inferences share certain features. Explanatory virtues are aspects of an explanation that
generally make it strong. There are many explanatory virtues, but we will focus on four. A good hypothesis
should be explanatory, simple, and conservative and must have depth.

To say that a hypothesis must be explanatory simply means that it must explain all the available evidence. The
word "explanatory" for our purposes is being used in a narrower sense than used in everyday language. Take
the pumpkin bread example: a person might reason that perhaps their roommate ate the loaf of pumpkin
bread. However, such an explanation would not explain why the crumbs and bag were on the floor, nor the
guilty posture of the dog. People do not normally eat an entire loaf of pumpkin bread, and if they do, they don't
eviscerate the bag while doing so, and even if they did, they'd probably hide the evidence. Thus, the
explanation that your roommate ate the bread isn't as explanatory as the one that pinpoints your dog as the
culprit.

But what if you reason that a different dog got into the house and ate the bread, then got out again, and your
dog looks guilty because he did nothing to stop the intruder? This explanation seems to explain the missing
bread, but it is not as good as the simpler explanation that your dog is the perpetrator. A good explanation is
often simple. You may have heard of Occam's razor, formulated by William of Ockham (1287-1347), which
says that the simplest explanation is the best explanation. Ockham said that "entities should not be multiplied
beyond necessity" (Spade & Panaccio 2019). By "entities," Ockham meant concepts or mechanisms or moving
parts.

Examples of explanations that lack simplicity abound. For example, conspiracy theories present the very
opposite of simplicity since such explanations are by their very nature complex. Conspiracy theories must
posit plots, underhanded dealings, cover-ups (to explain the existence of alternative evidence), and maniacal
people to explain phenomena and to further explain away the simpler explanation for those phenomena.
Conspiracy theories are never simple, but that is not the only reason they are suspect. Conspiracy theories also
generally lack the virtues of being conservative and having depth.

A conservative explanation maintains or conserves much of what we already believe. Conservativeness in
science is when a theory or hypothesis fits with other established scientific theories and explanations. For
example, a theory that accounts for some physical phenomenon but also does not violate Newton's first law of
motion is an example of a conservative theory. On the other hand, consider the conspiracy theory that we
never landed on the moon. Someone might posit that the televised Apollo 11 space landing was filmed in a
secret studio somewhere. But the reality of the first televised moon landing is not the only belief we must get
rid of to maintain the theory. Five more manned moon landings occurred. Furthermore, the reality of the
moon landings fits into beliefs about technological advancement over the next five decades. Many of the
technologies developed were later adopted by the military and private sector (NASA, n.d.). Moreover, the Apollo
missions are a key factor in understanding the space race of the Cold War era. Accepting the conspiracy theory
requires rejecting a wide range of beliefs, and so the theory is not conservative.

A conspiracy theorist may offer alternative explanations to account for the tension between their explanation
and established beliefs. However, for each explanation the conspiracist offers, more questions are raised. And
a good explanation should not raise more questions than it answers. This characteristic is the virtue of depth.
A deep explanation avoids unexplained explainers, or an explanation that itself is in need of explanation. For
example, the theorist might claim that John Glenn and the other astronauts were brainwashed to explain the
astronauts' firsthand accounts. But this claim raises a question about how brainwashing works. Furthermore,
what about the accounts of the thousands of other personnel who worked on the project? Were they all
brainwashed? And if so, how? The conspiracy theorist's explanation raises more questions than it answers.
158 5 · Logic and Reasoning

Extraordinary Claims Require Extraordinary Evidence

Is it possible that our established beliefs (or scientific theories) could be wrong? Why give precedence to an
explanation because it upholds our beliefs? Scientific thought would never have advanced if we deferred to
conservative explanations all the time. In fact, the explanatory virtues are not laws but rules of thumb, none of
which are supreme or necessary. Sometimes the correct explanation is more complicated, and sometimes the
correct explanation will require that we give up long-held beliefs. Novel and revolutionary explanations can be
strong if they have evidence to back them up. In the sciences, this approach is expressed in the following
principle: Extraordinary claims will require extraordinary evidence. In other words, a novel claim that disrupts
accepted knowledge will need more evidence to make it credible than a claim that already aligns with accepted
knowledge.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the four general categories of informal fallacies.
  · Classify fallacies by general category.
  · Identify fallacies in ordinary language.

Reasoning can go wrong in many ways. When the form of an argument is problematic, it is called a formal
fallacy. Mistakes in reasoning are not usually caused by the structure of the argument. Rather, there is usually
a problem in the relationship between the evidence given in the premises and the conclusion. Take the
following example:

      I don't think Ms. Timmons will make a good mayor. I've got a bad feeling about her. And I've heard
      she's not a Christian. Furthermore, the last time we had a female mayor, the city nearly went
      bankrupt. Don't vote for Ms. Timmons.

Notice that to assess the above argument, you have must think about whether the reasons offered function as
evidence for the conclusion that Ms. Timmons would be a bad mayor. This assessment requires background
knowledge about the world. Does belonging to a specific religion have any bearing on one's qualification for
mayor? Is there any credible connection between a mayor's gender and the likelihood that person will cause a

bankruptcy? If the reasons are not adequate support for the conclusion, then the reasoner commits an
informal fallacy. In the above argument, none of the reasons offered support for the conclusion. In fact, each
reason commits a different fallacy. The first reason is based on an appeal to emotion, which is not relevant.
The second reason points to a characteristic (religion) that is irrelevant in judging competency, and the third
reason creates a spurious connection between the candidate and a previous female mayor, putting them both
in the same failed category based solely on the fact that they share the same gender.

There are many specific types of informal fallacies, but most can be sorted into four general categories
according to how the reasoning fails. These categories show how reasoning can go wrong and serve as
warnings for what to watch out for in arguments. They are (1) fallacies of relevance, (2) fallacies of weak
induction, (3) fallacies of unwarranted assumption, and (4) fallacies of diversion.

     CONNECTIONS

See the chapter on critical thinking, research, reading, and writing to learn more about overcoming biases.

Fallacies of Relevance

In fallacies of relevance, the arguer presents evidence that is not relevant for logically establishing their
conclusion. The reason why fallacies of relevance stick around is because the evidence seems
relevant--meaning it feels relevant. Fallacies of relevance prey on our likes and dislikes. Indeed, the very first
fallacy of relevance is called "appeal to emotion."

Appeal to Emotion

Emotional appeals can target any number of emotions--from fear to pity and from love and compassion to
hate and aversion. For the most part, appeals to emotion of any kind are not relevant for establishing the
conclusion. Here's an example:

      I know the allegations against the governor seem serious. However, he's in his 80s now, and he fought
      for our country in the Korean War, earning a Purple Heart. We don't want to put an elderly veteran
      through the ordeal of a trial. I urge you to drop the charges.

In this example, the arguer appeals to our feelings of pity and compassion and to our positive feelings about
the governor. We might admire the governor for his military service and feel sympathy for his advanced age.
But are our feelings relevant in making the decision about whether to drop criminal charges? Notice that the
arguer says nothing about the content of the charges or about whether the governor is innocent or guilty.
Indeed, the arguer says absolutely nothing that's relevant to the conclusion. How we feel about somebody is
not a logical determinant to use in judging guilt or innocence.

Ad Hominem Attacks

The ad hominem attack is most often committed by a person who is arguing against some other person's
position. "Ad hominem" in Latin means "toward the man." It is so named because when someone commits this
fallacy, the reasons they give for their conclusion concern the characteristics of the person they are arguing
against rather than that person's position. For example, the arguer may verbally attack the person by making
fun of their appearance, intelligence, or character; they can highlight something about the person's
circumstances like their job or past; or they can insinuate that the person is a hypocrite.

You may wonder why such arguments are effective, and one reason is sloppy associative reasoning, wherein
we problematically assume that characteristics held by an arguer will be transferred to their argument.
Another related reason is that too often we allow ourselves to be ruled by emotion rather than reason. If we are
made to feel negatively toward a person, those feelings can cloud assessment of their arguments. Consider the
following example:

      My fellow councilwoman has argued for the city solar project. But what she failed to mention was that
160 5 · Logic and Reasoning

             she has been arrested twice--once for protesting during the Vietnam War and another time for
             protesting the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She's a traitor and a liar. Any project she espouses is bad for the
             city.

       This is clearly an ad hominem attack. The arguer wants to undermine the councilwoman's position by making
       us feel negatively toward her. The fact that a person engaged in protests in the past has no bearing on their
       arguments for an energy project. Furthermore, the arguer goes on to call the councilwoman a traitor and a liar
       and offers no evidence. Attaching negative labels to people is one way to manipulate an audience's emotions.

       There are other types of ad hominem attacks, and the most successful is probably the one called tu quoque,
       which means "you too" in Latin. When someone commits a tu quoque ad hominem fallacy, they attempt to
       undermine a person's argument by pointing to real or perceived hypocrisy on the part of the person. They
       assert or imply that their opponent, in the past or currently, has done or said things that are inconsistent with
       their current argument. Often tu quoque is used as a defensive maneuver. Take the example of a teenager
       whose father just caught her smoking cigarettes and reprimanded her. If she knows that her father smoked
       when he was her age, her defensive response will be "You did it too!" She is likely to think he is a hypocrite who
       should not be heeded. However, the daughter reasons poorly. First, a person's actions have no bearing on the
       strength of their arguments or the truth of their claims (unless, of course, the person's arguments are about
       their own actions). That her father smoked in the past (or smokes currently) has no bearing on whether
       smoking is in fact dangerous. Smoking does not suddenly cease to be dangerous because the person
       explaining the dangers of smoking is a smoker.

       You might think, however, that we should not trust the reasoning of hypocrites because hypocrisy is a sign of
       untrustworthiness, and untrustworthy people often say false things. But remember that there is a difference
       between a truth analysis and a logical analysis. If smoking has bad consequences on health and development,
       then that counts as a good reason for the father to not allow his daughter to smoke. But interestingly, some
       cases of perceived hypocrisy make the supposed hypocrite more trustworthy rather than less. And the
       smoking example is one such case. Of all the people who might be able to speak of the dangers of picking up a
       smoking habit at a young age, the father, who became addicted to cigarettes in his teenage years, is a good
       source. He speaks from experience, which is a second reason the daughter reasons incorrectly in thinking she
       should not listen to him because he was or is a smoker.

       Let's take a different scenario. Suppose a married person argues that it is immoral to cheat on one's spouse,
       but you know he has a mistress. As much as you may hate it, his status as a cheater is not relevant to assessing
       his argument. You might infer from his hypocrisy that he does not believe his own arguments or perhaps that
       he suffers guilt about his actions but cannot control his cheating behavior. Nonetheless, whatever the cheater
       believes or feels is simply not relevant to determining whether his argument is good. To think that whether a
       person believes an argument affects the truth of that argument is tantamount to thinking that if you believe X,
       the belief itself is more likely to make X happen or make X true. But such an approach is magical thinking, not
       logic or reason.

      Fallacies of Weak Induction

       The fallacies of weak induction are mistakes in reasoning in which a person's evidence or reasons are too
       weak to firmly establish a conclusion. The reasoner uses relevant premises, but the evidence contained
       therein is weak or defective in some way. These errors are errors of induction. When we inductively reason, we
       gather evidence using our experience in the world and draw conclusions based on that experience. Earlier in
       the chapter I used a generalization about the return of the red-winged blackbirds in March. But what if I based
       my generalization on just two years of experience? Now my conclusion--that the blackbirds return every mid-
       March--seems much weaker. In such cases, the reasoner uses induction properly by using relevant evidence,
       but her evidence is simply too weak to support the generalization she makes. An inductive inference may also
       be weak because it too narrowly focuses on one type of evidence, or the inference may apply to a
       generalization in the wrong way.

Hasty Generalization

A hasty generalization is a fallacy of weak induction in which a person draws a conclusion using too little
evidence to support the conclusion. A hasty generalization was made in the red-winged blackbird case above.
Here is another example:

      Don't eat at the restaurant. It's bad. I had lunch there once, and it was awful. Another time I had
      dinner, and the portions were too small.

This person draws the conclusion that the restaurant is bad from two instances of eating there. But two
instances are not enough to support such a robust conclusion. Consider another example:

      Sixty-five percent of a random poll of 50 registered voters in the state said they would vote for the
      amendment. We conclude that the state amendment will pass.

Fifty voters is not a large enough sample size to draw predictive conclusions about an election. So to say the
amendment will pass based on such limited evidence is a hasty generalization. Just how much evidence we
need to support a generalization depends upon the conclusion being made. If we already have good reason to
believe that the class of entities that is the subject of our generalization are all very similar, then we will not
need a very large sample size to make a reliable generalization. For instance, physics tells us that electrons are
very similar, so a study drawn from observing just a few electrons may be reasonable. Humans (particularly
their political beliefs and behaviors) are not the same, so a much larger sample size is needed to determine
political behavior. The fallacy of hasty generalization highlights the empirical nature of induction--we need a
basic understanding of the world to know exactly how much evidence is needed to support many of our claims.

Biased Sample

A biased sample has some things in common with a hasty generalization. Consider the following:

      Don't eat dinner at that restaurant. It's bad. My book club has met there once a week for breakfast for
      the past year, and they overcook their eggs.

This seems much better than the restaurant example offered above. If the book club has gone to the restaurant
once per week for a year, the arguer has more than 50 instances as data. However, notice that the arguer's
evidence concerns breakfast, not dinner, and focuses on the eggs. Suppose the restaurant has an entirely
different, more expensive dinner menu; then we cannot draw reliable conclusions about the restaurant's
success at dinner. This is an example of a biased sample. With a hasty generalization, the problem is that not
enough evidence is used. In a biased sample, the problem is that the evidence used is biased in some way.

Appeal to Ignorance

Appeal to ignorance is another type of fallacy of weak induction. Consider the following line of reasoning:

      In my philosophy class, we reviewed all the traditional arguments for the existence of God. All of them
      have problems. Because no one can prove that God exists, we can only conclude that God doesn't exist.

Notice that the arguer wants to conclude that because we do not have evidence or sufficient arguments for
God's existence, then God cannot exist. In an appeal to ignorance, the reasoner relies on the lack of knowledge
or evidence for a thing (our ignorance of it) to draw a definite conclusion about that thing. But in many cases,
this simply does not work. The same reasoning can be used to assert that God must exist:

      In my philosophy class, we reviewed different arguments against the existence of God. All of them
      have problems. Because no one can prove that God doesn't exist, we can only conclude that God exists.

Any form of reasoning that allows you to draw contradictory conclusions ought to be suspect. Appeals to
ignorance ignore the idea that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The fact that we lack evidence
for X should not always function as evidence that X is false or does not exist.
162 5 · Logic and Reasoning

       False Cause Attribution
       The fallacy of false cause occurs when a causal relation is assumed to exist between two events or things when
       it is unlikely that such a causal relationship exists. People often make this mistake when the two events occur
       together. The phrase "correlation does not equal causation" captures a common critique of this form of false
       cause reasoning. For example, a person may think that swimsuits cause sunburns because people often get
       sunburned when wearing swimsuits. There is a correlation between sunburn and swimsuits, but the suits are
       not a cause of sunburns.
       False cause fallacies also occur when a person believes that just because one event occurs after another, the
       first event is the cause of the second one. This poor form of reasoning, in tandem with confirmation bias, leads
       to many superstitious beliefs. Confirmation bias is the natural tendency to look for, interpret, or recall
       information that confirms already-established beliefs or values. For example, some sports fans may notice that
       their team won sometimes on days when they were wearing a specific item of clothing. They may come to
       believe that this clothing item is "lucky." Furthermore, because of confirmation bias, they may remember only
       instances when the team won when they were wearing that item (and not remember when the team lost when
       they were also wearing the item). The resulting superstition amounts to believing that wearing a special team
       jersey somehow causes the team to win.

       FIGURE 5.7 Correlation Is Not the Same as Causation (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC
       BY 4.0 license)
       In short, as emphasized by Figure 5.7, just because two things are often correlated (connected in that they
       occur together in time or place) does not mean that a cause-and-effect relationship exists between them.

           CONNECTIONS

       See the chapter on critical thinking, research, reading, and writing to learn more about confirmation bias.

      Fallacies of Unwarranted Assumption

       Fallacies of unwarranted assumption occur when an argument relies on a piece of information or belief that
       requires further justification. The category gets its name from the fact that a person assumes something
       unwarranted to draw their conclusion. Often the unjustified assumption is only implicit, which can make these
       types of fallacies difficult to identify.
       False Dichotomy
       False dichotomy, or "false dilemma," occurs in an argument when a limited number of possibilities are
       assumed to be the only available options. In the classic variation, the arguer offers two possibilities, shows that
       the one cannot be true, and then deduces that the other possibility must be true. Here is the form:
        1. Either A or B must be true.
        2. A is not true.
        3. Therefore, B is true.

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                            5.5 · Informal Fallacies 163

The form itself looks like a good argument--a form of disjunctive syllogism. But a false dichotomy is an
informal fallacy, and such errors depend upon the content of arguments (their meaning and relation to the
world) rather than the form. The problematic assumption occurs in premise 1, where it is assumed that A and
B are the only options. Here is a concrete example:

      A citizen of the United States either loves their country, or they are a traitor. Since you don't love your
      country, you are a traitor.

The above argument assumes that loving the United States or being a traitor are the only two possible options
for American citizens. The argument assumes these options are mutually exclusive (you cannot be both) and
jointly exhaustive (you must be one or the other). But this position requires justification. For example, a person
can have mixed emotions about their country and not be a traitor. False dichotomy is poor reasoning because
it artificially limits the available options and then uses this artificial limitation to attempt to prove some
conclusion. A false dichotomy may include more than two options. The important thing to remember is a false
dichotomy limits options in an argument without justification when there is reason to think there are more
options.

Begging the Question

Begging the question occurs when an arguer either assumes the truth of the conclusion they aim to prove in
the course of trying to prove it or when an arguer assumes the truth of a contentious claim in their argument.
When the former happens, it is sometimes called circular reasoning. Here is an example:

1. The Bible states that God exists.
2. The Bible is true because it is divinely inspired.
3. Therefore, God exists.

The problematic assumption occurs in premise 2. To say the Bible is "divinely inspired" is to say that it is the
word of God. But the argument aims to prove that God exists. So premise 2 assumes that God exists in order to
prove God exists. This is patently circular reasoning. The name "begging the question" is confusing to some
students. One way to think about this fallacy is that the question is whatever is at issue in a debate or
argument. Here the question is "Does God exist?" To "beg" the question means to assume you already know
the answer. The above argument assumes the answer to the question it is supposed to answer.

The name "begging the question" makes more sense for the second form of the fallacy. When a person begs the
question in the second sense, they assume the truth of something controversial while trying to prove their
conclusion. Here is an example you might be familiar with:

1. The intentional killing of an innocent person is murder.
2. Abortion is the intentional killing of an innocent person.
3. Therefore, abortion is murder.

This is a valid argument. Structurally, it uses good logic. However, the argument is an example of begging the
question because of premise 2. Much of the debate over abortion revolves around the question of whether a
fetus is a person. But premise 2 simply assumes that a fetus is a person, so the argument begs the question "Is
a fetus a person?"

Fallacies of Diversion

The final class of informal fallacies is the fallacy of diversion, which usually occurs in contexts where there is
an opponent or an audience. In this instance, the arguer attempts to distract the attention of the audience away
from the argument at hand. Clearly, the tactic of diverting attention implies that there is someone whose
attention can be diverted: either an audience, an opponent, or both.

Strawman

Men made of straw can easily be knocked over. Hence, a strawman occurs when an arguer presents a weaker
164 5 · Logic and Reasoning

       version of the position they are arguing against to make the position easier to defeat. The arguer takes their
       opponent's argument, repackages it, and defeats this new version of the argument rather than their
       opponent's actual position. If the audience listening to or reading the argument is not careful, they won't notice
       this move and believe that the opponent's original position has been defeated. Usually when a strawman is
       created, the misrepresented position is made more extreme. Here is an example:

             Senator: It is important that the path to citizenship be governed by established legal procedure.
             Granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants who came to this country illegally sets up a
             dangerous and unfair precedent. It could encourage others to illegally enter the country in hopes that
             they too can be granted clemency at a later date. We must only reward the status of citizenship to
             those who followed the laws in coming here.
             Opponent: Clearly, we can reject the Senator's position, which is obviously anti-immigrant. If he had it
             his way, we'd never allow any immigration into the country. We are a nation of immigrants, and
             disallowing people from other countries to join our nation is against everything this nation has stood
             for historically.
       The opponent misrepresents the senator as being wholly anti-immigration and then argues against that
       manufactured position--a classic strawman move. The senator's original argument focuses narrowly on the
       question of whether to create a pathway to citizenship for people already in the country who came here
       illegally. The repackaged argument is much easier to defeat than the senator's actual argument since few
       people are in favor of not allowing any immigration into the country.
       Red Herring
       A red herring fallacy is like a strawman, except the arguer completely ignores their opponent's position and
       simply changes the subject. The arguer diverts the attention of the audience to a new subject. A red herring is a
       smelly smoked fish that was used to train hunting dogs to track smells by dragging this fish along a path as
       practice. So the fallacy gets its name because it means to trick people into following a different path of
       reasoning than the one at hand. You may wonder how a person can get away with simply changing the subject.
       Successful use of the red herring usually involves shifting the subject to something tangentially related. Here is
       an example:
             My daughter wants me to exercise more. She said she is worried about my health. She showed me
             research about cardiovascular fitness and its impact on quality of life for people my age and older. She
             suggested I start biking with her. But bicycles are expensive. And it is dangerous to ride bicycles on a
             busy road. Furthermore, I do not have a place to store a bicycle.
       This arguer first summarizes the daughter's position that they ought to exercise more. But then they take the
       suggestion of bicycling and veer off topic (getting more exercise) to the feasibility of cycling instead. The
       comments on bicycling in no way address the daughter's general conclusion that the arguer needs to exercise
       more. Because the argument changes the subject, it is a red herring.
       Table 5.3 summaries these many types of informal fallacies.

Summary

5.1 Philosophical Methods for Discovering Truth

Logic is the study of reasoning and is a key tool for discovering truth in philosophy and other disciplines. Early
philosophers used dialectics--reasoned debates with the goal of getting closer to the truth--to practice and
develop reason. Dialectics usually start with a question. An interlocuter offers an answer to the question,
which is then scrutinized by all participants. Early forms of arguments are evident in written dialogues.
Arguments are reasons offered in support of a conclusion. We use logic to test hypotheses in philosophy and
other domains. There are laws of logic--the law of noncontradiction and the law of the excluded middle. Laws
of logic can be thought of as rules of thought. Logical laws are rules that underlie thinking itself. The rules or
laws of logic are normative--they describe how we ought to reason.

5.2 Logical Statements

Logical statements can be conditionals or universal affirmative statements. Both are important since they
express the important logical relations (also called "conditions") of necessity and sufficiency. If something is
sufficient, it is always sufficient for something else. And if something is necessary, it is always necessary for
something else. If you want to prove that a conditional or universal affirmative statement is false (which is to
also prove that the necessary and sufficient conditions they express do not hold), then you must offer a
counterexample.

5.3 Arguments

An argument is a set of reasons offered in support of a conclusion. The reasons are called premises, and they
are meant to logically support the conclusion. Identifying the premises involves critically identifying what is
meant to be evidence for the conclusion. Both the premises and conclusion can be indicated by phrases and
words. Evaluations of arguments take place on two levels: assessing truth and assessing logic. Logic and truth
are separate features of arguments. Logical assessment involves determining whether the truth of the
premises do support the conclusion. Logically good arguments contain inferences--a reasoning process that
leads from one idea to another, through which we formulate conclusions--where the inference does support
the conclusion.

5.4 Types of Inferences

There are three different types of inferences: deductive, inductive, and abductive. Deductive inferences, when
valid, guarantee the truth of their conclusions. Inductive inferences, when strong, offer probable support for
the conclusion. And good abductive inferences offer probable support for their conclusions. Deductive
inferences that cannot guarantee the truth of their conclusions are called invalid. A counterexample can be
offered to prove that a deductive inference is invalid. Inductive inferences involve using observations based on
experience to draw general conclusions about the world. Abductive inferences involve offering explanations
for accepted evidence. Abduction is sometimes called "inference to the best explanation."

5.5 Informal Fallacies

A fallacy is a poor form of reasoning. Fallacies that cannot be reduced to the structure of an argument are
called informal fallacies. There are many types of informal fallacies, which can be sorted into four general
categories according to how the reasoning fails. These categories are fallacies of relevance, fallacies of weak
induction, fallacies of unwarranted assumption, and fallacies of diversion. A fallacy of relevance occurs when
the arguer presents evidence that is not relevant for logically establishing their conclusion. The fallacies of
weak induction occur when the evidence used is relevant but is too weak to support the desired conclusion.
The fallacies of unwarranted assumption occur when an argument assumes, as evidence, some reason that
requires further justification. The fallacies of diversion occur when the arguer attempts to distract the
attention of the audience from the argument at hand.

Key Terms

Abductive having to do with abduction/abductive reasoning. Abduction is probabilistic form of inference in
      which an explanation is offered to justify and explain evidence.

Ad hominin attack fallacy of relevance that argues against someone's idea or suggestion by attacking the
      individual personally, rather than pointing out problems with the idea or suggestion.

Appeal to ignorance a fallacy of weak induction that relies on the lack of knowledge or evidence for a thing
      (our ignorance of it) to draw a definite conclusion about that thing.

Argument a set of reasons offered in support of a conclusion.
Begging the question a fallacy of unwarranted assumption that either assumes the truth of a conclusion in

      the course of trying to prove it or assumes the truth of a contentious claim.
Biased sample a fallacy of weak induction that draws a conclusion using evidence that is biased in some way.
Conclusion the result of an argument. A conclusion is that which is meant to be proved by the reasoning and

      premises used in an argument.
Conditional a logical statement that expresses a necessary and a sufficient condition. Conditionals are usually

      formulated as if-then statements.
Contradiction a statement that is always false. A contradiction is the conjunction of any statement and its

      negation.
Counterexample an example that proves that either a statement is false or an argument is invalid.
Deductive having to do with deduction/deductive reasoning. Deduction is a form of inference that can

      guarantee the truth of its conclusions, given the truth of the premises.
Emotional appeal fallacy of relevance that appeals to feelings (whether positive or negative) rather than

      discussing the merits of an idea or proposal.
Explanatory virtues aspects of an explanation that generally make it strong; four such virtues are that a good

      hypothesis should be explanatory, simple, and conservative, and have depth.
Fallacy a poor form of reasoning.
Fallacy of diversion a general category of informal fallacies in which an arguer presents evidence that

      functions to divert the attention of the audience from the current subject of argument.
Fallacy of relevance a general category of informal fallacies in which an arguer relies on reasons that are not

      relevant for establishing a conclusion.
Fallacy of unwarranted assumption a general category of informal fallacies in which an arguer implicitly or

      explicitly relies on reasons that require further justification.
Fallacy of weak induction a general category of informal fallacies in which an arguer's evidence or reasons

      are too weak to firmly establish their conclusion.
False cause fallacy of weak induction in which a causal relation is assumed to exist between two events or

      things that are not causally connected; "correlation does not equal causation".
False dichotomy a fallacy of unwarranted assumption in which a limited number of possibilities are assumed

      to be the only available options.
Hasty generalization fallacy of weak induction that draws a conclusion using too little evidence to support the

      conclusion.
Hypothesis a proposed explanation for an observed process or phenomenon.
Inductive having to do with induction/inductive reasoning. Induction is a probabilistic form of inference in

      which observation or experience is used to draw conclusions about the world.
Inference a reasoning process that moves from one idea to another, resulting in conclusions.
Invalidity a property of bad deductive inferences. An invalid inference/argument is one in which the truth of

      the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.
Law of noncontradiction a logical law that states that contradictory statements/propositions can never be

      true in the same sense at the same time.
Law of the excluded middle a logical law that states that for any statement, either that statement or its

      negation is true.

Logical analysis the process of determining whether the logical inferences made in an argument are good. A
      logical analysis determines whether the premises in an argument logically support the conclusion.

Necessary condition X is a necessary condition for Y if and only if X must be true given the truth of Y. If X is
      necessary for Y, then X is guaranteed by Y--without the truth of X, Y cannot be true.

Statement a sentence with a truth value--a sentence that must be either true or false.
Strawman fallacy of diversion that utilizes a weaker version of the position being argued against in order to

      make the position easier to defeat.
Sufficient condition X is a sufficient condition for Y if and only if the truth of X guarantees the truth of Y. If X is

      sufficient for Y, then the truth of X is enough to prove the truth of Y.
Truth analysis the process of determining whether statements made in an argument are either true or false.
Universal affirmative statement statements that take two groups of things and claim all members of the first

      group are also members of the second groups.
Validity a property of deductive arguments where the structure of an argument is such that if the premises are

      true, then the conclusion is guaranteed to be true. A valid inference is a logically good inference.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

6.1 Substance
6.2 Self and Identity
6.3 Cosmology and the Existence of God
6.4 Free Will

INTRODUCTION Defining metaphysics is difficult. On a summary level, one possible definition is that
metaphysics is the field of philosophy concerned with identifying that which is real. You may wonder why any
reasonable person would invest time pursuing an answer to that which, at first glance, seems obvious. But on
deeper inspection of the world around you, it can be challenging to identify what is real.
Consider the acorn. As you probably learned through life science, an acorn is destined to become an oak. If you
were to look at the acorn and compare it to the oak, you would see two radically different things. How can a
thing change and remain the same thing?
Aristotle offers insight into how the acorn and the oak represent change but within the same being. Within
Aristotle's thinking, each being has a specific end or purpose. As telos is Greek for "end" (end as target or goal),
this view is known as teleological. In addition, each being is described as having a specific function (ergon) by
172 6 · Metaphysics

       which that being seeks the proper end.
       In the case of an oak tree, the oak tree works from its acorn to the fullness of the oak. Aristotle describes the
       becoming as movement from a state of potentiality to actuality. You might say that which is most real
       concerning the oak stands beneath the movement from acorn to oak. The movement from potentiality toward
       actuality is one method to make sense of change while maintaining a constant or underlying sense of true
       being.
       As you will discover, the topic of metaphysics is far-reaching and broaches many questions.

         · What is real?
         · What is being?
         · Is there a purpose to our being?
         · What is the self?
         · Is there a God?
         · Do human beings (however defined) possess free will?
       Metaphysical questions tend not to be resting points but starting points. This chapter begins to explore many
       simple yet interrelated questions as part of seeking the real.

       FIGURE 6.2 The term metaphysics comes from Aristotle's book of the same name. The opening sentence translates
       as "All men by nature desire to know." Our desire to lay bare the deepest and most discrete understanding of reality
       is at the heart of metaphysics. (credit: "Aristotle: Metaphysica, first page in Immanuel Bekker's edition, 1837." by

6.1 Substance

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify what constitutes a substance.
  · Articulate the difference between monism and pluralism.
  · Contrast Aristotle's and Plato's views of form and substance.
  · Compare theories of substance in Greek and Indian philosophy.

The Latin term substantia, translated as substance, is often used to refer to the basic reality of a thing. The
notion that reason could lay bare the secrets of the cosmos if properly applied was widespread throughout the
ancient world. One of the early questions that philosophers in ancient Greece and India approached was that of
fundamentality, or simply, What is the foundation of reality? What is the independent base for that which we
consider to be real?

Fundamentality: The One and the Many

A reasonable starting point in the philosophical pursuit of the "really real" is to consider just how many real
things exist. Is the real one, or is it many? You are probably puzzled by the question. Every day, you see and
experience a plurality of beings. Common sense suggests that if you were to take a moment to observe the
many different and ostensibly non-related things in your presence right now, you would most likely support a
pluralistic view (there are many real things). Yet the framing of the real as one (the view known as monism) is
also compelling.

Monism

One of the earliest metaphysical positions taken was monism. At its simplest form, monism is the belief that
the most discrete or fundamental reality (i.e., "the really real") is singular. This idea was held by the so-called
pre-Socratics, a disparate group of philosophers who lived somewhat near each other and were born prior to
Socrates but whose metaphysical positions, even if monistic, were wildly different. For example, they had
different views of what the one "really real" is (see Table 6.1).

Date  Philosopher                  The One Is:

c. 624-547 BCE Thales of Miletus   water

c. 610-546 BCE Anaximander of Miletus the unbounded

c. 586-526 BCE Anaximenes          air

c. 535-475 BCE Heraclitus of Ephesus fire

c. 515-445 BCE Parmenides of Elea  Being

TABLE 6.1 Pre-Socratic Monists

It is tempting to look at the list of monistic answers and dismiss the thought quickly. Water, for example, is not
the "really real." Yet, as we see below, philosophers such as Thales of Miletus made a consistent, rational
argument for monism. In his case, he argued in support of water as the fundamental substance.

Thales of Miletus

Studying the philosophers who predate Socrates is challenging, as in many cases their primary works did not
survive. But there are transcribed fragments and the characterization of other philosophers from which to gain
insights. There are also historians to give glimpses of what these thinkers posited. In the case of Thales,
174 6 · Metaphysics

Aristotle is a useful source. Aristotle noted, "Thales, the founder of this school of philosophy, says the
permanent entity is water (which is why he also propounded that the earth floats on water)" (Metaphysics
983b20). Why would anyone draw this conclusion? Aristotle suggested that Thales's belief reflected the
observations that all things are nourished through water, that heat itself is generated through the absence or
removal of water, and that all things require water to live. The observations inherent to the position itself are
understandable. How long can a person live without water? What happens to plants during drought? Water is,
indeed, essential for any being.

The intellectual assumptions supporting the position are intriguing. First, Thales is working from the
assumption that all things that are must be conceived as having only a material principle. Given how these
thinkers made sense of the world around them, assuming only material causes (e.g. fire, water, air, etc.) is
understandable. A second assumption informing the position is the notion that being either is or it is not. For
these thinkers, there is no becoming (for example, change or evolving) from one fundamental substance, such
as water, to another, such as fire. There is no state somewhere in between being and not being. By extension,
being (once it is) cannot be generated or destroyed. Thus, primary being (the most real of reals) must be and
must not be capable of not being (Aristotle, Metaphysics 983b).

Thales's account of water as the most real is internally consistent, meaning the argument uses the evidence
presented in such a way as to avoid asserting contradictory and potentially competing claims. However, his
approach itself prioritizes reason over the overwhelming empirical evidence. As a result, he draws a
conclusion that denies the reality of change, motion, and plurality that is experienced so readily.

Pluralism

Pluralism asserts that fundamental reality consists of many types of being. The pluralists viewed the "really
real" as "many," but like the pre-Socratic monists, they did not hold a uniform view concerning how to define
the many or basic realities (see Table 6.2).

                                 Date  Philosopher      The Many Is:

                     c. 500-428 BCE Anaxagoras moving bits of matter

                     c. 494-434 BCE Empedocles fire, air, water, earth

                     c. 5th century BCE Leucippus atoms (indivisible eternal bits of matter)

                     c. 460-370 BCE Democritus atoms (indivisible eternal bits of matter)

                     TABLE 6.2 Pre-Socratic Pluralists

One of the views that resonates with the contemporary reader is that of atomism. Note that the atomism
alluded to here is different from what is referred to as atomic theory. The atom within the thinking of
Leucippus and Democritus refers to atomos as meaning "uncuttable" or "that which cannot be divided." The
plurality we experience is the result of atoms in motion. As these indivisible and eternal bits of true being
collide and either join or separate, the beings we experience are formed. But underneath or supporting the
being we experience is that being which is eternal and unchanging--in other words, the atoms. Atoms are the
true being, and the visible objects are not!

Although it might appear that they have broken all philosophical ties with the monists, both the monists and
pluralists agreed that true being was eternal. Anything real stayed as it was. Change happened to things that
were not real. This assertion, however, leads to the unsatisfactory conclusion that neither the acorn nor the
oak is real.

Atomism in Indian Philosophy

Indian atomism provides for foundational immutable substances while going further toward accounting for
change and explaining the transformation of the acorn into the oak. One of the earliest of all atomic models
was pioneered in the sixth centurty BCE by a philosopher named Acharya Kanad. According to legend, he was
inspired by watching pilgrims scatter rice and grains at a temple. As he began to examine the rice, he realized
that the grains, left alone, were without value. But once the grains were assembled into a meal, the collection of
"anu" (atom) made a meal. So too were the beings we observe collections of indivisible particles.

Another tradition, the Nyya-Vaieika, proposed an atomic theory built upon two elements: 1) The presence
of change within things or wholes, and 2) The doctrine of five elements (pañca mahbhtas). Unlike the Greek
atomistic view explored earlier, each atom was thought to have a specific attribute. As noted by Chatterjee
(2017), "An earth atom has odour, a water atom taste, a fire atom colour and an air atom has touch as specific
attribute."

The reasoning supporting the atomistic views described above is a priori. Using an appeal to reason (and not
experience), it was asserted that all things were composed of parts, and therefore it was necessary to assert
that all things were reducible to eternal, spherical, and indivisible building blocks. The potential of an infinite
regress (anavasth) suggested that parts could always be divided into smaller parts. However, reason dictated
that there must be a logical starting point at which no smaller part could be admitted (Chatterjee, 2017).

Unlike the random bumping and grinding used by Democritus to explain how atoms combined to form wholes,
the Nyya-Vaieika framework explained composition through the joining of similar atomic types to first
form a dyad (dyauka) and then a triad (tryauka). Triads joined in varying permutations in order to build the
objects, or "wholes," we experience.

Ontological Perspectives on Substance

Up until now, this chapter has examined substance from a materialistic perspective--the concrete substances
(water, fire, atoms) that make up the physical world that we see around us. As such, the discussion has been
located squarely within a physicalism, an approach that equates the real world with the physical world. The
study of existence, of being, of what is real--a discipline known as ontology--is broader. Ontos is the Greek
participle from the verb "to be" and means "being." What qualifies as being? How should we categorize being?

Naturalism

Naturalism, in its simplest form, is the view that meaningful inquiry includes only the physical and the laws
governing physical entities and rejects the priority placed on reason assumed within metaphysics. For
example, naturalism asserts that the inventory of beings allowed should include beings that are found within
the physical realm. If we can see a thing or if we can test a thing within a laboratory environment, then a
naturalist would include the being within their inventory. Naturalists also weed out the assumptions, theories,
and questions that are introduced but are not capable of empirical proof.

       The debate between supernaturalism (that accepts the existence of beings beyond or above our natural realm)
       and naturalism is as old as philosophical inquiry itself. But the tension became particularly relevant during the
       modern period. During modernity, scholars made advances across many disciplines based upon a turn to a
       scientific method and a rejection of a priori reasoning.

       The Allegory of the Cave
       In Book VII of The Republic, Plato offered his allegory of the cave, which depicts prisoners who have mistaken
       shadows cast on the wall of the cave for real beings and therefore have mistaken illusion for truth. The
       prisoners have been imprisoned throughout their lives. They are chained in place and have been positioned so
       that they can only see shadows that are cast upon the wall in front of them. They have come to treat the
       shadows not as the reflections that they are, but as something real. In an unexpected plot twist, one prisoner
       escapes and reaches the cave entrance. There, for the first time, he sees the sun--the true source of light
       (knowledge). After adjusting to the overpowering light emanating from the sun, the prisoner realizes that a fire
       was causing objects to cast shadows on the cave wall. The shadows cast by the fire within the cave were

reflections. He realized that the shadows are not actual being or truth--they were merely fading facsimiles of
reality. The escaped prisoner, freed from the chains of his earlier captivity (metaphorically speaking),
understands the true nature of being and truth. He returns to the cave to "free" his fellow captives, but his
claim is rejected by those in chains.

Plato's Notion of Substance and Form
The prisoners were mistaking shadows for that which was real. But shadows do not last. As soon as the source
of light fades, the shadows too disappear. If we want to identify the really real, Plato argued, we need to go
beyond mere shadows and try to find those beings whose reality is not temporary. The idea or form of a thing,
unlike the material "shadow," was not subject to atrophy and change.
The Latin term substantia, translated as "substance," describes the basic reality or essence of a thing that
supports or stands under features that are incidental to the substance itself. While the so-called incidental
features (e.g., quantity, time, place, etc.) can change, the essence of the entity endures. To account for the
fundamental whatness of a thing, Plato posited an unchanging form or idea as the underlying and unchanging
substance. As all things within a person's reality are subject to change, Plato reasoned that the forms or
unchanging basic realities concerning all things must not be located within this world. He therefore posited a
realm in which change did not occur.
There is an intuitive appeal to Plato's accounting of the real to forms. How else could we explain our ability to
recognize a type of being given the sheer number of differences we will observe in the instances of a thing? We
can make sense of dog, for example, because beyond the differences found among spaniels, poodles, and
retrievers, there is a form of dog that accounts for knowing dog and being as dog.
Aristotle on Matter and Form
Aristotle, a student of Plato, disagreed with his teacher. If forms did exist, he challenged, then how could forms
influence things? How could an immaterial form-which lacks matter--cause change to material entities?
In addition, what about concepts that are not easily reducible to a simple meaning or idea? Aristotle noted that
"good was said in many ways" (Ethics 1096a-b as found in Adamson 2016, 232). The reduction to a single form
to identify the whatness for something works when the concept is simple but does not work when a wide-
ranging concept (such as "the good") is considered. Aristotle agreed with the approach of isolating dogness as
the essence, but through the study of specific instances or particulars. He encouraged natural observation of
the entity in question and introduced the categories of species and genera.
Unlike Plato, Aristotle does not posit an otherworldly form or collection of forms. In his middle and later works,
178 6 · Metaphysics

       Aristotle explained substance through a composite of matter and form. Form, much like an idea a sculptor has
       in mind, is the unchanging purpose or whatness informing each particular or individual instance. In this case
       of a sculpture, the sculptor's vision or idea was referred to as the formal cause. The marble would be the
       material cause. The ability and artistic skill of the sculptor was termed the efficient cause. The final cause
       reflected the purpose of the being, or the reason why the sculpture was made in the first place.
       The idea of substance being a composite of form within matter became known as hylomorphism. The Greek
       word hyle translates as "wood." Here wood is figurative, a symbol of basic building material that is shaped by
       the form within a particular instance. The form does not reside in the Platonic heavens but, through purpose
       and efficiency, moves a particular thing from its beginning state (potentiality) along a continuum toward its
       final goal (actuality). The acorn is driven by its form and purpose to become the mighty oak. The movement
       from potentiality to actuality requires material and the efficient (proper) application of these materials such
       that the acorn can become!

       The attitudes of Plato and Aristotle are reflected in Figure 6.5. The School of Athens was discussed in the
       introduction to philosophy chapter. This section details the interaction between the two central characters in
       the oil-on-canvas painting. Plato is the subject displayed to the left of center, and Aristotle is the subject
       depicted to the right of center. Plato's gesture toward the heavens with his right hand was the artist's way of
       recognizing Plato's theory of forms. For Plato, forms were immutable and the ultimate reality. Forms were
       supposed to exist outside of our earthly realm as the things we observe are subject to change. Aristotle's
       gesture with his right hand was the artist's representation of Aristotle's stressing of the form embedded within
       particular matter. The ultimate reality was supposed to be within each instance of matter observed. The
       material components were subject to change, but the form was not.
       What do you think? The crucial difference introduced at this historical point was the emphasis placed upon
       particulars--individual instances of an entity--by Aristotle. While Plato stressed forms and asserted that there
       could be no individual instance without the form, Aristotle stressed particulars and asserted that without
       individual instances, there could be no knowledge of the form. Whereas Plato holds that beauty itself causes
       the beauty we see in flowers or faces, Aristotle asserts that there is no such thing as beauty without beautiful
       things, such as flowers and faces (Adamson, 2016, p. 231).

6.2 Self and Identity

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Apply the dilemma of persistence to self and identity.
  · Outline Western and Eastern theological views of self.
  · Describe secular views of the self.
  · Describe the mind-body problem.
Today, some might think that atomism and Aristotle's teleological view have evolved into a theory of cells that
resolves the acorn-oak tree identity problem. The purpose, or ergon, of both the acorn and the oak tree are
present in the zygote, the cell that forms when male and female sex cells combine. This zygote cell contains the
genetic material, or the instructions, for how the organism will develop to carry out its intended purpose.
But not all identity problems are so easily solved today. What if the author of this chapter lived in a house as a
child, and years later, after traveling in the highly glamorous life that comes with being a philosopher, returned
to find the house had burned down and been rebuilt exactly as it had been. Is it the same home? The generic
questions that center on how we should understand the tension between identity and persistence include:
  · Can a thing change without losing its identity?
  · If so, how much change can occur without a loss of identity for the thing itself?
This section begins to broach these questions of identity and self.

      The Ship of Theseus

       Consider the following thought experiment. Imagine a wooden ship owned by the hero Theseus. Within
       months of launching, the need to replace decking would be evident. The salt content of sea water is highly
       corrosive. Accidents can also happen. Within a common version of the thought experiment, the span of one
       thousand years is supposed. Throughout the span, it is supposed that the entire decking and wooden content
       of the ship will have been replaced. The name of the ship remains constant. But given the complete change of
       materials over the assumed time span, in what sense can we assert that the ship is the same ship? We are
       tempted to conceptualize identity in terms of persistence, but the Ship of Theseus challenges the commonly
       held intuition regarding how to make sense of identity.

       Similarly, as our bodies develop from zygote to adult, cells die and are replaced using new building materials
       we obtain though food, water, and our environment. Given this, are we the same being as we were 10 or 20
       years ago? How can we identify what defines ourselves? What is our essence? This section examines answers
       proposed by secular and religious systems of belief.

      Judeo-Christian Views of Self

       The common view concerning identity in Judeo-Christian as well as other spiritual traditions is that the self is
       a soul. In Western thought, the origin of this view can be traced to Plato and his theory of forms. This soul as
       the real self solves the ship of Theseus dilemma, as the soul continuously exists from zygote or infant and is
       not replaced by basic building materials. The soul provides permanence and even persists into the afterlife.

       Much of the Christian perspective on soul and identity rested on Aristotle's theory of being, as a result of the
       work of St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas, a medieval philosopher, followed the Aristotelian composite of form and
       matter but modified the concept to fit within a Christianized cosmology. Drawing upon portions of Aristotle's
       works reintroduced to the West as a result of the Crusades, Aquinas offered an alternative philosophical model
       to the largely Platonic Christian view that was dominant in his day. From an intellectual historical perspective,
       the reintroduction of the Aristotelian perspective into Western thought owes much to the thought of Aquinas.

       In Being and Essence, Aquinas noted that there was a type of existence that was necessary and uncaused and a
       type of being that was contingent and was therefore dependent upon the former to be brought into existence.
       While the concept of a first cause or unmoved mover was present within Aristotle's works, Aquinas identified
       the Christian idea of God as the "unmoved mover." God, as necessary being, was understood as the cause of
       contingent being. God, as the unmoved mover, as the essence from which other contingent beings derived
       existence, also determined the nature and purpose driving all contingent beings. In addition, God was
       conceived of as a being beyond change, as perfection realized. Using Aristotelian terms, we could say that God
       as Being lacked potentiality and was best thought of as that being that attained complete actuality or
       perfection--in other words, necessary being.

       God, as the ultimate Good and Truth, will typically be understood as assigning purpose to the self. The
       cosmology involved is typically teleological--in other words, there is a design and order and ultimately an end
       to the story (the eschaton). Members of this tradition will assert that the Divine is personal and caring and that
       God has entered the narrative of our history to realize God's purpose through humanity. With some doctrinal
       exception, if the self lives the good life (a life according to God's will), then the possibility of sharing eternity

"Imagining Eternal Life (https://openstax.org/r/imagining-eternal-life)".
Is eternal life an appealing prospect? If change is not possible within heaven, then heaven (the final resting place for
immortal souls) should be outside of time. What exactly would existence within an eternal now be like? In the video,
Pawl claimed that time has to be present within eternity. He argued that there must be movement from potentiality
to actuality. How can that happen in an eternity?

Hindu and Buddhist Views of Self

Within Hindu traditions, atman is the term associated with the self. The term, with its roots in ancient
Sanskrit, is typically translated as the eternal self, spirit, essence, soul, and breath (Rudy, 2019). Western faith
traditions speak of an individual soul and its movement toward the Divine. That is, a strong principle of
individuation is applied to the soul. A soul is born, and from that time forward, the soul is eternal. Hinduism,
on the other hand, frames atman as eternal; atman has always been. Although atman is eternal, atman is
reincarnated. The spiritual goal is to "know atman" such that liberation from reincarnation (moksha) occurs.
Brahman
Hindu traditions vary in the meaning of brahman. Some will speak of a force supporting all things, while other
traditions might invoke specific deities as manifestations of brahman. Escaping the cycle of reincarnation
requires the individual to realize that atman is brahman and to live well or in accordance with dharma,
observing the code of conduct as prescribed by scripture, and karma, actions and deeds. Union of the atman
with brahman can be reach though yoga, meditation, rituals, and other practices.

       Buddha rejected the concept of brahman and proposed an alternate view of the world and the path to
       liberation. The next sections consider the interaction between the concepts of Atman (the self) and Brahman
       (reality).

       The Doctrine of Dependent Origination

       Buddhist philosophy rejects the concept of an eternal soul. The doctrine of dependent origination, a central
       tenet within Buddhism, is built on the claim that there is a causal link between events in the past, the present,
       and the future. What we did in the past is part of what happened previously and is part of what will be.

       The doctrine of dependent origination (also known as interdependent arising) is the starting point for
       Buddhist cosmology. The doctrine here asserts that not only are all people joined, but all phenomena are
       joined with all other phenomena. All things are caused by all other things, and in turn, all things are dependent
       upon other things. Being is a nexus of interdependencies. There is no first cause or prime mover in this
       system. There is no self--at least in the Western sense of self--in this system (O'Brien 2019a).

       The Buddhist Doctrine of No Self (Anatman)

       One of many distinct features of Buddhism is the notion of anatman as the denial of the self. What is being
       denied here is the sense of self expressed through metaphysical terms such as substance or universal being.
       Western traditions want to assert an autonomous being who is strongly individuated from other beings. Within
       Buddhism, the "me" is ephemeral.

       Suffering and Liberation

       Within Buddhism, there are four noble truths that are used to guide the self toward liberation. An often-quoted
       sentiment from Buddhism is the first of the four noble truths. The first noble truth states that "life is suffering"
       (dukkha).

       But there are different types of suffering that need to be addressed in order to understand more fully how
       suffering is being used here. The first meaning (dukkha-dukkha) is commensurate with the ordinary use of
       suffering as pain. This sort of suffering can be experienced physically and/or emotionally. A metaphysical
       sense of dukkha is viparinama-dukkha. Suffering in this sense relates to the impermanence of all objects. It is
       our tendency to impose permanence upon that which by nature is not, or our craving for ontological
       persistence, that best captures this sense of dukkha. Finally, there is samkhara-dukkha, or suffering brought
       about through the interdependency of all things.

       Building on an understanding of "suffering" informed only by the first sense, some characterize Buddhism as
       "life is suffering; suffering is caused by greed; suffering ends when we stop being greedy; the way to do that is
       to follow something called the Eightfold Path" (O'Brien 2019b). A more accurate understanding of dukkha
       within this context must include all three senses of suffering.

       The second of the noble truths is that the cause of suffering is our thirst or craving (tanha) for things that lack
       the ability to satisfy our craving. We attach our self to material things, concepts, ideas, and so on. This
       attachment, although born of a desire to fulfill our internal cravings, only heightens the craving. The problem
       is that attachment separates the self from the other. Through our attachments, we lose sight of the
       impermanence not only of the self but of all things.

       The third noble truth teaches that the way to awakening (nirvana) is through a letting go of the cravings.
       Letting go of the cravings entails the cessation of suffering (dukkha).

The fourth truth is founded in the realization that living a good life requires doing, not just thinking. By living
in accordance with the Eightfold Path, a person may live such that "every action of body, mind, and speech" are
geared toward the promotion of dharma.

The Five Aggregates

How might the self (atman) experience the world and follow a path toward liberation? Buddhist philosophy
posits five aggregates (skandhas), which are the thoughtful and iterative processes, through which the self
interacts with the world.

1. Form (rupa): the aggregate of matter, or the body.
2. Sensation (vedana): emotional and physical feelings.
3. Perception (samjna): thinking, the processing of sense data; "knowledge that puts together."
4. Mental formation (samskara): how thoughts are processed into habits, predispositions, moods, volitions,

      biases, interests, etc. The fourth skandhas is related to karma, as much of our actions flow from these
      elements.
5. Consciousness (vijnana): awareness and sensitivity concerning a thing that does not include
      conceptualization.

Although the self uses the aggregates, the self is not thought of as a static and enduring substance underlying
the processes. These aggregates are collections that are very much subject to change in an interdependent
world.

Secular Notions of Self

In theology, continuity of the self is achieved through the soul. Secular scholars reject this idea, defining self in
different ways, some of which are explored in the next sections.

Bundle Theory

One of the first and most influential scholars in the Western tradition to propose a secular concept of self was
Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-1776). Hume formed his thoughts in response to empiricist thinkers'
views on substance and knowledge. British philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) offered a definition of
substance in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding. In Book XXIII, Locke described substance as "a
something, I know not what." He asserted that although we cannot know exactly what substance is, we can
reason from experience that there must be a substance "standing under or upholding" the qualities that exist
within a thing itself. The meaning of substance is taken from the Latin substantia, or "that which supports."

If we return to the acorn and oak example, the reality of what it means to be an oak is rooted in the ultimate
reality of what it means to be an oak tree. The ultimate reality, like the oak's root system, stands beneath every
particular instance of an oak tree. While not every tree is exactly the same, all oak trees do share a something,
a shared whatness, that makes an oak an oak. Philosophers call this whatness that is shared among oaks a
substance.

Arguments against a static and enduring substance ensued. David Hume's answer to the related question of
"What is the self?" illustrates how a singular thing may not require an equally singular substance. According to
Hume, the self was not a Platonic form or an Aristotelian composite of matter and form. Hume articulated the
self as a changing bundle of perceptions. In his Treatise of Human Nature (Book 1, Part IV), Hume described
184 6 · Metaphysics

       the self as "a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with inconceivable
       rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement."
       Hume noted that what has been mistaken for a static and enduring self was nothing more than a constantly
       changing set of impressions that were tied together through their resemblance to one another, the order or
       predictable pattern (succession) of the impressions, and the appearance of causation lent through the
       resemblance and succession. The continuity we experience was not due to an enduring self but due to the
       mind's ability to act as a sort of theater: "The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively
       make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations"
       (Hume 1739, 252).

       FIGURE 6.8 David Hume (1711-1776) took British empiricism to its logical extreme. Immanuel Kant credited
       Hume as awakening him from his "dogmatic slumbers." (credit: "M. David Hume, 1764" by Simon Charles Miger
       after Charles-Nicolas Cochin II/National Gallery of Art, Public Domain)
       Which theories of self--and substance--should we accept? The Greek theories of substance and the theological
       theories of a soul offer advantages. Substance allows us to explain what we observe. For example, an apple,
       through its substance, allows us to make sense of the qualities of color, taste, the nearness of the object, etc.
       Without a substance, it could be objected that the qualities are merely unintelligible and unrelated qualities
       without a reference frame. But bundle theory allows us to make sense of a thing without presupposing a
       mythical form, or "something I know not what!" Yet, without the mythical form of a soul, how do we explain our
       own identities?
       Anthropological Views
       Anthropological views of the self question the cultural and social constructs upon which views of the self are
       erected. For example, within Western thought, it is supposed that the self is distinct from the "other." In fact,
       throughout this section, we have assumed the need for a separate and distinct self and have used a principle of
       continuity based on the assumption that a self must persist over time. Yet, non-Western cultures blur or negate
       this distinction. The African notion of ubuntu, for example, posits a humanity that cannot be divided. The
       Nguni proverb that best describes this concept is "umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" sometimes translated as "a

person is a person through other persons" (Gade 2011). The word ubuntu is from the Zulu language, but
cultures from southern Africa to Tanzania, Kenya, and Democratic Republic of the Congo all have words for
this concept. Anthropological approaches attempt to make clear how the self and the culture share in making
meaning.

The Mind as Self

Many philosophers, Western and non-Western, have equated the self to the mind. But what is the mind? A
monist response is the mind is the brain. Yet, if the mind is the brain, a purely biological entity, then how do we
explain consciousness? Moreover, if we take the position that the mind is immaterial but the body is material,
we are left with the question of how two very different types of things can causally affect the other. The
question of "How do the two nonidentical and dissimilar entities experience a causal relationship?" is known
as the mind-body problem. This section explores some alternative philosophical responses to these questions.

Physicalism

Reducing the mind to the brain seems intuitive given advances in neuroscience and other related sciences that
deepen our understanding of cognition. As a doctrine, physicalism is committed to the assumption that
everything is physical. Exactly how to define the physical is a matter of contention. Driving this view is the
assertion that nothing that is nonphysical has physical effects.

Focus on the thought experiment concerning what Mary knows. Here is a summary of the thought experiment:

Mary is a scientist and specializes in the neurophysiology of color. Strangely, her world has black, white, and shades
of gray but lacks color (weird, but go with it!). Due to her expertise, she knows every physical fact concerning colors.
What if Mary found herself in a room in which color as we experience it is present? Would she learn anything? A
physicalist must respond "no"! Do you agree? How would you respond?

John Locke and Identity

In place of the biological, Locke defined identity as the continuity lent through what we refer to as
consciousness. His approach is often referred to as the psychological continuity approach, as our memories
and our ability to reflect upon our memories constitute identity for Locke. In his Essay on Human
Understanding, Locke (as cited by Gordon-Roth 2019) observed, "We must consider what Person stands for . . .
which, I think, is a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider it self as itself,
the same thinking thing in different times and places." He offered a thought experiment to illustrate his point.
Imagine a prince and cobbler whose memories (we might say consciousness) were swapped. The notion is far-
fetched, but if this were to happen, we would assert that the prince was now the cobbler and the cobbler was
now the prince. Therefore, what individuates us cannot be the body (or the biological).

       The Problem of Consciousness
       Christof Koch (2018) has said that "consciousness is everything you experience." Koch offered examples, such
       as "a tune stuck in your head," the "throbbing pain from a toothache," and "a parent's love for a child" to
       illustrate the experience of consciousness. Our first-person experiences are what we think of intuitively when
       we try to describe what consciousness is. If we were to focus on the throbbing pain of a toothache as listed
       above, we can see that there is the experiencing of the toothache. Curiously, there is also the experiencing of
       the experiencing of the toothache. Introspection and theorizing built upon first-person inspections affords
       vivid and moving accounts of the things experienced, referred to as qualia.
       An optimal accounting of consciousness, however, should not only explain what consciousness is but should
       also offer an explanation concerning how consciousness came to be and why consciousness is present. What
       difference or differences does consciousness introduce?

       Rene Descartes and Dualism
       Dualism, as the name suggests, attempts to account for the mind through the introduction of two entities. The
       dualist split was addressed earlier in the discussion of substance. Plato argued for the reality of immaterial
       forms but admitted another type of thing--the material. Aristotle disagreed with his teacher Plato and insisted
       on the location of the immaterial within the material realm. How might the mind and consciousness be
       explained through dualism?

      Mind Body Dualism

       Click to view content (https://openstax.org/books/introduction-philosophy/pages/6-2-self-and-identity)
       A substance dualist, in reference to the mind problem, asserts that there are two fundamental and irreducible
       realities that are needed to fully explain the self. The mind is nonidentical to the body, and the body is
       nonidentical to the mind. The French philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650) offered a very influential
       version of substance dualism in his 1641 work Meditations on First Philosophy. In that work, Descartes
       referred to the mind as a thinking thing (res cogitans) and the body as an extended nonthinking thing (res
       extensa). Descartes associated identity with the thinking thing. He introduced a model in which the self and
       the mind were eternal.

Yorick's skull" by Henry Courtney Selous/Wikimedia, Public Domain)
Behaviorism
There is a response that rejects the idea of an independent mind. Within this approach, what is important is
not mental states or the existence of a mind as a sort of central processor, but activity that can be translated
into statements concerning observable behavior (Palmer 2016, 122). As within most philosophical
perspectives, there are many different "takes" on the most correct understanding. Behaviorism is no
exception. The "hard" behaviorist asserts that there are no mental states. You might consider this perspective
the purist or "die-hard" perspective. The "soft" behaviorist, the moderate position, does not deny the
possibility of minds and mental events but believes that theorizing concerning human activity should be based
on behavior.
Before dismissing the view, pause and consider the plausibility of the position. Do we ever really know
another's mind? There is some validity to the notion that we ought to rely on behavior when trying to know or
to make sense of the "other." But if you have a toothache, and you experience myself being aware of the qualia
associated with a toothache (e.g., pain, swelling, irritability, etc.), are these sensations more than activities?
What of the experience that accompanies the experience?

6.3 Cosmology and the Existence of God

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe teleological and moral arguments for the existence of God.
  · Outline Hindu cosmology and arguments for and against the divine.
  · Explain Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God.
  · Articulate the distinction between the logical and evidential problems of evil.
188 6 · Metaphysics

       Another major question in metaphysics relates to cosmology. Cosmology is the study of how reality is ordered.
       How can we account for the ordering, built upon many different elements such as causation, contingency,
       motion, and change, that we experience within our reality? The primary focus of cosmological arguments will
       be on proving a logically necessary first cause to explain the order observed. As discussed in earlier sections,
       for millennia, peoples have equated the idea of a first mover or cause with the divine that exists in another
       realm. This section cosmological arguments for the existence of God as well as how philosophers have
       reconciled the existence of God with the presence of evil in the world.

      Teleological Arguments for God

       Teleological arguments examine the inherent design within reality and attempt to infer the existence of an
       entity responsible for the design observed. Teleological arguments consider the level of design found in living
       organisms, the order displayed on a cosmological scale, and even how the presence of order in general is
       significant.
       Aquinas's Design Argument
       Thomas Aquinas's Five Ways is known as a teleological argument for the existence of God from the presence of
       design in experience. Here is one possible formulation of Aquinas's design argument:
        1. Things that lack knowledge tend to act toward an end/goal.
        2. These things act toward an end either by chance or by design.

              A. It is obvious that it is not by chance.
              B. Things that lack knowledge act toward an end by design.
        3. If a thing is being directed toward an end, it requires direction by some being endowed with intelligence
             (e.g. the arrow being directed by the archer).
        4. Therefore, some intelligent being exists that directs all natural things toward their end. This being is
             known as God.

Design Arguments in Biology

Though Aquinas died long ago, his arguments still live on in today's discourse, exciting passionate argument.
Such is the case with design arguments in biology. William Paley (1743-1805) proposed a teleological
argument, sometimes called the design argument, that there exists so much intricate detail, design, and
purpose in the world that we must suppose a creator. The sophistication and incredible detail we observe in
nature could not have occurred by chance.

Paley employs an analogy between design as found within a watch and design as found within the universe to
advance his position. Suppose you were walking down a beach and you happened to find a watch. Maybe you
were feeling inquisitive, and you opened the watch (it was an old-fashioned pocket watch). You would see all
the gears and coils and springs. Maybe you would wind up the watch and observe the design of the watch at
work. Considering the way that all the mechanical parts worked together toward the end/goal of telling time,
you would be reluctant to say that the watch was not created by a designer.

Now consider another object--say, the complexity of the inner workings of the human eye. If we can suppose a
watchmaker for the watch (due to the design of the watch), we must be able to suppose a designer for the eye.
For that matter, we must suppose a designer for all the things we observe in nature that exhibit order.
Considering the complexity and grandeur of design found in the world around us, the designer must be a
Divine designer. That is, there must be a God.

Often, the design argument is formulated as an induction:

1. In all things we have experienced that exhibit design, we have experienced a designer of that artifact.
2. The universe exhibits order and design.
3. Given #1, the universe must have a designer.
4. The designer of the universe is God.

Moral Arguments for God

Another type of argument for the existence of God is built upon metaethics and normative ethics. Consider
subjective and objective values. Subjective values are those beliefs that guide and drive behaviors deemed
permissible as determined by either an individual or an individual's culture. Objective values govern morally
permissible and desired outcomes that apply to all moral agents. Moral arguments for the existence of God
depend upon the existence of objective values.

If there are objective values, then the question of "Whence do these values come?" must be raised. One
possible answer used to explain the presence of objective values is that the basis of the values is found in God.
Here is one premise/conclusion form of the argument:

1. If objective values exist, there must be a source for their objective validity.
2. The source of all value (including the validity held by objective values) is God.
3. Objective values do exist.
4. Therefore, God exists.

This argument, however, raises questions. Does moral permissibility (i.e., right and wrong) depend upon God?
190 6 · Metaphysics

       Are ethics an expression of the divine, or are ethics better understood separate from divine authority?

                WRITE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

       Watch "God & Morality: Part 2 (https://openstax.org/r/god-and-morality-part-2)" by Steven Darwall.

       Darwall's argument for the autonomy of ethics may be restated as follows:

        1. God knows morality best (1:44).
        2. God knows what is best for us (2:12).
        3. God has authority over us (2:48).

       How does Darwall refute the conclusion? What is the evidence offered, and at what point within the argument is the
       evidence introduced? What does his approach suggest about refutational strategies? Can you refute Darwall's
       argument?

       As you write, begin by defining the conclusion. Remember that in philosophy, conclusions are not resting points but
       mere starting points. Next, present the evidence, both stated and unstated, and explain how it supports the
       conclusion.

      The Ontological Argument for God

       An ontological argument for God was proposed by the Italian philosopher, monk, and Archbishop of
       Canterbury Anselm (1033-1109). Anselm lived in a time where belief in a deity was often assumed. He, as a
       person and as a prior of an abbey, had experienced and witnessed doubt. To assuage this doubt, Anselm
       endeavored to prove the existence of God in such an irrefutable way that even the staunchest of nonbelievers
       would be forced, by reason, to admit the existence of a God.

       Anselm's proof is a priori and does not appeal to empirical or sense data as its basis. Much like a proof in
       geometry, Anselm is working from a set of "givens" to a set of demonstrable concepts. Anselm begins by
       defining the most central term in his argument--God. For the purpose of this argument, Anselm suggests, let
       "God" = "a being than which nothing greater can be conceived." He makes two key points:

        1. When we speak of God (whether we are asserting God is or God is not), we are contemplating an entity who
             can be defined as "a being than which nothing greater can be conceived."

        2. When we speak of God (either as believer or nonbeliever), we have an intramental understanding of that
             concept--in other words, the idea is within our understanding.

       Anselm continues by examining the difference between that which exists in the mind and that which exists
       both in the mind and outside of the mind. The question is: Is it greater to exist in the mind alone or in the mind
       and in reality (or outside of the mind)? Anselm asks you to consider the painter--for example, define which is
       greater: the reality of a painting as it exists in the mind of an artist or that same painting existing in the mind of
       that same artist and as a physical piece of art. Anselm contends that the painting, existing both within the
       mind of the artist and as a real piece of art, is greater than the mere intramental conception of the work.

       At this point, a third key point is established:

        3. It is greater to exist in the mind and in reality than to exist in the mind alone.
             Have you figured out where Anselm is going with this argument?

              A. If God is a being than which nothing greater can be conceived (established in #1 above);
              B. And since it is greater to exist in the mind and in reality than in the mind alone (established in #3

                   above);
              C. Then God must exist both in the mind (established in #2 above) and in reality;
              D. In short, God must be. God is not merely an intramental concept but an extra-mental reality as well.

Hindu Cosmology

One of the primary arguments for the existence of God as found within Hindu traditions is based on
cosmological conditions necessary to explain the reality of karma. As explained in the introduction to
philosophy chapter and earlier in this chapter, karma may be thought of as the causal law that links causes to
effects. Assuming the doctrine of interdependence, karma asserts that if we act in such a way to cause harm to
others, we increase the amount of negativity in nature. We therefore hurt ourself by harming others. As the self
moves through rebirth (samsara), the karmic debt incurred is retained. Note that positive actions also are
retained. The goal is liberation of the soul from the cycle of rebirth.
Maintenance of the Law of Karma
While one can understand karmic causality without an appeal to divinity, how the causal karmic chain is so
well-ordered and capable of realizing just results is not as easily explainable without an appeal to divinity. One
possible presentation of the argument for the existence of God from karma could therefore read as follows:
1. If karma is, there must be some force/entity that accounts for the appropriateness (justice) of the karmic

      debt or karmic reward earned.
2. The source responsible for the appropriateness (justice) of the debt or reward earned must be a conscious

      agent capable of lending order to all karmic interactions (past, present, and future).
3. Karmic appropriateness (justice) does exist.
4. Therefore, a conscious agent capable of lending order to all karmic interactions (past, present, and future)

      must exist.
5. Therefore, God exists.
192 6 · Metaphysics

       Physical World as Manifestation of Divine Consciousness

       The cosmology built upon the religious doctrines allows for an argument within Hindu thought that joins a
       version of the moral argument and the design argument. Unless a divine designer were assumed, the moral
       and cosmological fabric assumed within the perspective could not be asserted.

       Hindu Arguments Against the Existence of God

       One of the primary arguments against the existence of God is found in the Mmms tradition. This ancient
       school suggests that the Vedas were eternal but without authors. The cosmological and teleological evidence as
       examined above was deemed inconclusive. The focus of this tradition and its several subtraditions was on
       living properly.

      Problem of Evil

       The problem of evil poses a philosophical challenge to the traditional arguments (in particular the design
       argument) because it implies that the design of the cosmos and the designer of the cosmos are flawed. How can
       we assert the existence of a caring and benevolent God when there exists so much evil in the world? The glib
       answer to this question is to say that human moral agents, not God, are the cause of evil. Some philosophers
       reframe the problem of evil as the problem of suffering to place the stress of the question on the reality of
       suffering versus moral agency.

       The Logical Problem of Evil

       David Hume raised arguments not only against the traditional arguments for the existence of God but against
       most of the foundational ideas of philosophy. Hume, the great skeptic, starts by proposing that if God knows
       about the suffering and would stop it but cannot stop it, God is not omnipotent. If God is able to stop the
       suffering and would want to but does not know about it, then God is not omniscient. If God knows about the
       suffering and is able to stop it but does not wish to assuage the pain, God is not omnibenevolent. At the very
       least, Hume argues, the existence of evil does not justify a belief in a caring Creator.

       The Evidential Problem of Evil

       The evidential problem considers the reality of suffering and the probability that if an omnibenevolent divine
       being existed, then the divine being would not allow such extreme suffering. One of the most formidable
       presentations of the argument was formulated by William Rowe:

        1. There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have
             prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.

        2. An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could,
             unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad
             or worse.

        3. (Therefore) there does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being. (Rowe 1979, 336)

       Western Theistic Responses to the Problem of Evil

       Many theists (those who assert the existence of god/s) have argued against both the logical and evidential
       formulations of the problem of evil. One of the earliest Christian defenses was authored by Saint Augustine.
       Based upon a highly Neo-Platonic methodology and ontology, Augustine argued that as God was
       omnibenevolent (all good), God would not introduce evil into our existence. Evil, observed Augustine, was not
       real. It was a privation or negation of the good. Evil therefore did not argue against the reality or being of God
       but was a reflection for the necessity of God. Here we see the application of a set of working principles and the
       stressing of a priori resulting in what could be labeled (prima facie) a counterintuitive result.

       An African Perspective on the Problem of Evil

       In the above sections, the problem of evil was centered in a conception of a god as all-powerful, all-loving, and

all-knowing. Evil, from this perspective, reflects a god doing evil (we might say reflecting the moral agency of a
god) and thus results in the aforementioned problem--how could a "good" god do evil or perhaps allow evil to
happen? The rich diversity of African thought helps us examine evil and agency from different starting points.
What if, for example, the lifting of the agency (the doing of evil) was removed entirely from the supernatural? In
much of Western thought, God was understood as the creator. Given the philosophical role and responsibilities
that follow from the assignment of "the entity that made all things," reconciling evil and creation and God as
good becomes a problem. But if we were to remove the concept of God from the creator role, the agency of evil
(and reconciling evil with the creator) is no longer present.

Within the Yoruba-African perspective, the agency of evil is not put upon human agency, as might be expected
in the West, but upon "spiritual beings other than God" (Dasaolu and Oyelakun 2015). These multiple spiritual
beings, known as "Ajogun," are "scattered around the cosmos" and have specific types of wrongdoing
associated specifically with each being (Dasaolu and Oyelakun 2015). Moving the framework (or cosmology)
upon which goodness and evil is understood results in a significant philosophical shift. The meaning of evil,
instead of being packed with religious or supernatural connotations, has a more down-to-earth sense. Evil is
not so much sin as a destruction of life. It is not an offense against an eternal Creator, but an action conducted
by one human moral agent that harms another human moral agent.

Unlike Augustine's attempt to explain evil as the negation of good (as not real), the Yoruban metaphysics
asserts the necessity of evil. Our ability to contrast good and evil are required logically so that we can make
sense of both concepts.

6.4 Free Will

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define free will.
  · Explain how determinism, libertarianism, and compatibilism are different.

Though the presence of evil in the world suggests that we have free will, the idea of a first mover or an all-
powerful divine being challenges the idea that we might have free will in the material world. Throughout most
of our experiences, it seems as if we are free. When we complete a task, we seem very capable of marking this
experience as different from being free. But what if the sensation of freedom does not demonstrate the
presence of freedom?

Amusement parks often have rides that consist of a car on a track that has safety features forcing the car to
stay within predetermined paths. In most cases, there is an accelerator, a brake, and a steering wheel. Some
rides have strategically placed rubber boundaries guiding the vehicle, while others have a steel post hidden
underneath the car that guides the car by means of a predetermined tract. While "driving" the car, the young
driver feels free to choose the direction. As vivid as the experience for the driver may be, the thrill and
phenomenon does not prove the presence or existence of freedom! Similarly, does the feeling of being free
demonstrate the presence of freedom in our actions?

Defining Freedom

To begin to answer these questions, this section first explores two competing definitions of freedom.

The Ability to Do Otherwise

Perhaps the most intuitive definition of freedom can be expressed as "A moral agent is free if and only if the
moral agent could have done otherwise." Philosophers refer to this expression as the Principle of Alternative
Possibilities (PAP). A person is typically thought of as performing a free action if that same person could have
taken a different action or decided to take no action. Within many legal systems, a person is not considered
culpable if the action taken was forced.
194 6 · Metaphysics

       One objection against the PAP is based on how we define our being. What if we as physical objects are governed
       by the laws of nature? We do not set our rate of velocity when diving into a pool, nor are we able to determine
       the force of gravity if we choose to enter the water "belly first"! Those outcomes are determined by the laws of
       nature. We, as objects, are governed by such forces. Does this mean, like the driver in the ride depicted above,
       that we never actually experience alternative possibilities? If so, then the possibility of freedom--a
       precondition for responsibility--seems absent.
       What about socialization and the conditioning that follows from living in a society? Does the constructed set of
       norms and values lessen our ability to do otherwise? Given the external conditioning we all endure, can we
       assert that the PAP is a possibility?
       The Ability to Do as One Wants
       One possible objection to defining freedom through PAP was offered by Harry G. Frankfurt. Frankfurt argued
       that freedom was better understood not as the ability to do otherwise but as the ability to do what one wants
       (1971). Imagine that a deranged space alien barges into your room and produces a sinister-looking button. You
       are informed that the button will annihilate Earth if pressed. The alien laughs manically and demands that you
       eat a delicious pizza brought from your favorite pizzeria or the alien will press the button. You can feel and
       smell the freshness! In this case, most of us would argue that you are not free to do otherwise. But you could
       say that you not only want the pizza, a first-order volition, but given what is at stake, you want to want the
       pizza. You could be described as acting freely, as you are satisfying your first- and second-order volitions. You
       are free, as you are doing what you want to do.

      Libertarianism

       Within the free will debate, libertarianism denotes freedom in the metaphysical sense and not in the political
       sense. A libertarian believes that actions are free--that is, not caused by external forces. We are free to plot our
       course through our actions. Existentialists further argue that our essence is the product of our choices.

       once characterized the reality of freedom as condemnation, as through the existence of free will, a human being was

therefore responsible for all actions taken. (credit: "Jean Paul Sartre for PIFAL" by Arturo Espinosa/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Many proponents of the libertarian view assume the definition of freedom inherent to the Principle of
Alternative Possibilities (PAP). We are free if and only if we could have done otherwise at a specific time.

There are many challenges to this assertion. One objection, based on Benjamin Libet's neuroscience-based
experiments, suggest that many of the actions we perceive as free are, in fact, caused and determined by the
brain.

Determinism

The contrary view to metaphysical libertarianism is determinism. The determinist holds that human moral
agents are not free from external forces. Our actions could not have been otherwise. Thus, action X at time T
must occur.

Causal Closure of the Physical World

One argument used to support determinism is built upon the observation of causality. Baron D'Holbach
(1723-1789), in his System of Nature, observed that we, like all other natural entities, are subject to and
governed by natural laws of the universe. His so-called "hard determinism" posited that all our actions are
outside of our control. Humans cannot escape the cause-and-effect relationships that are part and parcel of
being in the world.

Causal Determinacy of the Past

Another argument used to support determinism is built upon the consideration of past experiences. Perhaps
the simplest way to express the causal force the past holds on future events is to reflect on your first-person
experience. How influential has the past been in shaping the decisions you make in the present? We use
expressions that reflect this causal power--for example, I will not get fooled again, I guess I will have to learn
from my mistakes, etc. What has happened in the past can, in the least, limit the event horizon of the present.

The power of the past is not limited to first-person experience. Our socio-economic status, for example, can be
a powerful force in determining the actions we deem permissible. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once quipped, we
tend to "don the knapsack of custom" without questioning the contents of the knapsack.

Another important distinction when discussing determinism is that of compatibilism. Some determinists will
assume that free will is not compatible with determinism. An incompatibilist position asserts that due to the
nature of freedom and our lack of control concerning our actions, we cannot be held culpable for our actions. A
soft determinist will assume that free will is compatible with determinism. In order to salvage a sense of moral
culpability, an incompatibility might challenge the definition of freedom in terms of the PAP. For example, if
you consider Frankfurt's framing of freedom of fulfilling higher-order volitions, then even when forced to take
an action, it may have very well been the action you would have chosen if not forced to do so.

William James (1842-1910) offers a view called indeterminism in which the notion is that all events are rigidly
controlled. What if there is the possibility that one small effect might be uncaused somewhere out there in the
grand series of cause-and-effect sequences? Given the possibility that such an uncaused effect might occur,
there is the chance that not all events are falling dominoes or events that must happen. Thus, even in a
deterministic setting, an indeterminist can argue that the possibility of an uncaused act is a genuine one. By
extension, your choices, your hopes, and the actions for which you should be praised or criticized cannot be
196 6 · Metaphysics

       treated without doubt as caused externally. These actions could be your own!

                THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

       Watch the video "Language: Contrastivism #2 (Free Will) (https://openstax.org/r/contrastivism-2-free-will)" by
       Walter Sinnott-Armstrong.
       Metaphysicians are concerned with freedom from causation. By contrast, ethicists are concerned with freedom from
       constraint. Contrastivism allows enough space for philosophers to contrast the different focuses and to appreciate
       the differences that these differences introduce. According to Sinnott-Armstrong, the net result is a cease-fire. How
       can you support or refute the contrastivist solution to the problem of free will?

Summary

6.1 Substance

The Latin term substantia, translated as "substance," is often used to refer to the basic reality supporting or
standing under features that are incidental to that same thing. Ancient Greek philosophers were both monists
and dualists. Indian philosophers developed the idea of atomism. The challenge of persistence (i.e., whether a
thing could be said to retain identity despite changes introduced through time) can be explored through the
Ship of Theseus thought experiment.

6.2 Self and Identity

There are different answers to the question "What is the self?" The Judeo-Christian view tends to posit the
"really real," or the true self, in terms of a soul. Hindu and Buddhist views identify the self with the "atman."
Atman is an ancient term and has many meanings, but typically the term is translated as eternal self, soul, or
even breath. Unlike in the Judeo-Christian view, the soul is reincarnated until the self attains release from
reincarnation (moksha). The Buddhist doctrine of No Self (anatman) challenged the Western view in which the
self is understood as enduring. There is no persistent self; within Buddhism, the "me" is ephemeral.

A second issue addressed within this subsection is the reality of the mind. Many people identify the mind as
the brain. Perhaps the attempts to reduce thinking to an independent mind are relics of an outdated view. The
hard problem of consciousness is identified as the inability to explain one's awareness of being aware.
Behaviorism, the understanding of the self in terms of behavior, is one possible explanation for the ultimate
reality of the self.

6.3 Cosmology and the Existence of God

The attempt to demonstrate the existence of God has taken many forms and occurred across multiple cultures.
Cosmological arguments consider that which is found in experience--that is, they are a posteriori and move
from observed effects to cause. Ontological arguments are not based in experience but call upon people as
thinkers to apply reason in order to reach a conclusion (i.e., they are a priori arguments). These arguments,
much as a geometer might consider the nature of a triangle and then prove a theorem concerning triangularity,
do not appeal to experience. Rather, they pose that the basic attributes of God are known through reason.
Moral theorists argue for the existence of a divine being through a consideration of the possibility of objective
values.

How might the existence of evil support or argue against the existence of a god? The evidential problem of evil
considers the reality of suffering and challenges the attributes we might apply to God given the existence of
suffering. As not all traditions assume the same cosmology, some traditions (such as the African or Yoruban
view) do not have this particular issue. Augustine, working within a Christian cosmology, attempted to answer
the challenge by positing evil as the absence of good. Thus, a god could not be challenged as being good if evil
existed as evil was merely the privation (absence) of good.

6.4 Free Will

Does the sensation of freedom prove the existence of freedom? The metaphysical libertarian response declares
that human action are free and outside of the causality observed governing natural objects. Because free
choices exist, we are culpable for our decisions. The determinist response, in its so-called hard form, states
that all actions are governed by the laws and principles observed in nature. According to this view, people's
actions, although accompanied by a feeling of freedom, are not in fact free. This section considers the soft
determinist position, in which, as long as the moral agent did not face internal constraints concerning the
choice at hand, the action could be free. Soft determinism is considered a compatibilist position, as the lack of
alternative possibilities was considered compatible with freedom. Indeterminism, observing the inability of
human reason to capture reality and all cause-and-effect chains in totality, asserts that the possibility of one
event being outside of a cause-and-effect sequence is enough to assert the possibility of human freedom.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

7.1 What Epistemology Studies
7.2 Knowledge
7.3 Justification
7.4 Skepticism
7.5 Applied Epistemology

INTRODUCTION Within any discipline of study, the acquisition of new knowledge is a primary goal. Theorists
and researchers throughout academia seek to expand the body of knowledge associated with their discipline.
Philosophers likewise aim for knowledge acquisition but are also concerned with the nature of knowledge
itself. What is knowledge? Is there a limit to what we can know? How can we increase our knowledge without
first understanding what knowledge is? Epistemology is the field within philosophy that focuses on questions
pertaining to the nature and extent of human knowledge. This chapter seeks to provide a general
understanding of the discipline of epistemology.
204 7 · Epistemology

     7.1 What Epistemology Studies

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the study of epistemology.
         · Explain how the counterexample method works in conceptual analysis.
         · Explain the difference between a priori and a posteriori knowledge.
         · Categorize knowledge as either propositional, procedural, or by acquaintance.

       The word epistemology is derived from the Greek words episteme, meaning "knowledge," and logos, meaning
       "explanation" and translated in suffix form (-logia) as "the study of." Hence, epistemology is the study of
       knowledge. Epistemology focuses on what knowledge is as well as what types of knowledge there are. Because
       knowledge is a complex concept, epistemology also includes the study of the possibility of justification, the
       sources and nature of justification, the sources of beliefs, and the nature of truth.

      How to Do Epistemology

       Like other areas within philosophy, epistemology begins with the philosophical method of doubting and asking
       questions. What if everything we think we know is false? Can we be sure of the truth of our beliefs? What does
       it even mean for a belief to be true? Philosophers ask questions about the nature and possibility of knowledge
       and related concepts and then craft possible answers. But because of the nature of philosophical investigation,
       simply offering answers is never enough. Philosophers also try to identify problems with those answers,
       formulate possible solutions to those problems, and look for counterarguments. For example, in questioning
       the possibility of knowledge, philosophers imagine ways the world could be such that our beliefs are false and
       then try to determine whether we can rule out the possibility that the world really is this way. What if there's a
       powerful evil demon who feeds you all your conscious experiences, making you believe you are currently
       reading a philosophy text when in fact you are not? How could you rule this out? And if you can't rule it out,
       what does this say about the concept of knowledge?

       In answering epistemological questions, theorists utilize arguments. Philosophers also offer counterexamples
       to assess theories and positions. And many philosophers utilize research to apply epistemological concerns to
       current issues and other areas of study. These are the tools used in epistemological investigation: arguments,
       conceptual analysis, counterexamples, and research.

       Conceptual Analysis and Counterexamples

       One of the main questions within epistemology pertains to the nature of the concepts of knowledge,
       justification, and truth. Analyzing what concepts mean is the practice of conceptual analysis. The idea is that
       we can answer questions like "What is knowledge?" and "What is truth?" by using our grasp of the relevant
       concepts. When investigating a concept, theorists attempt to identify the essential features of the concept, or
       its necessary conditions. So, when investigating knowledge, theorists work to identify features that all
       instances of knowledge share. But researchers are not only interested in isolating the necessary conditions for
       concepts such as knowledge; they also want to determine what set of conditions, when taken together, always
       amounts to knowledge--that is, its sufficient conditions. Conceptual analysis is an important element of doing
       philosophy, particularly epistemology. When doing conceptual analysis, theorists actively endeavor to come up
       with counterexamples to proposed definitions. A counterexample is a case that illustrates that a statement,
       definition, or argument is flawed.

           CONNECTIONS

       The introductory chapter provides an in-depth exploration of conceptual analysis. Counterexamples are
       discussed in the chapter on logic and reasoning.

       Counterexamples to definitions in epistemology usually take the form of hypothetical cases--thought

experiments intended to show that a definition includes features that are either not necessary or not sufficient
for the concept. If a counterexample works to defeat an analysis, then theorists will amend the analysis, offer a
new definition, and start the process over again. The counterexample method is part of the philosophical
practice of getting closer to an accurate account of a concept. Understanding the process of conceptual
analysis is key to following the debate in epistemological theorizing about knowledge and justification.

For example, a theorist could contend that certainty is a necessary component of knowledge: if a person were
not completely certain of a belief, then they could not be said to know the belief, even if the belief were true. To
argue against this "certainty" theory, another philosopher could offer examples of true beliefs that aren't quite
certain but are nevertheless considered to be knowledge. For example, take my current belief that there's a
bird on a branch outside my office window. I believe this because I can see the bird and I trust my vision. Is it
possible that I am wrong? Yes. I could be hallucinating, or the so-called bird may be a decoy (a fake stuffed
bird). But let's grant that there is indeed a real bird on the branch and that "there is a bird on that branch" is
true right now. Can I say that I know there is a bird on the branch, given that I believe it, it's true, and I have
good reason to believe it? If yes, then the "certainty" thesis is flawed. Certainty is not necessary to have
knowledge. This chapter includes several examples such as this, where a theorist offers an example to
undermine a particular account of knowledge or justification.

Arguments

As with all areas of philosophy, epistemology relies on the use of argumentation. As explained in the chapter
on logic and reasoning, argumentation involves offering reasons in support of a conclusion. The
aforementioned counterexample method is a type of argumentation, the aim of which is to prove that an
analysis or definition is flawed. Here is an example of a structured argument:

1. Testimonial injustice occurs when the opinions of individuals/groups are unfairly ignored or treated as
      untrustworthy.

2. If the testimony of women in criminal court cases is less likely to be believed than that of men, then this is
      unfair.

3. So, if the testimony of women in criminal court cases is less likely to be believed than that of men, this is a
      case of testimonial injustice.

The above argument links the general concept of testimonial injustice to a specific possible real-world
scenario: women being treated as less believable by a jury. If women are considered less believable, then it is
problematic.

Research

Notice that the above argument does not say that women are in fact considered less believable. To establish
this thesis, philosophers can offer further arguments. Often, arguments utilize empirical research. If a theorist
can find studies that indicate that women are treated less seriously than men in general, then they can argue
that this attitude would extend to the courtroom. Philosophers often search for and utilize research from other
areas of study. The research used can be wide-ranging. Epistemologists may use research from psychology,
sociology, economics, medicine, or criminal justice. In the social and hard sciences, the goal is to accurately
describe trends and phenomena. And this is where philosophy differs from the sciences--for epistemology, the
goal is not only to describe but also to prescribe. Philosophers can argue that unjustifiably discounting the
opinions of groups is bad and to be avoided. Hence, epistemology is a normative discipline.

The Normative Nature of Epistemology

This chapter began with the observation that knowledge is the goal of many disciplines. If knowledge is a goal,
then it is desirable. Humans do not like being proven wrong in their beliefs. Possessing justification in the form
of reasons and support for beliefs makes a person less likely to be wrong. Hence, both justification and
knowledge are valuable. If knowledge is valuable and there are proper methods of justification that we should
206 7 · Epistemology

       follow, then epistemology turns out to be a normative discipline. Normativity is the assumption that certain
       actions, beliefs, or other mental states are good and ought to be pursued or realized. One way to think of
       epistemology is that in describing what knowledge, truth, and justification are, it further prescribes the proper
       way to form beliefs. And we do treat knowledge as valuable and further judge others according to the
       justification for their beliefs.

      A Preliminary Look at Knowledge

       Because the concept of knowledge is so central to epistemological theorizing, it is necessary to briefly discuss
       knowledge before proceeding. Knowledge enjoys a special status among beliefs and mental states. To say that
       a person knows something directly implies that the person is not wrong, so knowledge implies truth. But
       knowledge is more than just truth. Knowledge also implies effort--that the person who has knowledge did
       more than just form a belief; they somehow earned it. Often, in epistemology, this is understood as
       justification. These features of knowledge are important to keep in mind as we continue. First, we will look at
       the different ways of knowing.
       Ways of Knowing
       The distinction between a priori knowledge and a posteriori knowledge reveals something important about the
       possible ways a person can gain knowledge. Most knowledge requires experience in the world, although some
       knowledge without experience is also possible. A priori knowledge is knowledge that can be gained using
       reason alone. The acquisition of a priori knowledge does not depend on experience. One way to think of a
       priori knowledge is that it is logically prior to experience, which does not necessarily mean that it is always
       prior in time to experience. Knowledge that exists before experience (prior in time) is innate knowledge, or
       knowledge that one is somehow born with. Theorists disagree over whether innate knowledge exists. But many
       theorists agree that people can come to know things by merely thinking. For example, one can know that 4 × 2
       = 8 without needing to search for outside evidence.
       A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that can only be gained through experience. Because a posteriori
       knowledge depends on experience, it is empirical. Something is empirical if it is based on and verifiable
       through observation and experience, so empirical knowledge is knowledge gained from sense perception. If
       my belief that there's a bird on the branch outside my window is knowledge, it would be a posteriori
       knowledge. The difference between a posteriori and a priori knowledge is that the former requires experience
       and the latter does not.
       While a priori knowledge does not require experience, this does not mean that it must always be reached using
       reason alone. A priori knowledge can be learned through experience. Think of mathematical truths. While it is
       possible to figure out multiplication using thinking alone, many first understand it empirically by memorizing
       multiplication tables and only later come to understand why the operations work the way they do.

FIGURE 7.2 Some facts that students are asked to memorize in school, such as multiplication tables, fall into the
category of a priori knowledge--knowledge gained through reason alone. Knowledge about the shortest route to the

knowledge--knowledge that can only be gained through experience. (credit: modification of work "Ventura

Things You Can Know: Types of Knowledge
Philosophers classify knowledge not only by source but also by type. Propositional knowledge is knowledge of
propositions or statements. A proposition or statement is a declarative sentence with a truth value--that is, a
sentence that is either true or false. If one knows a statement, that means that the statement is true. And true
statements about the world are usually called facts. Hence, propositional knowledge is best thought of as
knowledge of facts. Facts about the world are infinite. It is a fact that the square root of 9 is 3. It is a fact that
Earth is round. It is a fact that the author of this chapter is five feet, one inch tall, and it is a fact that Nairobi is
the capital of Kenya. Often, philosophers describe propositional knowledge as "knowledge that," and if you
look at the structure of the previous sentences, you can see why. Someone can know that Nairobi is the capital
of Kenya, and "Nairobi is the capital of Kenya" is a true proposition. Propositional knowledge can be a priori or
a posteriori. Knowledge of our own height is clearly a posteriori because we cannot know this without
measuring ourselves. But knowing that 3 is the square root of 9 is a priori, given that it's possible for a person
to reason their way to this belief. Propositional knowledge is the primary focus of traditional epistemology. In
the following sections of this chapter, keep in mind that knowledge refers to propositional knowledge.
While traditional epistemology focuses on propositional knowledge, other types of knowledge exist.
Procedural knowledge is best understood as know-how. Procedural knowledge involves the ability to perform
some task successfully. While a person may know that a bicycle stays erect using centrifugal force and forward
momentum caused by peddling, and that the forces of friction and air resistance will affect their speed, this
does not mean that they know how to ride a bicycle. Having propositional knowledge concerning a task does
not guarantee that one has procedural knowledge of that task. Indeed, one could be a physicist who studies the
forces involved in keeping a bike upright, and therefore know many facts about bicycles, but still not know how
to ride a bike.

       guarantee that one knows how to ride a bicycle. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0

       Knowledge by acquaintance is knowledge gained from direct experience. A person knows something by
       acquaintance when they are directly aware of that thing. This awareness comes from direct perception using
       one's senses. For example, I have knowledge by acquaintance of pain when I am in pain. I am directly aware of
       the pain, so I cannot be mistaken about the existence of the pain.
       British philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) is credited with first articulating a distinction between
       knowledge by acquaintance and propositional knowledge, which he called knowledge by description (Russell
       1910-1911). According to Russell, knowledge by acquaintance is a direct form of knowledge. A person has
       knowledge by acquaintance when they have direct cognitive awareness of it, which is awareness absent of
       inference. That knowledge by acquaintance is not the product of inference is very important. Inference is a
       stepwise process of reasoning that moves from one idea to another. When I feel pain, I am acquainted with that
       pain without thinking to myself, "I am in pain." No inference is required on my part for me to know of my pain.
       I am simply aware of it. It is the directness of this knowledge that differentiates it from all other a posteriori
       knowledge. All knowledge by acquaintance is a posteriori, but not all a posteriori knowledge is knowledge by
       acquaintance. My awareness of pain is knowledge by acquaintance, yet when I infer that "something is causing
       me pain," this belief is propositional.
       Russell's distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and propositional knowledge, if accurate, has
       important implications in epistemology. It shows that inference is used even in cases of beliefs that people
       think are obvious: ordinary beliefs based on perception. Russell thought that one can only have knowledge by
       acquaintance of one's sensations and cannot have direct awareness of the objects that could be the cause of
       those sensations. This is a significant point. When I see the bird on a branch outside my office window, I am not
       immediately aware of the bird itself. Rather, I am directly aware of my perceptual experience of the bird--what
       philosophers call sense data. Sense data are sensations gained from perceptual experience; they are the raw
       data obtained through the senses (seeing, smelling, feeling, etc.). One's perceptual experience is of sense data,
       not of the objects that could be causing that sense data. People infer the existence of external objects that they
       believe cause their perceptual experiences. Russell's view implies that people always use reasoning to access
       the external world. I have knowledge by acquaintance of my perceptual experience of seeing a bird; I then infer
       ever so quickly (and often unconsciously) that there is a bird on the branch, which is propositional knowledge.
       Not all philosophers think that experience of the external world is mediated through sense data. Some
       philosophers contend that people can directly perceive objects in the external world. But Russell's theory

introduces an important possibility in epistemological thinking: that there is a gap between one's experience
of the world and the world itself. This potential gap opens up the possibility for error. The gap between
experience and the world is used by some thinkers to argue that knowledge of the external world is impossible.

Table 7.1 summarizes the types of knowledge discussed in this section.

TABLE 7.1 Types of Knowledge

Truth

Philosophers who argue that knowledge of the external world is impossible do so based on the idea that one
can never be certain of the truth of one's external world beliefs. But what does it mean to claim that a belief is
true? People are sometimes tempted to believe that truth is relative. A person may say things like "Well, that's
just their truth" as if something can be true for one person and not for others. Yet for statements and
propositions, there is only one truth value. One person can believe that Earth is flat while another can believe
is it round, but only one of them is right. People do not each personally get to decide whether a statement is
true. Furthermore, just because one has no way of determining whether a statement is true or false does not
mean that there is no truth to the matter. For example, you probably don't quite know how to go about
determining the exact number of blades of grass on the White House lawn, but this does not mean that there is
no true answer to the question. It is true that there is a specific number of blades of grass at this moment, even
if you cannot know what that number is.

But what does it mean for a statement to be true? At first, this question may seem silly. The meaning of truth is
obvious. True things are correct, factual, and accurate. But to say that something is correct, factual, or accurate
is just another way of saying it is true. Factual just means "true." Creating a noncircular and illuminating
account of truth is a difficult task. Nevertheless, philosophers attempt to explain truth. Philosophers often are
curious about and question concepts that most people accept as obvious, and truth is no exception.

Theories of truth and the debate over them are a rather complicated matter not suitable for an introductory
text. Instead, let's briefly consider two ways of understanding truth in order to gain a general understanding of
what truth is. Aristotle claimed that a true statement is one that says of something that it is what it is or that it
is not what it is not (Aristotle 1989). A possible interpretation of Aristotle's idea is that "A is B" is true if and
only if A is B. Notice that this simply removes the quotations around the proposition. The idea is simple: the
statement "Dogs are mammals" is true if dogs are mammals.
210 7 · Epistemology

       Another way of understanding truth is as a correspondence between statements and the world. The
       correspondence theory of truth proposes that a statement is true if and only if that statement corresponds to
       some fact (David 2015). A fact is a state of affairs in the world--an arrangement of objects and properties in
       reality--so the statement "The dog is under the bed" is true if and only if there exists in the world a dog and a
       bed and the dog is related to the bed by being underneath it. The correspondence theory of truth makes truth a
       relation between statements and the world. If statements are appropriately related to the world--if they
       correspond to the world--then those statements can be said to be true.

     7.2 Knowledge

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify and explain the elements of Plato's traditional account of knowledge.
         · Describe the Gettier problem.
         · Recall a Gettier case and explain how it is a counterexample to the traditional account of knowledge.
         · Identify and explain a way of thinking that attempts to solve the Gettier problem.
       What does it mean to say that one knows something? Knowledge is an important concept in all areas of
       thought. Knowledge is the goal and therefore enjoys a special status. Investigating the nature of knowledge
       reveals the importance of other concepts that are key to epistemological theorizing--justification in particular.

      Plato and the Traditional Account of Knowledge

       Plato, one of the most important of the Greek philosophers, hypothesized that knowledge is justified true
       belief. Plato's analysis is known as the traditional account of knowledge. Plato's definition is that a person S
       knows proposition P if and only if

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                     7.2 · Knowledge 211

1. P is true,
2. S believes P, and
3. S is justified in believing P (Plato 1997b).

Plato's hypothesis on knowledge, often referred to as the JTB account (because it is "justified true belief"), is
highly intuitive. To say "John knows P, but he does not believe P" sounds wrong. In order to know something, a
subject must first believe it. And one also cannot say "Ali knows P, but P is false." A person simply cannot have
knowledge of false things. Knowledge requires truth. Last, someone should not claim to know P if they have no
reason to believe P (a reason to believe being justification for P).

Problems with the Traditional Account of Knowledge

Amazingly, Plato's view that knowledge is justified true belief was generally accepted until the 20th century
(over 2,000 years!). But once this analysis was questioned, a flurry of developments occurred within
epistemology in the latter half of the 20th century. This section discusses the counterexample method at play
in the dialectic concerning what knowledge is. Plato's JTB analysis was the first to come under scrutiny.

In 1963, American philosopher Edmund Gettier (1927-2021) published a short paper titled "Is Justified True
Belief Knowledge?," which upended the JTB canon in Western philosophy. Gettier presents two
counterexamples to Plato's analysis of knowledge. In these counterexamples, a person seems to have a
justified true belief, yet they do not seem to have knowledge. While Gettier is credited with the first popular
counterexample to the JTB account, he was not the first philosopher to articulate a counterexample that calls
into question Plato's analysis. But because Gettier published the first influential account, any example that
seems to undermine Plato's JTB account of knowledge is called a Gettier case. Gettier cases illustrate the
inadequacy of the JTB account--a problem referred to as the Gettier problem.

Dharmakrti's Mirage

The earliest known Gettier case, long predating the term, was conceived by the eighth century Indian Buddhist
philosopher Dharmakrti. Dharmakrti's case asks one to imagine a weary nomad traveling across the desert in
search of water (Dreyfus 1997). The traveler crests a mountain and sees what appears to be an oasis in the
valley below, and so comes to believe that there is water in the valley. However, the oasis is just a mirage. Yet
there is water in the valley, but it is just beneath the surface of the land where the mirage is. The traveler is
justified in believing there is water in the valley due to sensory experience. Furthermore, it is true that there is
water in the valley. However, the traveler's belief does not seem to count as knowledge. Dharmakrti's
conclusion is that the traveler cannot be said to know there is water in the valley because the traveler's reason
for believing that there is water in the valley is an illusory mirage.

Russell's Case

Perhaps you've heard the phrase "Even a broken clock is right twice a day." The next case relies on this fact
about broken clocks. In 1948, Bertrand Russell offered a case in which a man looks up at a stopped clock at
exactly the correct time:

      There is the man who looks at a clock which is not going, though he thinks it is, and who happens to
      look at it at the moment when it is right; this man acquires a true belief as to the time of day, but
      cannot be said to have knowledge. (Russell 1948, 154)

Imagine that the clock the man looks at is known for its reliability. Hence, the man is justified in believing that
the time is, for example, 4:30. And, as the cases supposes, it is true that it is 4:30. However, given that the clock
is not working and that the man happens to look up at one of the two times a day that the clock is correct, it is
only a matter of luck that his belief happens to be true. Hence, Russell concludes that the man cannot be said
to know the correct time.
212 7 · Epistemology

Fake Barn Country

The last Gettier case we will look at is from American philosopher Carl Ginet (b. 1932) (Goldman 1976). Henry
is driving through a bucolic area of farmland and barns. What he doesn't realize, however, is that the area is
currently being used as a movie set, and all the barns save one are actually barn facades. While looking at one
of the barns, Henry says to himself, "That is a barn." Luckily for Henry, the one he points to is the one true barn
in the area. Again, all the conditions in Plato's analysis of knowledge are met. It is true that Henry is looking at
a real barn, and he believes it is a barn. Furthermore, he has come to this belief utilizing justifiable means--he
is using his vision, in normal lighting, to identify a common object (a barn). Yet one cannot reasonably say that
Henry knows the barn is a barn because he could have, by chance, accidentally identified one of the fake barns
as a true barn. He fortunately happens to pick the one true barn.

TABLE 7.2 Gettier Cases

Fixing Plato's Traditional Account of Knowledge

Gettier cases demonstrate that Plato's traditional account of knowledge as justified true belief is wrong.
Specifically, Gettier cases show that a belief being true and justified is not sufficient for that belief to count as
knowledge. In all the cases discussed, the subject seems to have a justified true belief but not knowledge.
Notice that this does not mean that belief, truth, or justification is not necessary for knowledge. Indeed, when
speaking of propositional knowledge, all philosophers grant that belief and truth are necessary conditions for
knowledge. A person cannot be said to know a proposition if they do not believe that proposition. And clearly, if
a belief is to count as knowledge, then that believe simply cannot be false. Accordingly, attempts to solve the
Gettier problem do one of two things: either they replace the justification condition with something more
robust, or they add a fourth condition to JTB to make the account sufficient.

No False Premises

In Dharmakrti's case, the nomad believes there is water in the valley based on the false belief that a mirage is
an oasis. And in Russell's case, the man bases his true belief about the time on the false belief that the clock
he's looking at is working. In both cases, the inference that leads to the true belief passes through false
premises. In response to this fact, American philosopher Gilbert Harman (1928-2021) suggested adding a
condition to the JTB account that he termed "no false lemmas" (Harman 1973). A false lemma is a false
premise, or step in the reasoning process. Harman's fourth condition is that a person's belief cannot be based
on an inference that uses false premises. According to Harman, S knows P if and only if (1) P is true, (2) S
believes P, (3) S is justified in believing P, and (4) S did not infer P from any falsehoods.

Harman theorized that many counterexamples to the traditional account share a similar feature: the truth of
the belief is not appropriately connected to the evidence used to deduce that belief. Going back to
Dharmakrti's case, what makes the statement "There's water in the valley" true is the fact that there is water
below the surface. However, the nomad comes to believe that there is water based on the mistaken belief that a
mirage is an oasis, so what makes the belief true is not connected to the reason the nomad believes it. If
Harman's condition that the reasoning that leads to belief cannot pass through false steps is added, then the
nomad's belief no longer counts as knowledge.

Harman's emendation explains why the nomad does not have knowledge and accounts for the intuition that
the man in Russell's case does not actually know what time it is. However, this cannot take care of all Gettier
cases. Consider the case of Henry in fake barn country. Henry comes to believe he is looking at a barn based on
his perceptual experience of the barn in front of him. And Henry does look at a real barn. He does not reason
through any false premises, such as "All the structures on my drive are barns." His inference flows directly
from his perceptual experience of a real barn. Yet it is a matter of luck that Henry isn't looking at one of the
many barn facades in the area, so his belief still does not seem to count as knowledge. Because Harman's
account is vulnerable to the barn counterexample, it does not solve the Gettier problem.

Ruling Out Defeaters and Alternatives

While driving through fake barn country, Henry happens to form the belief "That is a barn" when looking at
the only real barn in the area. While Henry's belief is not based on false premises, there still seems to be
something wrong with it. Why? The problem is that certain facts about Henry's environment (that it is filled
with barn facades), if known, would undermine his confidence in the belief. That the area is predominantly
filled with barn facades is what is known as a defeater because it serves to defeat the justification for his belief.
Contemporary American philosophers Keith Lehrer and Thomas Paxson Jr. suggest that justified true belief is
knowledge as long as there are no existing defeaters of the belief (Lehrer and Paxson 1969). S has knowledge
that P if and only if (1) P is true, (2) S believes P, (3) S is justified in believing P, and (4) there exist no defeaters
for P. The added fourth condition means that there cannot exist evidence that, if believed by S, would
undermine S's justification.

The "no defeaters" condition solves all three Gettier cases discussed so far because in each case, there exists
evidence that, if possessed by the subject, would undermine their justification. Henry cannot be said to know
he's looking at a barn because of the evidence that most of the barns in the area are fake, and Russell's man
doesn't know the time because the clock is stopped. The "no defeaters" condition thus helps solve many
Gettier cases. However, we now need a thorough account of when evidence counts as a defeater. We are told
that a defeater is evidence that would undermine a person's justification but not how it does this. It cannot be
that all evidence that weakens a belief is a defeater because this would make knowledge attainment much
more difficult. For many of our justified true beliefs, there exists some evidence that we are unaware of that
could weaken our justification. For example, we get many beliefs from other people. Research indicates that
people tell an average of one lie per day (DePaulo et al. 1996; Serota, Levine, and Boster 2010). So when
someone tells you something in conversation, often it is true that the person has lied once today. Is the
evidence that a person has lied once today enough evidence to undermine your justification for believing what
214 7 · Epistemology

they tell you?

Notice that because a defeater is evidence that would undermine a person's justification, what counts as a
defeater depends on what justification is. Of the theories of knowledge examined so far, all of them treat
justification as basic. They state that a belief must be justified but not how to measure or determine
justification.

The Problem with Justification

The traditional analysis of knowledge explains that knowledge is justified true belief. But even if we accept this
definition, we could still wonder whether a true belief is knowledge because we may wonder if it is justified.
What counts as justification? Justification is a rather broad concept. Instead of simply stating that justification
is necessary for knowledge, perhaps a thorough account of knowledge ought to instead spell out what this
means. The next section looks more deeply at how to understand justification and how some theorists suggest
replacing the justification condition in order to solve the Gettier problem.

7.3 Justification

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain what justification means in the context of epistemology.
  · Explain the difference between internal and external theories of justification.
  · Describe the similarities and differences between coherentism and foundationalism.
  · Classify beliefs according to their source of justification.

Much of epistemology in the latter half of the 20th century was devoted to the question of justification.
Questions about what knowledge is often boil down to questions about justification. When we wonder whether
knowledge of the external world is possible, what we really question is whether we can ever be justified in
accepting as true our beliefs about the external world. And as previously discussed, determining whether a
defeater for knowledge exists requires knowing what could undermine justification.

We will start with two general points about justification. First, justification makes beliefs more likely to be true.
When we think we are justified in believing something, we think we have reason to believe it is true. How
justification does this and how to think about the reasons will be discussed below. Second, justification does
not always guarantee truth. Justification makes beliefs more likely to be true, which implies that justified
beliefs could still be false. The fallibility of justification will be addressed at the end of this section.

The Nature of Justification

Justification makes a belief more likely to be true by providing reasons in favor of the truth of the belief. A

natural way to think of justification is that it provides logical support. Logic is the study of reasoning, so logical

support is strong reasoning. If I am reasoning correctly, I am justified in believing that my dog is a mammal

because all dogs are mammals. And I am justified in believing that  if I did the derivation

correctly. But what if I used a calculator to derive the result? Must I also have reasons for believing the

calculator is reliable before being justified in believing the answer? Or can the mere fact that calculators are

reliable justify my belief in the answer? These questions get at an important distinction between the possible

sources of justification--whether justification is internal or external to the mind of the believer.

Internalism and Externalism

Theories of justification can be divided into two different types: internal and external. Internalism is the view
that justification for belief is determined solely by factors internal to a subject's mind. The initial appeal of
internalism is obvious. A person's beliefs are internal to them, and the process by which they form beliefs is
also an internal mental process. If you discover that someone engaged in wishful thinking when they came to
the belief that the weather would be nice today, even if it turns out to be true, you can determine that they did

                                                                                                                                                                   7.3 · Justification 215

not know that it would be nice today. You will believe they did not have that knowledge because they had no
reasons or evidence on which to base their belief. When you make this determination, you reference that
person's mental state (the lack of reasons).

But what if a person had good reasons when they formed a belief but cannot currently recall what those
reasons were? For example, I believe that Aristotle wrote about unicorns, although I cannot remember my
reasons for believing this. I assume I learned it from a scholarly text (perhaps from reading Aristotle himself),
which is a reliable source. Assuming I did gain the belief from a reliable source, am I still justified given that I
cannot now recall what that source was? Internalists contend that a subject must have cognitive access to the
reasons for belief in order to have justification. To be justified, the subject must be able to immediately or upon
careful reflection recall their reasons. Hence, according to internalism, I am not justified in believing that
Aristotle wrote about unicorns.

On the other hand, an externalist would say my belief about Aristotle is justified because of the facts about
where I got the belief. Externalism is the view that at least some part of justification can rely on factors that are
not internal or accessible to the mind of the believer. If I once had good reasons, then I am still justified, even if
I cannot now cite those reasons. Externalist theories about justification usually focus on the sources of
justification, which include not only inference but also testimony and perception. The fact that a source is
reliable is what matters. To return to the calculator example, the mere fact that a calculator is reliable can
function as justification for forming beliefs based on its outputs.

An Example of Internalism: Ruling Out Relevant Alternatives

Recall that the "no defeaters" theory of knowledge requires that there exist no evidence that, if known by the
subject, would undermine their justification. The evidence is not known by the subject, which makes the
evidence external. The fourth condition could instead be an internal condition. Rather than require that there
exist no evidence, one could say that S needs to rule out any relevant alternatives to their belief. The "no
relevant alternatives" theory adds to the traditional account of knowledge the requirement that a person rule
out any competing hypotheses for their belief. Ruling out refers to a subject's conscious internal mental state,
which makes this condition internal in nature. Like the "no defeaters" condition, the "no relevant alternatives"
condition is meant to solve the Gettier problem. It does so by broadening the understanding of justification so
that justification requires ruling out relevant alternatives. However, it still doesn't solve the Gettier problem.
Returning to the barn example, the possibility that there are barn facades is not a relevant alternative to the
belief that one is looking at a barn. Unless one is in Hollywood, one would not think that facades are a distinct
possibility.

An Example of Externalism: Causal Theories

Externalists hold that a subject need not have access to why their true beliefs are justified. But some theorists,
such as American philosopher Alvin Goldman (b. 1938), argue that the justification condition in the account of
knowledge should be replaced with a more substantial and thorough condition that effectively explains what
justification is. Goldman argues that beliefs are justified if they are produced by reliable belief-forming
processes (Goldman 1979). Importantly, it is the process that confers justification, not one's ability to recount
that process. Goldman's account of knowledge is that a true belief is the result of a reliable belief-forming
process.

Goldman's theory is called historical reliabilism--historical because the view focuses on the past processes
that led to a belief, and reliabilism because, according to the theory, processes that reliably produce true
beliefs confer justification on those beliefs. Reliable belief-forming processes include perception, memory,
strong or valid reasoning, and introspection. These processes are functional operations whose outputs are
beliefs and other cognitive states. For example, reasoning is an operation that takes as input prior beliefs and
hypotheses and outputs new beliefs, and memory is a process that "takes as input beliefs or experiences at an
earlier time and generates as output beliefs at a later time" (Goldman 1979, 12). Usually, memory is reliable in
216 7 · Epistemology

       the sense that it is more likely to produce true beliefs than false ones.

       Because Goldman's approach is externalist, the justification-conferring process need not be cognitively
       accessible to the believer. His view has also been called causal because he focuses on the causes of belief. If a
       belief is caused in the right way (by a reliable belief-forming processes), then it is justified. One virtue of this
       approach is that it accounts for the intuition that someone could have a justified belief without being able to
       cite all the reasons for holding that belief. However, this view is not without fault. The original impetus behind
       revising Plato's traditional JTB analysis was to solve the Gettier problem, and Goldman's account cannot do
       this. Consider again Henry and the barn. Henry looks at a real barn and forms the belief that it is a barn.
       Henry's belief that he is looking at a barn is caused by a reliable belief-forming process (perception), so
       according to Goldman's account, Henry does have knowledge. Yet many philosophers think that Henry doesn't
       have knowledge given the lucky nature of his belief.

      Theories of Justification

       So far, we have looked at theories of justification as applied to individual beliefs. But beliefs are not always
       justified in isolation. Usually, the justification of one belief depends on the justification of other beliefs. I must
       be justified in trusting my perception to then be justified in believing that there is a bird outside of my office
       window. Thus, some theories focus on the structure of justification--that is, how a system or set of beliefs is
       structured. The theories on the structure of justification aim to illustrate how the structure of a system of
       beliefs leads to knowledge, or true beliefs.

       Foundationalism

       Much of what a subject justifiably believes is inferred from other justified beliefs. For example, Ella justifiably
       believes the Battle of Hastings occurred in 1066 because her history professor told her this. But the
       justification for her belief doesn't end there. Why is Ella justified in believing that her history professor is a
       good source? Furthermore, why is she even justified in believing that her history professor told her this? To the
       second question, Ella would reply that she is justified because she remembers her professor telling her. But
       then one can ask, Why is the reliance on memory justifiable? Justified beliefs rest on other justified beliefs.
       The question is whether the chain of justification ever ends. Foundationalists hold that justification must
       terminate at some point.

       Foundationalism is the view that all justified beliefs ultimately rest on a set of foundational, basic beliefs.
       Consider a house. Most of what people see of a house is the superstructure--the main floor, columns, and roof.
       But the house must rest on a foundation that stabilizes and props up the parts of the house people can see.
       According to foundationalists, most beliefs are like the superstructure of the house--the frame, roof, and walls.
       The majority of people's beliefs are inferential beliefs, or beliefs based on inference. And according to
       foundationalism, all beliefs rest on a foundation of basic beliefs (Hasan and Fumerton 2016). One of Ella's
       foundational beliefs could be that her memory is reliable. If this belief is justified, then all of Ella's justified
       beliefs derived from memory will rest on this foundational belief.

       But what justifies basic beliefs? If basic beliefs function so as to justify other beliefs, then they too must be
       justified. If the foundation is not justified, then none of the beliefs that rest on it are justified. According to
       foundationalism, the beliefs that make up the foundation are justified beliefs, but they are justified non-
       inferential beliefs. Foundational beliefs must be non-inferential (not based on inference) because if they were
       inferential, they would get their justification from another source, and they would no longer be foundational.
       Foundational beliefs are supposed to be where the justification stops.

       The strongest objection against foundationalism targets the nature of basic beliefs. What is a basic belief, and
       what are the reasons for thinking basic beliefs are justified? French philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650)
       was a foundationalist, and he held that people's basic beliefs are infallible (Descartes 1986). An infallible belief
       is one that cannot be mistaken. Clearly, if the foundation is made of beliefs that cannot be mistaken, then it is
       justified. But why think that foundational beliefs cannot be mistaken? Descartes thought that whatever a

                                                                                                                                                                   7.3 · Justification 217

subject can clearly and distinctly conceive of in their mind, they can take to be true because God would not
allow them to be fooled. As an illustration of how some beliefs might be infallible, recall that knowledge by
acquaintance is direct and unmediated knowledge. Acquaintance is unmediated by other ways of knowing,
including inference, so beliefs gained though acquaintance are non-inferential, which is what the
foundationalist wants. Beliefs gained via acquaintance are also justified, which is why Russell deems them
knowledge. As an example, imagine that you see a green orb in your field of vision. You may not know whether
the green orb is due to something in your environment, but you cannot be mistaken about the fact that you
visually experience the green orb. Hence, knowledge by acquaintance is a possible candidate for the
foundation of beliefs.
Coherence
Coherentism is the view that justification, and thus knowledge, is structured not like a house but instead like a
web. More precisely, coherentism argues that a belief is justified if it is embedded in a network of coherent,
mutually supported beliefs. Think of a web. Each strand in a web is not that strong by itself, but when the
strands are connected to multiple other strands and woven together, the result is a durable network. Similarly,
a subject's justification for individual beliefs, taken alone, is not that strong. But when those beliefs are situated
in a system of many mutually supporting beliefs, the justification grows stronger. Justification emerges from
the structure of a belief system (BonJour 1985).
Within foundationalism, the justifications for some beliefs can proceed in a completely linear fashion. Ella
believes the Battle of Hastings occurred in 1066 because her professor told her, and she believes that her
professor told her because she remembers it and thinks her memory is justifiable. One belief justifies another,
which justifies another, and so on, until the foundation is reached. Yet very few beliefs are actually structured
in this manner. People often look for support for their beliefs in multiple other beliefs while making sure that
they are also consistent. Figure 7.5 offers a simplified visual of the two different structures of belief.

FIGURE 7.5 There are two different ways of conceptualizing belief structures: as a web of interconnected beliefs
(left) and as a linear structure (right) in which foundational beliefs justify other beliefs, one after the other in a line.
(attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Often, when we think of the justification for our beliefs, we don't just consider the original source of a belief. We
also think about how that belief fits into our other beliefs. If a belief does not cohere with other beliefs, then its
justification appears weak, even if the initial justification for the belief seemed strong. Suppose you need to go
to the bank, and on your way out the door, your roommate tells you not to waste your time because they drove
by the bank earlier and it was closed. Your roommate's testimony seems like enough reason to believe the
bank is closed. However, it is a weekday, and the bank is always open during the week. Furthermore, it is not a
holiday. You check the bank's website, and it states that the bank is open. Hence, the belief that the bank is
closed does not cohere with your other beliefs. The lack of coherence with other beliefs weakens the
justification for believing what your otherwise reliable roommate tells you.
To be fair, foundationalists also consider coherence of beliefs in determining justification. However, as long as
218 7 · Epistemology

       a belief is consistent with other beliefs and rests on the foundation, it is justified. But consistency is not the
       same thing as logical support. The beliefs that there is a bird in that tree, it is November, and a person is
       hungry are all consistent with one another, but they do not support one another. And for coherentists, logical
       consistency alone does not make a system of belief justified. Justification arises from a system of beliefs that
       mutually reinforce one another. Support can happen in many ways: beliefs can deductively entail one another,
       they can inductively entail one another, and they can cohere by explaining one another. Suppose I am trying to
       remember where my friend Faruq is from. I believe he is from Tennessee but am not sure. But then I
       remember that Faruq often wears a University of Tennessee hat and has a Tennessee Titans sticker on this car.
       He also speaks with a slight southern twang and has told stories about hiking in the Smoky Mountains, which
       are partially in Tennessee. That Faruq is from Tennessee can explain these further beliefs. Note that I can get
       more assurance for my belief that Faruq is from Tennessee by considering my other beliefs about him. When
       beliefs mutually reinforce one another, they acquire more justification.
       Coherentism more naturally reflects the actual structure of belief systems, and it does so without relying on
       the notion of basic, justified, non-inferential beliefs. However, coherentism has weaknesses. One objection to
       coherentism is that it can result in circularity. Within a system of beliefs, any belief can play a roundabout role
       in its own justification. Figure 7.6 illustrates this problem.

       FIGURE 7.6 The circularly problem: Belief A entails belief B, and belief B entails belief C. Belief C entails belief D,
       and belief D entails belief A. The beliefs are coherent, and all support one another. However, each plays a role in its
       own justification. D justifies A, but A justifies D through B and C. Circularity results in the beliefs not having any
       support at all. If D essentially justifies itself, then it has no justification. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,
       OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
       Another objection to coherentism is called the isolation objection. A network of beliefs can mutually explain
       and support one another, thus giving them justification. However, it is not guaranteed that these beliefs are
       connected to reality. Imagine a person, Dinah, who is trapped in a highly detailed virtual reality. Dinah has
       been trapped for so long that she believes her experiences are of the real world. Because of the detailed nature
       of Dinah's virtual reality, most of her beliefs are consistent with and support one another, just as your beliefs
       about the real world do. As long as Dinah's beliefs are consistent and coherent, she will be justified in believing
       that her experience is of real objects and real people. So Dinah has justification even though all her beliefs
       concerning the reality of her world are false. Dinah's situation reveals an important feature of justification:
       while justification makes beliefs more likely to be true, it does not always guarantee that they are true.
       Justification is often fallible.

      The Fallible Nature of Justification

       The sources of beliefs are varied. Perception, reason, hope, faith, and wishful thinking can all result in belief.
       Yet just because something results in belief, that does not mean that the belief is justified. Beliefs that result
       from wishful thinking are not justified because wishful thinking does not make a belief more likely to be true.
       A source of justification is a reliable basis for belief. Yet while justification is a reliable source, notice that this
       does not mean that the belief is true; it just makes it more likely. Justified beliefs can turn out to be false. In
       order to drive this point home, we will briefly look at four different sources of belief. As you will see, each

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                   7.3 · Justification 219

source is fallible.

One source of belief is memory. Memory is not always reliable. First of all, that you do not remember
something in your past does not mean that it did not happen. Second, when you do remember something, does
that guarantee that it happened the way you remember it? Because people can misremember, philosophers
distinguish between remembering and seeming to remember. When you actually remember P, then this
justifies believing P. When you seem to remember P, this does not justify believing P. The problem is that
remembering and seeming to remember often feel the same to the person trying to remember.

Most beliefs are the product of inference. When you use reason to come to belief, the justification you have is
inferential; hence, inferential justification is equivalent to logical justification. But as discussed in the chapter
on logic, not all forms of inference can guarantee truth. Inductive reasoning, which is the most common source
of beliefs, is only probable even when done well. Furthermore, people often make mistakes in reasoning. Just
because someone reasoned their way to a belief doesn't mean they reasoned well. But assume for a moment
that a person comes to a belief using deductive reasoning, which can guarantee truth, and they reason well. Is
it still possible that their belief is false? Yes. Deductive reasoning takes as its input other beliefs to then derive
conclusions. In good inductive reasoning, if the premises are true (the input beliefs), then the conclusion is
true. If the input beliefs are false, then even good deductive reasoning cannot guarantee true beliefs.

Another source of belief is testimony. When you gain beliefs based on the stated beliefs of others, you rely on
testimony. Testimony is usually considered something that happens only in a court of law, but in philosophy,
the term testimony is used much more broadly. Testimony is any utterance, spoken or written, occurring in
normal communication conditions. Instances of testimony include news magazines, nonfiction books,
personal blogs, professors' lectures, and opinions volunteered in casual conversation. Often, testimony is a
reliable source of information and so can be justified. When you form beliefs based on the testimony of
experts, it is justified. But even when justified, those beliefs could be false because experts are vulnerable to all
of the weaknesses of justification covered in this section. More will be said about testimony in the section on
social epistemology.

Last, perception can be used as a source of justification. Perception includes the information received from the
senses (smell, taste, touch, sight, hearing). People often automatically form beliefs based on perception.
However, not all beliefs that follow from perception are guaranteed to be true, as the possibility of knowledge
by acquaintance shows. As discussed earlier, Russell maintained that the only automatically justified beliefs
gained from perception are about the existence of sense data (Russell 1948). When looking at the bird outside
of my office window, I only have knowledge by acquaintance of the experience of seeing the bird on a branch in
my visual field. I know that it seems to me that there's a bird. But how do I get from those sense data to the
justified belief that there really is bird on the branch? I must rely on another belief about the reliability of my
perception--a belief that I can only get by inference, specifically induction. I reason from past instances where
I believe my perception is reliable to the general belief that it is reliable. And of course, induction is fallible.
Whenever one moves from knowledge by acquaintance to further beliefs--such as the belief that sense data is
caused by actually existing objects--there is room for error.

Not all philosophers agree that all perceptual beliefs are mediated through sense data (Crane and French
2021). The view called direct realism states that people have direct access to objects in the external world via
perception. While direct realism holds that one can directly perceive the external world, it still cannot
guarantee that beliefs about it are true, for both hallucinations and illusions are still possible. Figure 7.7 is an
example of an illusion.

       If you focus only on the top two lines, it appears as though they are of different lengths. Yet the bottom two lines
       indicate that this appearance is illusory--the lines are actually of equal length. Illusions function as evidence
       that perception sometimes misrepresents reality. Even direct realists have to contend with the possibility that
       beliefs gained through sense perception could be wrong. Hence, sources of beliefs, even when they are usually
       justified, are nevertheless fallible. The possibility that the subject could be wrong is what gives rise to
       philosophical skepticism--the view that knowledge in some or all domains is impossible.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define skepticism as it is used in philosophy.
         · Compare and contrast global and local skepticism.
         · Offer and explain a skeptical hypothesis.
         · Outline the general structure of argument for global skepticism.
       Philosophical skepticism is the view that some or all knowledge is impossible. A skeptic questions the
       possibility of knowledge--particularly justification--in some domain. A global skeptic rejects the possibility of
       knowledge in general. But one need not reject the possibility of all knowledge. A local skeptic questions the
       possibility of knowledge only in particular areas of study. One can be a local skeptic about moral knowledge or
       scientific knowledge. This section will first look at global skepticism and the arguments offered in support of it
       and then will briefly look at local skepticism.

      Global Skepticism

       Global skepticism is a view that questions the possibility of all knowledge. To make their case, global skeptics
       point to the lack of the possibility of certainty in our beliefs. Because we cannot know that our beliefs are true,
       we cannot know in general. Usually, global skepticism attempts to undermine the possibility of forming
       justified beliefs. Global skeptics target all beliefs, or all beliefs about the external world (which amounts to

most beliefs). Most beliefs tacitly or explicitly assume the existence of an external world. When I have the
experience of seeing a bird in a tree and think, "There is a bird in that tree," I assume that there is an actually
existing physical bird in an actually existing physical tree in an actually existing real world outside of me.
There is means "there exists." I believe the bird, tree, and world all exist independently of my thoughts. The
global skeptic questions beliefs such as these.
The Dream Argument
How many times have you realized that you were dreaming while you were dreaming? Most people believe that
whatever they are dreaming is real during the dream. Indeed, the fact that people think dreams are real while
dreaming is what makes nightmares so terrible. If you knew the content of a nightmare was a dream, then it
would not be nearly as scary. Zhuang Zhou (c. 369-286 BCE) was a Chinese Taoist philosopher who argued that
for all we know, we could currently be dreaming while thinking we are awake. Imagine dreaming that you are a
butterfly, happily flitting about on flowers. When you wake, how can you determine whether you have just
woken from dreaming you are a butterfly or you are a butterfly who has just started dreaming that you are
human? Zhuang Zhou explains:

      While he is dreaming he does not know it is a dream, and in his dream he may even try to interpret a
      dream. Only after he wakes does he know it was a dream. And someday there will be a great
      awakening when we know that this is all a great dream. Yet the stupid believe they are awake, busily
      and brightly assuming they understand things, calling this man ruler, that one herdsman--how dense!
      Confucius and you are both dreaming! And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too.
      (Zhuangzi 2003, 43)
Zhaung Zhou puts forward the possibility that all of what we take to be conscious experience is actually a
dream. And if we are dreaming, then all our beliefs about the external world are false because those beliefs
take for granted that our current experience is real.

FIGURE 7.8 Is this a picture of a man dreaming of a butterfly, or is it a picture of a butterfly dreaming of a man? The
Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou asks us to consider the possibility that everything we consider waking experience
might actually be a dream. (credit: "Zhuangzi-Butterfly-Dream" by Ike no Taiga/Wikipedia, Public Domain)
The Evil Demon Argument
Nearly two millennia after Zhuang Zhou, René Descartes also proposed a dream hypothesis. Descartes argued
that because dreams often incorporate experiences we have in real life, it is impossible to distinguish between
dreaming and waking life (Descartes 2008). But Descartes eventually concludes that even if he could be
222 7 · Epistemology

       dreaming, there are still some beliefs he can know, specifically arithmetic. Even in dreams, 1 + 1 = 2, and a
       square will always have four sides. And so, Descartes devises an even stronger skeptical hypothesis: what if we
       are being tricked by an evil demon?
       Descartes's evil demon is powerful. It can make you believe things, and it can trick you by controlling your
       experience. The evil demon can make you believe you are currently eating a sandwich by directly feeding you
       the sensory experience of eating a sandwich (the sight, the smells, the taste, the feel). Under this scenario, you
       cannot tell the difference between actually eating a sandwich and merely believing you are eating one because
       the evil demon is tricking you. If we cannot reliably tell the difference between experiences caused by reality
       and experiences caused by an evil demon, then we cannot know anything. We can represent Descartes's
       argument as follows:
        1. If I cannot rule out the possibility that an evil demon is tricking me, then I do not have any knowledge of

             the external world.
        2. I cannot rule out the possibility that an evil demon is tricking me.
        3. Therefore, I do not have knowledge of the external world.
       Why does Descartes claim we can't have knowledge if we cannot rule out the evil demon hypothesis? If an evil
       demon is tricking us, then all our beliefs are wrong. And if we cannot rule out the possibility that we are wrong,
       then we are not justified. And if we are not justified in our beliefs, then we cannot have knowledge of them.
       Putnam's Brain in a Vat
       If you don't like evil demons, then consider a more modern version of a skeptical hypothesis: the "brain in a
       vat" conceived of by American philosopher and mathematician Hilary Putnam (1926-2016). Imagine that
       while you were asleep last night, a group of scientists kidnapped you and took you to their lab. There, they
       surgically removed your brain and placed it in a vat of nutrients. The scientists then hooked up your brain to a
       sophisticated new computer system. They were able to download your memories so as to create new
       experiences. The result is a seamless experience of consciousness between yesterday and today. When you
       woke this morning, your life seemed to proceed without disruption. Can you prove that you are not a brain in a
       vat? No, you cannot. The scenario stipulates that your experience will seem exactly the same whether you are a
       brain in a vat or not. Other, similar skeptical scenarios are easy to come up with. Consider the possibility that
       you are caught in a virtual reality world or that you are trapped in the Matrix.

deliberate manipulation of our mental processes. (credit: "Brain in a Vat" by Was a bee/Wikimedia, Public Domain)
General Structure of Global Skeptical Arguments
Skeptical hypotheses and the arguments that they inspire all have a similar structure:
1. If I cannot rule out the possibility of SH, then I cannot be justified in believing that P.
2. I cannot rule out the possibility of SH.
3. Therefore, I cannot be justified in believing that P.
SH is a skeptical hypothesis. P is any proposition about the external world. Premise 1 is the skeptic's
challenge--that you must rule out skeptical hypotheses. Premise 2 relies on limitations within your
perspective. The skeptic claims that you can rule out the possibility of whatever skeptical hypothesis is at hand
only if you are able to construct an argument that defeats that hypothesis using the evidence you have (and a
priori knowledge). As demonstrated, this is difficult to do. The nature of the skeptical hypotheses used for
global skepticism limits your evidence to the contents of your thoughts. What you take to be evidence of the
external world (that you perceive things that seem to be separate from yourself) is effectively neutralized by
the possibility of a skeptical hypothesis.

Responses to Global Skepticism

The philosopher who wishes to overcome philosophical skepticism must find reasonable grounds for rejecting
the skeptic's argument. The different skeptical arguments reveal a specific conception of the level of
justification required for knowledge. Skeptical arguments rely on the existence of doubt. Doubt exists when we
cannot rule out a possibility. If we have doubt, we are not certain. We cannot be certain that we are not, say, a
brain in a vat. And if we cannot be certain, then we cannot know anything that implies we are not a brain in a
vat. Certainty is a very strict measure of justification. One clear possible response is to simply deny that one
needs certainty in order to be considered justified. This section looks at some of the classical responses to the
skeptic's argument that we cannot know anything.
Moore
British philosopher G. E. Moore (1873-1958) presented an argument against skepticism that relies on
common sense. In his famous paper "Proof of an External World," Moore begins by raising his right hand and
224 7 · Epistemology

       claiming, "Here is one hand," then raising his left hand and claiming, "Here is another hand" (Moore 1939).
       Therefore, he concludes that skepticism is false. At first glance, this argument may seem flippant. It is not.
       Moore means to replace the second premise in the skeptical argument with his own premise: I know I have
       hands. The skeptical argument starts with the premise that if you cannot rule out a skeptical hypothesis, then
       you do not have knowledge of some proposition pertaining to the external world. Moore uses "I have two
       hands" as his proposition about the external world. In effect, he accepts the skeptic's first premise, then uses
       his commonsense belief in the truth of "I have two hands" to defeat the skeptical hypothesis. Here is the
       argument's structure:

        1. If I cannot rule out the possibility of SH, then I cannot be justified in believing that P.
        2. I am justified in believing that P.
        3. Therefore, I can rule out the possibility of SH.

       In claiming that he has two hands, Moore claims that he is justified in believing propositions about the external
       world. And if he is justified, then he can rule out the skeptical hypothesis. The skeptic's argument takes the
       form of what is called modus ponens, meaning a valid inference where the antecedent of a conditional is
       affirmed. Moore's argument takes the form of what is known as modus tollens, meaning a valid inference
       where the consequence of a conditional is denied.

       But notice that the two arguments contradict each other. If we accept the first premise, then either Moore's or
       the skeptic's second premise must be false. So why did Moore think his second premise is better? The choice is
       between thinking you are justified in believing that you have two hands and thinking you are justified in
       believing the skeptical hypothesis might be true. Moore thinks he has better reason to believe that he has two
       hands than he does for believing the skeptical hypothesis is true. For Moore, it is just common sense. You have
       reason to believe that you have two hands--you can see them and feel them--while you have no reason to
       believe the skeptical hypothesis is true.

       Many philosophers remain unconvinced by Moore's argument. Any person who accepts the possibility of the
       skeptical hypothesis will disagree with his premise 2. The possibility of the skeptical hypothesis effectively
       undermines justification in the belief that you have two hands.

       Contextualism

       As we just saw, some theorists reject the notion that you must be certain of a belief--that is, rule out all possible
       defeaters--in order to have knowledge. Moore thinks he has more justification to believe he has two hands than
       he does that there's an evil demon tricking him. And in determining whether I am justified in believing in the
       bird outside my office window, I rarely consider the possibility that I could be a brain in a vat. I'm more likely to
       focus on my poor vision as a defeater. In the context of bird identification, wild skeptical hypotheses seem out
       of place. Indeed, we often adjust how much justification we think is needed for a belief to the task at hand.
       Contextualism is the view that the truth of knowledge attributions depends on the context. Contextualism is a
       theory about knowledge and justification. When we attribute knowledge to a subject S, the truth of the
       knowledge claim depends on the context that S is in. The context of S determines the level of justification
       needed for a true belief to count as knowledge. Contextualism comes from the observation that the level of
       confidence needed for justification changes depending on what the belief is as well as its the purpose and its
       importance, among other things. We expect a high degree of justification from physicians when they diagnose
       disease but less justification from friends recalling the title of a movie because there's much more at stake in
       medical diagnoses.

       Contextualism deals with skepticism in a unique way. Rarely are we in situations where we must rule out
       skeptical hypotheses to consider ourselves justified. Indeed, it is generally only when a skeptical hypothesis
       has been explicitly raised that we think we need to rule it out to be justified. And in our daily lives, the skeptical
       hypothesis just does not seem relevant. Yes, the possibility that we are brains in a vat technically still exists; we
       just do not think of it.

Skepticism in Specific Domains

As explained above, local skepticism questions the possibility of knowledge only in particular areas of study.
People can accept that knowledge of the external world is possible while also questioning whether knowledge
is achievable in more specific domains. A common form of local skepticism focuses on religious belief,
specifically knowledge of the existence of God. Another form of local skepticism concerns the ability to ever
have moral knowledge. Skepticism in these domains does not entail that there is no God or that all moral
claims are false. Rather, skepticism means that we can never be sufficiently justified in believing that there is a
God or that moral claims are true. We simply can never know either way whether, for example, God exists.

Skepticism about morality arises due to the nature of its subject. Moral claims are normative, which means
that they assert claims about what ought to be the case rather than what is the case. But moral claims are
difficult to prove, given their normative nature. How can you prove what ought to be the case? Usually, moral
claims are grounded in value claims. An ethicist may say that we ought to help a stranger because well-being is
morally valuable. But the skeptic will point out that we cannot prove that something is valuable. We do not have
sensors that can confirm moral value. Moral claims instead rest on arguments. The problem, as Scottish
Enlightenment philosopher David Hume (1711-1776) explained, is that no amount of description can ever
help us logically derive a normative claim (Hume 1985). This leaves room for doubt, and therefore skepticism.

Skeptical positions about God also focus on the lack of sufficient evidence. A skeptic can reasonably ask, What
sorts of evidence would show the existence of God? Certainly, if God unambiguously appeared right now to
everyone in the world simultaneously, then we would have reliable evidence. But God has not done so. The
most we have is testimony in the form of religious texts. And testimony, particularly a chain of testimony
stretching back hundreds and hundreds of years, is not necessarily reliable. Why believe, for example, the
Christian Bible? Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), himself a devote Catholic, argued that the very nature of
God--having no limits and existing beyond time--precludes the possibility of ever comprehending the full true
nature of God or God's existence. He states, "Who then can blame the Christians for not being able to give
reasons for their belief, professing as they do a religion which they cannot explain by reason. . . . It is in lacking
proofs that they do not lack sense" (Pascal 1973, 93). Pascal contends that not attempting to give proof of God
is the sensible thing to do. A person can simply rely on faith, which is belief based on insufficient evidence.

         THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

In your view, what is the relationship between reason and faith? Some theologians say that reason can establish the
existence of a supreme being. Others think that reason can only partially justify religious belief and that full belief
requires faith, or belief without reason. Reason for some is antithetical to faith, which requires blind obedience. For
example, in the biblical story of the sacrifice of Isaac, Abraham is willing to sacrifice his only son to God as an act of
faith. How do you think we should understand the role of reason in religious belief?

7.5 Applied Epistemology

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define applied epistemology.
  · Describe the social aspect of knowledge and justification.
  · Describe standpoint epistemology.
  · Identify examples of epistemic injustice.

Applied epistemology, like other areas of applied philosophy, takes the tools of philosophy and applies them to
areas of practical concern. Specifically, it applies philosophical methods and theories particular to
epistemology to current social issues and practices. Applied epistemology often approaches epistemological
questions on a collective or systems level. When looking at systems, applied epistemology investigates whether
226 7 · Epistemology

       the systems of investigation (like those in the sciences) are structured in the best way to lead to true beliefs.
       When applied to collectives, applied epistemology examines whether and how groups of people conduct
       deliberation that leads to reliably true and justified beliefs. The groups focused on can range from small
       groups, such as a jury, to large collectives, such as a democracy.

       FIGURE 7.10 We often attribute beliefs to the Supreme Court, even though it is a collection of people that has
       changed over time. In this photo, former president Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump stand with members
       of the US Supreme Court in 2018. (credit: "President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at the Supreme
       Court of the United States" by Trump White House Archived/Flickr, Public Domain)

      Social Epistemology

       The traditional epistemology that most of this chapter has covered is singularly focused on individuals.
       Theories are focused on what a person can know or when a subject is justified. For the most part, gaining
       knowledge is often treated as an individual effort. Social epistemology instead investigates how groups pursue
       knowledge and justification and how an individual can best seek justification and knowledge in a social world.
       Social epistemology takes seriously the fact that humans are, by and large, social animals that rely on others
       for belief formation. Because humans are social creatures, we rely on others for much of what we come to
       know. Our dependence on others for true beliefs eases knowledge acquisition, but it also complicates the task
       due to concerns regarding the reliability of others.
       How much of your knowledge was gained strictly from independent investigation conducted only by yourself?
       Very little, most likely. We rely on other humans from the past and present for a very large proportion of our
       knowledge. Scientific endeavors consist of amending and adding to the work of others over the course of
       centuries. The propositional knowledge learned in school is gained through layers upon layers of individuals
       trusting the testimony of others--students trusting the testimony of teachers, teachers trusting the testimony
       of books, the writers of the books trusting the testimony of sources, and so on. The news we view, the books we
       read, the conversations we overhear--all of these are social means of gaining knowledge.
       Testimony
       Social means of gaining knowledge are called testimony. Any time you believe something because you read it
       or heard it somewhere, you believe based on testimony. Of course, people are not always reliable. People
       sometimes use poor reasoning, misremember, or even lie. Hence, testimony is also sometimes unreliable. And
       this raises the question, When is testimony justified?
       Testimony is clearly of importance to social epistemology. In determining whether to believe what others tell
       us, we ask whether they are trustworthy. A trustworthy source of testimony is honest, unbiased, rational, well-
       informed, and clearheaded. We further look for an expert or authority. An expert or authority is a person

whose experience, education, and knowledge in an area make them more reliable. Questions surrounding
testimony are questions about justification. When are we justified in believing others? Who are we justified in
believing in particular situations? When and how does testimony give us justification for a belief? And what do
we do when the testimony of others conflicts with our already held beliefs?

public reading rooms in the New York Public Library. (credit: "New York Public Library" by soomness/Flickr, CC BY
2.0)
Peer Disagreement
When the testimony of another contradicts your own belief, what should you do? In cases where the other
person is an expert and you are not, then the testimony ought to weaken your confidence in your belief. You
should either change your belief or withhold from believing either way until you can get further justification.
But what should you do when the person is not an expert but an epistemic peer? An epistemic peer is a person
who is in an equal epistemic position relative to some domain--that is, they have the same cognitive ability,
evidence, and background knowledge in that domain. A person can be an epistemic peer with respect to one
domain but not another. You may know that you are on level epistemic ground with regard to the subject of
baseball with your best friend but that they are an authority compared to you on the subject of baking.
Social epistemologists theorize about how peer disagreement ought to function in justification and belief.
Some theorists argue that you should always modify your conviction in some way in the face of peer
disagreement, though they disagree about exactly how you ought to modify your view. Others maintain that
peer disagreement does not always give you reason to think you are mistaken (Frances and Matheson 2018).

         THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

When assessing the testimony of a person you believe is an epistemic peer, ask yourself the following questions:
1. Does the person supplying the testimony have a history of lying?
2. Is this person known to have biases that might distort their perceptions?
3. Does this person have a good track record?
4. Does this person's testimony conflict with testimony from others?
5. What are this person's motives?
When assessing the testimony of a purported authority on some subject, ask yourself the following questions:
1. Is this a question on which there is expertise?
228 7 · Epistemology

        2. Is the person supplying the testimony an expert in the relevant field?
        3. Is there a consensus among experts in the relevant field on the question at hand?
        4. Does this person's testimony reflect agreement with the consensus of experts?
        5. Is there reason to think this person is biased?

       Group Justification

       So far, we have looked at how social factors influence an individual's justification and beliefs. Social
       epistemology also investigates whether it is possible for groups to have beliefs. We often attribute beliefs to
       groups of people. We say things like "The United States believes in freedom," "The Supreme Court holds that a
       right to privacy exists," "Scientists believe in climate change," and "The jury knew he was guilty." When can it
       rightfully be said that a group believes something? One answer is that a group believes P only in cases in which
       all or almost all members of the group believe P. However, we do attribute beliefs to groups while not always
       assuming that every member holds the belief. The Supreme Court example above illustrates that not every
       member of a group must believe something for us to say that the group does. When the court decides an issue
       with a 6-3 vote, we still attribute belief to the court as a whole.

       Another view is a commitment view. Group belief does not require that all members believe; rather, members
       of the group are jointly committed to a belief as a body merely by virtue of being members of that group
       (Goldman and O'Connor 2019). Group commitment to a belief creates a normative constraint on members of a
       group to emulate the belief. Commitment views may work for any group formed around allegiance to specific
       ideas. Take religious groups, for example, which coalesce around beliefs pertaining to God and religious
       dogma.

       If groups are capable of beliefs, then clearly the question of justification of group belief is relevant. Note that
       some of the previous theories on epistemic justification are applicable to questions of group justification.
       Goldman focused on reliable processes. Social epistemology also focuses on the reliability of processes used in
       juries, democracies, and the sciences.

      Standpoint Epistemology

       Social epistemology accounts for the social nature of knowledge and justification. The quality and extent of an
       individual's knowledge depends heavily on the people that individual deems trustworthy. The same is the case
       for group or public knowledge (knowledge generally accepted as true by a collective). Individuals and
       perspectives granted expert status have more influence on what is accepted, but this means that many
       individuals and perspectives will be ignored. Furthermore, it is often types or groups of people who are
       excluded, which becomes problematic if the perspectives of those groups are valuable to the task of knowledge
       creation. Standpoint epistemology takes this worry seriously. Standpoint epistemology studies the
       relationship between an individual's social status and that individual's epistemic position. Of particular
       importance to the theory is the notion that the relative power of individuals and groups influences who we
       consider to be reliable sources, causing us to ignore the perspectives of less powerful groups. Furthermore,
       standpoint theory argues that the exclusion of entire groups harms the entire enterprise of gaining knowledge.

       Take as an example the president of a large factory who wants to increase efficiency and cut down on waste.
       The president convenes all the department heads and managers to identify areas of inefficiency and waste;
       essentially, they want the perspectives of those individuals with more power within the factory. But if the
       president doesn't elicit the opinion of any of the workers in the warehouse or on the factory floor, they miss out
       on potentially valuable perspectives. A manager may think they can adequately identify problems in the way
       that the manual work is done. But given the position of a factory worker--situated day after day on the factory
       floor--the factory worker has a unique perspective. Standpoint theorists hold that perspectives such as that of
       the factory floor worker are uniquely valuable and cannot be emulated by those not in that position.

       Standpoint epistemology is applied to many areas of study. In the social sciences, where the goal is to describe

social structures, behaviors, and relationships, standpoint theorists advocate for focusing on the perspectives
of traditionally marginalized groups. If the general goal is to study how people do things, then it does not do
any good to ignore the experiences of entire classes of people. And when the goal is to discover facts about
power dynamics within social institutions, focusing only on privileged perspectives is woefully inadequate. If
anthropologists in the 1950s wanted to understand racism and the unequal power structure in the American
South, interviewing Black citizens would generate more insightful evidence than interviews with White
citizens. Black Americans were in a better epistemic position compared to their White counterparts to
describe the power structure. Similarly, women are in a better position to explain sexism within a workplace
than their male counterparts. People who use wheelchairs are in a much better position to design a truly
accessible bathroom. Examples such as these abound.

Standpoint epistemology also critiques the traditional hard sciences and medical research. Hard sciences,
such as biology, chemistry, and physiology, are those that rely on controlled experiments, quantifiable data,
and mathematical modeling. Hard sciences are generally noted for being exact, rigorous, and objective.
Standpoint theorists question this objectivity and reveal how biases and perspectives of researchers can
influence these supposedly objective fields. A clear example of this is early research on heart disease. Because
medical researchers, who were mostly male, focused their studies on men, heart disease was considered a
men's disease. The symptoms of a heart attack that doctors and patients were warned to look out for did not
include many symptoms that women experience when having a heart attack (Kourany 2009). Men most often
experience chest pain, while women are more likely to experience symptoms such as jaw pain and nausea
(American Heart Association n.d.). As a result, many women did not seek medical attention when experiencing
heart problems, and doctors failed to properly diagnose them when they did seek medical treatment.
Standpoint theory reveals not only that varied standpoints are valuable but also that specific standpoints often
include implicit or explicit bias--not including women or people of color in data sets, only including particular
variables in modeling, and so on.

Epistemic Injustice

If standpoint epistemology is correct in concluding that valuable perspectives are often excluded from social
and scientific discourse, then this is an instance of epistemic injustice. Epistemic injustice is injustice related
to epistemology. Epistemic injustices include the exclusion and silencing of perspectives, systematic
misrepresentation of group or individual views, unfair conferring of expert status, and unjustified distrust of
certain perspectives. British philosopher Miranda Fricker (b. 1966), who coined the term epistemic injustice,
divides epistemic injustice into two categories: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice (Fricker
2007). Testimonial injustice occurs when the opinions of individuals or groups are unfairly ignored or treated
as untrustworthy. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when a society's language and concepts cannot adequately
capture the experience of people living within that society, which thereby limits understanding of their
experiences.

Testimonial Injustice

Silencing and distrust of someone's word often occurs by virtue of that individual's membership in a
marginalized group. Women, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income individuals, and religious
minorities are all examples of marginalized groups. Take as an example a criminal trial. If the jury takes the
testimony of a witness less seriously because of their perceived class status or membership in a particular
group, this is an example of epistemic injustice, specifically testimonial injustice. Philosophers who focus on
testimonial injustice utilize research to show how the voices of individuals and groups are unfairly ignored and
discounted compared to others. For example, many studies over the past few decades have illustrated that
reports of pain by Black patients are taken less seriously by medical professionals than similar pain reports by
White patients. An outcome of this is that Black patients are given less pain medicine and pain management
than White patients, even in cases where the patients had the same injury or surgery (Smedley, Stith, and
Nelson 2003; Cintron and Morrison 2006). This is clearly a case of testimonial injustice: Black patients receive
230 7 · Epistemology

       less care because their testimony (reporting pain) is not taken as seriously as the testimony of their White
       counterparts.
       But testimonial injustice also occurs when someone's opinions are systematically misrepresented. To
       misrepresent a view is to interpret that view in a way that does not align with the original intended meaning.
       As an example, consider the Black Lives Matter movement and a popular response to it. Black Lives Matter was
       formed in response to police brutality and racially motivated violence against Black people. The idea was to
       affirm the value of Black lives. However, a popular response to the movement was the phrase "All lives matter."
       This response implies that the message of Black Lives Matter is really that only Black lives matter, which is an
       unfair and inaccurate representation of the view.

       FIGURE 7.12 Interpreting the phrase "Black lives matter" to mean "only Black lives matter" is an instance of
       testimonial injustice. (credit: "Black Lives Matter" by Taymaz Valley/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
       Hermeneutical Injustice
       Hermeneutical injustice occurs when language and concepts cannot adequately capture an individual's
       experience, resulting in a lack of understanding of that individual's experience by both the individual and
       those around them. The classic example of hermeneutical injustice focuses on sexual harassment. Before the
       concept and phrase sexual harassment was introduced and understood by society, women had a difficult time
       describing certain experiences in the workplace. Women experienced unwanted attention and focus,
       exclusion, comments concerning their bodies and looks, and different treatment based on negative
       assumptions about their gender. Many women were fired for not going along with such treatment. But there
       was no word for their experience, so many women could not understand or explain their discomfort.
       Furthermore, accounts of their distressing experience ran the risk of not being taken seriously by others. The
       phrase sexual harassment was coined to fill a gap in the concepts used to explain and describe experience.
       Perhaps you have had the experience of being introduced to a word or concept that suddenly illuminated a part
       of your experience in a way that greatly increased your understanding of yourself and your ability to explain
       yourself to others.

Summary

7.1 What Epistemology Studies

Epistemology is the study of knowledge and its associated concepts, such as truth and justification. The
discipline of epistemology uses many tools, including conceptual analysis, argumentation, and research.
Traditional epistemology focuses on propositional knowledge, which is knowledge of facts or statements.
There are other types of knowledge, including procedural knowledge and knowledge by acquaintance. Because
knowledge and justification are treated as valuable and epistemology studies these concepts, epistemology is
both descriptive and a normative discipline.

7.2 Knowledge

The traditional understanding of knowledge, which comes from Plato, is that it consists of justified true belief.
Plato's account was generally accepted until the 1960s, when philosopher Edmund Gettier offered
counterexamples, known as Gettier cases. Gettier cases reveal that justified true belief is not sufficient for
knowledge, a problemed called the Gettier problem. Many theorists attempt to solve the Gettier problem by
strengthening Plato's account. Fixes include adding another condition to the definition and clarifying what
justification is.

7.3 Justification

Justification for a belief makes the belief more likely to be true. How justification works and the nature of
justification are important to the study of epistemology. Internalism is the view that justification is entirely
dependent on factors internal to the mind of the knower. Externalism is the view that at least some elements
that determine justification are external to the mind of the knower. Attempts to solve the Gettier problem have
come in both internal and external forms. Theorists also study justification as it exists in the structure of entire
belief systems. Foundationalists believe that all beliefs rest on a foundation of basic beliefs, while coherentists
hold that beliefs exist in a web of mutually supporting and consistent beliefs. Justification has many sources,
but all of them are fallible, which means that even justified beliefs can be false.

7.4 Skepticism

Skepticism is the view that all or some of our knowledge is impossible. A global skeptic rejects the possibility of
all knowledge and often focuses on the possibility of justification for beliefs of the external world. Global
skeptics usually put forth a skeptical hypothesis--a way that the world could be that would entail that all our
beliefs are false--and show that we cannot rule out the hypothesis. Skeptical hypotheses include the possibility
that we are dreaming, that a powerful demon is tricking us, and that we are brains in vats or trapped in virtual
reality. All skeptical arguments take advantage of the fact that we cannot rule out skeptical hypotheses on the
evidence we have. Those who argue against skepticism claim we do not need the level of justification that
skeptics claim we do.

7.5 Applied Epistemology

Applied epistemology uses the concepts, methods, and theories particular to epistemology and applies them to
current social issues and practices. An important area of applied epistemology is social epistemology, which
focuses on the social facets of knowledge and justification and how groups form beliefs. Testimony refers to
how we gain knowledge from and share knowledge with others. Social epistemology studies how to evaluate
our beliefs when they conflict with the testimony of others. Social epistemology also illuminates how injustice
can arise in epistemological endeavors in a social world. Testimonial injustice occurs when the opinions of
individuals are systematically discounted or ignored unfairly. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when a society's
language and concepts cannot adequately capture the experience of all its members.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

8.1 The Fact-Value Distinction
8.2 Basic Questions about Values
8.3 Metaethics
8.4 Well-Being
8.5 Aesthetics

INTRODUCTION Chances are you have found yourself in a debate with someone about a matter involving
judgments about what is good or bad. Maybe your disagreement was about a contemporary moral issue like
abortion or the death penalty. Maybe the conflict had to do with a course of action, like going to college or
joining the military, and whether it was the right thing to do. Maybe you got into a disagreement about whether
a work of art was beautiful or a movie was good or bad. These types of conversations deal with values, and
there is a specific area of philosophy that helps people think about these types of debates: value theory.
Value theory is the philosophical investigation of values. In its narrow sense, it refers to ethical concerns. In its
238 8 · Value Theory

       broader sense, it addresses ethical, social, political, religious, aesthetic, and other types of values. Philosophers
       use value theory to approach questions that require people to think about what they value in life as individuals
       and as communities, especially in terms of morality, happiness, goodness, and beauty. Value theory provides
       tools that you can use to navigate difficult debates about what you value and why. This chapter will help you
       understand what a value is and how it differs from facts, the types of questions and distinctions that help
       people discuss values and their relations, and specific areas of value theory like metaethics and aesthetics.

     8.1 The Fact-Value Distinction

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Articulate the fact-value distinction.
         · Distinguish between descriptive and evaluative claims.
         · Explain the is-ought problem
         · Describe the naturalistic fallacy
         · Evaluate objections to the fact-value distinction.

       Values are woven into how you live and relate to others. The ideals that guide your life decisions, the morals
       that shape how you treat others, and even the choices that define your personal aesthetic all express your
       values. Values signify judgments about the way people ought to think, feel, or act based on what is good,
       worthwhile, or important. For example, you might think you ought to read Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man
       because it is considered a great American novel or because you believe that reading about anti-Black racism in
       the United States is important for forming a more just worldview. Here, your reasoning for a course of
       action--reading Invisible Man--is based on value judgments about the novel's greatness and the importance of
       understanding racial injustice.

       Values describe how people think things should be, not necessarily how they are. Philosophers describe this
       difference as the is-ought distinction or, more commonly, the fact-value distinction. The fact-value distinction
       distinguishes between what is the case (facts) and what people think ought to be the case (values) based on
       beliefs about what is good, beautiful, important, etc.

       The line between facts and values is not always clear. It can be easy to mistake a value for a fact, especially
       when a person feels strongly about something and believes it is truly good or bad beyond any doubt. For
       example, the statement "killing an innocent person is bad" may seem like a fact, but it is not a description of
       how things are. This statement describes the way people think things should be, not the way the world is. For
       this reason, the fact-value distinction is an important place to begin. This section will give an overview of the
       fact-value distinction by examining the types of claims you can make about facts and values and how facts and
       values are related to or distinct from each other.

      Descriptive vs. Evaluative Claims

       One way to think about the difference between facts and values is through the different types of claims you can
       make about them. People talk about facts using descriptive claims and values using evaluative claims.
       Descriptive claims are statements about matters of fact, whereas evaluative claims express a judgment about
       something's value.

       Descriptive Claims: How the World Is

       Descriptive claims make statements about how the world is. They describe the facts of something, what you
       observe to be the case without any form of evaluation or judgment. For example, "the weather today is sunny"
       is a descriptive claim because it simply describes what someone observes.

       Evaluative Claims: How the World Ought to Be

good, just, fair, beautiful, healthy, important, etc. Instead of simply describing, evaluative claims interpret facts
or assert what should be the case.

Evaluative claims can be prescriptive--that is, they state what should be the case or what people ought to do in
a given situation. For example, "I should go outside to get some sunshine" is an evaluative claim. It is based on
a descriptive claim ("the weather today is sunny"), but it interprets this fact and ascribes a value to it
("sunshine is good for mental health") in a way that prescribes an action ("I should go outside"). When people
make evaluations about the goodness of something, it implies that they should do it. Evaluations are thus
connected to actions and choices.

Sometimes people struggle to distinguish between facts and values and mistakenly think an evaluative
statement is simply a positive claim about the way things are. As the next section will describe, this mistake is
a type of fallacy.

statement that form the basis of each statement that you identify as evaluative.

1. You should wear a scarf and mittens to keep warm.
2. People visit Athens to explore the remains of the ancient city.
3. Tomatoes contain vitamin C, which can boost your immune system.
4. The city needs to build more parks where residents can walk, jog, and exercise.

The Naturalistic Fallacy

When thinking about values, it can be easy to make errors. A fallacy is an error in logical reasoning. Fallacies
involve drawing the wrong conclusions from the premises of an argument or jumping to a conclusion without
sufficient evidence. There are many types of logical fallacies because there are many ways people can make
mistakes with their reasoning.

Learn more about informal fallacies in the chapter on logic and reasoning, and explore more about cognitive
values in the chapter on critical thinking, research, reading, and writing.

The naturalistic fallacy is an error in reasoning that assumes you can derive values (what people ought to do)
from facts about the world (what is the case). The British philosopher G. E. Moore (1873-1958) explains the
problem with this fallacy in his 1903 book Principia Ethica. For Moore, if philosophers based the judgment "x
is good" on a set of facts, or natural properties, about x, they have committed the naturalistic fallacy.

There are frequent examples of the naturalistic fallacy in popular discourse. Debates about whether
monogamy is good or bad are frequently posed in terms of whether it is "natural," and proponents for either
side of the argument often point at monogamous or nonmonogamous animals to justify their answer. Claiming
what humans ought to do from observations about animal behavior is an attempt to derive values from facts
about the world.

Hume and the Is-Ought Problem

The naturalistic fallacy is related to the is-ought problem. This problem asserts the challenge of moving from
statements of fact (something is) to statements of value (something ought to be). The Scottish Enlightenment
philosopher David Hume (1711-1776) provides one of the most famous explanations of this problem in his A
Treatise of Human Nature (1739-1740).

       become the evaluative claim "People ought to have pets." This is known as the is-ought problem. (credit: "My cat
       Toby" by Richard J/Flickr, Public Domain)
       At the time Hume was writing the Treatise, philosophers were rejecting a morality based on religious faith or
       dogmatic beliefs and were instead trying to find justifications for morality that relied on undeniable reasons
       for being a good person or trying to build a better society. Hume countered that you cannot derive ought from
       is because morality has to do with sentiments, not facts. In other words, morality has to do with what people
       believe and how we feel, and beliefs and feelings are not factual or derivable from facts. As Hume explains in
       the passage below, facts have to do with relations between objects. Morality, however, has to do with a human
       subject expressing their sentiments about a matter.

                READ LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

       Read this excerpt from David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, Book 3, Part 1. As you read, pay attention to how
       he describes propositions that use "ought." Does he seem to think they are justified with proper reasoning? Why or
       why not? Think of an example where using "ought" statements without rational justification could be a problem.

             "I cannot forbear adding to these reasonings an observation, which may, perhaps, be found of some
             importance. In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the
             author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or
             makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprized to find, that instead of the
             usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an
             ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this
             ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is necessary that it should be observed
             and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether
             inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it.
             But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and
             am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see,
             that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by
             reason."

The Open-Question Argument

Hume's description of the is-ought problem lives on in contemporary philosophy, especially in 20th-century
ethics. In his 1903 book Principia Ethica, G. E. Moore introduces the open-question argument to argue against
the naturalistic fallacy, which he sees as trying to derive non-natural properties, such as "right" and "good,"
from natural properties. Unlike claims in the natural sciences, which extend understanding of or express a
discovery about natural properties of the world, goodness and rightness are non-natural properties that
cannot establish their truth based on natural properties and thus are always open to questioning. For example,
the natural properties of water (H20) are not open to questioning in the same way that the non-natural
properties of things that people judge to be "good" or "right" are.

In order to answer the question "Is x good?" people frequently have to assert that something else is good. Is
being kind to your neighbor good? Yes. Why? Because compassion for others is good. This does not "close" the
question because it amounts to saying "good is good." It is circular and thus uninformative, so the question
remains open. Moore did believe that claims about moral properties can be true, but not in the same way as
claims about natural properties.

Objections to the Fact-Value Distinction

Not all philosophers agree that there is a strict distinction between facts and values. Moral realists argue for a
more objective concept of morality. They feel that there are certain moral facts about the world that are
objectively true, such as the claim "murder is immoral." Moral skeptics, on the other hand, often use the fact-
value distinction to argue against an objective basis for morality by emphasizing that moral values are not
factual and involve a different mode of thinking that is distinct from logical or scientific reasoning.
Disagreements with the fact-value distinction come in different forms.

Putnam's Objection to the Fact-Value Distinction

Some philosophers reject the concept of empirical facts by demonstrating that scientific reasoning uses values
to establish facts. In his 1982 article "Beyond the Fact-Value Dichotomy," American philosopher and
mathematician Hilary Putnam (1926 - 2016) argues that scientists frequently must choose between
conflicting theories and use desirable principles like simplicity or coherence to devise an explanation for
complex observational data. To illustrate his point, he explains that Einstein's theory of gravity was accepted
over competing theories because it was simpler and preserved other laws of physics. Putnam argues that
science's creation of facts is an evaluative practice and does not necessarily stand on a firmer ground than
conclusions about values like goodness or kindness. This approach to refuting the fact-value distinction is
provocative because it challenges the idea that science is an objective presentation of facts.

Lack of Distinction Claims

Another approach to challenging the fact-value distinction is to emphasize how people connect them in their
everyday ways of speaking. Some philosophers argue that certain types of descriptive claims imply an
evaluative claim, especially if they are linked by the concept of purpose or function. For example, if a person
says, "This knife is too dull to cut anything," then you can assume they also mean "This is a bad knife" because
it does not fulfill its function. If you understand the purpose of function of the knife, you can follow this
implication easily. Since people make these types of connections easily in everyday speech, the distinction
between facts and values may not hold much meaning.
242 8 · Value Theory

       Claims of Objective Moral Reasoning
       Finally, some philosophers reject the fact-value distinction through the concept of telos (purpose, end, or goal).
       They argue that values are based on the fulfillment of a goal. You can objectively assess whether an action does
       or does not fulfill a goal. For example, if your goal is to help others in need, an action will be good if it fulfills
       that goal, like volunteering at a homeless shelter. Using this goal, you can objectively determine whether any
       action is good, bad, or neutral. Telos, therefore, establishes an objective morality.
       To investigate the is-ought distinction further, you must explore what a value is. The following section will take
       up this question.

     8.2 Basic Questions about Values

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Relate extrinsic values to intrinsic values.
         · Distinguish between monism and pluralism in value theory.
         · Explain the concept of incommensurability in value theory.
         · Compare and contrast moral pluralism and moral relativism.
       People spend much of their time trying to accomplish goals that they deem as "good." But what do people
       mean when they say something is "good"? What does it mean to value something? Can conflicting values be
       resolved? This section will explore different answers to these questions and, in doing so, help you understand
       the meaning of value.

      Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value

       One way to think about what a value is has to do with whether it is valuable for its own sake or valuable for the
       sake of something else. Something has intrinsic value if it is valuable for its own sake. For example, Aristotle
       asserted that happiness has intrinsic value because it is an end in itself. He believed that all actions ultimately
       aim at happiness, but happiness is pursued for its own sake. If someone were to ask, "What is happiness good
       for?" Aristotle would reply that it simply good in and of itself.
       Something has extrinsic value if it is valuable for the sake of something else. It is a means to an end. For
       example, you probably engage in a variety of activities that are good insofar as they help your health. Eating a
       well-balanced diet, going to the doctor regularly, and keeping an active routine all contribute to health and
       well-being. Health is thus the intrinsic good that makes each of those activities extrinsically good.

health. If eating fruits and vegetables were found to not contribute to health, this would no longer be viewed as a
desirable action. (credit: "Healthy and tasty fruits and vegetables" by Marco Verch Professional/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Fundamentality

One could argue, however, that health is yet an extrinsic value because people only value health because it
contributes to happiness. When people distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic values, they think about not
only what is valuable but also how values are related to each other. The example of health and happiness raises
the question of fundamentality--whether there is only one intrinsic value or many.

Monism argues that there is only one fundamental intrinsic value that forms the foundation for all other
values. For example, hedonists think that pleasure is a fundamental intrinsic value and that something must
be pleasurable to be good. A monist believes that if people evaluate their values carefully--and the relationship
between their values--then one value will be more important than the others and the others will serve that
intrinsic value. For a monist, it is important to identify which value is more fundamental so that it can guide
your beliefs, judgments, and actions.

Pluralism argues that there are multiple fundamental intrinsic values rather than one. A pluralist can still
evaluate which values are intrinsic and which are extrinsic, but that process does not lead them to identify one
ultimate intrinsic value that forms the foundation for all other values. Pluralism holds that people have two or
more fundamental values because these values are not reducible to each other. For example, knowledge and
love are both intrinsic goods if what is good about knowledge cannot be summed up in terms of love and if
what is good about love cannot be summed up in terms of knowledge.

Philosophers who argue for monism often see pluralism as a type of relativism that can prevent people from
resolving moral issues when values come into conflict. Consider physician-assisted suicide. A monist would
want to address the issue of ending one's life for medical reasons by evaluating it according to one ethical
principle. For example, if monists hold that pleasure is the intrinsic good, they might argue that physician-
assisted suicide is good when it allows the cessation of pain, particularly in cases where the patient's suffering
prohibits any pleasure of mind or body. Pluralists, however, would have to evaluate this physician-assisted
suicide based on multiple intrinsic values, such as pleasure and life. In this case, the cessation of pain and the
continuation of life are both good, and neither is better than the other. As a result, pluralists may not find a way
to resolve the conflicting values or may not be able to identify whether this action is right or wrong. By
contrast, monism allows someone to hold a unified and coherent metaethical framework because it asserts
one fundamental value rather than many.

Pluralists, however, consider life to have many intrinsic goods including satisfying one's desires, achieving
one's aims, developing one's abilities, and developing deep personal relationships. In Women and Human
Development, American feminist and moral philosopher Martha Nussbaum (1947 - present) describes many
intrinsic goods--including life, health, emotional attachment, affiliation, play, reason, and more (2000). A
flourishing life will have many goods, not just one. Pluralists, moreover, are concerned with the consequences
of monism. Asserting that there is only one intrinsic good, despite differences in opinion, could potentially
restrict individual's freedom, especially when their values differ from the mainstream.

Incommensurability

Pluralism frequently relies on the concept of incommensurability, which describes a situation in which two or
more goods, values, or phenomena have no standard of evaluation that applies to them all. You can compare
the size of one object in feet and another object in centimeters by converting feet to centimeters. But you
cannot compare the speed of a running cheetah to the size of the Taj Mahal because one involves measuring
miles per hour and the other involves measuring square feet.

Similarly, some values are simply too different to be evaluated in the same way. For example, there are some
things in life that you cherish and cannot describe in terms of a dollar amount, such as love or friendship. The
244 8 · Value Theory

       value of friendship is not commensurate with the value of money. Furthermore, physical health and supportive
       friends are both valuable, but they are good in different ways, so they are incomparable values. Even if you can
       evaluate values in the same way, you might not be able to compare them in the sense of judging what is better
       or worse than the other. For example, you might have many friendships that you value highly but not be able to
       rank them or determine who your best friend is.

      Moral Pluralism vs. Moral Relativism

       Moral pluralism argues that there are different moral frameworks that cannot be unified into one. One
       implication of this is that one culture may have difficulty understanding the values of another culture because
       they have completely different concepts of what is good, and we might not be able to find a way to reconcile
       these differences. Cultural differences play an important role in value pluralism and the idea that there can be
       multiple frameworks for understanding morality.

       At the same time, pluralism is not the same as relativism. Moral relativism makes a larger claim than
       pluralism because it not only asserts that there are multiple moral frameworks, it also asserts that each
       framework is equally valid insofar as individuals, communities, and cultures determine what is moral. Moral
       relativism thus prohibits cultures from judging each other's value systems.

       Nussbaum uses the example of genital mutilation as an example of why moral relativism raises issues (1999).
       If morality is completely relative to a culture's own traditions and values, it would be impossible for any
       outsiders to condemn female genital mutilation or other practices that harm women or keep them in a
       weakened or exploited state. Nussbaum argues that feminist issues should not be evaluated by local traditions
       and that a global notion of justice is needed to address gender inequality. She thus argues for a universal
       account of justice that is sensitive to differences between cultures, which she calls reasonable pluralism.

       Pluralism and relativism get at the heart of many real-world ethical issues that people navigate in life,
       especially when they look at moral beliefs from historical or cultural perspectives that show how different
       values can be. Situating different values in relation to each other is difficult, and how people do so has practical
       outcomes for how they define what is right or wrong, which actions they consider ethical or unethical, and
       what aims they pursue in life.

     8.3 Metaethics

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the meaning of the phrase "ontology of value."
         · Identify the significance of realism and anti-realism for moral discourse.
         · Compare and contrast different theories regarding the foundations for moral theory.
         · Explain the importance of the Euthyphro problem for metaethics.

       Ethics is the broad study of morality and is often divided into metaethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics.
       Normative ethics and applied ethics are covered in separate chapters. Each field is distinguished by a different
       level of inquiry and analysis. Metaethics focuses on moral reasoning and foundational questions that explore
       the assumptions related to moral beliefs and practice. It attempts to understand the presuppositions
       connected to morality and moral deliberation. Metaethics explores, for example, where moral values originate,
       what it means to say something is right or good, whether there are any objective moral facts, whether morality
       is (culturally) relative, and whether there is a psychological basis for moral practices and value judgements.

       In the previous two sections, in asking whether there is a fact-value distinction and what values are, we
       encountered a central question in metaethics--whether morality is grounded in objective or subjective values.
       We have also encountered questions about what is good or bad and right or wrong, which is the main concern
       of normative ethics. This section dives deeper into these questions and explores different foundations for
       moral values, such as God, religious faith, nature, society, politics, law, and rationality.

Ontology of value

An important area of metaethics is the ontology of value. Ontology is the study (ology) of being (n). It gets at
the nature of what makes something what it is. Ontology of value is the study of the being of values. What is a
value? Is it a statement about reality? A subjective idea or belief? A mental state or emotion? As you will see,
there are different ontological accounts of value.

Realism and Anti-realism

Do moral values have a basis in reality, or are they purely subjective and relative to individuals or
communities? Depending on your answer, your approach to ethics will look completely different. Thus, the
first major distinction between different types of ethical reasoning is the difference between realism and anti-
realism. Moral realists, as discussed earlier, object to the fact-value distinction. Realism asserts that ethical
values have some basis in reality and that reasoning about ethical matters requires an objective framework or
foundation to discover what is truly good. For a realist, values are not simply subjective opinions. Anti-realism
asserts that ethical values are not based on objective facts about the world but instead rely on subjective
foundations like individuals' desires and beliefs.

  · Lying
  · Corporal punishment
  · Harming an innocent person

This section extends moral realism beyond the fact-value distinction to examine why many argue that moral
realism is an important position to take and the types of objective realities people have used to establish a
moral reality.

The Importance of Debate within Moral Realism

Moral debate poses a challenge to moral realism because it makes morality seem subjective. If people disagree
on important moral issues, such as abortion, or on how to justify moral beliefs, how are we to determine who is
right? Maybe no one has the right answer and moral claims are simply subjective opinions.

For a realist, moral disagreements do not mean that morality is subjective. Many fields, including the natural
sciences, have vibrant debates and disagreements that do not necessarily indicate that their claims are
subjective. For example, astronomers used to think that the sun and planets revolved around Earth, and the
heliocentric concept of the universe was considered heretical. This disagreement does not mean that
astronomy is subjective but instead that astronomy requires ongoing observation and debate to improve its
understanding of reality. Along similar lines, moral debates do not necessarily prove morality is subjective and
in fact can even improve one's understanding of a moral issue. Moral realism asserts that morality has an
objective framework or foundation, which means that you can make true moral claims. People do not
necessarily, however, agree on which claims are true.

The Importance of Moral Resolution

Moral relativism, discussed earlier, is an anti-realist position because it denies that there is an objective or
universal justification for moral beliefs. Instead, morality is always relative to an individual or community. This
means there is no way to say what is truly good or bad.
246 8 · Value Theory

       Moral relativism has taken many different shapes throughout the history of philosophy, and it is debated in
       popular discourses--especially politics and religion--as well as in metaethics. It is controversial because it
       seems to undermine the possibility of finding common ground in ethical debates that shape practical action or
       political policies. Thus anti-realism and moral relativism seem to create insurmountable barriers for
       overcoming moral disagreements.
       For contemporary philosopher Michelle Moody-Adams, however, moral disagreements between different
       cultures--and even within cultures--do not require us to adopt an anti-realist position. She takes moral
       disagreements seriously but also argues for "cautious optimism" about moral objectivity (1997). For Moody-
       Adams, irresolvable moral disagreements are an "unavoidable feature of moral experience" and not a reason
       to be skeptical about moral reasoning (1997, 107).
       Since anti-realism is a form of moral skepticism, it can lead not only to relativism but also to pessimism about
       whether we can resolve moral debates or whether moral reasoning has any legitimacy. Being able to explain
       what is right or wrong is important not only for ethics but also for the lives of individuals within communities
       because people's actions and decisions impact each other. This is one of the critiques that moral realists
       employ against anti-realists. If morality is purely subjective, then values are arbitrary and people are unable to
       make true claims about moral values.
       Moral realism requires one to find objective justifications for moral beliefs and claims. These justifications
       take a variety of forms--including God and nature--which the following sections will explain.

      Divine and Religious Foundations for Moral Values

       One way to analyze moral reasoning is by examining its foundation--that is, how it supports claims about
       morality. Throughout history, many humans have relied upon a concept of the divine to justify moral claims
       and values.
       Ethical frameworks that are based on God can function in a variety of ways depending on the concept of the
       divine. God can function as the highest good. In this case, God provides an exemplar for the virtues and values
       that should guide human action. For example, if God is a loving being, humans should develop their ability to
       love, and performing loving actions will be the basis for morality. The concept of God can function as an
       ultimate judge who decides what is right and wrong from an omnipotent and infallible position. In this case,
       God provides an objective standpoint for moral judgment. With this ethical framework, humans may disagree
       on what is right or wrong because of their limited perspectives, but morality is not relative or arbitrary because
       it rests on eternal truths from an all-knowing God.

Religions frequently claim knowledge about the nature and source of reality, the meaning of human existence,
the foundations for morality, the purpose of suffering in the world, and what happens when people die. Many
religions consider the tenets of their faith to come from a divine source, sacred revelations, or prophets.
Religions also look to scripture, sacred practices and customs, images, and objects to determine moral values.
Augustine on Faith and Knowledge
Those who challenge the divine as a source of moral authority question whether these moral beliefs are based
on only faith or whether they are justified true beliefs that can be accepted as knowledge. Faith refers to beliefs
that are not proven, including beliefs that cannot be proven. The medieval monk, theologian, and philosopher
Augustine of Hippo (354-430) argued that there are many things in life people claim to know that are actually
based on faith. His argument attempts to blur the distinction between faith and knowledge. For example, if
people are not adopted, they typically claim to know who their parents are and take that as firm knowledge, not
belief. Yet people are not able to remember their own births or the earliest years of their lives, so they did not
confirm this belief with their own observations. For Augustine, this is how faith works. In this sense, faith and
knowledge serve a similar purpose in human life and the values people hold.
The Euthyphro problem
Using God as the basis for moral values can introduce challenging philosophical questions that are difficult to
answer. The Euthyphro problem describes such a challenge in theistic ethical systems. It asks whether
something is good because God commands it or if God commands it because it is good. The name comes from
the Platonic dialogue Euthyphro, which features a conversation between the philosopher Socrates and a man
named Euthyphro who claims to be an expert on piety. Socrates asks, "Is the pious being loved by the gods
because it is pious, or is it pious because it is being loved by the gods?" (Plato, Euthyphro 10a). In the former
case, the gods do not determine what is good, so there must be a higher authority above the gods. In the latter
248 8 · Value Theory

       case, the gods remain the ultimate authority, but there are no discernible principles for why they love what
       they love. That means that piety is a command from above without reason, which limits one's ability to theorize
       about it. This idea is called divine command theory.

       The former case, however, introduces a problem regarding God's sovereignty and omnipotence because it
       places moral principles above the divine and seems to set up a situation in which there are rules not even God
       may violate. In other words, if God cannot act immorally, is God truly all-powerful?

      Natural and Human Foundations for Moral Values

       Different ethical frameworks rest on different foundations or justifications: some appeal to a nonhuman
       principle like nature; others appeal to shared human institutions like culture, tradition, society, or law; and
       still others appeal to the individual and their resources for moral reasoning. This section examines moral
       reasoning based on nature, society, politics, the self, or reason.

       Nature and Natural Law

       One approach to ethics appeals to nature or natural law to make claims about what is good or bad. An action,
       goal, or characteristic is good if it accords with nature or natural law and is bad if it violates it. Here, nature can
       refer to human nature or the observed features of the natural world.

       According to the medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), there are four types of laws: eternal,
       natural, human, and divine. Eternal laws govern the universe, natural laws govern the natural world, and
       human laws govern human societies. Divine laws are supernatural and allow humans to reach salvation but
       cannot be known through human reason alone. Instead, they must be revealed by God (e.g., the Ten
       Commandments, Scriptures, and other divine revelations). Humans can use reason, however, to discover
       natural laws and create human laws. For Aquinas, human laws must align with natural law. Human laws that
       violate the laws of nature are "no longer a law but a perversion of law" (Aquinas [1485] 1948, 649). Aquinas's
       argument contributes to classical natural law theory, which sees laws as upholding natural order. Because
       nature is not subjective, natural law theory sees values as objective.

       Ethical Naturalism

       As discussed earlier, some philosophers believe that an essential link between values and telos, or purpose,
       creates an objective moral reality. Ethical naturalism argues that performing good actions fulfills human
       nature, while performing evil actions distorts it. If this is the case, moral values and "what is good" are based
       on natural facts about the world, not individuals' subjective feelings or beliefs. Ethical naturalism often relies
       on concepts of pleasure, desire, happiness, or flourishing to define what is naturally good or bad.

       The 20th-century philosopher Philippa Foot (1920-2010) provides one of the most famous philosophical
       arguments for ethical naturalism. In Natural Goodness (2003), Foot argues that moral values like "goodness"
       are not about statements, as G. E. Moore suggested in Principia Ethica, or about mere emotions that
       individuals feel, but are instead about human flourishing. Just as bees have qualities that help them thrive and
       build strong colonies, so humans have virtues that help them to thrive in life and build flourishing
       communities. Foot's description of flourishing is influenced by Aristotle, who based his concept of ethics on an
       examination of different virtues, which involve fulfilling one's telos, or purpose. This approach to morality is
       called virtue ethics. In ethical naturalism and virtue ethics, discovering moral values requires understanding
       one's nature, which must be based on an objective understanding of human life.

           CONNECTIONS

       The chapter on normative moral theory explores virtue ethics in greater depth.

       In Natural Goodness, Foot further argues that moral evaluations are similar to the types of evaluations that
       people make about other living things in the natural world. Moral goodness describes how one should live

according to human nature. Just as you can know what is good for an animal by studying its nature, you can
know what is good for humans by understanding their nature.
More importantly, Foot argues that part of understanding what an organism is involves knowing what is good
for it based on its vital processes. For example, you know what is good for a duck based on knowledge of what a
duck is. This knowledge would include an understanding of the duck's nature and what helps it live a good life.
A duck is an aquatic bird, so a habitat with water will be good for it. Along similar lines, you can know what is
good for a human based on knowledge of human nature.
In this sense, she connects morality to biological flourishing, or achieving the goals of human life. For example,
if the purpose of human life is to develop meaningful relationships and to actualize one's potential, then
morality is based on the virtues that allow someone to achieve these ends. For example, one could argue that
humans, like other primates, have evolved to cooperate and care for others as a part of their survival, so
actions that promote cooperation and care are good, and actions that harm others are bad.
Reason
Some ethical theories focus exclusively on certain human capacities, like reason. Reason is a methodical way
of thinking that uses evidence and logic to draw conclusions. The use of reason as the grounds for morality
became particularly important in Enlightenment philosophy because philosophers wanted to assert the
validity of moral principles without relying on religious beliefs or God.

FIGURE 8.5 Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that an action is moral if it can be universal. (credit:
"Bildnis des Immanuel Kant" by Johann Friedrich Schleuen (senior)/Leipzig University Library, Public Domain)
The Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) argued that as rational agents, humans express
general principles or maxims when they act. You always act for a reason--namely, a goal or end in mind. For
Kant, an action or decision is moral if you can universalize it, which he formulates in the categorical
imperative. Kant's categorical imperative states: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the
same time, will that it should become a universal law" (Kant [1785] 1998, 31). That means you know an action
is moral if can be universal for everyone. The categorical imperative works best when we note that an action
250 8 · Value Theory

       contradicts it. For example, lying cannot be moral because it is not universalizable. It is impossible for
       everyone to lie. Even the act of lying assumes that people usually tell the truth.

       Self

       Other approaches to ethical theory argue that morality originates in the self. How do people know what is right
       or wrong? What motivates them to be good and care for others? Some argue that the conscience, an
       individual's inner sense of right and wrong, forms the basis for ethics. But where does one get this inner sense?
       Some argue that it comes through intuition--cognition that seems completely self-evident and impossible to
       deny--while others assert that individuals develop it through education or reason.

       Other approaches to ethics rely upon the individual's psychology, moral sentiments, or feelings. Multiple moral
       theories emphasize compassion and empathy, the ability to suffer with and share others' feelings. For the
       ancient Chinese philosopher Mencius (371-289 BCE), the feeling of compassion allows benevolent actions,
       which are the basis for ethics and well-being. Compassion and empathy might also be considered virtues that
       individuals cultivate. Virtue ethics bases its moral theory on virtues as personal characteristics that an
       individual can develop.

       Feminist care ethics bases ethics on individuals' feelings for the people who play a significant role in their
       lives. In her book Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, the American philosopher Nel
       Noddings (b. 1929) argues that an "ethics built on caring" is "characteristically and essentially feminine"
       insofar as it arises out of women's experiences, which are traditionally defined through caregiving roles (2013,
       8).

       An important debate within ethical theory is the importance of altruism, which is the selfless care for others'
       well-being. Some moral philosophers argue that only altruistic actions are completely moral, while others
       assert that self-interest can motivate the moral treatment of others. It is this issue that the next section
       addresses.

                THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

       In the above section, you learned that there are many different possible sources for moral knowledge. Do you think
       there are objective sources of moral knowledge? Why or why not?

     8.4 Well-Being

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe Epicurean hedonism and utilitarianism.
         · Analyze arguments for and against satisfactionism as a determinant of well-being.
         · Identify objective goods that contribute to well-being.
         · Outline different approaches to eudaimonism.

       Well-being--or flourishing, as it is sometimes called--is a widely discussed topic in value theory because it
       helps us to understand what we value and why. The things people value in life--for example, a just society, good
       health, beautiful art, physical pleasure, and supportive friendships--contribute to their well-being. For some
       philosophers, well-being determines values. If you want to define whether an action is valuable, you must
       determine whether it promotes the well-being of a person.

       Well-being focuses on what is good for a person, not simply what is good in an abstract sense. It also focuses
       on intrinsic goods that contribute to a flourishing life. In what follows, you will learn about different concepts of
       well-being and how they can help you think about what is valuable and good. There are three general ways
       philosophers approach the value of well-being: (1) pleasure, (2) desire, and (3) objective goods.

Hedonism

Some philosophers describe well-being as obtaining pleasure and avoiding pain. The general term for this
approach is hedonism. The term hedonism has a different meaning in philosophy than in popular usage. In
everyday language, hedonism refers to extravagant indulgence in bodily pleasures. By contrast, philosophical
hedonism is not about just bodily pleasure--it takes emotional and mental pleasure and pain into account as
well. A philosophical hedonist will prioritize intellectual pleasures or long-lasting pleasures that contribute to
a good and meaningful life, rather than momentary and fleeting pleasures.

Hedonism is based on the idea that pleasure and pain are the two most fundamental emotions or states of
being. For a hedonist, pleasure is good and pain is bad, and for this reason they can serve as principles for
determining well-being.

Epicurus's Hedonism

Hedonism has a long philosophical history. The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341-270 BCE) founded a
school of philosophy called Epicureanism, which taught that pleasure is the highest good. Epicurus's concept
of pleasure, however, is not simply physical and is far from being extravagant, materialistic, or indulgent. He
taught that a life of moderation, virtue, and philosophy would be the most pleasurable. He believed it was
important to tame wild desires that are impossible to satisfy and that cause unhappiness and dissatisfaction
with life. His philosophy focused on methods for achieving freedom from mental, emotional, and physical pain
through ataraxia (tranquility). For Epicurus, achieving ataraxia requires confronting irrational fears,
especially the fear of death.

The concept of hedonism and even the word Epicurean have very different meanings in popular usage now.
Hedonism describes reveling in indulgent bodily and sensory pleasures like food, alcohol, and sex. The term
Epicurean often refers to individuals who take especial pleasure in food and drink, like a wine connoisseur or
someone obsessed with Michelin star restaurants. However, for Epicurus, the best thing in life was having good
friends who want to discuss philosophy.

Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is considered hedonistic because it bases moral theory on maximizing pleasure and
minimizing pain. For the utilitarian philosophers Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) and John Stuart Mill
(1806-1873), values rest on pleasure and pain, which are psychological states of mind. Pleasure is a
psychological state of mind that is intrinsically good, while pain is a psychological state of mind that is
intrinsically bad. The value of an action thus rests on the psychological state it causes. Utilitarians evaluate
actions based on the intensity, duration, certainty, and extent of pleasure or pain and the number of people it
affects. In general, utilitarian philosophers believe that an action is moral if it leads to the greatest benefit for
the greatest number of people. Thus, utilitarianism can be described as a method for maximizing well-being.

Qualitative Distinctions in Pleasure

Pleasure can be a slippery term. It is experiential, but it can be experienced in many different ways. For this
reason, philosophers often create distinctions to explain different types of pleasure. Pleasure can be sensory
or bodily, affective or emotional, and mental or emotional. You can describe the pleasure of biting into a juicy
apple, watching light reflect on water, and feeling soft textures. You can describe the elation of achieving a goal,
the joy of receiving good news, and the comfort of spending time with a close friend. You can also describe the
gratification of learning something new, the satisfaction of sharing ideas with others, and the euphoria of
immersing one's focus entirely in an activity.

Pleasure as a State of Mind

Pleasure seems to be a feeling or sensation, but also much more. For example, savoring an apple means taking
pleasure in its taste. Here the pleasure depends on the taste being good, but the pleasure we take in tasting it is
not the same as simply tasting it. For this reason, some philosophers have argued that pleasure is not simply
252 8 · Value Theory

       sensation but instead involves a notion of good. That is, pleasure satisfies a desire for what is good, which
       involves a state of mind, not just a sensation--and so involves reasoning, beliefs, or the satisfaction of a desire.

           CONNECTIONS

       The chapter on normative moral theory explores utilitarianism in greater depth.

       As a result, critics of hedonistic philosophies complain that pleasure is too varied, indeterminate, subjective,
       and conditional to be a solid basis for ethics, well-being, or any philosophical theory, and that well-being
       consists of more than pleasure. The experience machine illustrates this issue.

       The Experience Machine (a Thought Experiment)

       The experience machine is a critique of hedonism and pleasure-based concepts of well-being. In this thought
       experiment created by American thinker Robert Nozick (1938 - 2002) in 1974, a person can be plugged into
       an "experience machine" that gives them every experience they value and enjoy. Moreover, they would be
       completely unaware of the machine, which means they would experience everything as real even though it
       would all be an illusion. The thought experiment prompts one to think about what makes life good. Is well-
       being simply a state of mind that a machine could replicate, or is there more to it? For Nozick, it is not a good
       life because it is not real. People want what is real, and they want to really do things. Pleasure alone does not
       satisfy that need and desire.

      Well-Being and the Satisfaction of Desire

       Another way to think of well-being is the satisfaction of desire. There are multiple ways to define desire and
       think about its satisfaction. One approach is to describe desire as action based. A person's desires dispose
       them to take certain actions--for example, you eat because you desire food. Another approach is to think of
       desire as related to beliefs about what is good. In this case, you would say that you eat because you believe it is
       good to do so. This theory of desire explains why it is relevant to philosophical concepts of well-being. Well-
       being is satisfying one's desires. This concept of well-being is called satisfactionism.

       In satisfactionism, if an individual is able to satisfy larger desires in their life, they live a good life. Flourishing
       is thus a matter of desire satisfaction that is dependent upon the individual's preferences. However, individuals
       can be wrong about what is good and can make choices that they think will bring them happiness but do not.
       For example, a person may believe that being an astronaut will make them happy in life but then discover that
       they do not deal well with the loneliness of long space flights. Had they understood what being an astronaut
       entails, they would not have desired it. So only the satisfaction of informed desires leads to happiness, while
       the satisfaction of uninformed desires might not.

       Cognitivism and Non-cognitivism

       Explaining well-being in terms of desire and preferences exposes specific disagreements in how philosophers
       think about values--more specifically, whether values have content. In other words, do values express explicit
       ideas and beliefs that you can put in a statement, or are values the emotional states of an individual?
       Cognitivism argues that values are cognitive (involve thought) and express statements about properties of
       things (e.g., this apple is healthy) or states of events (e.g., the sinking of the Titanic was a tragedy). Non-
       cognitivism argues that values are not cognitive because they do not necessarily make statements about
       properties of things or states of events and have more to do with a psychological state of mind.

       Emotivism

       Emotivism is a branch of non-cognitivism that argues that value judgments express someone's emotions,
       which unlike a belief cannot be true or false. English philosopher A. J. Ayer (1910-1989), a proponent for
       moral emotivism, proposed that people do not hold moral beliefs; instead, they emote moral feelings. That
       means that if someone says, "Killing innocent people is bad," they are expressing how they feel about killing

                                                                                                                                                                      8.4 · Well-Being 253

innocent people rather than making a statement that can be proven or disproven or that is up for debate.
Contemporary moral philosophers often argue against emotivism because it means that values are dependent
on individuals' feelings and thus are completely subjective. Moral philosophy often attempts to assert that
there are objective values, particularly when it comes to well-being. The following section will explain such
philosophical approaches.

Well-Being and Objective Goods

Another approach to well-being is to create lists of objective goods that contribute to a flourishing life. Unlike
desire-based concepts of well-being, objective goods can argue against personal preferences. Distinguishing
between desire and objective goods can be useful in situations where personal desire conflicts with what is
good for the person. As an example, consider a good that clearly contributes to well-being, like health. One
could argue that a balanced diet and frequent physical activity are objective goods. Even if an individual
desires to eat unhealthy food or live a sedentary lifestyle, their individual preferences do not change what is
objectively good. Philosophers who propose that there are objective goods frequently focus on knowledge,
virtue, and friendship as ways to evaluate and understand well-being.
Knowledge
Aristotle began his Metaphysics with the idea that the desire to know is a universal human quality. Part of
being human is to seek knowledge. People are curious. They have a sense of wonder. They value discovery. By
contrast, having a lack of knowledge about the world can lead to poor decisions, confusion, anxieties,
delusions, and other states of minds and activities that detract from well-being. For these reasons, knowledge
can be considered an important part of well-being and flourishing in life.
Virtue
Virtue is also considered an objective good. The ancient Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
considered virtue to be essential to a good life. In ancient Greek, the word for virtue was arête, which can also
be translated as "excellence." To determine the arête, or excellence, of something, you have to know what its
purpose or function is. For example, the purpose of a knife is to cut things, so its arête is sharpness. A good
knife is a sharp knife. It is easier to determine the arête of a practical object like a knife than the arête of a
person. For this reason, Socrates argues that people need to "discuss virtue everyday" and continually
examine their lives (Plato [399-360 BCE] 2002, 41). Virtue is not simply a characteristic or personality trait for
the ancient Greeks. It is a way of living.

FIGURE 8.6 Determining the arête, or excellence, of objects is often a straightforward undertaking. These teacups,
for example, should fulfill their function of holding tea very well. Determining the function of human existence,
254 8 · Value Theory

       however, is more difficulty, making determining arête in this context much trickier. (credit: "Teacups" by Heather/
       Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

       Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics describes virtue as promoting human well-being. To determine what actions
       are virtuous, Aristotle proposes that virtue is the mean between a deficiency and excess. Vices, the opposite of
       virtues, are deficiencies or excesses. Aristotle uses bravery as an example (Book II, Chapter 7, §2). Bravery is
       virtue that involves having the right amount of fear and confidence. It is the mean between excessive fear and
       deficient confidence on one hand (cowardice) and deficient fear and excessive confidence (rashness) on the
       other hand. In this way, the virtuous action will be the golden mean, neither too much nor too little. Virtue thus
       describes being able to do the right thing in the right way, a quality that contributes to one's well-being.

       Friendship

       Friendship is also considered an objective good. A person's social relations and close ties to others also allow
       them to flourish. For Aristotle, friendship is "necessary for our life" (1155a5). In Book VIII of Nicomachean
       Ethics, Aristotle identifies three different types of friendships: (1) friendships of pleasure, (2) friendships of
       utility, and (3) friendships of character. The first two types of friendship are instrumental in the sense that
       these friends are not appreciated for themselves but instead are a means to another end (pleasure or
       usefulness). Aristotle thinks that these friendships dissolve easily. For Aristotle, friendships based on an
       appreciation of someone's character are stronger and do not dissolve when circumstances change. These types
       of friends recognize what is good in each other as people and want what is good for each other. In these ways,
       friendships contribute to our well-being.

      Eudaimonia (Human Flourishing)

       Philosophers sometimes use the word eudaimonia, the ancient Greek term for "happiness" or "human
       flourishing," to describe well-being. Eudaimonia is a hard word to translate. People often associate the word
       happiness with a fleeting moment of elation or personal satisfaction rather than a state of overall well-being.
       However, eudaimonia is not a mere feeling or temporary high. It describes one's life as a whole, not just how
       one feels, which is why the term flourishing is used more often. Flourishing also has the sense of thriving
       according to one's nature. We add human to flourishing to specify that we mean excelling in the things that are
       proper to a human life.

       Ancient Greek View of Eudaimonia

       Eudaimonia is derived from the words for "good" (eu) and "spirit" (daimon). A daimon was a guardian spirit
       that would help someone through life and guide them to the underworld. The ancient Greek philosopher
       Socrates claimed his daimon told him to philosophize so he could awaken the Athenian people. Eudaimonia is
       more than a temporary feeling of joy or elation. It is having a good spirit through life, or--to put in more
       modern terms--having a flourishing life, full of all the good things a life can provide.

       For Plato and Aristotle, eudaimonia is related to the virtue or excellence of something (arête). Virtue or
       excellence is determined by the nature and purpose of something. For humans, one simply needs to determine
       the virtues that are proper to human nature and practice them to flourish in life. Moreover, flourishing in life
       gives an indication that one is acting well or virtuously. For Aristotle, virtue alone was not sufficient for
       flourishing. After all, someone could be very virtuous and suffer a grave misfortune. Suffering seems
       antithetical to flourishing. However, ancient Stoics believed that virtue was sufficient for flourishing and that
       tragic circumstances could not rob someone of their flourishing, because it could not take away their virtue.
       These debates in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy help us to think about whether an individual cultivates
       flourishing through their own agency alone or whether circumstances determine flourishing, or whether
       perhaps both are true.

       G. E. M. Anscombe and Modern Eudaimonism

       The British philosopher Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe (1919-2001), known as G. E. M. Anscombe,

critiqued Aristotle's ethics and eudaimonism in her 1958 article "Modern Moral Philosophy." For Anscombe,
Aristotle's concept of eudaimonism is too vague to be useful to moral philosophy, and many of the virtues he
describes in Nicomachean Ethics do not fit within a moral framework.

At the same time that Anscombe critiqued ancient Greek eudaimonism as a principle for moral philosophy,
she denied that modern philosophy had provided any better alternatives. For Anscombe, modern moral
philosophies, such as Kantian ethics and utilitarianism, use "oughts" that have no firm foundation. She argues
that an "ought" implies a command or law, which requires a legislator. This concept of morality works well
within a theistic framework where God serves as a legislator, but modern moral philosophy presents itself as
secular, not religious. Anscombe's contemporaries took up the challenge of describing human flourishing and
virtues in a more rigorous manner that could form the foundation for modern moral philosophy.

Perfectionism

Another way to approach human flourishing is to think of the highest attainable good for an individual, human
nature, or society. This approach to ethics is called perfectionism. There are a variety of ways that
perfectionism can be articulated. For Thomas Aquinas, one's goal in life is to become a perfect image of God
(Aquinas [1485] 1948, 439). Enlightenment philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) argued in his Ethics
([1677] 1985) that people pursue what will increase and perfect their powers and capacities. For example, joy
allows people to rise to greater perfection, while sadness leads to less perfection. There are many other
philosophies of self-perfection across the history of ideas. In each of them, you can see how the concept of
well-being is tied to perfecting oneself.

Kant's Kingdom of Ends

For Kant, values are not psychological states but instead are rational maxims. As explained previously, Kant
bases his moral philosophy on the categorical imperative, which helps one recognize moral and immoral
actions based on whether they can be turned into a universal maxim that applies to everyone. Kant provides
other formulations of the categorical imperative, where he states that one must always treat humans as "ends
in themselves" rather than "a means to an end." This means that you cannot use other people as instruments
to achieve your goals.

Kant states that another way to arrive at a universal maxim is to imagine you are creating laws for a kingdom of
ends. The kingdom of ends is a hypothetical, ideal society in which every individual is treated as an end and
no one is treated as a means to an end. It would be a society of equals, where everyone flourishes. In this sense,
Kant's moral philosophy uses the concept of an ideal or perfect society as a guiding principle.

Japanese Notion of Ikigai (Reason for Being)

Japanese psychology takes up the concept of ikigai (reason for being) to describe well-being. Contemporary
psychologist Michiko Kumano describes two senses of well-being in Japan: (1) shiawase, or hedonic well-
being, and (2) ikigai, or reason for being. He explains that while shiawase is a state of contentment or
happiness and freedom from worry, ikigai deals more with what makes life meaningful. He explains that ikigai
is "less philosophical and more intuitive, irrational, and complicated in its nuances than other related terms in
Western languages" (Kumano 2017, 421). How does one experience this nuanced, intuitive sense of purpose in
life? For Kumano, ikigai has to do with devoting oneself to goals and activities that are aligned with one's
values.

         · Explain the relation between aesthetics and feminism.
         · Describe everyday aesthetics.
       Thus far, the chapter has touched on fairly abstract concepts related to value. However, value theory has very
       concrete applications. Aesthetics is an area of value theory that examines how people evaluate works of art and
       other aesthetic experiences in nature and their everyday lives.

      Beauty

       A central concept in aesthetics is beauty. What is beauty? Is beauty an objective or subjective value? Even if
       you take beauty to be a subjective judgment, there are different ways to approach thinking about it. Are
       judgments of beauty completely "in the eye of the beholder," as the popular phrase indicates, or are there
       criteria or patterns that determine individuals' responses? Is beauty arbitrary, or can we discover some
       framework for explaining our experiences of it?
       Objective Concepts of Beauty
       For ancient philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, beauty is a quality of an object. These thinkers asserted that
       there was objective criteria for explaining what is beautiful. Plato believed that beauty is a quality of an object
       and that there is one true "form" or essence of the beautiful that explains why individual things are beautiful.
       The beautiful itself has to do with harmony, proportion, and balance.
       This concept of the beautiful makes sense if you look at ancient Greek art. The ancient Greeks used
       mathematical ratios to determine the perfect proportions for their temples and sculptures. The Greek sculptor
       Polykleitos (5th century BCE) developed mathematical rules for sculpting the human form so that the
       proportions of the body would be beautiful and lifelike.

weight. The contrapposto position expresses balance and harmonious movement. (credit: "Florence1988" by David

In Plato's philosophy, moreover, beauty is not simply a sensory or emotional response to things of this world; it
is transcendent and immaterial and involves one's soul and mind. The experience of beauty is ecstatic in the
sense that it lifts one beyond this world. In the Phaedrus, Plato describes the soul sprouting and growing wings
when it beholds something beautiful. As the wings grow, the soul is able to ascend to new heights.
Subjective Concepts of Beauty
In contrast to Plato and Aristotle, Enlightenment philosophers argued that beauty is a subjective judgment,
meaning it is a statement about what a person feels rather a quality of an object. For Hume, judgments of
beauty are statements of taste. In Hume's "Of the Standard of Taste" (1757), he points out that we witness great
variety in taste, even among people who share similar cultural and educational backgrounds. He also notes the
way that debates about taste frequently descend into condescension and defensiveness. Taste is very personal,
and people feel passionately about their judgments of taste. Yet Hume still asserts that people can educate,
develop, and refine their taste, which can then give their judgments more weight. For Hume, critics with
refined taste ultimately decide what is good or bad art.

Aesthetic Judgment

Aesthetic theory also examines how people make judgments about art. Are aesthetic judgments rational? Do
they have justifications, and if so, what kind of justifications?
Kant and Aesthetic Judgment
In the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790), Kant, like Hume, considers judgments of taste to be
subjective--that is, a statement about the subject's response to an object. However, he thinks that when people
experience beauty, they also think that others ought to feel the same way. Moreover, Kant thinks that art and
258 8 · Value Theory

       beauty are not a matter of personal preference because values and ideals are involved. If you enjoy something
       that is a mere personal preference, like an ice cream flavor, you will not necessarily expect others to like it and
       will not feel insulted if they dislike it. But the same is not necessarily true for art. For example, maybe you
       cannot explain why you prefer chocolate ice cream--it simply tastes better to you. However, you can explain
       why you love Toni Morrison's Beloved and think that others should read it too. Kant cares about the values
       involved with aesthetic judgments because he believes that the beautiful prepares people to love what is good.

       Sibley and Aesthetic Judgment

       How do people justify aesthetic judgments? Are there rules or a specific rationale that are needed? In
       "Aesthetic Concepts," British philosopher Frank Sibley (1923 - 1996) distinguishes between two types of
       remarks people make about art: sensory observations--what anyone with the sense of sight or hearing can
       observe--and aesthetic judgments, which require sensitivity to details and discernment (1959). Sibley notes
       that people frequently base aesthetic judgments on sensory observations. For example, you might describe a
       painting as melancholic because of its blue palette. However, Sibley argues that this does not mean that a
       person's sensory observations require that they arrive at a particular aesthetic judgment. Someone could
       disagree with your assessment of the painting and describe it as calm rather than melancholic. In this sense,
       aesthetic judgments have justifications but not necessary rules, conditions, or relations between what a person
       sees and how they interpret or judge it.

       The Intentional Fallacy

       Who determines what a work of art means? Its audience? Art historians or critics? Some people assert that it is
       the intention of the artist that determines the meaning of the work of art. For literary theorist William Kurtz
       Wimsatt (1907 - 1975) and philosopher of art Monroe Beardsley (1915 - 1985), both Americans, this is a
       fallacy: the intentional fallacy. Wimsatt and Beardsley point out that people are able to describe, interpret,
       and evaluate a work of art without any reference to the artist's intentions and, furthermore, that these
       intentions are often unknown and unavailable (1946).

       There are other reasons not to limit the meaning of a work of art to the artist's intentions. A work of art takes
       on a life of its own as it becomes known to the public and incorporated into spaces where it is discussed,
       compared, analyzed, and catalogued. Additionally, intentions do not always land correctly. An artist might
       intend to provoke a particular reaction and fail to do so, or the work of art might incite a response that the
       artist could not possibly anticipate. Audiences' reactions to the work of art are meaningful and, more
       importantly, not always a misinterpretation if they differ from the intentions of the artist.

      Art and Values

       Studying aesthetics can lay bare what societies value, how they express that value, and who gets to create
       values. Since aesthetic values are shaped by culture, society, class, religion, politics, ethnicity, race, gender,
       sexual orientation, and ability, art intervenes in ethical and social-political issues--and vice versa.

       Feminist Aesthetics

       Feminism, as defined by American social activist bell hooks (1952 - 2021), "is a movement to end sexism,
       sexist exploitation, and oppression" (hooks 2015, 1). Art provides one way to investigate the exploitation and
       oppression of women, particularly since women have been excluded from art. In past centuries, women were
       not allowed to study at art academies or exhibit their work at galleries. Additionally, the women who managed
       to create art were often marginalized and at times brutally punished for trying to make their way into the art
       world, like the 17th-century Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi, who was sexually assaulted by a man from her
       father's art circle and then dishonored and tortured in court. Women of color have been excluded from the art
       world to an even greater degree, particularly if their works of art do not fit within the classical "canon" of art,
       which focuses on "great" works of art like large-scale paintings, epic novels, and other traditionally masculine
       arts. Often, works of art that are tied to handicraft and domestic arts are excluded from the canon of great

works of art, which means that many creations by a variety of women are ignored.
In the 1980s, a group of anonymous women artist-activists called the Guerrilla Girls--a reference to guerrilla
fighters and the fact that they used gorilla masks to hide their identities--started a billboard campaign to shed
light on this issue. They created a poster that pointed out the exclusion of women artists from the Metropolitan
Museum. It provided the statistic that "less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women, but
85% of the nudes are female" (Guerrilla Girls 1989) and raised the question of whether women have to be
naked to be in a museum. The Guerilla Girls are still active and continue to use playful campaigns to raise
awareness about feminist issues.

women's objectification and lack of representation in art museums. (credit: "Guerrilla girls" by Ryohei Noda/Flickr,

Environmental Aesthetics
People often think about art in terms of spaces like a museum or gallery, not the great outdoors. Moreover,
some philosophers, like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770 - 1831), draw a sharp distinction between
natural beauty and artistic beauty to assert the superiority of human creation over the natural world. Some art,
however, challenges the elevation of art over nature and uses art to immerse people in nature. There are many
examples of land art in prehistoric and Indigenous cultures--for example, earthworks and mounds made by
pre-Columbian Native Americans. Contemporary land art blurs the distinction between nature and art in ways
that allow one to contemplate the profound effect people have had the natural world and to reorient
themselves to the sublime beauty and grandeur of natural landscapes.

FIGURE 8.9 Sun Tunnels, by American artist Nancy Holt (1938 - 2014) is an art installation of massive concrete
tunnels placed in the Great Basin Desert of Utah. The tunnels are large enough for people to sit inside, and they are
260 8 · Value Theory

       placed so that their openings frame the sun on the horizon during solstices. Holt described the purpose of the art
       installation as bringing "the vast space of the desert back to human scale." (credit: "Nancy Holt, Sun Tunnels,
       1973-1976" by Retis/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
       Land art was an art movement in the 1960s and 1970s that sought to relocate works of art from the
       commercialized spaces of museums and galleries to the natural world. Some examples of land art challenge
       the distinction between the human world and the natural world. The Cuban-American artist Ana Mendieta
       (1948-1985) did an "earth-body" series of works that involved pressing her body into natural landscapes and
       photographing the impressions, as well as still and moving film of her interacting with natural landscapes. Her
       intention was to develop a spiritual connection with the earth using her body. Art can help people think about
       their relationship to the natural world and their responsibility for the environment.
       At times, works of art have also served as environmental interventions. For example, in her 2020 art project
       The Distant Is Imminent, American photographer Camille Seaman (b. 1969) projected images of melting
       icebergs from Antarctica and the Artic onto buildings in cities that will be affected by the rising sea level. The
       projections showed the estimated water line for 2050, which allowed spectators to envision their surroundings
       swallowed by the ocean due to climate change. These works of art are meant to create more than an aesthetic
       experience--they are calls to collective action and change.
       Everyday Aesthetics
       While many approaches to aesthetics focus on works of art and artistic creations, you can find aesthetically
       significant objects, experiences, and practices all around you. Everyday aesthetics asserts the prevalence of
       aesthetically meaningful experiences in one's ordinary day-to-day life--for example, listening to the rain fall on
       a roof, admiring the pattern of leaves on the ground, and even choosing what shirt to wear or how to decorate
       your living spaces.

       FIGURE 8.10 Everyday aesthetics calls attention to the aesthetically meaningful experiences in day-to-day life.
       (credit: "Tall Grass" by Tom Shockey/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
       Japanese aesthetics is a rich source of inspiration for everyday aesthetics. Japanese aesthetics often
       incorporates Zen Buddhism to encourage mindful attention to the beauty of things around us. Additionally,
       Japanese aesthetics focuses on the small and impermanent, such as cherry blossoms and tea ceremonies, as
       opposed to the large-scale grandiose "masterpieces" favored by traditional European aesthetics. As Japanese
       scholar Okakura Kakuzo (1863 - 1913) explains in The Book of Tea, Japanese tea ceremonies are "founded on
       the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence" (Kakuzo [1906] 1956, 3). In
       Japanese culture, everyday aesthetic practices are a moral and religious form of self-cultivation.

Japanese aesthetics and environmental aesthetics together to address the moral dimensions of aesthetics and
its impact on the world. She explains that everyday aesthetics decenters works of art in ways that broaden
people's discussions and help them understand the way questions of taste and beauty enrich their lives and
impact the environment (Saito 2007). By focusing on the many aesthetic dimensions of life, people can
examine what they value.

         WRITE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

Write a short essay (2-3 paragraphs) addressing the following: What in your everyday life do you consider to be
aesthetically meaningful? Describe why you think of it as aesthetic. How is it different from a work of art that you
might encounter in a museum or gallery? How is it similar?

Value theory gives people tools for identifying, formulating, and questioning the values that are important to
them as individuals and as a society. Even if you never take another philosophy course, you can use these ideas
to think about your choices in life, what you desire or find pleasurable and good, and how you define well-being
or a just society.

Summary

8.1 The Fact-Value Distinction

The fact-value distinction distinguishes between what is the case (facts) and what we think ought to be the case
(values) based on beliefs about what is good, beautiful, important, etc. Descriptive claims are statements about
matters of fact, whereas evaluative claims express a judgment about something's value. Descriptive claims
make statements about how the world is. Evaluative claims make statements about how the world ought to be.

The naturalistic fallacy is an error in reasoning that assumes we can derive values (what we ought to do) from
facts about the world (what is the case). The is-ought problem asserts the challenge of moving from statements
of fact (something is) to statements of value (something ought to be).

Moral realists argue for a more objective concept of morality. They feel that there are certain moral facts about
the world that are objectively true. Moral skeptics, on the other hand, argue against an objective basis for
morality by emphasizing that moral values are not factual and involve a different mode of thinking that is
distinct from logical or scientific reasoning.

8.2 Basic Questions about Values

Something has intrinsic value if it is valuable for its own sake. Something has extrinsic value if it is valuable for
the sake of something else. The question of fundamentality is the question of whether there is only one
intrinsic value or many. Monism argues that there is only one fundamental intrinsic value that forms the
foundation for all other values. Pluralism argues that there are multiple fundamental intrinsic values, rather
than one.

Pluralism frequently relies on the concept of incommensurability, which describes a situation in which two or
more goods, values, or phenomena have no standard of evaluation that applies to them all. Moral relativism
makes a larger claim than pluralism because it not only asserts that there are multiple moral frameworks, it
also asserts that each framework is equally valid insofar as individuals, communities, and cultures determine
what is moral.

8.3 Metaethics

Metaethics focuses on moral reasoning and foundational questions that explore the assumptions related to our
moral beliefs and practice. Realism asserts that ethical values have some basis in reality and that reasoning
about ethical matters requires an objective framework or foundation to discover what is truly good. Anti-
realism asserts that ethical values are not based on objective facts about the world but instead rely on
subjective foundations like individuals' desires and beliefs.

Different ethical frameworks rest on different foundations or justifications: some appeal to a non-human
principles like nature, while others appeal to shared human institutions. Ethical frameworks that are based on
God can function in a variety of ways depending on the concept of the divine. Augustine of Hippo argued that
there are many things in life we claim to know that are actually based on faith. The Euthyphro problem asks
whether something is good because God commands it or if God commands it because it is good. According to
Thomas Aquinas, there are four types of laws: eternal, natural, human, and divine. Ethical naturalism argues
that doing good actions fulfills human nature, while doing evil actions distorts it.

8.4 Well-Being

Well-being focuses on what is good for a person, not simply what is good in an abstract sense.

There are three general ways philosophers approach the value of well-being: (1) pleasure, (2) desire, and (3)
objective goods. Some philosophers describe well-being as obtaining pleasure and avoiding pain. The general
term for this approach is hedonism. Epicurus founded a school of philosophy called Epicureanism, which
taught that pleasure is the highest good. Utilitarianism is considered hedonistic because it bases moral theory
on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. Critics of hedonistic philosophies complain that pleasure is too

varied, indeterminate, subjective, and conditional to be a solid basis for ethics.

Another way to think of well-being is the satisfaction of desire. There are multiple ways to define desire and
think about its satisfaction. Cognitivism argues that values are cognitive and express statements about
properties of things or states of events. Non-cognitivism argues that values are not cognitive because they have
more to do with a psychological state of mind. Another approach to well-being is to create lists of objective
goods that contribute to a flourishing life. Philosophers who propose that there are objective goods frequently
focus on knowledge, virtue, friendship, and perfection as ways to evaluate and understand well-being.

8.5 Aesthetics

Aesthetics is an area of value theory that examines how we evaluate works of art and other aesthetic
experiences in nature and our everyday lives. For ancient philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus,
beauty is a quality of an object. In contrast, Enlightenment philosophers argue that beauty is a subjective
judgment. Aesthetic theory also examines how we make judgments about art. Studying aesthetics can lay bare
what societies value, how they express that value, and who gets to create values.

9.2 Consequentialism
9.3 Deontology
9.4 Virtue Ethics
9.5 Daoism
9.6 Feminist Theories of Ethics

INTRODUCTION How do you decide what to do when you face a difficult moral dilemma? When you are
unsure what is right in a situation, what do you rely on, if anything, to guide you so you can do the right thing?
Say, for example, you have borrowed a friend's car. You want to fill the gas tank before returning the car, but
you don't know what fuel the car uses. You are in a hurry and can't reach your friend on the phone. What do you
do? Do you return the car without filling it up? Do you take a wild guess or ask a person at the gas station and
hope the fuel you pick doesn't damage the engine?
What you might need is a good normative moral theory. Normative ethics focuses on establishing norms and
standards of moral conduct for effectively guiding our behavior. A normative moral theory is a systematized
270 9 · Normative Moral Theory

       account of morality that addresses important questions related to effectively guiding moral conduct. By the
       end of this chapter, you will be able to apply different types of normative moral theories to help guide your
       decisions at gas stations and elsewhere.

     9.1 Requirements of a Normative Moral Theory

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the meaning and purpose of normative moral theory.
         · Distinguish between the three areas of ethics.

       This section focuses on the how normative moral theories relate to other branches of ethics, examines the
       requirements of normative moral theories, and introduces three major types of moral theories.

      Three Areas of Ethics

       Ethics is the field of philosophy that investigates morality and engages in "systematizing, defending, and
       recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior" (Fieser 1995). It is divided into three main
       areas--metaethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics--each of which is distinguished by a different level of
       inquiry and analysis.

       Metaethics focuses on moral reasoning and "whether morality exists" (Dittmer 1995). It is concerned with
       questions that are more abstract, ones that explore the foundations and assumptions related to our moral
       beliefs and practice. It attempts to understand the beliefs and presuppositions connected to morality and
       moral deliberation. Metaethics explores, for example, where moral values originate, what it means to say
       something is right or good, whether there are any objective moral facts, whether morality is (culturally)
       relative, and the psychological basis for moral practices and values.

       Normative ethics focuses on moral behavior, on what we should do. It thus deals with questions concerning
       human agency, responsibility, and moral evaluation. Normative ethics attempts to establish criteria or
       principles for identifying norms and standards to guide correct behavior. Philosophers offer systematized
       accounts of morality that provide standards and norms of right conduct. There are three main approaches to
       normative moral theory: consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics. Each approach differs based on the
       criterion (consequences, duty, or character) used for determining moral conduct.

       Applied ethics focuses on the application of moral norms and principles to controversial issues to determine
       the rightness of specific actions. Issues like abortion, euthanasia, the use of humans in biomedical research,
       and artificial intelligence are just a few of the controversial moral issues explored in applied ethics, which is
       covered in the next chapter.

       A normative moral theory provides a framework for understanding our actions and determining what's right.
       A fully worked out moral theory often addresses all three areas of ethics (metaethics, normative ethics, and
       applied ethics), but its aim will be establishing and defending the norms of conduct it recommends.

      Three Coherent Frameworks for Understanding Morality

       A moral theory should make it possible to effectively guide behavior by providing a framework for determining
       what is morally right and arguments justifying its recommendations. Such a framework must be based on a
       logical foundation for its principles and provide consistent recommendations. It should, in short, make sense.

       This chapter examines three distinct moral framework approaches to normative ethics: consequentialist,
       deontological, and virtue. Consequentialism looks at an action's outcome or consequences to determine
       whether it is morally right. Consequentialists think an action is right when it produces the greatest good (e.g.,
       happiness or general welfare). Deontology focuses on duties or rules to determine the rightness of an action.
       Deontologists argue that an action is right when it conforms to the correct rule or duty (e.g., it is always wrong
       to lie). Virtue ethics focuses on character and the development of the right habits or traits. Virtue ethicists

argue that right action flows from right character. These three main approaches are distinguished by the
criterion (i.e., consequences, duty, or character) used for determining moral conduct.

9.2 Consequentialism

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the meaning and purpose of the consequentialist approach.
  · Summarize Mohist and utilitarian interpretations of consequentialism.
Most people make at least some decisions based on the likely consequences of their actions. You might, for
example, appeal to costs and benefits to justify a decision. For example, you might consider the happiness your
friend will feel when discovering that you've filled the gas tank (a benefit) and weigh that against the price of a
tank of gas (cost). In doing so, you are analyzing consequences to yourself and to your friend.
Consequentialists, however, ask you to take a wider view. In consequentialism, an action is right when it
produces the greatest good for everyone. An agent is tasked with assessing possible consequences to
determine which action will maximize good for all those who might be impacted. This section looks at two
consequentialist approaches, Mohism and utilitarianism.

Mohism

FIGURE 9.2 The Warring States period (ca. 475-221 BCE) saw intense warfare as older states located along the
Yellow River declined and Qin, Qi, and Chu rose until Qin conquered the others in 221 BCE and established an
imperial government. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The Warring States period in ancient China (ca. 475-221 BCE) was a period of widespread social unrest and
discord, one characterized by warfare, suffering, and a fractured society. Thinkers in ancient China responded
by exploring ways to unite people and discover (or rediscover) moral norms and standards that would promote
272 9 · Normative Moral Theory

       a better life and social harmony. Philosophies like Mohism, Confucianism, and Daoism were developed,
       making it a period marked by intellectual and cultural expansion. These philosophies, while different in
       important respects, are similar in that each is born as a response to the social disharmony and widespread
       suffering experienced during the Warring States period. Each one shows a desire to facilitate and foster change
       in order to overcome social challenges and improve the lives of the people.

       Very little is known about the founder of Mohism, Mo Di or Mozi (ca. 430 BCE). He lived around the time of
       Confucius (ca. 479 BCE), the founder of Confucianism, and Laozi, the founder of Daoism. Mozi, like Confucius
       and Laozi, was considered a great teacher. He and early Mohists sought to establish rational, objective
       standards for evaluating actions and establishing ethical norms.

       Four Concepts of Mohist Ethical Theory

       Four interrelated concepts are at the heart of Mohist ethical theory: morality, benefit, benevolence, and care.
       Morality (yi) is determined by benefit (li), which shapes how we understand our duties and define what is right.
       Benefit (li) is defined loosely as a set of material and social goods, including virtues and practices that
       strengthen social order. Benefit, in turn, rested on the concept of benevolence or kindness (rèn), which
       requires that we look outside our own interests and treat others with care (ài). Practicing kindness is crucial
       for promoting social order and fair treatment. Mohists believed that we are more likely to achieve social
       stability and general welfare when we focus not simply on ourselves, but the betterment of others and the
       community.

       Mohists thought ethical norms should be established by looking at what increases overall benefit. To this end,
       Mozi argued that we should promote the immediate welfare of individuals and consider the welfare of all when
       acting. If people are suffering or in need now, it makes sense, Mozi thought, to address those issues first.
       As the theory developed, Mohists also came to associate benefit with happiness or delight (x). However, most
       essential to Mohism is the value of impartial care of all, or universal love. They thought we should treat
       everyone impartially and that we shouldn't give preference to some people's welfare over others. Mohists
       opposed the rulers and elites during the Warring States period who had focused only on their own pleasure
       and gain to the detriment of everyone else.

       Normative Practices: The Ten Doctrines

       There are ten doctrines that form the core of early Mohism. These ten doctrines correspond to Mozi's original
       work, and they were treated as central even by later Mohists who developed and expanded upon early Mohist
       thinking. The ten doctrines are normally split into five pairs as follows:

        1. "Promoting the Worthy" and "Identifying Upward"
        2. "Inclusive Care" and "Condemning Aggression"
        3. "Moderation in Use" and "Moderation in Burial"
        4. "Heaven's Intent" and "Understanding Ghosts"
        5. "Condemning Music" and "Condemning Fatalism"

       The "Promoting the Worthy" and "Identifying Upward" doctrines highlight the Mohists' concern for a
       meritocratic system. They believed that an individual should be appointed to a position based on their
       performance and moral goodness. These officials should serve as models to all. Mohists assumed that people
       are motivated to act in ways that conform to their beliefs about what is right. They therefore believed that
       people needed proper moral education informed by rational, objective moral standards. Once people possess
       the proper knowledge, they conform their behavior accordingly. This, in turn, would address the social
       upheaval and disharmony that plagued their world. Mozi realized that if people adopt the same morality, they
       will use the same standards to judge their own actions and the actions of others, which will improve social
       order and harmony.

       The "Inclusive Care" and "Condemning Aggression" doctrines affirm the importance of considering and caring

for everyone equally. They reinforce the idea that it is not just the individual's own benefit that matters, but the
benefit of all people. Mohists therefore condemn aggression because others are harmed in the pursuit of
personal benefit. During a period in which warlord battled against warlord, Mohists condemned these
attempts at military conquest as selfishly immoral.

Mohists promoted the practices of "Moderation in Use" and "Moderation in Burial." They rejected lavish
funerals, customs, and practices that were wasteful. Resources should be used to the benefit of individuals and
society. They viewed excessive displays of wealth that only benefit the few as selfish.

Mohists use the ideas of "Heaven's Intent" and "Understanding Ghosts" to argue that there is an objective
moral world order that individuals and society should hasten to emulate. Heaven acts as their principal
standard for evaluating and understanding our moral responsibilities.

Early Mohists, in particular, also saw heaven as way to motivate individuals to act selflessly, as moral deeds
would be rewarded, whereas immoral ones would be punished. Later, however, Mohists seemed to abandon or
at least put less emphasis on this appeal to heaven to justify ethical norms and principles, favoring a greater
emphasis on rational argumentation.

Finally, Mohists promoted the norms of "Condemning Music" and "Condemning Fatalism." The Mohist views
on music stemmed from their condemnation of the powerful for being wasteful when they enjoyed lavish
displays and luxuries. They felt those with wealth had a responsibility to others and should behave morally.

Mohists also believed in social mobility, such that capable, moral individuals should rise. Their support of
meritocracy further underscores a belief that the individual has the power to change, to direct their own life,
and to determine their own path. The Mohists condemn fatalism because it suggests that human effort is futile
and undermines Mohist goals of achieving social order and a large and economically thriving population.
Mohists believed that our lot in life is not set in stone, nor does fate determine our path (Fraser 2020).

Utilitarianism

The term utility means "useful" or "a useful thing." Utilitarians argue that what is right is whatever produces
the most utility, the most usefulness. The question, then, is how do we define usefulness? The utilitarian's
answer is that something is useful when it promotes happiness (or pleasure). According to utilitarians, we have
a moral obligation or responsibility to choose the action that produces the most happiness.

Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill

Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) was the first philosopher to articulate the principle of utility. James Mill
(1773-1836), an economist, political philosopher, and historian, was Bentham's friend and a follower of
utilitarianism. James Mill naturally raised his son to be a utilitarian as well. John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)
received a rigorous homeschooling under his father's tutelage. Scholars in the fields of philosophy, political
science, and economics continue to apply the insights of Bentham and Mill to this day.

       Bentham. Line engraving by C. Fox, 1838, after H. W. Pickersgill." by C. Fox/Wellcome Collection)
       The Principle of Utility
       The principle of utility states that "actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong
       as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness" (Mill [1861] 2001, 7). Utilitarians argue that moral conduct is
       conduct that maximizes the good (or produces the most value). In economics, for example, utility is defined as
       the amount of enjoyment a consumer receives from a good or a service. You might, for example, choose
       between buying an oatmeal raisin cookie and a chocolate chip cookie. If you like them both equally, the right
       action would be to compare the prices and buy the cheaper one. Utility, however, is not always so easy to
       determine, particularly in more complex situations.

           CONNECTIONS

       The chapter on Value Theory covers the topic of well-being in greater detail.
       The Trolley Problem
       Trolley problems are classic thought experiments first invented by Philippa Foot and widely employed by
       ethicists to explore moral reasoning (Foot 2002). Consider one such trolley problem, referred to as the
       bystander case. Imagine you are standing by trolley tracks observing the trolley cars in action. To your horror,
       you realize that one of the trolley cars is out of control. If nothing is done, the trolley will continue down the
       track, killing five workers who are performing track maintenance. You happen to be standing near a lever you
       can pull that will divert the trolley. If you divert the trolley, you will change its path so that it takes a different
       track where only one worker is performing maintenance. Is it morally permissible to pull the lever?

reasoning and deliberation. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
The simplest utilitarian response would be "yes." You would save the lives of four workers. The right decision
involves making a simple quantitative calculation: five workers minus one worker is four workers. So the right,
moral decision is to divert the trolley. Yet, John Stuart Mill recognized that not all questions of utility can be
answered quantitatively.
Higher and Lower Pleasures
Raised to continue in the footsteps of Bentham and his father, John Stuart Mill had a nervous breakdown as a
young man. Mill emerged from the crisis with new ideas about utilitarianism, including the realization that
Bentham's characterization of pleasure could be improved upon (Durham 1963). He realized that pleasures
differ both quantitatively and qualitatively. Mill identified what he calls higher and lower pleasures to
distinguish between different qualities of pleasure. With his revised and more nuanced account of pleasure,
Mill set out to develop Bentham's earlier formulation of utilitarianism. He refined the calculus and assigned a
greater significance or preference to higher-quality pleasures (e.g., mental pleasures).
Mill distinguished between different (higher and lower) qualities of pleasure in his formulation of
utilitarianism. What he called higher pleasures are those pleasures associated with the exercise of our higher
faculties. For example, higher pleasures are often associated with the use of our higher cognitive faculties and/
or participation in social/cultural life. Lower pleasures, in contrast, are those pleasures associated with the
exercise of our lower faculties. For example, lower pleasures are (basic) sensory pleasures like those
experienced when we satisfy our hunger or relax after difficult physical activity. As Mill saw it, we have higher
cognitive faculties (e.g., reason, imagination, moral sense) that distinguish us from other living things. Our
higher cognitive faculties give us access to higher pleasures, and these pleasures are a defining feature of
human life.

      It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than
      a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their
      own side of the question. (Mill [1861] 2001, 10)
Mill's claim that "it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied" suggests that it is better to be
dissatisfied and aware that you are capable of experiencing different qualities of pleasure than to forfeit the
higher pleasures merely for the sake of basic satisfaction.
Some Mill scholars have even suggested that our dissatisfaction is a potential source of higher pleasures. In
Mill and Edward on Higher Pleasures, Susan Feagin (1983) points out that dissatisfaction stems from a
recognition that our situation could be improved. Feagin argues that our ability to formulate plans to improve
our situation is a source of higher pleasure. Dissatisfaction motivates us to improve things and pursue a better
world and life.

       The Greatest Happiness Principle

       To apply the principle of utility in broad social and political contexts, Mill formulated the greatest happiness
       principle, which stipulates that those actions are right that produce the greatest happiness for the greatest
       number of people. When agents (individual decision makers) approach a decision, they review and evaluate
       their possible actions and should choose the action that will promote the most happiness for the most people.
       It is not simply the agent's own happiness that matters, but the happiness of all individuals involved or affected
       by the consequences produced. The "happiness which forms the utilitarian standard of what is right in
       conduct is not the agent's own happiness but that of all concerned" (Mill [1861] 2001, 17). Mill argued that the
       right action is the one that maximizes happiness or produces the most net happiness.

       Mill emphasizes the importance of putting personal interests aside. Mill writes that if an individual is faced
       with a decision "between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly
       impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator" (Mill [1861] 2001, 17). Impartiality makes us able to
       assess possible consequences without giving preference to how they might impact us or those we are biased
       toward (e.g., friends, family, or institutions we are affiliated with). Utilitarians, therefore, strive to apply the
       principle in an informed, rational, and unbiased way.

                WRITE LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

      A Utilitarian Approach

       Choose a moral dilemma you are facing or that you have faced. Devise and implement a method of calculating the
       greatest happiness, such as identifying all the individuals affected by your decision and estimating the impact of
       your decision on their happiness. Then examine and explain the assumptions that are inherent in the method you
       are using to calculate happiness.

       Act vs. Rule Utilitarianism

       Within this moral theory, there is a major division between act and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarians argue
       that we should apply the greatest happiness principle on a case-by-case basis. Factors may vary from one
       situation to the next making it possible that different actions are morally right even in two seemingly similar
       situations. Act utilitarians believe morality requires us to maximize the good every time we act.

       Some have argued that act utilitarianism is problematic because it seems to justify doing actions that go well
       beyond ordinary moral standards. For instance, act utilitarianism could justify a vigilante killing a person, an
       action that is contrary to our normal sense of right conduct, if it saves lives and so maximizes happiness.
       However, if many people were to take the law into their own hands, the long-term consequence would be to
       undermine the security of all individuals within society. Consider also the case in which a jury or a judge were
       to find an innocent person guilty and sentence them to prison in order to avoid widespread riots. In this
       particular case, such an act would increase happiness but reduce the overall level of trust in the judicial
       system.

       To avoid such problems, rule utilitarians argue that we should apply the greatest happiness principle not to
       each act, but instead as a means of establishing a set of moral rules. We can test possible moral rules to
       determine whether a given rule would produce greater happiness if it were followed. Assuming the rules pass
       the test, they argue that following such rules will maximize happiness and should be followed. Rule utilitarians
       think this list of rules can be modified as needed by reexamining each one through application of the greatest
       happiness principle. However, it is not easy and may not be possible to formulate all the exceptions to each
       rule.

       Character and Intent in Utilitarianism

       For utilitarians, the only intrinsic value is happiness. Utilitarians believe that no action in itself is right or

wrong, nor is it right or wrong based on an agent's character or intent. Only the scope of consequences should
be considered when assessing the rightness of an action. An agent might intend to produce certain
consequences when they act, but what they intend may not come about or their action might produce other
unintended consequences. If an action produces consequences a person didn't intend or foresee and so does
harm, they are still morally at fault, even if at the time it seemed reasonable to assume those outcomes
wouldn't happen. For utilitarians, an agent's intent and character are not morally relevant factors. In this,
utilitarianism differs from the other normative ethical theories that will be considered in the remainder of this
chapter.

9.3 Deontology

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the meaning and purpose of the deontological approach.
  · Articulate the role of duty and obligation within deontological reasoning.
  · Compare and contrast the Kantian and pluralist interpretation of deontology.

The word deontology derives from the Greek words deon, meaning duty, and logos, meaning the study or
science of, so that deontology literally means "the study or science of duty." Unlike consequentialists,
deontologists do not evaluate the moral rightness of an action based solely on its consequences. Rightness in
deontological theories is established by conformity to moral norms or rules that we have a duty to follow
(Alexander 2020). Deontologists attempt to establish our moral duties, the set of rules that are morally binding,
and using these we can guide our behavior and choices.

Later deontologists--for instance, W. D. Ross (1877-1971)--argue that consequences are morally relevant when
considered in light of our moral duties. Ross believed that a moral theory that ignored duty or a moral theory
that ignored consequences "over-simplifies the moral life" (Ross 1939, 189).

Kantian Formulation

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is one of the most important figures in modern philosophy. The first philosopher
to advance a deontological approach, he has influenced contemporary philosophy significantly in areas such
as aesthetics, political philosophy, and ethics.

Good Will

Kant argued that when we focus on outcomes rather than our duty, we prefer something of merely conditional
value--beneficial outcomes--over the only thing that has unconditional value--good will, a concept that for
Kant meant the decision to carry out our moral duties. Kant establishes the unconditional value of good will.

      A good will is good not because of what it effects, or accomplishes, not because of its fitness to attain
      some intended end, but good just by its willing, i.e. in itself; and, considered by itself, is to be
      esteemed beyond compare much higher than anything that could ever be brought about by it in favor
      of some inclination. (Kant 1997a, 4:394)

When we perform an action because it is our duty (or from duty), without influence from outside, merely
conditional factors, we act in a way that contributes to the goodness of our will.

Human Reason and Morality

Kant's normative moral theory rests on how he defines what it means to be human. Kant argued that what
separated us from other animals is our ability to think rationally. Animals are driven by impulses and so are
irrational. As humans, however, we can reason, make decision independent of our desires, and so exercise
agency. We can rise above animal instincts. In this sense, humans have freedom and free will. Kant used the
term "good will" to refer to our will to rise above our passions and biases and act rationally
278 9 · Normative Moral Theory

       Furthermore, through our capacity to act rationally and so exercise "good will," we establish our value above all
       other (living) things. At the same time, we have a duty to act rationally--which, in Kant's view, is to act morally.
       We should always act rationally because it is only through rational, moral action that we realize our freedom
       and affirm our worth and dignity.

       FIGURE 9.5 "Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and reverence, the more often and
       more steadily one reflects on them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me" (Kant 1997a, 5:161).
       (credit: "The Milky Way" by Erick Kurniawan/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
       Moral Laws
       Kant believed that moral laws, or maxims, could be discovered a priori. No matter what religion we follow or
       culture we grew up in, we can use our reason to figure out what is right and what is wrong. We use our reason
       alone to arrive at the moral rules by which we should abide.
       In Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals ([1785] 1997, 4:415-416), Kant set out to explore these moral laws
       by first examining common-sense morality--that is, ideas that most people share about morality, such as do
       not steal or do not murder. The will, Kant noted, always presents its rules in the form of commands, which he
       called imperatives. He divided these imperatives into two categories: hypothetical and categorical.
       Hypothetical Imperatives
       A hypothetical imperative "says only that the action is good for some actual or possible purpose" (Kant 1997a,
       4:414-415). In other words, we may follow rules, such as "study hard," "get a job," and "save money." But each
       of these commands determine only what should be done in order to achieve some (proposed) end. We say
       "study hard to get good grades," "get a job to earn money," and "save money to buy a house for your family."
       Through the hypothetical imperative we establish subjective rules for acting. We use these rules regularly to
       navigate the world, solve problems, and pursue various ends. A hypothetical imperative is thus not a moral
       rule, but a means to achieve a goal--to fulfill a desire.
       Categorical Imperative
       Unlike hypothetical imperatives, categorical imperatives are universal laws that we must obey regardless of
       our desires. Kant writes, "For only the law carries with it the concept of an unconditional and indeed objective
       and hence universally valid necessity, and commands are laws that must be obeyed, i.e. must be complied with
       even contrary to inclination" (Kant 1997a, 4:416). Categorical imperatives are derived by reason and we have a
       moral duty to follow them.
       Kant suggested that we derive categorical imperatives through four formulations that serve as a standard or
       guide to test whether our reasons for acting conform to the standard of rationality and thus moral law. The two

most widely examined formulations are the universal law formulation and the humanity formulation.

The Universal Law Formulation

The universal law formulation of the categorical imperative states: "Act only according to that maxim through
which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law" (Kant 1997a, 4:421). Kant thought the
maxim (or rule for acting) should be able to be made universal in the sense that it is a rule that could bind all
rational beings (e.g., always tell the truth). When we lie, for example, we want to act as an exception to the rule
for reasons other than fulfilling our moral obligation. In such cases, we wish that everyone else abide by the
rule, so that when we lie, we are believed and can operate as an exception to the norm in order to fulfill a
desire. Yet, if everyone lied--that is if we universalized lying--then we would no longer achieve our desired end.
Everyone would lie, and so you would not necessarily be believed.

Say, for example, members of a specific group, such as university students, get discounted rates at a bookstore.
If you, as a nonstudent, tell the bookseller that you are a student even though you are not, you can get the
discounted rate. But once you universalize your action--and all nonstudents begin to lie--the bookseller will
catch on and likely begin to ask for identification. Therefore, the rule you are following, "I can lie to get a
discount," cannot be made universal and is immoral. Moral law must be applicable to all rational beings.

The Humanity Formulation

The humanity formulation focuses on how we ought to treat rational beings, whether oneself or others. Kant
thought that every person possesses the same inherent value and worth because we are all rational beings.
Kant writes, "So act that you use humanity, in your own person as well as in the person of any other, always at
the same time as an end, never merely as a means" (Kant 1997a, 4:429). The humanity formulation therefore
asks us to consider whether our actions treat others and ourselves as ends, as entities valuable in themselves,
or whether we seek to reduce rational beings to the status of a mere means, as valuable only in that they help
us achieve our goal. When we lie to someone, we fail to treat them as a person. We have obstructed their ability
to act as a human, as a rational being that has the ability to rise up above impulses and make decisions based
on reason. By telling a lie, we have failed to provide the basic information another human needs to make a
rational decision. To do so, is always wrong, for it overlooks the inherent value we all possess as rational beings
who possess a will and who are capable of acting as free, rational agents.

Note that Kant is not saying that we cannot rely on other humans to help us achieve a goal. Kant uses the term
"never merely as a means" and so indicates that so long as we treat others as humans, and do not impair their
ability to act as rational agents, we can derive benefit from others. Humans must cooperate, but in doing so,
should treat each other as ends-in-themselves, as rational beings.

Notice that we can arrive at the same imperative from either the universal law formulation or the humanity
formulation. If you lie to the bookseller about being a student, you are treating the bookseller as a means to an
end. Indeed, scholars often view Kant's four formulations as different means to achieving the same ends--that
is, different ways of arriving at the same or a similar list of categorical imperatives.

Pluralism

Some philosophers argue that classic utilitarianism (e.g., Mill) and deontology (e.g., Kant) offer accounts of
morality that do not adequately explain our common experience of morality in practice. Do we, like Mill, really
think that morality is all about increasing happiness? Do we, like Kant, really treat all moral rules as absolute
and always binding? Deontology and utilitarianism seem to offer an overly simplistic account of what is good.

Pluralists offer a more complex, complete account of morality that explains our common experience. In
contrast to classic utilitarianism and deontology, pluralism recognizes a plurality of intrinsic values and moral
rules.
280 9 · Normative Moral Theory

       William David Ross
       Sir William David Ross (1877-1971) believed (classic) utilitarianism and deontology fail because they "over-
       simplify the moral life" (Ross 1939, 189). He thought each of these earlier moral theories reduced morality to a
       single principle (e.g., Mill's greatest happiness principle and Kant's categorical imperative), leaving them
       unable to adequately account for our common experience of morality. Ross also thought Mill was wrong to
       assume that rightness is reducible to simply the production of good, just as Kant was wrong to assume that
       moral rules are absolute and never admit any exceptions. Ross therefore set out to create a moral theory that
       was not susceptible to the shortfalls of these earlier positions, one that would make sense of our common
       sense moral life (Skelton 2012).
       Competing Duties
       Pluralists point out that most people do not treat moral obligations as equally weighty or pressing. Doing so
       would make it difficult, if not impossible, to determine our moral duty in situations where two or more
       competing moral obligations are applicable. Let's say you are approached by a woman carrying a gun who asks
       you what direction your neighbor ran off in. You know in what direction he was headed. Do you follow Kantian
       moral law not to tell a lie? What if she intends to use her gun on your neighbor? Do you potentially risk your
       neighbor's life? This example and others suggest that we must consider factors beyond the (relevant) moral
       rule or weigh more than one rule when we determine our duty in a specific situation. For example, the rule
       "don't lie" might compete with the rule "don't take actions that will get innocent people killed."
       Prima Facie Duties
       Ross argued that our obligations are not absolute and derived from pure reason, as Kant would have it, but
       rather are prima facie duties (Ross 1930, 33). He called them prima facie, which means "at first sight,"
       because he believed these duties to be self-evident. They are moral commitments that we come to recognize
       through experience and maturity.
       Ross identified five prima facie duties that represent our main moral commitments: (1) a duty of fidelity, or to
       keep promises and be truthful; (2) a duty of reparation, or to make up for wrongs done to others; (3) a duty of
       gratitude, or to express gratitude when others do things that benefit us and to reciprocate when possible; (4) a
       duty to promote a maximum of aggregate good, or to increase the overall good in the world; and (5) a duty of
       non-maleficence, or to not harm others (Ross 1930, 21, 25; Ross 1939, 65, 75, 76; Skelton 2012).
       Ross believed each duty each represents an important moral commitment, but they are not absolute or equally
       important. He thought our duties of gratitude and reparation, for example, are generally more pressing than
       our duty to promote a maximum aggregate of good, and a duty of non-maleficence is weightier than a duty to
       promote maximum good (Ross 1930, 19, 21, 22, 41, 42; Ross 1939, 75, 76, 77, 90).
       Resolving Conflicts between Duties
       Our prima facie duties represent our moral responsibilities and commitments, other things being equal. In
       situations where two or more prima facie duties are relevant and our actual duty is not clear, Ross argued that
       we determine our duty using a quasi-consequentialist approach that accounts for a plurality of intrinsic goods.
       When we face such situations, Ross argued that our duty is whatever action will result in "the greatest balance
       of prima facie rightness . . . over . . . prima facie wrongness" (Ross 1930, 41, 46).

FIGURE 9.6 If you are the only witness to a bad car accident on your way to get your hair cut, William David Ross
would argue that you might judge that your prima facie duty to help anyone who might be injured in the accident
outweighs your prima facie duty to be on time for your appointment. (credit: "car accident @ vestavia hills" by Rian
Castillo/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
In life, it is not always clear what morality requires of us, especially when we face situations where we have
multiple, conflicting moral responsibilities and must figure out which one is our (actual) duty. In other words,
our actual duty will be whichever duty is most pressing and immediate, the one that we are most responsible
for (Ross 1939, 85).
Imagine, for example, that you make a promise to meet a friend after work. As you leave your office building
after work, however, you discover a coworker on the ground who is experiencing chest pains. You have a duty
to keep your promise, but you also have a duty to help your coworker. You help your coworker because, given
the circumstances, it is more pressing than the duty to fulfill your promise. It is clear which obligation is your
actual duty in this example. When you are able to, you apologize to your friend and explain what happened.
Your apology, Ross thought, is in part motivated by a recognition that you were prima facie wrong; that is, you
recognize that had your coworker not needed help, your actual duty would have been to fulfill your promise
and meet your friend.
The Role of Judgment
Judgment, Ross thought, plays an important role in moral life. We will often need to determine our actual duty
in situations where multiple contradictory prima facie duties are relevant. Ross thought we rank the relevant
prima facie duties and use facts of the situation to determine which duty is our actual duty.
In the case in which you are approached by a woman with a gun who seems to be chasing your neighbor, your
duty to protect your neighbor from harm probably outweighs your duty to tell the truth. But what if the woman
is wearing a blue uniform and wearing a badge indicating that she is a police officer? What if you know that you
watched your neighbor carry a carload of computers, televisions, expensive jewelry, and nice paintings into his
apartment last night? In this case, to make the best decision, you must make a judgement informed by your
own experience and observations.
In practice, it can be difficult to know what our actual duty is in a situation. Sometimes, the best we can do is
make an informed decision using the information we have and keep striving to be good. Indeed, this
uncertainty can, for pluralists, be an important part of the experience of a moral life.

     9.4 Virtue Ethics

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the central principles of virtue ethics.
         · Distinguish the major features of Confucianism.
         · Evaluate Aristotle's moral theory.
       Virtue ethics takes a character-centered approach to morality. Whereas Mohists and utilitarians look to
       consequences to determine the rightness of an action and deontologists maintain that a right action is the one
       that conforms to moral rules and norms, virtue ethicists argue that right action flows from good character
       traits or dispositions. We become a good person, then, through the cultivation of character, self-reflection, and
       self-perfection.
       There is often a connection between the virtuous life and the good life in virtue ethics because of its emphasis
       on character and self-cultivation. Through virtuous development, we realize and perfect ourselves, laying the
       foundation for a good life. In Justice as a Virtue, for example, Mark LeBar (2020) notes that "on the Greek
       eudaimonist views (including here Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and Epicurus) our reasons for action arise from
       our interest in [eudaimonia, or] a happy life." The ancient Greeks thought the aim of life was eudaimonia.
       Though eudaimonia is often translated as "happiness," it means something closer to "a flourishing life."
       Confucianism, with its strong emphasis on repairing the fractured social world, connects the promotion of
       virtuous development and social order. Confucians believe virtuous action is informed by social roles and
       relationships, such that promoting virtuous development also promotes social order.

      Confucianism

       As discussed earlier, the Warring States period in ancient China (ca. 475-221 BCE) was a period marked by
       warfare, social unrest, and suffering. Warfare during this period was common because China was comprised of
       small states that were not politically unified. New philosophical approaches were developed to promote social
       harmony, peace, and a better life. This period in China's history is also sometimes referred to as the era of the
       "Hundred Schools of Thought" because the development of new philosophical approaches led to cultural
       expansion and intellectual development. Mohism, Daoism, and Confucianism developed in ancient China
       during this period. Daoism and Confucianism would later spread to Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, where they
       would be adopted and changed in response to local social and cultural circumstances.
       Confucius
       Confucius (551-479 BCE) rose from lowly positions to become a minister in the government of a province in
       eastern China. After a political conflict with the hereditary aristocracy, Confucius resigned his position and
       began traveling to other kingdoms and teaching. Confucius's teachings centered on virtue, veering into
       practical subjects such as social obligations, ritual performance, and governance. During his lifetime,
       Confucius despaired that his advice to rulers fell on deaf ears: "How can I be like a bitter gourd that hangs from
       the end of a string and can not be eaten?" (Analects 17:7). He did not foresee that his work and ideas would
       influence society, politics, and culture in East Asia for over 2000 years.

FIGURE 9.7 This statue of Confucius, the largest in the world, stands at the Yushima Seido, a Confucian temple in
Japan. (credit: "Confucius Statue at the Yushima Seido" by Abasaa/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
Confucius is credited with authoring or editing the classical texts that became the curriculum of the imperial
exams, which applicants had to pass to obtain positions in government. His words, sayings, and exchanges
with rulers and his disciples were written down and recorded in the Lun Yu, or the Analects of Confucius,
which has heavily influenced the moral and social practice in China and elsewhere.
Relational Aspect of Virtue
Like Mohism, Confucianism aimed to restore social order and harmony by establishing moral and social
norms. Confucius believed the way to achieve this was through an ordered, hierarchical society in which
people know their place in relationship to other people. Confucius said, "There is government, when the prince
is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son" (Analects, 7:11). In
Confucianism, relationships and social roles shape moral responsibilities and structure moral life.
A cornerstone of Confucian virtue is filial piety. Confucius felt that the role of the father was to care for and
educate his son, but the duty of the son must be to respect his father by obediently abiding by his wishes.
"While a man's father is alive, look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his conduct. If for
three years he does not alter from the way of his father, he may be called filial" (Analects, 1:11). Indeed, when
the Duke of Sheh informed Confucius that his subjects were so truthful that if their father stole a sheep, they
would bear witness to it, Confucius replied, "Among us, in our part of the country, those who are upright are
different from this. The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the
father. Uprightness is to be found in this." The devotion of the son to the father is more important than what
Kant would call the universal moral law of truth telling.
There is therefore an important relational aspect of virtue that a moral person must understand. The virtuous
person must not only be aware of and care for others but must understand the "human dance," or the complex
practices and relationships that we participate in and that define social life (Wong 2021). The more we begin to
understand the "human dance," the more we grasp how we relate to one another and how social roles and
relationships must be accounted for to act virtuously.

       Ritual and Ren
       Important to both early and late Confucian ethics is the concept of li (ritual and practice). Li plays an important
       role in the transformation of character. These rituals are a guide or become a means by which we develop and
       start to understand our moral responsibilities. Sacrificial offerings to parents and other ancestors after their
       death, for example, cultivate filial piety. By carrying out rituals, we transform our character and become more
       sensitive to the complexities of human interaction and social life.
       In later Confucian thought, the concept of li takes on a broader role and denotes the customs and practices that
       are a blueprint for many kinds of respectful behavior (Wong 2021). In this way, it relates to ren, a concept that
       refers to someone with complete virtue or specific virtues needed to achieve moral excellence. Confucians
       maintain that it is possible to perfect human nature through personal development and transformation. They
       believe society will improve if people abide by moral and social norms and focus on perfecting themselves.
       The aim is to live according to the dao. The word dao means "way" in the sense of a road or path of virtue.
       Junzi and Self-Perfection
       Confucius used the term junzi to refer to an exemplary figure who lives according to the dao. This figure is an
       ethical ideal that reminds us that self-perfection can be achieved through practice, self-transformation, and a
       deep understanding of social relationships and norms. A junzi knows what is right and chooses it, taking into
       account social roles and norms, while serving as a role model. Whenever we act, our actions are observed by
       others. If we act morally and strive to embody the ethical ideal, we can become an example for others to follow,
       someone they can look to and emulate.
       The Ethical Ruler
       Any person of any status can become a junzi. Yet, it was particularly important that rulers strive toward this
       ideal because their subjects would then follow this ideal. When the ruler Chi K'ang consulted with Confucius
       about what to do about the number of thieves in his domain, Confucius responded, "If you, sir, were not
       covetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal" (Analects, 7:18).
       Confucius thought social problems were rooted in the elite's behavior and, in particular, in their pursuit of
       their own benefit to the detriment of the people. Hence, government officials must model personal integrity,
       understand the needs of the communities over which they exercised authority, and place the welfare of the
       people over and above their own (Koller 2007, 204).
       In adherence to the ethical code, a ruler's subjects must show obedience to honorable people and emulate
       those higher up in the social hierarchy. Chi K'ang, responding to Confucius's suggestion regarding thievery,
       asked Confucius, "What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the good of the principled?" Confucius
       replied that there was no need to kill at all. "Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be
       good." Confucius believed that the relationship between rulers and their subjects is and should be like that
       between the wind and the grass. "The grass must bend, when the wind blows across it" (Analects, 7:19).

Japanese Confucianism
Although Confucianism was initially developed in China, it spread to Japan in the mid-sixth century, via Korea,
and developed its own unique attributes. Confucianism is one of the dominant philosophical teachings in
Japan. As in China, Japanese Confucianism focuses on teaching individual perfection and moral development,
fostering harmonious and healthy familial relations, and promoting a functioning and prosperous society. In
Japan, Confucianism has been changed and transformed in response to local social and cultural factors. For
example, Confucianism and Buddhism were introduced around the same time in Japan. It is therefore not
uncommon to find variations of Japanese Confucianism that integrate ideas and beliefs from Buddhism. Some
neo-Confucian philosophers like Zhu Xi, for example, developed "Confucian thinking after earlier study and
practice of Chan Buddhism" (Tucker 2018).

       Aristotle (384-322 BCE) was a preeminent ancient Greek philosopher. He studied with Plato (ca. 429-347 BCE)
       at the Academy, a fraternal organization where participants pursued knowledge and self-development. After
       Plato's death, Aristotle traveled, tutored the boy who would later become Alexander the Great, and among
       other things, established his own place of learning, dedicated to the god Apollo (Shields 2020).

       Aristotle spent his life in the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. His extant works today represent only a
       portion of his total life's work, much of which was lost to history. During his life, Aristotle was, for example,
       principal to the creation of logic, created the first system of classification for animals, and wrote on diverse
       topics of philosophical interest. Along with his teacher, Plato, Aristotle is considered one of the pillars of
       Western philosophy.

       Human Flourishing as the Goal of Human Action

       In the first line of Book I of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, he observes that "[every] art and every inquiry, and
       similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1094a). If
       everything we do aims at some good, he argues, then there must be a final or highest good that is the end of all
       action (life's telos), which is eudaimonia, the flourishing life (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1097a34-b25).
       Everything else we pursue is pursued for the sake of this end.

           CONNECTIONS

       See the chapter on epistemology for more on the topic of eudaimonia.

       Nicomachean Ethics is a practical exploration of the flourishing life and how to live it. Aristotle, like other
       ancient Greek and Roman philosophers (e.g., Plato and the Stoics), asserts that virtuous development is central
       to human flourishing. Virtue (or aretê) means "excellence. We determine something's virtue, Aristotle argued,
       by identifying its peculiar function or purpose because "the good and the `well' is thought to reside in the
       function" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1097b25-1098a15). We might reasonably say, for example, that a knife's
       function is to cut. A sharp knife that cuts extremely well is an excellent (or virtuous) knife. The sharp knife
       realizes its function and embodies excellence (or it is an excellent representation of knife-ness).

       Aristotle assumed our rational capacity makes us distinct from other (living) things. He identifies rationality as
       the unique function of human beings and says that human virtue, or excellence, is therefore realized through
       the development or perfection of reason. For Aristotle, virtuous development is the transformation and
       perfection of character in accordance with reason. While most thinkers (like Aristotle and Kant) assign similar
       significance to reason, it is interesting to note how they arrive at such different theories.

       Deliberation, Practical Wisdom, and Character

       To exercise or possess virtue is to demonstrate excellent character. For ancient Greek and Roman
       philosophers, the pursuit of intentional, directed self-development to cultivate virtues is the pursuit of
       excellence. Someone with a virtuous character is consistent, firm, self-controlled, and well-off. Aristotle
       characterized the virtuous character state as the mean between two vice states, deficiency and excess. He
       thought each person naturally tends toward one of the extreme (or vice) states. We cultivate virtue when we
       bring our character into alignment with the "mean or intermediate state with regard to" feelings and actions,
       and in doing so we become "well off in relation to our feelings and actions" (Homiak 2019).

       Being virtuous requires more than simply developing a habit or character trait. An individual must voluntarily
       choose the right action, the virtuous state; know why they chose it; and do so from a consistent, firm character.
       To voluntarily choose virtue requires reflection, self-awareness, and deliberation. Virtuous actions, Aristotle
       claims, should "accord with the correct reason" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1103b30). The virtuous person

chooses what is right after deliberation that is informed by practical wisdom and experience. Through a
deliberative process we identify the choice that is consistent with the mean state.

The Role of Habit

Aristotle proposed that humans "are made perfect by habit" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1103a10-33). Habit
therefore plays an important role in our virtuous development. When we practice doing what's right, we get
better at choosing the right action in different circumstances. Through habituation we gain practice and
familiarity, we bring about dispositions or tendencies, and we gain the requisite practical experience to
identify the reasons why a certain action should be chosen in diverse situations. Habit, in short, allows us to
gain important practical experience and a certain familiarity with choosing and doing the right thing. The
more we reinforce doing the right thing, the more we grow accustomed to recognizing what's right in different
circumstances. Through habit we become more aware of which action is supported by reason and why, and get
better at choosing it.

Habit and repetition develop dispositions. In Nicomachean Ethics, for example, Aristotle reminds us of the
importance of upbringing. A good upbringing will promote the formation of positive dispositions, making
one's tendencies closer to the mean state. A bad upbringing, in contrast, will promote the formation of negative
dispositions, making one's tendencies farther from the mean state (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1095b5).

Artistotle on Virtue

Read this passage from from Book II of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (https://openstax.org/r/nicomachaen-2),
considering what Aristotle means when he states that moral virtues come about as a result of habit. How should
individuals make use of the two types of virtue to become virtuous?

      Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth
      and its growth to teaching (for which reason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes
      about as a result of habit, whence also its name (ethike) is one that is formed by a slight variation from the
      word ethos (habit). From this it is also plain that none of the moral virtues arises in us by nature; for nothing
      that exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature. For instance, the stone which by nature moves
      downwards cannot be habituated to move upwards, not even if one tries to train it by throwing it up ten
      thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to move downwards, nor can anything else that by nature
      behaves in one way be trained to behave in another. Neither by nature, then, nor contrary to nature do the
      virtues arise in us; rather we are adapted by nature to receive them, and are made perfect by habit.

      Again, of all the things that come to us by nature we first acquire the potentiality and later exhibit the
      activity (this is plain in the case of the senses; for it was not by often seeing or often hearing that we got
      these senses, but on the contrary we had them before we used them, and did not come to have them by
      using them); but the virtues we get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as well.
      For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them, e.g. men become builders
      by building and lyreplayers by playing the lyre; so too we become just by doing just acts, temperate by
      doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.

      This is confirmed by what happens in states; for legislators make the citizens good by forming habits in
      them, and this is the wish of every legislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in this
      that a good constitution differs from a bad one.

      Again, it is from the same causes and by the same means that every virtue is both produced and destroyed,
      and similarly every art; for it is from playing the lyre that both good and bad lyreplayers are produced. And
288 9 · Normative Moral Theory

             the corresponding statement is true of builders and of all the rest; men will be good or bad builders as a
             result of building well or badly. For if this were not so, there would have been no need of a teacher, but all
             men would have been born good or bad at their craft. This, then, is the case with the virtues also; by doing
             the acts that we do in our transactions with other men we become just or unjust, and by doing the acts that
             we do in the presence of danger, and being habituated to feel fear or confidence, we become brave or
             cowardly. The same is true of appetites and feelings of anger; some men become temperate and good-
             tempered, others self-indulgent and irascible, by behaving in one way or the other in the appropriate
             circumstances. Thus, in one word, states of character arise out of like activities. This is why the activities
             we exhibit must be of a certain kind; it is because the states of character correspond to the differences
             between these. It makes no small difference, then, whether we form habits of one kind or of another from
             our very youth; it makes a very great difference, or rather all the difference.

       Social Relationships and Friendship

       Aristotle was careful to note in Nicomachean Ethics that virtuous development alone does not make a
       flourishing life, though it is central to it. In addition to virtuous development, Aristotle thought things like
       success, friendships, and other external goods contributed to eudaimonia.

       In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle points out that humans are social (or political) beings (Aristotle [350 BCE]
       1998, 1097b10). It's not surprising, then, that, like Confucius, Aristotle thinks social relations are important for
       our rational and virtuous development.

       When we interact with others who have common goals and interests, we are more likely to progress and realize
       our rational powers. Social relations afford us opportunities to learn, practice, and engage in rational pursuits
       with other people. The ancient Greek schools (e.g., Plato's Academy, Aristotle's Lyceum, and Epicurus's
       Gardens) exemplify the ways individuals benefit from social relations. These ancient schools offered a meeting
       place where those interested in knowledge and the pursuit of wisdom could participate in these activities
       together.

       Through social relations, we also develop an important sense of community and take an interest in the
       flourishing of others. We see ourselves as connected to others, and through our interactions we develop social
       virtues like generosity and friendliness (Homiak 2019). Moreover, as we develop social virtues and gain a
       deeper understanding of the reasons why what is right, is right, we realize that an individual's ability to
       flourish and thrive is improved when the community flourishes. Social relations and political friendships are
       useful for increasing the amount of good we can do for the community (Kraut 2018).

       Friendship

       The important role Aristotle assigns to friendship in a flourishing life is evidenced by the fact that he devotes
       two out of the ten books of Nicomachean Ethics (Books VIII and IX) to a discussion of it. He notes that it would
       be odd, "when one assigns all good things to the happy man, not to assign friends, who are thought the greatest
       of external goods" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1169a35-b20). Aristotle distinguishes between incidental
       friendships and perfect friendships. Incidental friendships are based on and defined by either utility or
       pleasure. Such friendships are casual relationships where each person participates only because they get
       something (utility or pleasure) from it. These friendships neither contribute to our happiness nor do they
       foster virtuous development.

       Unlike incidental friendships, perfect friendships are relationships that foster and strengthen our virtuous
       development. The love that binds a perfect friendship is based on the good or on the goodness of the
       characters of the individuals involved. Aristotle believed that perfect friends wish each other well simply
       because they love each other and want each other to do well, not because they expect something (utility or
       pleasure) from the other. He points out that "those who wish well to their friends for their sake are most truly
       friends" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1156a27-b17). Aristotle argues that the happy man needs (true) friends

                                                                                                                                                                           9.5 · Daoism 289

because such friendships make it possible for them to "contemplate worthy [or virtuous] actions and actions
that are [their] own" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1169b20-1170a6). This affords the good individual the
opportunity to contemplate worthy actions that are not their own (i.e., they are their friend's) while still
thinking of these actions as in some sense being their own because their friend is another self. On Aristotle's
account, we see a true friend as another self because we are truly invested in our friend's life and "we ought to
wish what is good for his sake" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1155b17-1156a5).

Perfect friendships afford us opportunities to grow and develop, to better ourselves--something we do not get
from other relationships. Aristotle therefore argues that a "certain training in virtue arises also from the
company of the good" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1170a6-30). Our perfect friend provides perspective that
helps us in our development and contributes to our happiness because we get to participate in and experience
our friend's happiness as our own. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that Aristotle considered true friends "the
greatest of external goods" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1169a35-b20).

9.5 Daoism

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Summarize the metaphysical context and ethical properties of the dao.
  · Analyze the relationship between wu wei and Daoist ethics.
  · Compare and contrast Mohist, Confucian, and Daoist ethics.

Daoism (also written as Taoism) finds its beginnings during the Warring States period of ancient China. Like
Mohism and Confucianism, Daoism is a response to the social unrest and suffering characteristic of that
period. Daoism aims to foster harmony in both society and the individual. To do so, it seeks to understand the
source of evil and suffering. It locates the cause of most suffering and conflict in desires and greed. Daoists
believe that even when we try to regulate human action with moral systems and norms, we still fail to realize a
flourishing society and good life. Harmony is possible by living life in accordance with what is natural. While
Mohism and consequentialism judge the morality of an action based on the happiness it creates, Daoism
equates moral actions with those that promote harmony and accord with the natural way.

Chinese sources tell us that Laozi, also written as Lao Tzu, the founder of philosophical Daoism, lived during
the sixth century BCE (Chan 2018). He authored a short book, the Daodejing (sometimes written as Tao Te
Ching). Laozi's teachings emphasize the importance of simplicity, harmony, and following the natural way of
things. His basic teachings were expanded upon by Zhuangzi (fourth century BCE). Zhuangzi criticized the
artificial way of life humans had created and argued that it led to suffering by creating desire and greed.

      The Dao

       In Daoism, the dao is often translated as "the way." Daoists rejected the narrow Confucian view of dao as a way
       of behaving in society to ensure order and social harmony, and instead view the dao as the natural way of the
       universe and all things. The dao is represented as the source or origin of all that exists. Daoism tells us that we
       must live in accord with the dao if we want to live a good life or live well.
       Properties
       In the very first chapter of the Daodejing, we learn that the "dao" that can be spoken of or named is not dao:
       "Nameless: the origin of heaven and earth. Naming: the mother of ten thousand things" (Laozi [ca. 6th century
       BC] 1993, 1). When you name something, when you speak about it, you pick it out and give it a definite identity.
       Dao is the source of all that exists, of all characteristics and properties, but it is itself without limits and
       impossible to define. It represents the underlying connectedness and oneness of everything. Dao is an
       inexhaustible source of existence, of things, and it is that to which all things return.
       Naturalism
       In moral philosophy, naturalism is the belief that ethical claims can be derived from nonethical ones. In
       Daoism, "moral dao must be rooted in natural ways" (Hansen 2020). It emphasizes living in accord with nature
       by following the dao, or natural way of things. The individual who lives in the right way lives in accord with
       nature and exists in harmony with it. Daoism characterizes a fulfilling life as a calm, simple life, one that is free
       from desires and greed. Its focus on returning to nature, on naturalness, and on living in harmony with the
       natural world makes Daoism a naturalistic philosophy.
       Daoist Metaphysics
       The Daodejing offers a metaphysical perspective. The dao is characterized as the source of all things that exist,
       as the source of being and nonbeing. In Chapter 4 of the Daodejing, dao is said to be "empty--Its use never

                                                                                                                                                                           9.5 · Daoism 291

exhausted. Bottomless--The origin of all things" (Laozi [ca. 6th century BC] 1993, 4). The source of all that
exists, of change, the dao nevertheless remains unchanging. Daoism, then, can be read as a philosophy that
provides answers to important metaphysical questions in its exploration of the underlying nature of existence.

The metaphysical account of reality found in Daoism provides a foundation for other Daoist positions.
Daoism's naturalistic philosophy is supported by its metaphysical claims. The dao is the source of all, and
living in accordance with it is living in accordance with the natural way, with the flow of all existence. Daoists
claim, therefore, that we act morally when we act in accord with the dao and thus in accord with the natural
way of things. Their metaphysics suggests a view of the world that recognizes the dynamic connections and
interdependence of all things that exist. When we name things, when we differentiate things and treat them as
individual, existing entities, we ignore the fact that nothing exists on its own independent of the whole. To truly
understand existence, then, Daoists urge us to be more aware of and sensitive to the way everything depends
on and is connected to everything else. Each thing is a part of a larger, ever-changing whole.

Skepticism, Inclusion, and Acceptance

In the Daodejing, it can be hard to grasp or form a clear conception of the dao. In fact, when Zhuangzi expands
upon the earlier teachings of Laozi, he "repeatedly brings forth the issue of whether and how the Dao can be
known" (Pregadio 2020). The dao cannot be known in the sense in which we normally know things about
ourselves, objects, or our world. Daoism is thus skeptical not only about those things humans have so far
claimed to know and value, but also skeptical that knowledge of the dao is possible. This skepticism regarding
the extent to which we can know the dao pushes Daoism to be inclusive and accepting. It makes Daoism open
to and accepting of various interpretations and readings of the Daodejing so long as through them we are able
to live in accordance with the dao--to live a fulfilling life.

Paradox and Puzzles

Throughout the Daodejing, there is paradoxical and puzzling language. For example, it says that the dao "in its
regular course does nothing . . . and so there is nothing which it does not do" (Laozi [ca. 6th century BC] 1993,
37). The paradoxical ways the dao is described within the texts is a way to bring attention to or highlight a way
of thinking that is fundamentally different from our everyday experience of the world. Indeed, Daoists believe
that our problems are a consequence of our regular way of being in the world and living without awareness of
the dao. We are accustomed to treating things as distinct, definable entities, and we think of ourselves in the
same terms. Unaware of the dao, of the true nature of reality, we act against it and cause pain and suffering.
Through paradoxical language and expressions, Daoism attempts to make us aware of something greater that
is the generative source of existence. It challenges us to look at things differently and change our perspective
so that we can see that our pain and suffering is a consequence of conventional values and beliefs. It attempts
to sidestep the limitations of language by using paradoxes and puzzles to encourage and promote a deeper
awareness of the nature of existence. Daoists criticize the way humans normally live because it fosters and
encourages bad thinking, problematic values, and resistance to living differently.

Wu Wei

The Daoist approach to life is one that recommends reserve, acceptance of the world as it is, and living in
accordance with the flow of nature. In ancient China, Laozi and other thinkers responded to the unrest,
conflict, and suffering they witnessed in their society. Laozi's response (and Zhuangzi's development of it) is
critical of the way we normally live in the world. For example, we are normally wasteful, we resist change, and
we try to transform the natural world to suit our needs. Daoism recommends instead that we move with the
current of the natural way of things, accept things as they are, and find balance and harmony with the dao. The
Daoist call this the practice of wu wei, which involves what is often described as nonaction (Chan 2018).
Offering a clear account of wu wei can prove challenging because it is a paradoxical concept. Our normal
concept of action includes motivated, directed, purposeful activity aimed at desire satisfaction. To act is to
impose your strength and will on the world, to bring something about. Practicing wu wei, in contrast, suggests
292 9 · Normative Moral Theory

       a natural way of acting that is spontaneous or immediate. When you practice wu wei, you act in harmony with
       the dao, you are free of desire and of striving, and you spontaneously move with the natural flow of existence.
       Attitude toward the Dao

       One who practices wu wei, or nonaction, is someone free of unnecessary, self-gratifying desires. The normal
       way we act in the world fosters an attitude of separateness and causes us to act against nature or in ways that
       resist the natural way. Practicing nonaction brings one in harmony with the dao. The individual develops an
       attitude of connectedness rather than individuality, of being one with the natural world and the way of things
       rather than separate from or against it.
       Receptivity and "Softness"

       The Daoist way of living in the world is one that values being receptive to the natural flow and movements of
       life. We practice a "soft" style of action when we practice wu wei (Wong 2021). Daoists think we normally
       practice a "hard" style of action, we resist the natural flow. The common view or understanding of the natural
       world treats it as separate from the human world, as something valuable only for its usefulness. Such a view
       promotes values like strength, dominance, and force because we view nature as something that must be
       overpowered and transformed to fit the human, social world. The Daoist conception of softness suggests living
       in the world in a way that is in accord with the natural way of things. Instead of acting against the current of the
       stream, you move easily with the flow of the waters. A "soft" style suggests being receptive to the natural flow
       and moving with it. When you are sensitive to the natural movements and processes of life, you are free of
       desire, calm, and able to live in harmony with it.

       systematic normative theories that you have encountered in this chapter so far? Note that this translation uses the
       spelling "tao" rather than "dao". These two spellings refer to the same concept.

       Laozi (Lao-tzu) Daodejing (Tao Te Ching) (https://openstax.org/r/Daodejing), translated by James Legge.

       Chapter 1

        1. The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the
             enduring and unchanging name.

        2. (Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is
             the Mother of all things.

        3. Always without desire we must be found,
             If its deep mystery we would sound;
             But if desire always within us be,
             Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.

        4. Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, it receives the different names.
             Together we call them the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and
             wonderful.

             fulness. How deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of all things!

      so continue!
3. I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before God.

Chapter 8

1. The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in
      its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to
      (that of) the Tao.

2. The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place; that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of
      associations is in their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing good order; that of (the
      conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness.

3. And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about his low position), no one finds fault with
      him.

Chapter 13

1. Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal
      conditions (of the same kind).

2. What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment
      of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of
      (still greater calamity):--this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be
      feared. And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal
      conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the
      body, what great calamity could come to me?

3. Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he honours his own person, may be employed
      to govern it, and he who would administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be entrusted
      with it.

Daoist, Mohist, and Confucian Ethics

Daoism, Mohism, and Confucianism were created in response to widespread social unrest, conflict, and
suffering. All three aim to end suffering and promote harmony. Daoism's approach is unlike either Mohism or
Confucianism in important respects. Daoists reject traditional morality because it promotes a way of life that
supports acting against the natural way or against the flow of nature. They therefore reject the Mohist and
Confucian affirmation of traditional moral norms. Daoists believe social norms and practices won't solve our
problems, because they promote a way of life that is unnatural. Instead, Daoism affirms simplicity, the
elimination of desires and greed, and naturalness. Daoists believe we need to look beyond social life, beyond
traditional human constructs, and instead find harmony with the natural way, the dao.

In contrast, Mohist and Confucian ethics attempt to establish norms and standards for acting and emphasize
the important role of social relations in informing our obligations. They reaffirm the value and importance of
moral norms and social practices, arguing that widespread adherence will heal social discord and promote
well-being. Confucianism focuses on character and argues that through the cultivation of virtue we perfect
ourselves. Mohism, however, focuses on consequences to determine rightness, and Mohists believe actions
that promote general welfare are right.

     9.6 Feminist Theories of Ethics

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the framework of care ethics.
         · Summarize feminists' historical critique of normative moral teachings concerning gender.
         · Evaluate the purpose and potential of intersectional moral discourse.

       Feminism is, among other things, a political and philosophical movement that aims to end sexism and
       promote social justice. Feminists argue that the long-standing dominance of the male perspective has caused
       women's interests to be ignored and their autonomy to be limited. In ethics, feminist thinkers have
       traditionally explored, criticized, and sought to correct the role gender has historically played in the
       development and application of moral beliefs and practices. They examine, for example, the ways in which
       power defines relationships within society and the extent to which it has influenced social/cultural
       development. Feminist ethics places special emphasis on exploring the role of gender and gendered thinking
       in shaping our views, values, and our understanding of ourselves and the world.

      Historical Critique

       At its core, feminism is a response to a world that has by and large ignored the perspectives, interests, and
       lived experiences of women. Feminists explore historical factors that have caused and perpetuate gender
       discrimination and oppression. They aim to identify, critique, and correct traditional assumptions about
       gender. Feminists criticize "institutions, presuppositions, and practices that have historically favored men
       over women" (McAfee 2018). They point out that the male perspective has been treated as the norm and the
       stand-in for the human perspective. When theorists and thinkers have historically made claims about
       universality and objectivity, they ignored the fact that it was their own (male) perspective that was treated as
       the norm, as a standard human experience. Feminists therefore criticize traditional moral theory for
       pretending to be universal and objective even though it favored the male perspective and experience (McAfee
       2018).

       At its core, feminist ethics seeks to understand, uncover, and correct the traditional role gender has played in
       social/cultural development. The male perspective has celebrated man as the norm, the standard human. We
       see in all areas of life a celebration of traits associated with men. The belief that we should pursue science and
       technology to dominate and control the natural world, for example, celebrates strength and reason, values that
       are used to characterize men. Women, on the other hand, have traditionally been characterized as delicate,
       weak, submissive, and emotional (as opposed to rational).

       The Concept of the Feminine

       In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir points out that femininity is not something given, but something
       learned, a social construct. "It would appear, then, that every female human being is not necessarily a woman;
       to be so considered she must share in that mysterious and threatened reality known as femininity" (Beauvoir
       [1949] 2011). The concepts of femininity and masculinity represent society's idea of what it means to be either
       a woman or a man. These concepts are based on traditional gender roles and the norms, practices, and values
       tied to them. As Mari Mikkola suggests in her article "Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender" (2019),
       "females become women through a process whereby they acquire feminine traits and learn feminine
       behavior." Feminine behavior has historically been associated with being delicate, submissive, and emotional.
       Feminists critique this concept of femininity for being used to justify limits on female autonomy and
       contributing to the marginalization of women.

       Gender Binarism and Essentialism

       Most feminists in the 1970s and 1980s believed that gender was binary. Gender binarism is the view that each
       person can be categorized by one of the two genders (male or female). Some feminist thinkers have used

                                                                                                                                               9.6 · Feminist Theories of Ethics 295

gender binarism as a starting point to explore different, alternative ethical systems in which the norms for
human nature are defined by women. Others have suggested that women approach moral problems from a
fundamentally different perspective than men. Psychologist Carol Gilligan's work, for example, found that men
and women often approach moral problems from different perspectives: men from the perspective of justice
and women from the perspective of care.

Feminists criticize traditional normative ethics for treating man as the human norm. In the traditional view,
characteristics associated with masculinity are those characteristics that embody the ideal person.

Some feminists have argued that women should not deny or reject these characteristics, but instead adopt
them as essential. Essentialism is the view that a set of characteristics makes something what it is.
Essentialism suggests that there are certain essential characteristics that make a woman a woman or a man a
man. Traditionally, women have been defined by characteristics that define them as morally bad and
subversive. Rather than view these characteristics as negative or argue that they are not essential to woman,
some feminist ethicists have argued that women should adopt these essential traits as positive.

Ethics of Care

Gilligan's research led to the development of care ethics (Gilligan 1982). Gilligan discovered that men and
women often approach ethical dilemmas from different perspectives. Gilligan found that men value things like
justice, autonomy, and the application of abstract principles and norms. In contrast, she found that women
value things like caring for others, relationships, and responsibility. She called the approach favored by men
the perspective of justice and the approach favored by women the perspective of care (Norlock 2019).

The ethics of care is an approach that values caring, the relationships of the individuals involved, and the
interests of individuals. In contrast to the emphasis on the application of abstract rules and principles found in
traditional ethics, the ethics of care emphasizes the complexities of real life and is more sensitive to unique,
concrete situations. Gilligan's approach asks agents to consider the specific interests of individuals and their
relationships. The ethics of care values caring and moral reasoning that accounts for the unique factors of
concrete situations.

The Caring Relation as an Ethical Paradigm

Traditionally, the role of caretaker has been viewed as a woman's role. The caring relationship is one between
an individual and their caregiver. A caretaker is compassionate, takes responsibility, understands the
importance of relationships, and acts in the best interests of the one they care for. Care ethics uses the caring
relationship as an ethical paradigm. It is the model that should be used to determine what's right and guide
behavior. The caring relationship emphasizes the importance of concrete situations, the specific individuals
involved, and acting to promote their interests.

Nel Noddings on Caring

In her influential work Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education (1984), Nel Noddings
argues that the care perspective is both feminine and feminist (Norlock 2019). The emphasis on abstract,
universal principles in traditional ethics makes the agent insensitive to situational factors and relationships.
In contrast, Noddings endorses the moral value of partiality (Norlock 2019). From this perspective, the agent
considers specific situational and relational factors in moral deliberation. When we consider the needs of the
actual individuals involved in a situation, we are more likely to be sensitive to the interests of those in
marginalized or oppressed positions.

Intersectionality

Some feminists have highlighted the important role intersectionality plays in social relations and argue it must
be accounted for to end inequality and correct identity-based oppression and discrimination.
Intersectionality refers to different aspects of identity (e.g., gender, race, sexuality, and class) that intersect in
a person's identity and define or influence their lived experience. When we use or assume identity norms (e.g.,
296 9 · Normative Moral Theory

       the normal woman) without considering other aspects of identity, it is possible that we advance only some
       women and not others because there is a tendency to assume a position of privilege (Norlock 2019).

       Some feminists have argued that intersectional approaches compromise and weaken the strength of potential
       advocacy. Naomi Zack (2005), for example, argues that otherwise broad categories of social identity (e.g.,
       woman) are fragmented by intersectional approaches because diverse aspects of identity (e.g., race, class, and/
       or sexuality) are treated as changing the individual's perspective and experience of oppression. In other words,
       a group of individuals who all share one aspect of identity (woman) may be fragmented into smaller groups
       when intersectionality is considered because other aspects of identity shift a given individual's perspective
       and shared experience (Norlock 2019). This has the adverse effect, Zack argues, of weakening the category and
       the strength of advocacy.

       In response to feminists who question intersectional approaches on the grounds that they compromise and
       weaken advocacy, other feminists have pointed out that identity categories like women include diverse
       members. If intersectionality is ignored, we ignore the diverse perspectives, interests, and experiences of
       individuals and cannot advocate effectively. Identities are complex, and different aspects of identity (e.g., race,
       class, and/or sexuality) may make an individual more or less likely to experience oppression in different
       circumstances. Intersectional approaches bring a deeper awareness of aspects of identity and sensitivity to the
       ways social identities contribute to experiences of oppression. A greater emphasis on aspects of identity, they
       argue, can unite individuals with diverse social identities by increasing awareness of the common struggle of
       oppressed groups. Intersectionality can therefore foster solidarity among oppressed groups because it makes
       individuals more aware of their common experiences.

       Traditionally, it was thought that oppressed identities had a compounding effect and individuals were worse
       off if their identities included aspects of multiple oppressed identities. In this view, someone whose identity
       included multiple oppressed categories would be considered worse off than someone whose identity only
       included one oppressed category.

      Development of Alternative Normative Moral Frameworks

       Feminists critiqued traditional moral beliefs and practices for using norms and standards that prioritize
       certain groups and perspectives. Traditional normative moral frameworks favored the dominant, privileged
       position by, for example, ignoring actual individuals in concrete situations and therefore making us blind to
       the ways in which some individuals suffer. Social identities, like people, are diverse and complex. In an attempt
       to correct oppression based on gender (and identity), feminists have pursued alternative normative moral
       frameworks.

       Feminists have criticized deontological moral theories and duty-centric frameworks. They take issue with the
       separation of rationality and emotion. Traditionally, woman have been associated more with a capacity for
       emotion. Historically, philosophers like Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Kant, and many others have located the
       source of human worth and dignity in our rational capacity. Their theories imply, explicitly or implicitly, that
       women have less worth and dignity, suggesting they are deserving of less respect. The seemingly benign claim
       that humans are rational creatures has grave implications when what is normal is determined by those who
       are in a privileged position. Feminists also critique Kant's normative moral framework because it prioritizes
       abstraction and generalization over consideration of situational factors and the people involved. They argue
       that such abstraction is problematic because it pretends to be impartial while ignoring the interests of
       oppressed or vulnerable groups.

       In ethics, feminist scholars have explored alternative moral frameworks using all major approaches. They
       criticize traditional normative moral theories for ignoring the interests and perspectives of women (and
       oppressed groups) and for failing to consider important facts of the concrete situation and the individuals
       involved when applying norms or standards. A viable alternative moral framework must find ways to account
       for the interests of all persons, focus on the vulnerable and invisible, and lead to moral choices that advance

true equality rather than only advancing the interests of the privileged.

Summary

9.1 Requirements of a Normative Moral Theory

Ethics is the philosophical study of morality. It is commonly divided into three main areas: metaethics,
normative ethics, and applied ethics, each of which is distinguished by a different level of inquiry. A normative
moral theory is a systematized account of morality that addresses important questions related to effectively
guiding moral conduct. This chapter reviews three main approaches (consequentialist, deontological, and
virtue) to normative ethics distinguished by the criterion (consequences, duty, or character) used for
determining moral conduct.

9.2 Consequentialism

Consequentialism is the view that the rightness of an action is determined by its consequences. Mohism is a
consequentialist theory founded by Mozi. It was created as a response to widespread social unrest and
suffering characteristic of ancient China's Warring States period. Mohists thought ethical norms could be
established by looking at what increases overall welfare. They thought everyone should be treated impartially
or equally and that preference shouldn't be given to some people's welfare over others. A key virtue in Mohism
is benevolence, or kindness (rèn). The concept of benevolence is important because it requires one to look
outside one's own interests and treat others with care (ài). Mozi realized that if people adopt the same morality,
they will use the same standards to judge their own actions and the actions of others, which will improve social
order and harmony.

Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory developed by Jeremy Bentham and later modified by John Stuart
Mill. Utilitarians argue that what is right is whatever produces the most utility, the most usefulness. They
identify happiness with utility. The principle of utility states that "actions are right in proportion as they tend
to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness" (Mill [1861] 2001, 7). Classic
utilitarians like Bentham and Mill believed that pleasure and pain are basic, primary means by which people
navigate the world and find motivation. The greatest happiness principle (or principle of utility) tells us that
actions are right that produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number. When an agent evaluates the
moral rightness of an action, they consider the happiness of all affected by the consequences.

9.3 Deontology

Deontological approaches focus on duties (e.g., always tell the truth) to determine whether an act is morally
right. Immanuel Kant was the first philosopher to advance a deontological approach. He conceived of morality
as rules that any rational being can and should accept because they are norms of rational conduct or agency.
He called these rules categorical imperatives. There are two important formulations of the categorical
imperative: the universal law formulation and the humanity formulation. Kant distinguished the categorical
imperative from the hypothetical imperative, which is an action one takes to achieve a specific goal.

Pluralists like Sir William David Ross attempted to offer a more complex, complete account of morality that
explains the common human experience. Ross believed (classic) utilitarianism and deontology fail because
they "over-simplify the moral life" (Ross 1939, 189). He thought earlier moral theories reduced morality to a
single principle (e.g., Mill's greatest happiness principle and Kant's categorical imperative), leaving them
unable to adequately account for our common experience of morality. Ross argued that our duties are not
absolute, as Kant would have it, but rather are obligatory, other things being equal, or so long as other factors
and circumstances remain the same.

9.4 Virtue Ethics

Virtue ethics takes a character-centered approach to morality. Right action is said to flow from right character.
To do what is right requires having the right character traits or dispositions. You become a good person, then,
through the cultivation of character and self-perfection.

Confucius developed Confucianism in response to the widespread social unrest and suffering characteristic of

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                9 · Key Terms 299

ancient China's Warring States period. Confucians maintain that it is possible to perfect human nature through
personal development and transformation, and they maintain the importance of junzi, a person who is an
exemplary ethical figure and thus lives according to the dao. Ren refers to moral excellence, whether in full or
regarding specific characteristics or traits. Important to both early and late Confucian ethics is the concept of li
(ritual and practice). Li plays an important role in the transformation of character. Social and cultural norms
and practices shape and influence our interactions with others. These rituals are a guide or become a means
by which we develop and start to understand our moral responsibilities.

Aristotle believed virtuous development is central to human flourishing, eudaimonia. Aristotle identifies
rationality as the unique function of human beings, and human virtue or excellence is therefore realized
through the development or perfection of reason. To exercise or possess virtue is to demonstrate excellent
character. Someone with a virtuous character is consistent, firm, self-controlled, and well-off. Aristotle thought
people "are made perfect by habit" (Aristotle [350 BCE] 1998, 1103a10-33). When people practice doing what's
right, they get better at choosing the right action in different circumstances. Through habituation, people gain
practice and familiarity, bring about dispositions or tendencies, and gain the requisite practical experience to
identify the reasons why a certain action should be chosen in diverse situations.

Like Confucius, Aristotle thinks social relations are important for people's rational and virtuous development.
When people interact with others who have common goals and interests, they are more likely to progress and
realize their rational powers. Through social relations, people also develop an important sense of community
and take an interest in the flourishing of others.

9.5 Daoism

Like Mohism and Confucianism, Daoism is a response to the social unrest and suffering characteristic of
ancient China's Warring States period. Daoism aims to foster harmony in both society and the individual.
Philosophical Daoism was founded by Laozi. Daoists reject the narrow Confucian view of dao as a way of
behaving in society to ensure order and social harmony and instead view the dao as the natural way of the
universe and all things. Daoism characterizes a fulfilling life as a calm, simple life, one that is free from desires
and greed. The practice of wu wei suggests a natural way of acting that is spontaneous or immediate. When
people practice wu wei, they act in harmony with the dao, are free of desire and striving, and spontaneously
move with the natural flow of existence.

9.6 Feminist Theories of Ethics

The ethics of care is often associated with feminism, and its approach is modeled on a woman's moral
perspective. Psychologist Carol Gilligan's research led to the development of care ethics. It is an approach that
values caring, the relationships of the individuals involved, and the interests of individuals. Gilligan's approach
asks agents to consider the specific interests of individuals and their relationships. The ethics of care values
caring and moral reasoning that accounts for the unique factors of concrete situations rather than abstraction.

Feminist scholars criticize traditional normative moral theories for ignoring the interests and perspectives of
women (and oppressed groups) and for failing to consider important facts of the concrete situation and the
individuals involved when applying norms or standards. They have explored alternative moral frameworks
using all major approaches. A viable alternative moral framework must find ways to account for the interests of
all persons, focus on the vulnerable and invisible, and lead to moral choices that advance true equality rather
than only advancing the interests of the privileged.

Applied Ethics  10

FIGURE 10.1 Bioethics is an area of applied ethics that explores the many potential ethical dilemmas that can arise
in medicine and related areas. Bioethics addresses questions like: "What is informed consent?" "When, if ever, can a
physician assist a patient in ending their own life?" "Under what conditions is it morally permissible to conduct
research using human test subjects?" (credit: modification of "Operating Room" by John Crawford/National Cancer
Institute/National Institutes of Health/Wikimedia, Public Domain)

CHAPTER OUTLINE

10.1 The Challenge of Bioethics
10.2 Environmental Ethics
10.3 Business Ethics and Emerging Technology

INTRODUCTION Most of us think about ethical issues in our everyday lives. We might wonder, for instance,
whether we have an obligation to reduce our use of plastics because of their impact on the environment. We
might question whether we treated someone fairly at work or whether we acted in a way that was morally
problematic. When we reflect on whether a given action is right or wrong, we are doing applied ethics. We
attempt to determine the rightness of some specified action through moral deliberation and the application of
ethical principles and norms. Questions in applied ethics focus on whether some action is right, and
philosophers apply diverse perspectives when analyzing the morality of a specific action.
Developments and advances in areas like technology and medicine can potentially create otherwise
unforeseen or unexpected ethical dilemmas. In most cases, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to predict
308 10 · Applied Ethics

       potential ethical issues pertaining to an innovation until it is already in use and in the world. Imagine, for
       instance, trying to predict what moral dilemmas and disruptions the internet would cause before it was
       created and widely used. Indeed, even after its creation and widespread adoption in the 1990s, there were still
       many innovations and challenges to come that would have been hard to predict. Ethical dilemmas created by
       new innovations emerge with use and are often confronted and debated only after they become apparent. This
       is why it can sometimes seem like ethical debates are always playing catch-up, that we are motivated to debate
       the ethical implications of something only after issues become apparent.

       Metaethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics are the three main areas of ethics, which are each
       distinguished by a different level of inquiry and analysis. Applied ethics focuses on the application of moral
       norms and principles to controversial issues to determine the rightness of specific actions. While people have
       done applied ethics throughout human history, as a field of study, applied ethics is relatively new, emerging in
       the early 1970s. Issues like abortion, environmental racism, the use of humans in biomedical research, and
       online privacy are just a few of the controversial moral issues explored in applied ethics.

       Making sense of these complicated issues often requires a multidisciplinary approach. Applied ethics rarely
       finds answers within the philosophical frame alone. While philosophy provides the normative framework for
       analysis by way of the ethical theories, philosophy often generates more questions than functional answers,
       and in the field of ethics, concerns about the right to life, social justice, and the like sometimes fall into the
       arena of politics. As a result, many applied dilemmas are solved and resolved through law and policy. As such,
       applied ethics becomes an interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary field of study.

       This chapter explores major subfields in applied ethics including bioethics, environmental ethics, and
       business ethics and emerging technology.

     10.1 The Challenge of Bioethics

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Summarize current scientific advances and social and political factors that contribute to our understanding of
             today's bioethical controversies.

         · Explain the main philosophical positions in major areas of bioethical debate including abortion, euthanasia,
             clinical trials, and human augmentation.

         · Propose a position on each bioethical issue.

       The term bioethics, which essentially means "life ethics," was coined in 1970 by Van Rensselaer Potter
       (1911-2011), an American biochemist. It is a field that studies ethical issues that emerge with advances in
       biology, technology, and medicine. For example, bioethics deals with issues related to patient autonomy, the
       distribution of and access to medical resources, human experimentation, online privacy, and life-and-death
       decisions in medicine. When confronted with issues like these, ethicists consider a multiplicity of views, any
       potentially relevant interests, and complex situational factors. The bioethicist, like anyone doing applied
       ethics, must be prepared to wear many hats in order to explore all sides and perspectives. This section looks at
       current areas of controversy and debate in the field of bioethics.

      The Abortion Debate

       This section investigates biological, political, legal, and moral aspects of the issue of abortion. Unlike a
       miscarriage, a spontaneous loss of pregnancy due to injury or natural defect, an abortion is the intentional
       ending of a pregnancy. When abortions are medically induced, a pregnancy is terminated using drugs,
       surgery, or a combination of the two. In some cases, abortions are performed out of medical necessity to save
       the life of a pregnant person (therapeutic abortion), while in others a person who is pregnant elects to have the
       procedure for other reasons.

       Political efforts to legalize contraception and later abortion arose as part of many women's rights movements.

As shown in Figure 10.2, some countries still prohibit abortion, and others place limits on when it is allowed,
such as when the life of the person carrying the pregnancy is at risk.

In the United States, the right to an abortion prior to the viability of the fetus was deemed protected by the
Constitution in the historic Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade (1973). The court established a trimester
system to guide abortion decisions. The court initially acknowledged an unmitigated right to abort in the first
three months of pregnancy but left it up to the government to regulate abortion in the second trimester and
restrict or ban it in the last trimester if the life of the person carrying the pregnancy was not in danger.
A subsequent Supreme Court decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), reaffirmed Roe v. Wade and ruled
that state abortion regulations could not place serious obstacles in the path of someone who chose to seek an
abortion before a fetus was viable. The decision also replaced the trimester system with the notion of fetal
viability--or the fetus's ability to survive outside the womb (approximately at 25 to 28 weeks). Someone
therefore cannot freely seek an abortion if the fetus is viable.
Utilitarianism and Liberal Views on Individual Rights
Normative moral theories, such as those we considered in the previous chapter, factor into how societies view
abortion. In Hinduism, for example, moral actions are based on the principle of ahimsa, or "non-harming,"
which means that in considering abortion, the choice is governed by what does the least harm to all involved
(e.g., to the parents, the fetus, and society). Portions of the Vedas, Hinduism's most sacred texts, condemn
abortion (BBC 2009). Hinduism considers abortion wrong unless it is necessary to save the life of the person
carrying the pregnancy. At the same time, in practice, abortion is common in India because some families
prefer to have boy children (Dhillon 2020).
Utilitarianism, the consequentialist approach first advanced by Jeremy Bentham, judges an action to be moral
if it provides the greatest good to the greatest number. John Stuart Mill's work On Liberty popularized and
adapted this idea so that it could be implemented within representative governments. Mill recognized that the
natural rights of various individuals in society will often come into conflict. To maximize individual freedom,
Mill proposed the harm principle. It states that a person's actions should only be limited if they harm another
person. A person's speech should therefore not be curtailed unless it harms another by, for example, directly
inciting violence. The harm principle became the cornerstone of 19th-century liberalism. As a result, many
310 10 · Applied Ethics

       people living in liberal societies today evaluate the morality of abortion by weighing the rights of the pregnant
       person against the rights of the living organism inside the womb. Those who support abortion tend to use the
       term fetus for the living organism and do not regard it as a person with rights. Those who oppose abortion use
       the term unborn child and maintain that it has the rights of personhood.

       Metaphysical perspectives heavily inform the debate over whether or under what circumstances an abortion is
       a moral act. For some, the question revolves around what constitutes a person and what rights persons and
       nonpersons possess. For those who embrace the Judeo-Christian view that humans have a mind, body, and
       soul, the question often becomes about when the soul enters the body.

       Personhood

       Central to the abortion debate, the concept of personhood is best understood as a capacity humans possess
       that distinguishes them as beings capable of morality. Historically, philosophers like Aristotle and Immanuel
       Kant have identified reason as a principal factor that justifies the special value assigned to humans. Aristotle
       argued that rational activity is the peculiar function of humans. He thought we perfect ourselves by perfecting
       our rational nature. Kant located our worth and dignity in our capacity for rationality. He tells us that "rational
       beings are called persons inasmuch as their nature already marks them out as ends in themselves" (Kant
       1997, 4:428). In other words, personhood, for Kant, is contingent on possessing a rational nature.

       The question, then, is when personhood begins. No one is a fully functioning rational agent the moment they
       are born. In fact, we categorize some humans as dependents, as unable to act as rational agents, when their
       reason is not fully functioning or formed (e.g., children or those with late-stage Alzheimer's). Is there some
       threshold or line of demarcation that distinguishes the point at which reason is sufficiently developed for a
       human being to be considered a person by this definition? What would it mean for a society if only those who
       met that threshold were guaranteed the right to life?

       Aristotle and Potentiality

       The opening of the chapter on metaphysics considered the acorn and oak tree, asking how a being (in this case
       the acorn) can change so radically and yet remain essentially the same thing. Plato suggested that beings in the
       physical world are imperfect reflections of perfect forms that are part of an invisible, nonmaterial world.
       Whereas forms represent an unchanging ideal, beings in this world change. Aristotle proposed the theory of
       hylomorphism, which states that form is actually present in the material world and responsible for causing
       the acorn to actualize its potential as an oak tree. From this perspective, just as the acorn contains the
       essential identity of the fully grown oak tree, so does the human embryo contain the essential identity of a
       human being. Since the embryo contains the human essence, pro-life advocates argue that it is just as immoral
       to kill an embryo as to kill a human that has been born (Lee 2004).

           CONNECTIONS

       Aristotle's concept of hylomorphism is explored in greater depth in the chapter on metaphysics and the
       chapter on value theory.

       Aristotle and the Soul

       For Aristotle, the soul is the form of the living body. In his work On the Soul, Aristotle identifies three types of
       souls. The soul of a plant acts upon the body so that it can survive and reproduce. The soul of a lower-level
       animal acts on the body so that it can survive, reproduce, perceive, and act. The soul of a human makes it
       possible for the body to fulfill all the purposes of a lower-level animal and carry out rational thought. Some
       have argued that Aristotle believed that the rational soul only entered the human body once it was equipped
       with organs, at 40 days or more after conception. However, this is likely a misinterpretation promoted by the
       Greek philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias from 200 CE onward. In his text Generation of Animals, Aristotle
       conveys the belief, shared by others of his day, that ensoulment occurs upon fertilization (Bos 2012). Yet the

belief that the soul enters the body after 40 days--whether or not Aristotle supported it--became widespread
within monotheism and has greatly impacted the abortion debate.

Ensoulment in the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Traditions

Today major monotheistic religions object to or seek to limit abortions because they believe that a fetus has a
God-given soul. To abort then is to destroy God's creation. The Hebrew Bible, which is part of both Jewish and
Christian scripture, is silent on this issue of ensoulment. Genesis 2:7 describes how God created the first man,
Adam: "then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of
life; and the man became a living being." One of the Hebrew words for soul, neshama, also means "breath." In
Judaism, the introduction of form or soul into the body becomes an act of God that gives life. No mention is
made in the first five books of Moses, the Pentateuch, about when this occurs in natural procreation. The later
Babylonian Talmud, compiled between 200 and 500 CE, divulges that "the embryo is considered to be mere
water until the fortieth day" (quoted in Schenker 2008, 271). This pronouncement may reflect the influence of
Greek ideas.

The Aristotelian view of ensoulment is expressed within Christianity. The influential Christian theologian
Saint Augustine (354-430 CE) saw the killing of a 40-day-old fetus as an act of murder. A century later, the code
of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, who reigned from 529 to 565 CE, declared that fetuses under 40 days did
not possess a soul (Jones 2004). In the 12th century, the philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas also
followed Aristotle's thinking and suggested that a human soul was not fully "formed" until a period of time
after conception (40 days for boys and 90 days for girls). Moreover, while Aquinas did not sanction abortion at
any stage of pregnancy, he specifically notes that murder has been committed only after the fetus has become
animated or ensouled. Aquinas's understanding of ensoulment remained the official church view until late
into the 19th century. Pope Pius IX (1792-1878) altered the official position of the church on ensoulment in
order to address theological concerns regarding the Immaculate Conception (McGarry 2013). Beginning with
Pope Pius IX, then, the church's view has been that the soul is present at conception.

According to the Hadith, which along with the Quran constitutes the central written texts of Islam, the soul
enters the body 120 days after conception. Yet Islamic clerics have restricted abortions to the first 40 days or
prohibited them altogether--as the Quran implores parents not to kill their children for fear of want (Albar
2001). Like in Judaism and Christianity, opposition to abortion arises from a belief in the sanctity of life that
God has bestowed on his creations.

         READ LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

This excerpt from Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica (https://openstax.org/r/summatheologica) addresses
questions of how and why the soul should be viewed as distinct from the body and how we might go about defining
the soul.

      To seek the nature of the soul, we must premise that the soul is defined as the first principle of life of those
      things which live: for we call living things "animate," [*i.e., having a soul] and those things which have no
      life, "inanimate." Now life is shown principally by two actions, knowledge and movement. The philosophers
      of old, not being able to rise above their imagination, supposed that the principle of these actions was
      something corporeal: for they asserted that only bodies were real things; and that what is not corporeal is
      nothing: hence they maintained that the soul is something corporeal. This opinion can be proved to be false
      in many ways; but we shall make use of only one proof, based on universal and certain principles, which
      shows clearly that the soul is not a body.

      It is manifest that not every principle of vital action is a soul, for then the eye would be a soul, as it is a
      principle of vision; and the same might be applied to the other instruments of the soul: but it is the first
      principle of life, which we call the soul. Now, though a body may be a principle of life, as the heart is a
312 10 · Applied Ethics

             principle of life in an animal, yet nothing corporeal can be the first principle of life. For it is clear that to be a
             principle of life, or to be a living thing, does not belong to a body as such; since, if that were the case, every
             body would be a living thing, or a principle of life. Therefore a body is competent to be a living thing or even
             a principle of life, as "such" a body. Now that it is actually such a body, it owes to some principle which is
             called its act. Therefore the soul, which is the first principle of life, is not a body, but the act of a body; thus
             heat, which is the principle of calefaction, is not a body, but an act of a body.

       Secular Notions of Personhood

       Some contemporary philosophers have laid aside a belief in a God-given soul and turned to modern views of
       personhood to justify both support for and opposition to abortion. Mary Anne Warren, for example, identifies
       five characteristics essential to the concept of personhood (Warren 1973):

         · Consciousness (in particular, the capacity to feel pain)
         · Reasoning (the developed capacity to solve new, complex problems)
         · The presence of self-awareness and self-concepts
         · Self-motivated and self-directed activity
         · The capacity to communicate messages that are not definite or limited in terms of possible content, topic,

             or type

       Warren argues that a fetus is not a person because it does not satisfy any of the characteristics essential to
       personhood. Abortion, Warren argues, is always morally permissible because a fetus is not a person and does
       not have rights (e.g., it does not have a right to life). The rights of the person carrying the pregnancy will always
       override or outweigh any consideration that might be given to a fetus. Warren believes there is no moral basis
       for limiting or restricting abortion, but she recognizes the possibility that we might do so on nonmoral
       (practical or medical) grounds. For example, we might justify restricting abortion in a situation where someone
       would suffer serious harm from medical complications if the procedure were performed.

       Others argue that it is not the rational ability present in an individual that makes them a person or secures
       their moral status, but rather that our rational nature grounds our moral status--and if human nature is the
       source of our worth, then any human, even a child, has value whether their reason and agency has fully
       developed. Children, for example, are not fully functioning rational agents. We recognize this distinction, but
       we do not use it to justify intentionally harming children or using them as a means to our own ends. We
       assume that children, like all humans, possess a worth and value that prohibits such treatment. Similarly,
       people who oppose abortion say that the unborn are potential persons, which is sufficient to grant the unborn
       child at least a right to life.

       Some philosophers, like Ronald Dworkin, go a step further, arguing that full moral status is assigned to any
       human in virtue of being a member of the human species (Dworkin 1993). Dworkin's approach focuses on
       whether an entity is human and uses that as a basis for assigning full moral status rather than making such
       status contingent on whether a specific individual has fully formed rational capacities.

       The Right to Bodily Autonomy

       When the issue of abortion is couched in terms of rights, the debate centers on the conflict between the right(s)
       of the fetus or unborn child and the rights of the pregnant person. If a fetus has a right to life, then the question
       is whether its right is sufficiently strong to outweigh someone's right to bodily autonomy--the right of
       individuals to determine what happens to their bodies.

       In A Defense of Abortion, for example, Judith Jarvis Thomson (1929-2020) set out to show that granting a fetus
       a right to life does not mean that its right is unlimited. She proposed the following thought experiment:
       Imagine that you wake up one morning and find yourself in the hospital lying next to a famous violinist,
       currently unconscious, with a fatal kidney ailment. The Society of Music Lovers has reviewed all the available

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                              10.1 · The Challenge of Bioethics 313

medical records and found you to be the only suitable match for the violinist. They kidnapped you and plugged
his circulatory system into yours so that your kidneys can filter out the poisons in his bloodstream. This will
cure him within nine hours. Do you have an obligation to stay plugged in? What if the time needed to cure him
is nine days? Nine months? Nine years? At what point does your freedom trump the violinist's right to life?
Thomson thus asserts that the right to life does not necessarily require someone to carry a fetus to term
(Thomson 1976). Because every person has a right to bodily autonomy, abortions are permissible in at least
some cases.
The Sanctity of Human Life
One of the most pervasive moral arguments against abortion is based on the idea of the sanctity of human life.
Those who oppose abortion on religious grounds often equate abortion with murder. Broader concerns warn
that if a society abandons the sanctity of human life, then it becomes easier to justify other types of killing
(Singer 1993). Within the United States, it was just a decade or so after abortion was legalized that the debate
on euthanasia arose.

Euthanasia

Euthanasia, the ending a human life to avoid suffering, is controversial, as, like abortion, it confronts our
belief in the sanctity of human life. Because of advances in medical technology and increased longevity, we can
now preserve and extend life in a variety of ways, even when someone is critically ill--and as a result, we face
new and difficult end-of-life decisions. Many families now grapple with the issues of euthanasia and physician-
assisted suicide.
Euthanasia translated from Greek simply means "good death." Euthanasia can be either passive or active. In
passive euthanasia, treatment is withheld or withdrawn with the expectation that a patient will die sooner
than they would with continued medical intervention. In active euthanasia, a patient's life is terminated using
medical interventions (e.g., administering a lethal dose of medication). In addition, euthanasia can be
voluntary, when it is at the patient's request, or nonvoluntary, when a patient is incapable of voluntarily
expressing their wishes (e.g., a patient in a persistent vegetative state) and the decision must be made by
someone else acting in their best interests.

FIGURE 10.3 What role should the field of medicine play in end-of-life decisions? Should modern medicine
facilitate termination of a patient's life in at least some situations? These are ethical concerns that did not face our
ancestors, who did not have the technology to make these questions possible. (credit: "100614-A-2082K-024" by
U.S. Army Photo/David Kidd/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
While voluntary active euthanasia is illegal in the United States, in countries such as Switzerland, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada, various laws mandate dosages for lethal injection for the
314 10 · Applied Ethics

       terminally ill who request help with this form of euthanasia (Ashford 2019). Voluntary passive euthanasia is
       legal in the United States and involves the withholding of lifesaving or life-sustaining measures with the
       consent of the patient. The most common form of this kind of euthanasia is an advanced directive known as a
       DNR, or "do not resuscitate," order, in which a person provides written instructions ahead of time, in the form
       of a "living will," not to restart the heart if it stops and/or not to put the person on a respirator if they cannot
       breathe on their own. Nonvoluntary passive euthanasia is the same withholding of treatment but without
       consent of the patient. This form of euthanasia can occur when a person has not made a living will, another
       form of advanced directive, and is not conscious or competent to make the decision about whether to extend
       care on their own behalf.

       Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) refers to a practice in which a physician provides the means (i.e., a
       prescription for a lethal dose of medication) and/or information to assist a patient in ending their own life. The
       American Medical Association has denounced physician-assisted suicide as unethical and is aligned with
       some significant court cases in its position (AMA 2016). Though a controversial practice, the passage of "death
       with dignity" laws has legalized the practice of physician-assisted suicide in California, Colorado, the District of
       Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington (Death with Dignity 2021).
       Physician-assisted suicide is distinguished from euthanasia because the patient terminates their own life,
       whereas euthanasia involves the active or passive termination of the patient's life by a physician.

       Utilitarian Views of Euthanasia

       Utilitarian philosophers generally advocate seeking the greatest happiness for the largest number of people.
       Utilitarians weigh the benefits of keeping a person alive against the suffering of the patient and their loved
       ones and the expense and opportunity costs of caring for the individual. Opportunity cost refers to what is lost
       by choosing one option over another. For example, choosing to keep a patient alive on a respirator means that
       this respirator cannot be used by another patient. A utilitarian would argue that if the patient on the respirator
       has no chance of recovery while other patients who may recover need the respirator, the respirator should be
       given to those with hope of recovery. In such a system of considerations, the benefits of keeping a patient alive
       may include the extra time the patient or the loved ones need to prepare for death and/or the preservation of
       the sanctity of life as a value within the community.

       Australian moral philosopher Peter Singer (b. 1946), arguing from the utilitarian point of view, supports
       euthanasia in most of its forms. In Singer's view, whether euthanasia is morally permissible depends in part on
       whether a person's life is still worth living, whether they still have quality of life. Singer holds that it is moral to
       help someone avoid the unnecessary pain of a prolonged death and immoral to withhold assistance when a
       person has voluntarily and consciously waived their right to life. The only form of euthanasia Signer opposes is
       involuntary euthanasia. Euthanasia is involuntary when the decision to euthanize is made without patient
       input and against their interests.

       Other Philosophical Views on Euthanasia

       American ethicist James Rachels (1941-2003) famously challenged the conventional view that active
       euthanasia is morally wrong whereas passive euthanasia is (at least sometimes) morally permissible. Rachels
       pointed out that in both active and passive euthanasia the intent is the same, to end suffering, and the result is
       the same, the termination of the patient's life. The difference, however, is that active euthanasia causes the
       immediate cessation of patient suffering, whereas passive euthanasia may result in prolonged suffering for the
       patient because death is not immediate. Passive euthanasia results in greater suffering than active euthanasia.
       Therefore, Rachels argued not only that active euthanasia is permissible in all cases where passive euthanasia
       is permissible but that active euthanasia is preferrable because it brings an immediate end to patient
       suffering.

       Some philosophers believe that euthanasia should be morally prohibited. They argue that the ethical harm to
       the community done by permitting euthanasia is greater than the benefit of ending suffering. They focus on

the wrongness of killing, the physician's role, and the potential slippery slope if euthanasia were widely
practiced. Those who oppose active euthanasia argue, for example, that it is wrong to kill another person or
that killing is incompatible with our concept of what it means to be a physician. In cases of active euthanasia, a
physician must take action to cause the termination of their patient's life. Physicians, however, first and
foremost aim to help others and above all do no harm. Practicing active euthanasia seems to therefore be at
odds with the very idea of a physician. Additionally, the practice of active euthanasia carries with it the
potential for misuse or abuse.
Clinical Trials
In order to test new medical interventions and establish a drug's dosage, determine possible side effects, and
demonstrate efficacy, scientists run clinical trials. Clinical trials can involve both animal and human subjects.
While it is essential to determine whether treatments are safe for general consumption, clinical trials,
especially those using human subjects, have been a source of ethical dilemmas. Since the Enlightenment,
many societies have adopted the Kantian value that humans should not be treated as a means to an end. Many
societies have likewise embraced the view, grounded in social contract theory, that all individuals have natural
rights, which make everyone equal before the law. (For more on social contract theory, see the chapter on
political theories.) These ethical and political values have consequences for clinical trials. They have raised
issues related to, for example, informed consent, access to medical resources, and whether the ends of using
human subjects justify the means. Identifying and debating these ethical issues can promote, where
applicable, changes to the way trials are conducted to address areas of concern.

Equipoise and Double-Blind Methods
In randomized clinical trials, a random process determines the treatment each participant receives.
Randomization is used to ensure that researchers don't influence data by assigning treatments based on
clinical assessment or other factors. Double-blind methods in clinical research refer to trials in which
information about the treatment a participant receives is not disclosed to either the patient or the researcher.
Randomization and double-blind methods create potential ethical issues because they seem to favor
producing good data over patient interests. In other words, such methods seem to value the science more than
the individual lives and health of the participants.
The principle of clinical equipoise offers a way to conduct randomized trials in a way that balances the
interests of participants and aims of science. A trial satisfies the principle of clinical equipoise when (1) there
are no treatments that exist that are better than the ones being used in the trial and (2) clinical evidence does
316 10 · Applied Ethics

       not favor the use of one of the treatments in the trial for the participants involved. If it obtains, clinical
       equipoise suggests that a trial does not sacrifice the interests of participants in the pursuit of scientific
       information and data. It balances the interests of trial participants and scientific interests in a clinical trial so
       one isn't pursued at the expense of the other.

       Four Guiding Principles

       Trials involving human subjects have historically been a source of difficult ethical issues. There are four main
       ethical principles that can guide our thinking whenever faced with ethical issues in physician and patient or
       researcher and participant relationships, namely the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence,
       and justice.

       Principle of autonomy: The principle of autonomy states that in clinical settings, patients have a right to
       exercise agency or self-determination when it comes to making decisions about their own health care. In
       clinical trials, participant autonomy is protected when potential participants are entered in a trial only after
       giving their informed consent. Informed consent means an individual is provided all the relevant information
       about a trial to make their own decision about whether to participate. Participant autonomy and informed
       consent protect participants from exploitation.

       Principle of beneficence: The principle of beneficence proposes that we should act in ways that benefit others
       or that are for the good of others. In research settings involving human subjects, researchers satisfy
       beneficence by considering the interests of participants, ensuring participants are treated fairly, and
       considering the good of research subjects in addition to advancing science (see clinical equipoise above).

       Principle of nonmaleficence: The principle of nonmaleficence states that we should act in ways that do not
       cause harm to others. In clinical settings, nonmaleficence requires that patients are not unnecessarily harmed.
       In some cases, a procedure, treatment, or test may result in some harm to the patient. Physicians practice
       nonmaleficence when any potential harms are considered and patients are subjected only to those that are
       necessary for effective treatment. In research trials, nonmaleficence requires that trials are designed in ways
       to limit harm to participants as much as possible.

       The principle of justice: The principle of justice insists that the distribution and practice of health care should
       be equitable or fair. In clinical settings, the way patients are treated and the care they receive should be similar
       in relevant circumstances, and similar cases should be treated similarly. In clinical trials, the principle of
       justice dictates that researchers treat all participants fairly and equally. Researchers should not, for instance,
       give special treatment to some participants. Additionally, trial design and participation requirements should
       be fair and promote the impartial treatment of participants.

       In the arena of human experimentation, modern safeguards and guidelines were created in response to
       historical cases of exploitation and abuse. The Nuremburg Code, for example, represents the first attempt to
       establish guidelines for clinical trials created in response to the abuses and horrors perpetrated by Nazi
       physicians during World War II. The creation of institutional review boards (IRBs) was another method to
       mitigate ethical issues posed by clinical trials. IRBs comprised of experts in science, medicine, and the law are
       tasked with reviewing and vetting parameters of trials to protect participants and identify potential issues.
       Clinical trial guidelines and IRBs aim to promote that all trials with human subjects adhere to the four ethical
       principles above and protect participant privacy and confidentiality.

       Human Trials in Historically Marginalized Communities

       Historically marginalized communities and members of vulnerable populations have been especially
       susceptible to exploitation when participating in trials and research involving human subjects. Vulnerable
       populations have been particularly susceptible to coercion. Coercion, whether explicit or implicit, undermines
       a person's autonomy because it makes informed consent and the exercise of agency impossible. It can occur,
       for instance, in cases where researchers do not explain the parameters of a trial or misrepresent it in some

way to elicit consent from prospective trial participants.

In the United States, the Tuskegee syphilis study (1932-1972) is perhaps the most notorious example of a trial
that exploited individuals from marginalized communities. Over a period of 40 years, researchers tracked the
progression of syphilis in a group of some 400 Black men to determine whether it differed in any way when
compared to its progression in White men. The subjects were Black sharecroppers who, like many Americans,
were experiencing increased hardships and difficulties because of the Great Depression (1929 to late 1930s).
The desperate situation of potential subjects was exploited by recruiters who used the allure of free food and
medical care to get their consent to participate in the study. The trial aimed to study the progression of
untreated syphilis in human subjects. Researchers not only withheld the fact that participants had syphilis but
also intentionally withheld treatment as well. Even when a treatment for syphilis was discovered in 1947
(penicillin), subjects in the Tuskegee experiment still received no treatment. The interests and rights of trial
participants (e.g., their health, well-being, autonomy, and life) were ignored and abused for the sake of science
(Taylor n.d.).

The Tuskegee experiment and experimentation conducted by Nazi physicians on human subjects during
World War II are examples in which vulnerable populations are exploited and treated as expendable in the
pursuit of scientific knowledge. When subjects are recruited in exploitative trials, their "consent" is often a
consequence of coercion, whether explicit or implicit. Issues of coercion occur when recruiters, for example,
withhold important information about the trial, misrepresent trial goals, take advantage of participants'
desperate situations, and fail to adequately bridge language barriers to ensure trial parameters and
participation requirements are understood.

Normative Moral Frameworks Applied to Clinical Trials

The four main ethical concepts discussed above can (and should) guide decision-making in a clinical setting.
Not only do normative moral frameworks provide additional and more robust guidance for moral decision
making and conduct, but their application to specific issues can also shed light on why we support the
adoption of ethical practices.

Utilitarians like Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) proposed that the rightness
of an action is determined by its consequences, by what it produces. They argued that we act morally when our
actions produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number. In clinical trials, the utilitarian emphasis on
consequences and, in particular, happiness provides a framework that may help us balance scientific/research
goals and the interests of human research subjects. Mill argued that we should assess the morality of an action
from the standpoint of an impartial, benevolent spectator. We are impartial when we consider everyone's
happiness, including our own, equally and don't give preference to some individuals' or some groups'
happiness or interests over others. We are benevolent when we strive to choose those actions that produce the
most overall happiness and do not sacrifice the happiness of some for the happiness of others. Clinical trials
ought to weigh the interests of human subjects carefully and be conducted in ways that do not sacrifice the
subjects' interests for the sake of science. Research is often funded by the private sector. Companies pursuing
new treatments and interventions must balance their interests in profits, the costs associated with research
and clinical trials, the aims of science, and the interests of the human subjects in their trials. If decisions are
not made with these interests in mind, it is possible that choices in how clinical trials are conducted may be
made not based on producing the greatest overall happiness but rather to increase overall profits for certain
individuals or private groups.

     CONNECTIONS

The chapter on normative moral theory provides a framework for the philosophy of utilitarianism and
deontology.

A deontologist like Kant would examine the relevant rules and norms that apply to clinical trials. For Kant, an
318 10 · Applied Ethics

       important rule that must be considered when using human research subjects is the imperative to always treat
       all persons as ends in themselves, never as means only. In other words, Kant believed that all people have
       inherent worth and value that is not dependent simply on usefulness for some end or goal. Kant's ethics
       emphasizes the rights of human subjects and makes clear that potential research subjects must make an
       informed, free decision whether to participate in a clinical trial. Additionally, human beings' rights cannot be
       ignored or denied because some other end (e.g., the goals of science, profits, or even greater human interests)
       is deemed more valuable. A Kantian approach would affirm the rights, choice, and autonomy of trial
       participants.
       Care ethics takes a character-centered approach, but it makes the values of caring central in our moral
       deliberation and decision-making. Care ethics uses the caring relationship as the ethical paradigm and thus
       highlights the importance of subjective and concrete factors when evaluating the rightness of certain actions
       and choices. In clinical trials, care ethics reminds us to value all humans and consider the importance of
       virtues like compassion and empathy when interacting with and treating patients.

      Human Augmentation and Genetic Modification

       Human augmentation refers to attempts to enhance or increase human capabilities through technological,
       biomedical, or other interventions. While the notion of enhancement is broad, philosopher Eric Juengst and
       psychiatrist Daniel Moseley define it as "biomedical interventions that are used to improve human form or
       functioning beyond what is necessary to restore or sustain health" (Juengst and Moseley 2019). Human
       augmentation, then, refers to interventions sought not for individual health but for the sake of improving an
       individual's capabilities and functioning. For example, the cyclist Lance Armstrong famously won the Tour de
       France seven years in a row (1999-2005). Armstrong became infamous, however, when he was later stripped
       of his titles after it became clear that he had practiced "blood doping" to improve his performance when
       competing in the Tour de France. He used illegal and banned interventions to enhance his performance and
       gain an unfair edge over competition. There are many potential biomedical interventions (e.g.,
       pharmacological) that can be used to improve or enhance capabilities in certain areas, and it can often be
       difficult to clearly define why some raise moral concerns and others do not. Many people, for instance, ingest
       caffeine on a regular basis. Caffeine is a mild stimulant that may enhance capabilities, but caffeine use is
       accepted and generally does not raise moral concerns. In contrast, using Adderall, a pharmaceutical
       amphetamine salt, not as prescribed for medical and health reasons but to enhance energy levels and memory
       is the sort of intervention that is often viewed as ethically problematic.

Advancements in human biotechnology have created an opportunity for some people to exercise genetic
choices that could yield potential therapeutic benefits and make it possible to augment human capacities
through genetic modification. Developments in gene editing technologies like CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats), for example, have made genetic modification easier, faster, and more
affordable. New technologies have also demonstrated the potential of gene editing.
The characteristics of an organism can be deliberately modified and altered through genetic engineering.
Genetic modification has been practiced in agriculture to intentionally alter the characteristics of certain crops
(e.g., rice and corn) so that plants, for example, produce higher yields, are more robust, and have increased
nutritional properties. Human augmentation through genetic engineering raises numerous ethical concerns. If
genetic information is altered to promote certain traits, then how we define "positive" and "negative" genetic
traits could have far-reaching consequences. Positive genetic traits will naturally be ones that are promoted
and reinforced, whereas negative genetic traits will be reduced and eliminated. In the future, if human genetic
modification becomes widely practiced, it is possible that a focus on "positive" genetic traits will decrease
human genetic diversity, making us less adaptable and more vulnerable.
A Utilitarian Approach to Genetic Engineering
Whether a utilitarian would find the practice of genetic engineering morally permissible when applied to
humans would depend, as it so often does, on how it is used. Utilitarians would likely find human
augmentation through gene editing a morally worthwhile endeavor if it improved overall human welfare and
happiness. For instance, utilitarians would support the use of genetic modification to eliminate disease and
disability. If it turns out to be an extremely costly intervention, however, utilitarians might not support it on the
grounds that only the very wealthy would be able to access it.
New advancements in biotechnology often come with high costs, making it so only the wealthiest can afford
them. If the costs of human genetic modification are too high, many people won't be able to access such
interventions, and it will worsen the inequality gap. Imagine if prospective parents were able to access gene
editing technologies to modify their offspring's genetic traits. If these services are only accessible to the very
wealthy, then naturally only the select few and their offspring will benefit from them. Such a scenario would no
doubt have negative social implications. The inequality gap would widen, the children of wealthy parents
would have numerous advantages over other children, and it might even lay the groundwork for new forms of
discrimination and oppression.
Utilitarians argue that conduct is morally right if it promotes the greatest happiness for the greatest number.
320 10 · Applied Ethics

       Human augmentation through genetic engineering has the potential to increase quality of life by curing or
       preventing illness and eliminating certain forms of disability, but it could also negatively impact society by, for
       example, widening the inequality gap, benefiting only a very small percentage of the population, and laying the
       groundwork for new forms of discrimination. Whether utilitarians support the use of gene editing technologies
       on humans depends on how such technologies are used and whether their use promotes the greatest good for
       the greatest number. There are numerous ethical quagmires ahead in the arena of gene editing, but at the
       same time, this technology holds the promise of eradicating the most terrible of human diseases and thus
       eliminating unnecessary suffering and improving quality of life. Utilitarians argue that all potential benefits
       and harms need to be carefully considered and weighed to determine whether gene editing technologies are
       used in a morally responsible way.

       Gene Editing and Biodiversity

       Some ethicists argue that we should distinguish between somatic cell interventions and germ-line
       interventions when discussing the morality of human genetic modification. In somatic cell interventions,
       genetic changes cannot be inherited or passed to a patient's offspring. In germ-line interventions (inheritable
       genetic modification), however, genetic changes can be passed down to future generations (Gannett 2008). Any
       genetic modifications that result from germ-line interventions are inheritable and therefore have the potential
       to become part of the larger human gene pool. Ethicists have identified numerous ethical issues and concerns
       related to inheritable genetic modification. For example, it is unclear what long-term effects would result from
       gene modification, future generations cannot consent to genetic modification, and germ-line interventions
       may have a negative effect on biodiversity.

       Some ethicists also argue that the distinction between therapy and enhancement is morally relevant when
       considering genetic modification. A gene editing therapy (or negative genetic modification) is an intervention
       that is pursued to "restore normal function," whereas a gene editing enhancement (or positive genetic
       modification) is an intervention that is pursued to enhance or increase normal capacities and functioning
       (Gannett 2008). Ethicists argue that genetic modification is morally permissible when it aims at therapy and
       morally impermissible when it aims at enhancement. A therapy only aims to return an individual to a normal
       state of health, but an enhancement aims to go beyond an individual's normal capabilities. In cases of
       enhancement, however, interventions are pursued because patients possess a desire to go beyond their
       current capacities. The latter run a greater risk of having unknown and long-term effects on the gene pool and
       genetic diversity.

       Genetic diversity is important for any species to thrive, evolve, and adapt. If genetic engineering is widely
       practiced, it is possible that modification will focus on certain favored traits. This would result in less
       biodiversity within the species and would threaten humanity in unforeseen ways. For instance, it is possible
       that a less diverse gene pool would make the human species vulnerable to some unknown future illness. The
       concern is that the more homogenous and narrow our gene pool becomes, the less adaptable we become as a
       species. Like all technologies that are new and that push the boundaries of what's possible, it is hard to
       imagine all the possible (positive or negative) consequences that exist on the horizon until we use them and
       are able to gather data to help us better understand the implications of their use.

       Patenting of Genetic Material

       Before 1980, the United States did not consider living organisms patentable because they were considered
       naturally occurring entities. This changed in 1980 when the US Supreme Court issued its decision in Diamond
       v. Chakrabarty, which found that a genetically modified bacterial strain could be patented because "it was
       `man-made' and not naturally occurring" (Gannett 2008). The court's decision opened a door that allowed
       individuals, institutions, and private entities to patent organisms that they genetically modified and even
       patent specific genes when they were first to identify them. This made it possible for private entities to gain the
       exclusive rights to develop diagnostics for specific genes. Myriad Genetics, for example, "patented BRCA1 and
       BRCA2 breast and ovarian cancer genes and granted Eli Lilly exclusive rights to market applications based on

                                                                                                                                                     10.2 · Environmental Ethics 321

the BRCA1 sequence" (Gannett 2008). Eli Lilly's exclusive rights allowed it to charge patients thousands of
dollars to get tested for cancers resulting from the BRCA mutations, as well as charge researchers who worked
to develop a deeper understanding of these genes and their role in the development of cancer.

Philosophers debate whether patenting genetic material is an ethical practice. Some philosophers think gene
patents are generally beneficial and not morally problematic. They argue, for example, that patents are an
important reward and help motivate researchers, they incentivize progress and scientific advancement, and
gene patents benefit society because they lead to the development of better, more affordable medical testing
and intervention. Other philosophers, in contrast, raise doubts about the morality of gene patents. They argue,
for example, that gene patents impede scientific progress by encouraging secrecy, they reward the pursuit of
commercial interests, they award private entities the exclusive right to develop market applications and
embolden them to drive up the costs of medical testing and treatment, and genes are naturally occurring and
not the sort of thing that should be patentable.

An ethical position on gene patenting depends on what factors and outcomes are considered to be morally
relevant. Ethicists debate whether gene patents are generally beneficial or not, whether they produce more
good or harm. They explore how they impact scientific progress and development, question whether they
create conflicts of interest that harm patients or contribute to higher medical costs, and debate what makes
something intellectual property.

         THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

Genetic engineering is the process by which scientists modify or alter a gene to improve an organism in some way.
Genetic engineering is currently a common tool of science: for example, some crops such as corn have been
modified to be more resistant to certain types of bugs and pests. More recently, the COVID-19 vaccine was created
by using mRNA genetic sequencing to help an individual's body recognize the COVID virus. However, many have
raised concerns about the potential for genetic engineering to be used to change attributes of human beings.

In one or more paragraphs, address the following questions, and provide examples to support your position. Is it
moral for parents to genetically engineer an embryo for the purposes of producing a healthier child than they would
otherwise produce without such technology? How about a more physically beautiful or intelligent child? Why or why
not? Do you consider there to be significant differences between the two aims (health versus beauty or
intelligence)?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the current environmental and climate crisis.
  · Describe different philosophical positions pertaining to humanity's relationships to the natural environment.
  · Identify the circumstances that have led to marginalized groups being especially affected by climate disasters.

Before environmental ethics emerged as an academic discipline in the 1970s, some people were already
questioning and rethinking our relationship to the natural world. Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac,
published in 1949, called upon humanity to expand our idea of community to include the entire natural world,
grounding this approach in the belief that all of nature is connected and interdependent in important ways.
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962) drew attention to the dangers of what were then commonly used
commercial pesticides. Carson's essays drew attention to the far-reaching impacts of human activity and its
potential to cause significant harm to the environment and to humanity in turn. These early works inspired
the environmentalist movement and sparked debates about how to deal with emerging environmental
challenges.

      The Emerging Crisis

       Humans directly and indirectly change and shape the natural world. Our reliance on fossil fuels to meet our
       energy needs, for example, releases a key greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), into the air as a result.
       Greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, resulting in changes in the planet's climate. The two
       countries that produce the most CO2 are the United States and China. The United States is the biggest gasoline
       consumer in the world, using approximately 338 million gallons of gasoline per day. China is the biggest coal
       consumer, burning approximately three billion tons of coal in 2020--more than half of the worldwide total
       consumption of coal. Our demand for the energy provided by fossil fuels to power our industries, heat our
       homes, and make possible travel between distant locations is the main factor that has contributed to increased
       levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
       Human activities have had and continue to have significant impacts on the natural world. The term
       anthropogenic climate change refers to changes in Earth's climate caused or influenced by human activity.
       Severe weather and natural disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity because of the changing
       climate. As just one example, record-setting wildfires were experienced in recent years in both the United
       States and Australia. In a span of just five years (2017-2021), the United States experienced four of the most
       severe and deadliest wildfires in its history, all of which occurred in California: the 2017 Tubbs Fire, the 2018
       Camp Fire, the 2020 Bay Area Fire, and the 2021 Dixie Fire. In 2020, Australia experienced its most
       catastrophic bushfire season when roughly 19 million hectares burned, destroying over three thousand homes
       and killing approximately 1.25 billion animals.

Environmental ethics is an area of applied ethics that attempts to identify right conduct in our relationship
with the nonhuman world. For decades, scientists have expressed concern about the short- and long-term
effects that human activities are having on the climate and Earth's ecosystems. Many philosophers argue that
in order to change our behaviors in ways that result in healing of the natural world, we need to change our
thinking about the agency and value of the nonhuman elements (including plants, animals, and even entities
such as rivers and mountains) that share the globe with us.

Political and Legal Dimensions

The environmental movement began with specific worries about air and water pollution and the effects of
pesticides on food crops. Rachel Carson's Silent Spring was influential in the creation of nonprofit
organizations and government agencies, such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), designed to
protect human health and the environment. Agencies like the EPA can significantly affect national policy and
aspects of the economy related to emissions from factories, use of and disposal of toxic chemicals, and nearly
anything else that can adversely impact the environment or human health.
Legal approaches to protecting the environment vary from country to country. The economic drive to produce
quickly and efficiently with little to no regulation pits many industrializing countries against the more
established economies in Western Europe and North America. China, for example, which currently contributes
43 percent of the world's annual carbon emissions, is attempting to enact policies that extend beyond mere
cleanup to foster regeneration of ecological systems (Gardner 2019). With unaddressed environmental
concerns, China is currently facing a loss of financial and intellectual capital as 60 percent of citizens with a
net worth of $1.5 million or more have emigrated.
International efforts to address the climate crisis have met with mixed success. In 1985, after scientists
discovered that some aerosol sprays were causing holes in the ozone layer in the atmosphere, 20 countries
initiated the Montreal Protocol, which banned the use of these sprays. The international community rapidly
adopted the agreement, and today 197 countries have signed the treaty. One major reason for this success,
however, is that these sprays were relatively easy and inexpensive to replace. Such is not the case for global
climate change. Currently, there is no single, viable alternative to the carbon economy--a term used to
reference our current economic dependence on carbon-based fuels such as petroleum and coal. Renewable
energy sources, such as solar panels, are available, but not at the scale needed to fuel high-energy and high-
324 10 · Applied Ethics

       consumption lifestyles. More than 150 countries have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on
       Climate Change (UNFCCC), which laid the groundwork for the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and the Paris Agreement
       (2015). With these agreements, most nations have committed to future goals for reducing fossil fuel emissions,
       but to date no nation has made significant progress toward these goals. Climate change is a complex problem,
       intrinsically tied to an economy that depends on access to inexpensive and abundant fuel sources. It is also a
       problem that cannot be addressed by one nation or group alone but rather calls attention to the shared nature
       of our planetary ecosystem and the impact that activities in one location have on every other life.

      Philosophical Contributions to Environmental Ethics

       Instrumental Value of Nature

       Traditional Western philosophies have been anthropocentric (human-centered), as discussed in the chapter
       on value theory. Humans are regarded as the sole possessors of intrinsic value, meaning that each human life
       is understood to possess value in itself and for its own sake. The natural world, on the other hand, has been
       viewed as having instrumental value, understood as having value solely as a means to satisfy human needs
       and desires. From ancient Greece to the Enlightenment, philosophers and scientists have studied the natural
       world with the goal of understanding how better to use it to achieve the goals of human societies.

       Anthropocentric Obligations

       Empiricism is often traced back to the work of Francis Bacon (1561-1626), whose experimental techniques led
       to the development of the scientific method and who advocated an inductive approach to scientific inquiry in
       his essay Novum Organum. According to Bacon, when nature becomes the object of study, it can be completely
       manipulated and used in accordance with God's original plan for humanity on Earth. Bacon held the prevailing
       Christian view that God gave human beings dominion over the nonhuman world. Unlike an autonomous
       subject, an object can be treated without regard, manipulated for study, and exploited as a resource--all of
       which occurred as capitalism evolved in Western countries (Bacon 1878). Contemporary Western societies
       have viewed science and technology as an important vehicle for empowering humanity to manipulate and
       control nature, to force nature to bend to our will.

       Early advocates of the environmental movement in the West associated this anthropocentric (human-
       centered) perspective with the environment crisis. In a well-known essay, "The Historical Roots of Our
       Ecological Crisis" (1967), Lynn White argues that the way we think about the environment has its roots in
       Judeo-Christian thinking that maintains the superiority of humans over the nonhuman world and teaches that
       the natural world was created for human use. If nature only has instrumental value, then we do not violate
       morality when we manipulate, destroy, or otherwise harm nature.

       Some philosophers, however, point out that this same anthropocentric approach has the potential to foster an
       ethics of environmental care. According to this perspective, moral obligations concerning our treatment of the
       natural world can be justified by appealing to human interests and the desire for self-preservation. For
       example, we might argue that all humans have an interest in having access to clean air and drinkable water
       and in ensuring the longevity of Earth for future generations to enjoy. These basic interests that all humans
       share can be used as a basis for establishing moral obligations to reduce pollution, create more sustainable
       practices, and take actions to diminish harm caused to the environment by human activity.

       In People or Penguins: The Case for Optimal Pollution (1974), for example, William Baxter offers an
       unapologetically anthropocentric environmental ethic. Baxter adopts a traditional view that assigns intrinsic
       value only to persons. He proposes that the fact that some harm has come to certain aspects of the nonhuman
       world is, in itself, not enough to justify moral responsibility. "Damage to penguins, or sugar pines, or geological
       marvels is, without more, simply irrelevant" (Baxter 1974, 5). That acknowledged, Baxter goes on to state that
       a moral obligation to the nonhuman world does exist, because human interests are intrinsically tied to the
       natural world. When it comes to pollution, for example, Baxter argues that we have a moral obligation to
       balance the benefits we get from causing pollution with the harm caused by pollution to establish a level of

pollution that is optimal.

One proposed solution to the environmental crisis, in line with an anthropocentric approach, is to levy taxes
on people and corporations when their activities are deemed detrimental to society and/or to planetary health.
Currently, in the United States, many states levy extra taxes on the purchase of cigarettes and alcohol, above
and beyond the established sales tax. These extra taxes are justified by pointing out that these products are
detrimental to human health and that their consumption puts an unnecessary burden on the state's health
care systems. Some economists recommend using a similar approach to control environmental impact. In this
scenario, a tax cost or liability would be imposed on companies or individuals who cause harm to the
environment. A carbon emissions tax is an example of a such a tax. Of course, rewarding positive behavior
could also work, for example, by giving tax breaks or other types of rewards to organizations that are working
toward environmental sustainability. These policies align with the anthropocentric approach in that they hold
organizations accountable for the harm they are doing to human society and human interests.

In stark contrast to the anthropocentricism that has long dominated Western thinking about the environment,
deep ecology, a term first coined by Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess (1912-2009), assumes that all living
things are valuable in their own right (Naess 1973). If all life has intrinsic value, then all life is deserving of
respect. Deep ecology thus advocates a practice of restraint when it comes to the environment and to
nonhuman life.

Deep ecology argues that we need to fundamentally change how we think about ourselves and our relationship
to nature. This approach proposes that it is wrong to view ourselves as individual, separate entities. Instead, all
of nature, including human beings, should be understood in terms of their relationships with everything else.
This interrelatedness implies a responsibility to act in ways that respect the intrinsic value of all living things
and promote life in the broadest sense. For deep ecologists, a first step in this approach is to become sensitive
to and aware of the deep relationships that exist between everything in nature. Aware that we are more than
this body and this mind, that we are members of a larger whole, we recognize that we have an obligation to
promote and care for the natural world. Naess thought of deep ecology as a movement promoting a radical new
worldview that contrasted sharply with the traditional view that valued nature only as a means to human ends.

Critics of deep ecology sometimes note that it is a position of privilege taken by people in developed nations
and that less industrialized countries may not be in a position to respect the environment in the same way
when their own survival is at risk. Environmental initiatives may be challenging for smaller, less industrialized
countries to pursue. In these nations, the call to environmentalism may ring hollow to those who face a daily
struggle for food or clean water.

Social Ecology

Social ecologists see environmental problems as stemming from the same faulty political and economic
system that promotes inequity and is responsible for racism, sexism, and classism. In this view, capitalism has
created a system of domination over both humanity and nature and has turned nature into just one more
commodity. Murray Bookchin (1921-2006), an American political philosopher and a founder of social ecology,
was highly influential in this line of thought. Bookchin believed that most, if not all, of the problems that make
up our current environmental crisis are the result of long-standing social problems. He argued that the only
way to address our ecological problems is to address our social problems. Bookchin proposed that we change
society by rejecting large political structures and big business and empowering smaller, locally based groups
that are more tied to their environments and thus more environmentally aware.

       Concerns have also been raised about the unequal impact environmental problems have on different segments
       of society. Robert Bullard's 1990 book Dumping in Dixie argues that environmentalism is intertwined with
       issues of racial and socioeconomic equity. It is thus not just an issue of individual health but rather a concern
       about the health of communities. Historically marginalized communities in particular are statistically more
       likely to be exposed to environmental dangers. One egregious and well-publicized example of these types of
       dangers is the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. In 2014, it was realized that drinking water in Flint was
       contaminated with high levels of lead. This contamination was the result of a decision made by emergency
       managers appointed by the state government to switch Flint's water supply from the Detroit water system to
       the Flint River, in order to save money. The Flint River water not only contained bacteria and carcinogens but
       also leached lead from the pipes that brought water to people's homes. As a result, many suffered from rashes,
       hair loss, and elevated blood levels of lead (Denchak 2018). Another example can be seen in the South Bronx,
       in New York City. This area is sometimes referred to as an "island of pollution," as it lies at the confluence of
       three major highways. The pollution from the traffic has resulted in an increase in asthma diagnoses and
       asthma-related hospitalizations in those living in this neighborhood, the majority of them Black Americans,
       Latinos, and new immigrants (Butini 2018).
       Similar differences in environmental dangers can be observed on a global scale. A 2016 United Nations report
       reported that people in developing countries are more likely to live on land that has been exposed to
       contamination and chemical pollutants than those in wealthier nations (United Nations 2016).

corporate responsibility and the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. Additionally, a great deal of work in
these subfields supports the development and implementation of codes of ethics used by organizations to
guide the conduct of their members. This section explores both these broader issues and the practical
concerns.

Codes of Ethics

A business is defined as an organization that engages in selling goods and services with the intent to make a
profit. Governments generally restrict the activities of businesses through laws and regulations. To ensure that
their members act in accordance with these laws and regulations and to meet additional goals that reflect the
values of the societies in which they operate, businesses often create a code of ethics. These codes outline what
actions are and are not permissible for an organization and for its individual employees. They address
concrete matters, such as bribery, discrimination, and whistleblowing, while also laying out guidelines for how
to accomplish environmental and social goals and how to build and maintain trust and goodwill.

Businesses are not the sole entities, however, that issue such codes of ethics. Professional organizations
serving specific groups, such as nurses and teachers, also issue these codes, and members must study them
and commit to abide by them in order to be qualified as members of these professional organizations. Within
the fields of science and technology, for example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Computer
Society (IEEE-CS) provides a wealth of resources for computer science and engineering professionals,
including education, certification, research, and career and solutions centers. In 2000, the IEEE-CS adopted
the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, which defines the ethical obligations of
software engineers. These obligations include a commitment to approve software only if it meets certain
specifications and passes appropriate tests, is deemed safe, and does not threaten to diminish the quality of
human life, impinge on privacy, or harm the environment (IEEE-CS/ACM Joint Task Force 2001). Determining
what would constitute outcomes such as diminishing the quality of life or impinging on privacy ties these
concrete codes of ethics to larger questions that involve normative moral theories and political debate.

Corporate Responsibility

Businesses range from small family-owned organizations to large corporations. Governments often allow for
businesses to classify themselves as one or more legal entities, each of which must fulfill specific legal
requirements. Corporations are considered to be single entities distinct from the individuals who compose
them. Early in the modern era in the West, a business was understood to be a collection of individuals who
could be held responsible if something went wrong. Historians of business trace the birth of the modern
corporation to the Dutch East India Trading Company, founded in 1602. As noted, modern corporations are
legal entities understood to be separate from the individuals who work there. This definition allows individuals
to engage in business practices without necessarily bearing the legal consequences of the business's actions.
Instead, the business entities are held accountable and usually punished with financial penalties.

The status of corporations is a hotly debated topic in the United States, with many arguing that the rights of
corporations have expanded in inappropriate ways in recent decades. For example, the Supreme Court of the
United States recently ruled that companies can contribute to political elections and that some for-profit
corporations may refuse on religious grounds to cover birth control in their employee health plans (Totenberg
2014). Some argue that these legal rights challenge or threaten other ethical expectations acknowledged in
contemporary US society. We can rationally ask whether the legal rights of corporations also imply that these
entities have moral responsibilities. Moreover, to whom are corporations morally responsible: shareholders,
employees, customers, or the community?

Interests of Shareholders and Stakeholders

In 1970, Milton Friedman published a now-famous essay in the New York Times in which he argues that
businesses have a moral responsibility to increase profits (Friedman 1970). Friedman makes the case that all
individuals acting on behalf of a firm have an obligation to make decisions that will result in the increase of a
328 10 · Applied Ethics

       business's profits and thus the profits of shareholders. He argued that employees that make decisions on
       behalf of a company are obligated to take whatever actions will maximize profits. From Friedman's
       perspective, it is the responsibility of government to impose regulations that rein in businesses, which should
       be motivated only by a desire to benefit themselves, so that they don't act in ways that cause harm to society.
       A company, Friedman argued, is owned by shareholders, who have a right to the maximum return possible on
       their investment. Shareholders, also referred to as stockholders, are individuals who own a share of a
       corporation. Shareholders invest capital and receive a positive return on their investment when a company is
       profitable. Friedman's position favors the interests of the shareholders. Stakeholders, in contrast, are any
       individuals who have a stake in a business's operations. Stakeholders include but are not limited to employees,
       customers, shareholders, communities, and the like. So while the term shareholders refers to a relatively
       narrow group of individuals who have invested capital and own a portion of a given corporation, the term
       stakeholders refers to a much wider group and includes individuals who have not simply invested money but
       who are affected by the business's operations.
       Some argue for the view of shareholder primacy--that a firm's managers ought to act solely for the interests of
       shareholders--based on deontological grounds. Such positions appeal to the concept of duty to justify an
       obligation to promote the interests of shareholders. In this view, shareholders invest capital and own (a portion
       of) a company, and executives are tasked with running the firm in the shareholders' best interests. In contrast
       to shareholder primacy, stakeholder theory argues that "managers should seek to `balance' the interests of all
       stakeholders, where a stakeholder is anyone who has a `stake,' or interest (including a financial interest), in the
       firm" (Moriarty 2021). While shareholder theory asserts that the principal obligation is to increase the wealth
       of shareholders, stakeholder theory differs insofar as it advocates using corporate revenue in the interests of
       all stakeholders.
       Safety and Liability
       Today, corporations in the United States are held to standards of workplace safety established by the
       Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), created in 1971. Such government regulation of
       corporations is relatively new. After the Industrial Revolution, which began in the mid-18th century,
       manufacturing created new work models based on production efficiency, some of which created hazards for
       workers. Early classical economists like Adam Smith (1723-1790) advocated for a laissez-faire, or "hands off,"
       approach to business, in which there was minimal interference on the part of government in the activities of
       companies or manufacturing firms (Smith 2009). Once the Industrial Revolution was well established, workers
       in factories were expected to labor for long hours with few breaks, in very dangerous conditions. They received
       little pay, and children were commonly part of the workforce. While philosophers like Karl Marx and Friedrich
       Engels called for a revolutionary change--to replace the capitalist economic system with a communistic
       system--others called for political reforms (Marx and Engels 2002). Little by little, laws were passed to protect
       workers, beginning with the 1833 Factory Act in the United Kingdom (UK Parliament n.d.).

FIGURE 10.9 Safety helmets and other protective equipment are a common sight at construction sites today, but
safety was not always a primary concern in the workplace. (credit: "SRR Construction Employees Reach 12-Year
Milestone of Working Safe" by Savannah River Site/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
More recent legislation affords employees the right to lodge confidential complaints against their employer.
Complaints may point to hazards in the workplace, work-related illnesses, or anything else that endangers
employee health and safety. If concerns are verified, the company must correct these violations or face fines
from the government. Cutting costs in manufacturing processes, while it theoretically should increase
shareholder profits, can be dangerous to both employees and the public and ultimately harm a company's
long-term profits. For example, consider the Firestone/Ford tire controversy at the turn of the 21st century. An
investigation into unusually high rates of tire failure, which resulted in thousands of accidents and 271
fatalities worldwide, brought forth multiple lawsuits and a congressional investigation in the United States.
These were Firestone tires on Ford vehicles. Millions of tires were recalled, costing Firestone and Ford billions
of dollars. Consequently, a number of executives at both companies resigned or were fired (Jones 2000).
Meaningful Work
Modern multinational corporations are entities that operate throughout the world, the largest employing over a
million people. The relationship between corporations and their employees is an important area of focus in
business ethics. Analyzing the moral obligations that corporations have toward their employees is more
important than ever as large firms continue to gain power and control within the market.
We spend a significant part of our lives at work. The experience of working is one that most people are familiar
with. The Scottish moral philosopher Adam Smith (1723-90), famously expressed concern with the trend he
observed toward increased specialization in work in order to improve efficiency and increase production.
While good for production and profits, Smith observed that specialization made work repetitive, mindless, and
mechanical (Smith 2009). Smith worried that such work was harmful because it wasn't meaningful in the
sense that it didn't require skill, offered workers no opportunities to make choices, and was highly repetitive
and uninteresting. While Smith expressed concern about the lack of meaningful work, he did not believe
businesses have an obligation to provide it.
Unlike Smith, later philosophers such as Norman Bowie have argued "that one of the moral obligations of the
firm is to provide meaningful work for employees" (Bowie 1998, 1083). Applying a Kantian perspective, Bowie
develops a robust concept of meaningful work based on the belief that people must always be treated as ends
in themselves. To treat people as ends means respecting them as rational agents capable of freely directing
their own lives. He argues that to treat a person as anything other than an end is to strip them of their moral
status. Bowie characterizes meaningful work as work that (1) a worker freely chooses, (2) pays enough for a
worker to satisfy their basic needs, (3) provides workers opportunities to exercise their autonomy and
330 10 · Applied Ethics

       independence, (4) fosters rational development, (5) supports moral development, and (6) does not interfere
       with a worker's pursuit of happiness. As Bowie sees it, meaningful work recognizes the important role work
       plays in a person's development. It is through work that we develop our ability to act autonomously and live
       independently (Bowie 1998). Importantly, when workers earn a living wage, they acquire the means to be
       independent, live their own lives, and pursue their idea of a happy life. When workers are not paid a living
       wage, they are not treated as human beings deserving of respect. We see this, for instance, in the United States,
       where some workers who are employed full time by large corporations earn so little that they qualify for
       government assistance programs. In such cases, Bowie believes that workers cannot be truly independent
       because they do not earn enough to cover their basic needs.

       Fair Treatment of Workers in an Age of Globalization

       In some countries, labor laws are minimal or nonexistent, and workers may face the same level of danger that
       factory workers experienced in the West in the 19th century. Often such operations supply goods for US
       companies and a Western market. During the 20th century, most US corporations relocated their
       manufacturing overseas in order to save money. These savings were passed on to consumers as cheaper goods
       but also resulted in large-scale job loss for American workers and the economic decline of many US cities and
       towns (Correnti 2013). Outsourced labor has also been accused of exploiting workers in other countries, where
       government regulation and protection may not even exist. On the one hand, if there is no law to violate, some
       may argue that corporations are not doing anything wrong. Moreover, people working in these factories are
       paid a wage that may be more than they can earn any other way. Nonetheless, most would acknowledge that
       there must be some standard of morality and fair employment practices, even when the government does not
       provide it. Regardless of where labor is procured, it carries dilemmas regarding balancing just treatment of
       workers with company profits.

       Equity through Affirmative Action

       Affirmative action refers to taking positive steps "to increase the representation of women and minorities in
       areas of employment, education, and culture from which they have been historically excluded" (Fullinwider
       2018). The goal of increasing representation of underrepresented and historically excluded groups is
       understood to be desirable not simply to increase diversity but also to provide examples that affirm
       possibilities for those in underrepresented and marginalized groups. Affirmative action has never mandated
       "quotas" but instead has used training programs, outreach efforts, and other positive steps to make the
       workplace more diverse. The goal has been to encourage companies to actively recruit underrepresented
       groups. In application processes (e.g., for employment or college admissions), affirmative action sometimes
       entails giving preference to certain individuals based on race, ethnicity, or gender. Such preferential selection
       has been the driver of much of the controversy surrounding the morality of affirmative action.

       Critics of affirmative action argue that it encourages universities to admit or companies to hire applicants for
       reasons other than their merit. If preference is given to individuals based on race, ethnicity, or gender, then
       admissions and employment become not about what a person has done and shown they can do but about
       factors unrelated to performance. The concern is that we unfairly preference less qualified individuals over
       those who are more qualified simply to achieve greater diversity and representation. This raises an important
       question about the purpose of the application process. Is the goal of having individuals compete through an
       application process to ensure that a university or business is able to select only the best candidates, or is it to
       promote social goals like the representation of underrepresented groups?

       Some argue that employers who hire or promote based on qualifications, regardless of race or gender, are
       doing the right thing and that specifically seeking members of a particular race or gender for a position
       challenges the institution's own success and competitiveness. An institution's ability to compete and succeed
       depends on the quality of its workforce. Instead of focusing on the hiring or application process, we should
       instead focus on ensuring that individuals from underrepresented groups are able to be competitive on their
       own merit. Another potential problem concerning preferential selection is that individuals from groups that

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                        10.3 · Business Ethics and Emerging Technology 331

have historically been excluded may be viewed as less qualified even when they were admitted or hired solely
based on their own merit and achievements. In other words, affirmative action may inadvertently make it
harder for qualified and competitive individuals from underrepresented groups to be taken seriously or to
fulfill their responsibilities.
Contemporary American philosophers have provided various supports for affirmative action practices. James
Rachels (1941-2004) argued that giving preference based on race is justifiable because White people have
enjoyed privileges that have generally made it easier for them to achieve. While so-called reverse
discrimination may harm some White people, Rachels thought by and large it was a positive practice that
helped groups who have historically faced discrimination. Judith Jarvis Thomson (1929-2020) similarly
"endorsed job preferences for women and African-Americans as a form of redress for their past exclusion from
the academy and the workplace" (Fullinwider 2018). Mary Anne Warren (1945-2010) similarly argued in favor
of preferences as a way to make the admission and hiring process fair. As Warren saw it, "in a context of
entrenched gender discrimination," such preferences could very well "improve the `overall fairness'" of the
process (Fullinwider 2018).

Ethics and Emerging Technologies

Almost everyone in the contemporary world uses technologies such as cell phones and computers, but few of
us understand how these devices work. This ignorance hampers our ability to make informed decisions as a
society regarding how to use technology fairly or judiciously. A further challenge is that the pace of
technological evolution is much faster than the human ability to respond at societal level.

FIGURE 10.10 This image of an android makes many people uncomfortable because it appears so humanlike. Is
artificial intelligence a threat to human existence? Will there come a time when robots are afforded what we now
call human rights? (credit: "Lipstick" by Steve Jurvetson/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Artificial intelligence (AI), originally a feature of science fiction, is in widespread use today. Current examples
of AI include self-driving cars and quantum computers. Philosophers and engineers sort AI into two
categories: strong and weak. Strong artificial intelligence refers to machines that perform multiple cognitive
tasks like humans but at a very rapid pace (machine speed). Weak artificial intelligence refers to artificial
intelligence that performs primarily one task, such as Apple's Siri or social media bots. Philosophers of mind
such as John Searle (b. 1932) argue that truly strong artificial intelligence doesn't exist, since even the most
sophisticated technology does not possess intentionality the way a human being does. As such, no computer
could have anything like a mind or consciousness.
Despite Searle's assessment, many people--including leaders within the field of computer science--take the
332 10 · Applied Ethics

       threat of AI seriously. In a Pew Research Center survey, industry leaders expressed common concerns over
       exposure of individuals to cybercrime and cyberwarfare; infringement on individual privacy; the misuse of
       massive amounts of data for profit or other unscrupulous aims; the diminishing of the technical, cognitive, and
       social skills that humans require to survive; and job loss (Anderson and Rainie 2018). These concerns may
       reflect a deeper problem--what Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom (b. 1973) calls a mismatch between "our
       ability to cooperate as a species on the one hand and on the other hand our instrumental ability to use
       technology to make big changes in the world." Although leaders express more immediate concerns reflected in
       the Pew report, Bostrom's fundamental worry--like those expressed in science fiction literature--is the
       emergence of a superintelligent machine that does not align with human values and safety (Bostrom 2014).

Summary

10.1 The Challenge of Bioethics

Bioethics studies ethical issues that emerge with advances in biology, technology, and medicine. Important
contemporary ethical issues in bioethics include abortion, euthanasia, and clinical trials. Different
philosophers view these issues in different ways, resulting in various ethical or moral positions, each
privileging certain social obligations, individual rights, and/or ideas about personhood.

10.2 Environmental Ethics

Environmental ethics is an area of applied ethics that attempts to rethink our relationship to the natural world
and identify right conduct in our dealings with the nonhuman world. This section explores important aspects
of environmental ethics like the political and legal dimensions, the value of nature, deep ecology, social
ecology, and inequalities in environmental impact globally.

10.3 Business Ethics and Emerging Technology

Although business and information technology (IT) ethics raise broad issues such as corporate responsibility
and the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, a great deal of work in these subfields serves to support the
development and implementation of codes of ethics that organizations use to guide the conduct of their
members. The relationships between firms and their employees and between firms and shareholders is an
important area of focus in business ethics. This section also explores important issues related to equality with
a discussion of the important ethical issues related to affirmative action in university admissions and the
hiring process. Finally, ethical issues pertaining to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence are
considered.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

11.1 Historical Perspectives on Government
11.2 Forms of Government
11.3 Political Legitimacy and Duty
11.4 Political Ideologies

INTRODUCTION Politics invades much of our daily lives. Whether we are actively engaged in politics or not, it
is difficult to interact on social media, watch television, or even have a casual conversation without political
topics creeping in. Many of the things integral to our lives, such as getting an education, working, or even
traveling, are dependent upon political systems. However, we rarely think about what grounds these systems.
This chapter examines that grounding by introducing political philosophy. A branch of philosophy that looks
at how society determines governance, political philosophy also considers core concepts such as justice,
citizenship, and authority; investigates questions of legitimacy in political institutions; and examines the
rights, freedoms, and responsibilities a citizen may hold in a society. This chapter begins by looking at a few
key historical figures from different parts of the world and discovering how they pictured an ideal society.
Next, it examines different types of rule and theories about how best to govern a society and address the roles

       leaders and citizens play. Finally, the chapter looks at some of the issues currently being discussed by political
       philosophers.

       As political philosophies emerged in different cultures, their followers adopted notions of ideal societies and
       systems of government. This section examines the ideas of Aristotle and Plato in ancient Greece, Mozi in
       ancient China, and Al-Farabi in the early Islamic world.

      The Just City in Ancient Greece

       The history of political philosophy in the West can be traced back to ancient Greece. The term polis, from
       which is derived the word political, refers to the city-state, the basic unit of government in ancient Greece.
       Early inquiries were concerned with questions such as "Which qualities make for the best leader?" "Which is
       the best system of government for a city-state?" and "What is the role of a citizen?" For many philosophers, the
       most fundamental moral questions--such as "How should I treat others?" and "What constitutes a good
       life?"--are the basis for corollary political considerations. The philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BCE) links the
       two through the concept of telos, which means "goal directed." All things in life have a goal, or an end purpose,
       he says. It is the goal of human beings to live a good life, which is only achievable by living a virtuous life.
       Acquiring virtue is a difficult task, requiring constant practice. The acquisition of virtue necessarily involves a
       community to provide education, model virtues, and provide opportunities for a person to behave virtuously.
       Therefore, living in a well-constructed political society is an essential part of living a good life. According to
       Aristotle, "This truth is attested by the experience of states: lawgivers make the citizens good by training them
       in habits of right action--this is the aim of all legislation, and if it fails to do this it is a failure; this is what
       distinguishes a good form of constitution from a bad one" (1996, 1103b20).
       Plato and The Republic
       Plato's Republic is perhaps one of the best-known early texts examining the concept of a just society and the
       role of the citizen. Plato (ca. 428-348 BCE) uses a method of guided argumentation, known today as the
       Socratic method, to investigate the nature of justice. Using his mentor, Socrates, as the main interlocutor, Plato

                                                                                                                            11.1 · Historical Perspectives on Government 343

opens The Republic by asking what it means to live a just life, and the text evolves into a discussion about the
nature of justice. Socrates asks, Is justice simply an instrument used by those in power, or is it something
valuable in itself?

Socrates believes that behaving justly provides the greatest avenue to happiness, and he sets out to prove this
idea by using the analogy of the just city. If a just city is more successful than an unjust one, he argues, it
follows that a just man will be more successful than an unjust man. Much of Plato's Republic imagines this just
city. First, society is organized according to mutual need and differences in aptitude so that all the people can
receive essential goods and services. For example, some people will be farmers, while others will be weavers.
Gradually, the city begins to develop trade and introduce wages, which provide a basis of a good society. But
commerce with outsiders opens the city to threats, so soldiers are needed to protect and defend the city.
Soldiers of a just society must be exceptional in all virtues, including skill and courage, and must seek nothing
for themselves while working only for the good of the society. Plato calls these soldiers guardians, and the
development of the guardians is the main focus of the text because the guardians are the leaders of the society.

The Role of the Guardians

The guardians' training begins when they are quite young, as they must be exposed only to things that will
develop a strong character, inspire patriotic feelings, and emphasize the importance of courage and honor. The
guardians must not be exposed to any narrative that dwells on misery, bad luck, illness, or grief or that
portrays death or the afterlife as something to fear. Furthermore, they must live communally, and although
allowed to marry, they hold children and property in common. Because the guardians begin their education at
such an early age, they are taught to view their lifestyle not as a sacrifice but as the privilege of their station.
The guardians who are considered to be the most virtuous, both morally and intellectually, eventually become
the city's rulers, known as philosopher-kings: "Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this
world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one . . . cities will
never have rest from their evils" (1892, 473d-e).

Plato establishes the four virtues upon which the state should be founded: wisdom, courage, discipline, and
justice. While wisdom and courage must be present in the guardians, all members of the city must be at least
partially disciplined, performing their jobs and roles to maintain the peace and harmony of the state. Even for
those who are allowed private property, accumulating wealth is discouraged because it encourages laziness
and selfishness, traits that endanger the peace of the city. The theme of communal property appears several
times in The Republic. Socrates claims that when things are shared in common (including women and
children), sufferings and joys are also shared (461e). Thus, when one person loses something, the whole
community loses, but when one gains something, the whole community gains. Second, when words such as
mine are eliminated, conflicts over property are also eliminated, along with a sense of lack or suffering when
someone else prospers. Communal sharing helps eliminate rebellion, strikes, and other forms of discontent
and promotes social harmony, which is essential for a good society.

Plato's notion of three tiers of society--guardians, auxiliaries, and laborers--corresponds with elements of the
soul. Just as these three groups work together for the good of the city, reason and knowledge work together
with discipline to overrule passions that threaten to disrupt the harmony of individuals. These three qualities
allow individuals to be just and virtuous.

The Tradition of Exclusion

When thinking about foundational texts, we must pause to consider the missing voices of those denied a role in
governance, which ironically represents a significant injustice embedded in early theories of justice. In ancient
Greek texts, as in many texts that make up the foundational base of political philosophy, the citizenry generally
consists of wealthy men. Women are excluded from consideration, as are those born into slavery (rights are
occasionally extended to enslaved individuals obtained through war). According to Aristotle, women are by
nature born into a lower hierarchy than men and are not reasonable enough to engage in political life. Aristotle
344 11 · Political Philosophy

       also deems the elderly to be no longer competent to engage politically, while children (presumably male
       children) are not yet old enough to be competent: "The slave is wholly lacking the deliberative element; the
       female has it but it lacks authority; the child has it but it is incomplete" (1984, 1260a11). Aristotle's
       requirements for citizenship are a bit murky. In his view, an unconditional citizen is one who can participate in
       government, holding either deliberative or judicial office. Nonetheless, Plato's Republic does imagine a role for
       women as members of the ruling guardian class: "Men and women alike possess the qualities which make a
       guardian; they differ only in their comparative strength or weakness" (1892, 456a).

      Mohism in China

       Roughly 8,000 miles east of the birthplace of The Republic, a group of thinkers called Mohists were engaged in
       similar conversations about justice and governance. Mohism arose during China's Warring States era
       (481-221 BCE), a period of great social upheaval. Though this conflict was eventually resolved by the
       unification of the central states and the establishment of the Qin dynasty, the constant shifting of political
       boundaries led to a massive exchange of cultural, economic, and intellectual information. For this reason, this
       era is also known as the "`hundred schools' of thought" period (Fraser 2020, xi). The chapter on normative
       moral theory discusses the central tenets of Mohist thought; this section will examine its political ideals.

       The Book of Mozi

       The central tenets of Mohism can be found in the Mozi, an important text in Chinese philosophy. Compiled by
       followers of the teacher and reformer Mo Di, or Mozi (470-391 BCE), the Mozi explores a range of topics,
       including logic, economics, science, and political and ethical theory. Like Plato's Republic, the Mozi explores
       what constitutes virtuous behavior and arrives at ideas of universal love and benevolence. Mohists evaluate
       behavior according to how well it benefits others. Governance should focus on how best to promote social
       welfare. The morality of an action or policy is determined by its outcome. According to the Mozi, aggression
       and injury to others, even in military operations, should be opposed.

           CONNECTIONS

       The chapter on normative moral theory covers consequentialism in greater detail.

       The Mohist Ruler in China

       The Mohists believed that individuals are essentially good and want to do what is morally right, but they often
       lack an understanding of moral norms. Therefore, a virtuous and benevolent ruler is necessary to provide a
       standard of moral education and behavior. The Mozi describes social disorder in antiquity:

             In the beginning of human life, when there was yet no law and government, the custom was
             "everybody according to his own idea." Accordingly each man had his own idea, two men had two
             different ideas and ten men had ten different ideas--the more people the more different notions. And
             everybody approved of his own view and disapproved the views of others, and so arose mutual
             disapproval among men. (Mozi n.d., I.1)

       To combat this disorder and establish a form of peaceful cooperation, it became necessary to identify a ruler.
       Thus, "Heaven" chose a sage ruler, "crown[ing] him emperor" and "charging him with the duty of unifying the
       wills in the empire" (Mozi n.d., II.2).

       The sage ruler in turn chose three wise ministers to help him. However, they realized "the difficulty of unifying
       all the peoples in mountains and woods and those far distant," so they further divided the empire and
       appointed feudal lords as local rulers, who in turn chose "ministers and secretaries and all the way down to the
       heads of districts and villages, sharing with them the duty of unifying the standards in the state" (Mozi n.d.,
       II.2). Once this governmental hierarchy was established, the ruler issued an edict to the people to report moral
       misconduct among both the citizenry and the leaders. In this way, the Mozi says, people would behave

judiciously and act in good character.
In the Warring States period, Mohism competed with Confucianism. With the rise of the Qin and Imperial
dynasties that followed, it declined, although many of its tenets were absorbed into Confucianism, whose
influence in China lasted over 2,000 years.

Al-Farabi's View of Rulership

The emphasis on virtuous behavior as a condition for a civic peace can also be seen in the work of Islamic
philosopher Al-Farabi (870-950 CE). While there is not much information regarding Al-Farabi's life, it is
known that he came to Baghdad during the golden age of Islam, likely from central Asia. Alongside Arab
geographers and historians and Christian scholars translating texts from Greek to Arabic, Al-Farabi wrote and
taught. Baghdad was home not only to the largest urban population at the time but also to great libraries and
educational centers that produced advances in math, optics, astronomy, and biology. Al-Farabi fled Baghdad
due to political turmoil later in his life and is believed to have died in Damascus. He remains an important
thinker who influenced later, and perhaps better known, philosophers such as Avicenna and Averroes. Early
biographers emphasize his contributions to the fields of logic and metaphysics, which are still recognized as
pivotal today. Al-Farabi was one of the first Islamic philosophers to study Greek political philosophy and write
about it (Fakhry 2002). He advances some of the Greeks' ideas in his discussion of the supreme ruler and the
city of excellence (Galston 1990). For this reason, he is often called the "second master," with Aristotle being
the first.

FIGURE 11.3 This woodcut from the fifteenth century depicts Al-Farabi as a wise, old man. Al-Farabi made
important contributions to philosophy as well as to the fields of science, sociology, medicine, mathematics, and
music. (credit: "Al-Farabi" by Michel Wolgemut/Europeana, Public Domain)
The Supreme Ruler
Al-Farabi's supreme ruler is the founder of the city--not a historical founder, but rather one who possesses
both practical and theoretical knowledge and is not bound by any precedent or prior authority. While a
supreme ruler bases their decisions on careful analysis, their "successor" accepts and builds upon the
346 11 · Political Philosophy

       judgments of the supreme ruler without subjecting those judgments to philosophical scrutiny (Galston 1990,
       97).

       The supreme ruler has knowledge of both political philosophy and political science. For Al-Farabi, political
       science is the practical understanding of statecraft, which includes managing political affairs. It is the job of
       political science to investigate the ways in which people live their lives, including their moral dispositions and
       inclinations, and to look at the motivations behind actions and determine whether their aim is "true
       happiness." True happiness comes about through virtuous actions and the development of moral character. By
       contrast, presumed happiness focuses on things that corrupt, such as power, money, and material pleasures.
       Political philosophy is the theoretical knowledge needed to identify virtuous behavior.

       Philosophical and Nonphilosophical Rulers

       Al-Farabi draws a distinction between philosophical and nonphilosophical rulers. Nonphilosophical rulers
       may possess practical knowledge and be able to make judgments based on their experience observing and
       interacting with individuals in the city. They will be able to recognize patterns and similarities in conflict and
       thus make the fairest decisions possible to ensure the peace, even as they rely on the wisdom of the supreme
       ruler. On the other hand, philosophical rulers possess theoretical as well as practical knowledge and will be
       able to determine the wisdom of actions themselves (Galston 1990, 98). A philosophical ruler can become a
       supreme ruler, while a nonphilosophical ruler cannot.

       Cities of Excellence

       Like Plato's Republic, Al-Farabi's city must be ruled by a philosopher and seek to educate a class of
       philosopher-elites who can assist in the city's management. The classes to which the citizens of the city belong
       are determined by the supreme ruler and are based on their natural attributes, actions, and behaviors (Galston
       1990, 128). The overarching goal is to create a virtuous city or nation that gives its citizens the greatest chance
       of attaining true happiness.

       This is in stark contrast to the immoral city, in which people embrace vices such as drunkenness and gluttony
       and prioritize money and status over virtuous actions. Citizens act in this way not out of ignorance but rather
       by choice. Such a people can never attain true happiness because their happiness is based on temporary
       things (Galston 1990). If a city is not ruled by a supreme ruler, however, it is not necessarily destined to become
       an immoral city, and its citizens may still be able to achieve true happiness through the pursuit of virtue. In the
       Political Regime, Al-Farabi states:

             Among the necessary cities, there may be some that bring together all of the arts that procure what is
             necessary. Their ruler is the one who has fine governance and excellent stratagems for using [the
             citizens] so that they gain the necessary things and fine governance in preserving these things for
             them or who bestows these things on them from what he has. (quoted in Germann 2021)

       Nonetheless, such a city can never be considered a city of excellence; its aim is to provide for the material well-
       being of its citizens, but it lacks philosophical understanding of well-being in a larger sense.

       The city of excellence is governed by the practice of the "royal craft," or the management of political affairs.
       The royal craft attempts to establish a social order based on positive character, virtuous behavior, and moral
       action. When the citizens of the city embody these principles and encourage others to embody them as well, a
       harmonious society results, one in which all inhabitants can achieve their greatest possible level of happiness
       and fulfillment

                THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

       Plato and Al-Farabi both thought that a just city should be ruled by a philosopher. What factors determine whether a
       government will make good decisions? Do you agree with Plato and Al-Farabi that these factors are the virtue and

each decision, describing how the decision was made. Explain why it does or does not support Plato's and Al-
Farabi's position.

11.2 Forms of Government

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the difference between absolute and constitutional monarchies.
  · Distinguish between representative and totalitarian forms of government.
  · Relate social classes and caste systems to political systems.

Political schools of thought from ancient Greece, China, and the Islamic world have influenced governments
for centuries. The ideological beliefs of individuals holding power within a government play a large role in the
way that government operates. In addition, these ideas may inspire people to reform the structure of their
political system. This section looks at some of the most common forms of government and examines their
social and ideological roots.

Monarchy

Monarchy is a system of rule in which authority resides in one individual, who is head of state. Generally,
monarchical rule is passed down through a line of succession. Monarchies have existed at least since 3000
BCE and have been a common form of government around the globe. Some examples are the Germanic Franks
and Visigoths of the third and fourth centuries, the kingdoms of Spain and France, and the African countries of
Morocco and Eswatini, which are still in existence today (Kostiner 2020).

Absolute Monarchies

A monarchy can be either absolute or constitutional. In an absolute monarchy, the ruler retains complete
control and is not beholden to any other state authority. In the Zoroastrian tradition, following the idea of the
divine right of kings, rulers were chosen by the gods and bestowed with khvarenah, or royal glory, which gave
them wisdom, marked them as "supreme among the people, and indicated that they had been divinely
endowed with kingship" (Choksky n.d.).

Constitutional Monarchies

A constitutional monarch, on the other hand, works within the framework of a constitution and with other
political figures of the state. In a constitutional monarchy, the monarch acts as head of state and has some
executive powers but does not personally make policy. The British monarchy is an example of a constitutional
monarchy, although prior to the mid-1600s, it was an absolute monarchy. As a result of agricultural and
industrial revolutions and religious conflict, a middle class arose in England that demanded political power
through Parliament. Today, the United Kingdom is ceremonially headed by the royal family, but the right to
create policy and develop legislation belongs to the democratically elected Parliament, which acts under the
leadership of a prime minister. For this reason, the British system is also considered a parliamentary
democracy. While the power they exercise is limited, the royal family is still considered by many in the UK to
represent tradition and serve as the physical embodiment of the nation (Royal Household at Buckingham
Palace 2021).

      Aristocracies and Caste Systems

       Ruling authority in an aristocracy is in the hands of a small number of individuals considered to be elite
       members of society. Similar to monarchy, an aristocracy is determined through lines of succession. Generally,
       the higher a person's class, the closer they get to the actual seat of power.

       Greek Class Systems

       In a class system, members of society are placed in different groups based on their perceived worth and
       benefit. From these social hierarchies arise a system of political obligations from which rulers and their
       governments derive power and authority.

       A classic example of a class system is found in The Republic, when Plato divides society into five classes of
       citizens: agricultural or industrial producers, sailors and shipowners, merchants (i.e., importers and
       exporters), retail traders, and manual laborers. In Plato's view, individuals should keep to the jobs they know
       best. Moreover, because people are not equal in aptitude, "we must infer that all things are produced more
       plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it
       at the right time, and leaves other things" (Plato 1892, Book 2).

       Indian Caste Systems

       A current example of a class-based system is the Hindu caste system in India, called jati, which assigns people
       their role in society according to the social class into which they are born. There is a great deal of debate about
       the origin of the caste system, but the Rig Veda, the oldest texts in Hinduism's most sacred scriptures, offer a
       mythical origin of jati. In one poem in the Rig Veda, primordial man, called Purusha, sacrifices himself to
       create humanity, and from Purusha's body the castes are created. The four original castes (varnas, or social
       classes) are the Brahmins (priests and scholars), the Rajanya or Kshatriya (rulers and warriors), the Vaishya
       (workers, farmers, and craftsmen), and the Sudra (servants and laborers) (Johnson and Johnson 2008). In
       addition, outcastes or "untouchables" make up a fifth group, now called Dalits (Mayell 2003). The Hindu caste
       system is intimately bound with religious beliefs about karma and reincarnation. Hindus, who make up the
       majority of people in India, believe that the fruits of a person's good and bad deeds (karma) are carried from
       one life to the next when the soul reincarnates. Therefore, a person's place in the social hierarchy is
       determined by fate or karma, based on their behavior from life to life.

       In the 20th century, with the establishment of self-rule, the modernization of its economy, and the
       establishment of a democratic system, India reformed its social system. Today, caste discrimination is no
       longer legal, although it is still rampant in India. From four primary castes, the caste system grew to
       encompass some 3,000 subcastes over time, along with further subdivisions of the subcastes. Proponents of
       the caste system, including some within Hindu nationalist parties, argue that caste is a way of organizing
       society. Lone individuals lack power, they argue, but if individuals see themselves as part of a larger group,
       they may function as a de facto union. These defenders of the status quo argue that it is extraordinarily rare for
       wealthy, politically powerful families to give up their power, just as it is extremely rare for impoverished people
       to increase their political power.

      Representative Government

       In representative government systems, individuals are chosen by various means to represent the larger group.
       Representative government likely has deeper roots than monarchies or aristocracies. Cheyenne, Iroquois,
       Huron, and other Native American peoples established tribal democracies prior to European settlement of the
       Americas, and San (Bushmen), Pygmies, and other African peoples practice "campfire democracy" (Glassman

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                     11.2 · Forms of Government 349

2017). These examples and others suggest that cooperation between bands of peoples may have featured
elements of representative government prior to urban settlements.

The story of democracy in urban settings is often linked to ancient Greece, specifically Athens, where the hand
of government was extended to the people, but only to individuals in particular classes. The Athenian mode of
government was unique in the region. Before 700 BCE, Athens was ruled by single individuals or small groups
who often encountered social and economic problems that brought about instability. Around the year 600 BCE,
the Athenian ruler Solon (c. 630-c. 560 BCE) implemented a proto-democratic system. He did not allow
nonaristocratic individuals to hold certain offices, but he did allow all male citizens (which is not to say all
inhabitants) to vote on local leaders, and he did his best to outlaw debt slavery. His successes were short-lived,
but he paved the way for an impressive span of democratic rule in Athens.

In Thucydides's (c. 460-c. 404 BCE) History of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles (c. 495-429 BCE) praises the
Athenian constitution, in particular the idea that all members of a state should be allowed to participate in its
governance. The Athenian constitution "favors the many instead of the few," he says, and the laws "afford equal
justice to all in their private differences" (Thucydides [1996] 2008, 112).

Pericles links the notion of freedom to success both in governance and in people's daily lives. On both fronts,
he holds that happiness is "the fruit of freedom" (Thucydides [1996] 2008, 115). His view is that, despite the
imperfections in its implementation of democracy, Athens has the best form of government in existence.
Athenians are happy in a way that members of other polities are not, says Pericles, so much so that Athens is
worth defending in battle.

Current forms of democracy center on the notion of rule by the people, but today's democracies are not
administered by direct rule, with all policy decisions voted on by a majority. For example, the United States has
a representative democracy, which means that individuals are elected to make legislative decisions on behalf
of the people.

American philosopher Richard Arneson (b. 1945) holds that "what renders the democratic form of
government . . . morally legitimate . . . is that its operation over time produces better consequences for people
than any feasible alternative mode of governance" (2009, 197). This statement is an instrumental defense of
democracy, arguing that democracy is a good in itself and that democracies must prove themselves over time.
Many argue that democracies seem to outperform extant rival systems. Indian philosopher and Nobel Prize
winner Amartya Sen (b. 1933) has argued that democratic nations are the wealthiest in the world, and because
positions of power are determined through elections, their leaders are more likely to try to meet the needs of
the population.

According to Sen, "No substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent country with a democratic
form of government and a relatively free press" (quoted in Christiano and Bajaj 2021). What is more,
democracies are less likely to go to war with one another than are nondemocratic states. Sen also points out
that democratic governments allow people with different moral and political views to coexist. He observes that
democracy has allowed multiple religions to exist relatively peacefully in India. Nonetheless, democracy is not
a flawless system; some of the problems found in the system are discussed in Section 11.4 below.

Totalitarian Forms of Government

Totalitarianism

Totalitarianism is a system of government that exercises complete control over its population in both
personal and public life by eliminating free press and imposing censorship and mass surveillance, along with
other social controls. In a totalitarian system, opposition to the state is prohibited, and repercussions for
disobedience are generally severe. Totalitarianism can also take the form of autocracy, in which power is
concentrated in the hands of an individual, through a dictatorship under a single leader. For example, in the
20th century, the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin (1878-1953) and the Italian Fascist regime under Benito
350 11 · Political Philosophy

       Mussolini (1883-1945) were totalitarian regimes. A totalitarian system is different from tyranny, fascism, or
       communism, although there are enough similarities among these terms that the terms are often incorrectly
       used interchangeably.

       Communism

       Communism, an ideology that has engendered totalitarian governments, is largely associated with the Soviet
       Union (1922-1991) and the People's Republic of China (1949-present). While traces of communist ideas can
       be found much earlier in history, modern communism springs from the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich
       Engels, who called for a "dictatorship of the proletariat" to seize the means of production from private control
       and establish instead a system of labor and goods distribution that would benefit the working class.

       In modern communist countries, the state owns the means of production, sets wages, regulates production,
       and controls prices. Although these countries may hold elections, the leadership of the ruling political party
       monopolizes political power, dictating policies that cross over from public life into private life and severely
       restrict individual freedom. Between 1932 and 1933, for example, the leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin,
       implemented an agrarian collectivization program in Ukraine. Stalin ordered that any family that owned 24
       acres or more of land lose all their possessions and be deported to work camps in Siberia. Somewhere between
       four and seven million people starved to death.

       Fascism

       Fascism is another ideology that produced totalitarian political systems. As an ideology, fascism is
       characterized by a strong sense of nationalism, a disdain for democratic principles, and a belief in social
       hierarchy (Soucy 2021). Fascism was largely popular during the time known as the interwar years, meaning
       the years between the two world wars (roughly 1920-1938), although the fascism of Italy and Germany
       continued through World War II (1939-1945) and fascism under Francisco Franco in Spain, which began in
       1936, continued until 1975. In Italy, Benito Mussolini rose to power and established a fascist dictatorship
       beginning in 1925. The devastation caused by World War I (1914-1918), after which Europe struggled to
       rebuild and cope with food shortages and unemployment, created conditions that were ripe for the emergence
       of charismatic strongmen who promised to bring prosperity back to their nations.

       It was during this same period that German citizens, suffering under heavy sanctions from the Allied powers at
       the close of World War I, embraced the leadership of Adolf Hitler, who was elected as Germany's chancellor in
       1933. Hitler quickly moved to consolidate power and establish himself as absolute dictator in what had
       formerly been a democratic country. Hitler's National Socialism was a fascist ideology, with the added
       component of a genocidal program carried out against Jews and the Romani as well as other groups (Wiener
       Holocaust Library n.d.).

       Hannah Arendt on Totalitarianism

       In the seminal book The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), philosopher and political theorist Hannah Arendt
       (1906-1975) argues that totalitarianism is a relatively new form of government that seeks to exert control over
       every aspect of not just social and political life but citizens' personal lives as well. She says that a key
       difference between dictatorships, including those operating under fascism, and totalitarian regimes is that
       while the former assumes power and seeks to install members of its party in all offices of government, the
       latter includes a proliferation of the party into all arenas, including the state, the police, elite groups, and so
       forth. Furthermore, under a totalitarian system, laws are fungible, meaning they can change day by day. The
       ultimate goal of such regimes, Arendt says, is the eradication of any notion of the self as an individual in favor
       of the creation of the self as an extension of the government (Arendt 1951). The power of totalitarianism lies in
       the use of systematic violence to create a sense of total terror at the thought of countering the government and
       the dismantling of one's capacity for independent thought until people are wholly dependent on the
       government. The survival of the regime depends on eliminating any factor of identity for individuals beyond
       that of "citizen"--although people under totalitarian rule are more captives than citizens.

11.3 Political Legitimacy and Duty

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify two key arguments for political legitimacy.
  · Explain how a person might have a duty to others without having an obligation to the state.

No matter what system of government a society adopts, a government needs authority to rule. What gives
rulers their authority, and what rights, if any, do citizens have? One fundamental question of political theory
becomes, What are the sources of the legitimacy of a political system, and by extension, how much authority
do rulers or leaders have over citizens? Further, what obligations does a state owe its citizens, and vice versa?
This section will explore different ideas and characteristics of the source of authority and the obligations of its
members.

Divine Rule

The Mohists claimed that the emperor is chosen by heaven rather than the people. In order to fight against
social chaos, heaven identifies a wise ruler to establish control and act as a model of virtuous behavior (Mozi
n.d.). This is an example of divine rule, which legitimizes the rule of monarchs and lines of succession in a
royal family by stating that monarchs are chosen by divine authority and therefore are not answerable to the
people. The idea of divine rule became prevalent in Europe after the Roman Empire adopted Christianity. Yet
with the rise of Protestantism and the middle classes in Europe, new ideas emerged about authority and the
rights and responsibilities of leaders and citizens. Philosophers in western Europe, such as Thomas Hobbes

and John Locke, began to argue that the legitimacy of government rests on a social contract between the ruler
and the ruled.

Thomas Hobbes and Absolute Monarchy

FIGURE 11.5 Thomas Hobbe's Leviathan, first published in 1651, presents absolute monarchy as an order-creating
and necessary force in society. (credit: "Frontispiece of Leviathan engraved by Abraham Bosse, with input from
Thomas Hobbes, the author" by Abraham Bosse by unknown author/Wikimedia, Public Domain)
Leviathan, written by the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and first published in 1651, looks
at the structure of systems of government and develops the social contract theory. In the text, Hobbes imagines
a time prior to the creation of social institutions, when humans were motivated solely by satisfying their
desires. When land and food are plentiful, people can meet their needs and even store surplus for lean times.
But as population increases, people compete for resources, which means that one person's gain is another's
loss. Scarcity leads to conflict when people fight to obtain what they need. Prior to the establishment of
political authority, there is no check on violence, and thus human beings enter a state of perpetual war, which
Hobbes considers the state of nature. In this state,

      there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of
      the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious
      Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge
      of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all,
      continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and
      short. (Hobbes [1968] 2002, ch. 13)
To successfully leave the state of nature, people must form a political community that ensures their basic
needs are met, moderates conflicts, and codifies rules of behavior. Part of that project includes identifying a
power that can hold authority. Hobbes believed that power should be held by the monarchy, arguing that one
absolute and central authority is the best method of maintaining peace and avoiding discord and factionalism.
354 11 · Political Philosophy

      John Locke and Representative Government

       Other proponents of the social contract, including French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)
       and English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704), rejected absolute monarchy. Instead, they argued for
       representative government. In fact, John Locke's Second Treatise on Civil Government (1689) served as a
       major inspiration for the American founding fathers. Some of his well-known ideas can be found in the
       Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Locke defends the necessity of the separation of the church
       and state, for example, and provides the origin of the edict on self-preservation that leads to retaining the right
       to bear arms.

       Similar to Hobbes, Locke imagines that people begin in the state of nature and eventually agree to give up
       some liberties to an impartial authority in exchange for peace and security. But unlike Hobbes, Locke says that
       we exist peacefully for the most part and can be counted on to act in our interests when necessary. Locke
       invokes natural law, which is the notion that humankind is granted rationality by God and can use that
       rationality to determine moral laws. These laws are obligatory and include respect for others and the
       recognition of individual liberty. As Locke sees it, humans are born into "a state also of equality, wherein all the
       power and jurisdiction is reciprocal" (Locke 2016, 122). We are naturally free and equal; no one person has
       more natural power or right to rule than another. Locke maintains "that all men are naturally in that state, and
       remain so, till by their own consents they make themselves members of some politic society" (129).

       In Locke's state of nature, we have the right to own ourselves and can do what we like with ourselves, and we
       can own limited property. At first, property is things from nature that God gave to us in common to fulfill our
       basic needs and survival. Later, as society develops and begins using money, property is extended to include
       what we improve through our labor. Even in this early state, we are not free to abuse others. We are not free to
       take more than we need, for example. The law of self-preservation is prominent throughout Locke's treatise
       and can be found in his discussion of war as well in his solution to a tyrannical government (that people
       exercise their right to change it). Locke's philosophy is based on the assumption that moral law, which
       precedes the establishment of any political structure, leads to a type of natural justice.

       Locke also differentiates between natural liberty, which grows out of natural law, and civil liberty, which is the
       product of governance by a commonwealth. Remember that Locke establishes that we are allowed to gain
       property. We do so through our labor, when we improve the land that was given to us in common. This work, in
       turn, benefits others. As we gain more and more property, we develop a need to defend our property. If a
       person does not have property, they will still be under the protection of the laws of the civil society, though they
       will not have a hand in determining those laws. We agree to move from the state of nature into a society to
       protect property, both ourselves (as property) and our goods. By moving into a civil society, we gain the
       protection of laws, an impartial judge, and a means to enforce laws. The legislative power of civil society
       establishes its laws. These laws presumably are created with the interests of the entire commonwealth in
       mind, so individual interests may not supersede the interests of the whole. The executive power enforces these
       laws and should not have a hand in establishing laws. Locke views this requirement as a safeguard against
       personal interest.

       After civil society is established, Locke addresses the question of how much freedom the government should
       have to act without consulting the commonwealth as a whole and what limits should be put on its power. Above
       all, the good of the society must be the goal of government. Those who make up the legislative and executive
       powers must be cautious that these powers do not become a micro society. The longer individuals stay in
       positions of power, the greater the chance they may fall into corruption. If that happens, then the civil state will
       become worse than the state of nature. For that reason, people then have the right to remove the governmental
       powers; a state that has become tyrannical can justly be dissolved. The people may reestablish the structure
       that previously worked best or change to a system that better protects their interests. Ultimately, it is the
       commonwealth (the people) who oversee the society at large and determine its ability to function properly.
       Thus, Locke's safeguard against tyranny allows people to return to the state of nature, if necessary, and begin

Max Weber and Descriptive Legitimacy

Legitimacy can be descriptive (an explanation of authority) or normative (a justification for authority). Hobbes
and Locke tackled issues of normative legitimacy. A descriptive account of legitimacy can be found in
sociologist Max Weber's (1864-1920) influential essay "Three Types of Legitimate Rule," in which he identifies
three sources of legitimacy: traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal.
Traditional Legitimacy
Traditional legitimacy, not surprisingly, relies on tradition, or long-standing practice, to determine authority.
Once a system is deemed legitimate, power is granted to certain individuals based either on inheritance or a
belief that they are given rule through divine right. Al-Farabi's idea of a supreme ruler is one such example.
Perhaps the most common form of traditional legitimacy, however, is monarchy: a system in which the state is
ruled by a single individual, usually for the duration of their lifetime. In an absolute monarchy, the right to rule
usually is grounded in the notion that the monarchy was established by God and derives its authority from God
(known as the divine right of kings). As such, the monarchies in medieval Europe, for example, were not
beholden to any form of constitutional authority. In a constitutional monarchy, the head of state is subject to a
constitution.
Charismatic Legitimacy
Charismatic legitimacy is granted to an authority figure who has tremendous social appeal. Citizens of society
grant these figures power to speak and act on their behalf due to their perceived ability to understand and
empathize with the people they represent. Charismatic figures may or may not hold official government
positions. Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) is an example of a charismatic authority figure who held great
influence as an anti-apartheid activist even prior to becoming president of South Africa. Weber maintained
that this is the most unstable form of authority because it is dependent on the individual and can be lost
through death or a failure to live up to expectations.

FIGURE 11.6 Two leaders often described as charismatic: South African president Nelson Mandela (center) with US
356 11 · Political Philosophy

       prison for leading the anti-apartheid movement. (credit: "Philadelphia Freedom Festival & Awards" by Robert
       McNeely/White House Photograph Office/Clinton Digital Library, Public Domain)

       Rational-Legal Legitimacy

       Finally, rational-legal legitimacy comes from belief in the government itself rather than a specific individual. A
       leader is justified in upholding laws and setting policy as long as they are working within the established
       structure. Modern representative democracies are examples of this form of authority. Individuals are elected
       to hold positions within the government for a specified period of time, or term. When the term is over, the
       position is turned over to another elected individual. While people may not always have faith in the individual
       elected to office, they retain faith in the legitimacy of the office itself. Weber saw this form of legitimacy as the
       most stable.

      Political Obligations

       So far, this chapter has examined the role of rulers in society. But what responsibilities do citizens have to the
       government and to each other, and what responsibilities does the government have to its citizens?

       Communitarianism

       Building on the idea of an individual's responsibility to community, communitarianism is a theory about
       human identity that holds that people's values and worldviews are contingent on their social environment.
       Most of us spend our lives as members of one community or another, and often these communities provide us
       with our first introductions to moral values, which in turn influence our interactions with others and our
       political views. The implication of this position is that individuals have obligations to their communities that
       may supersede their individual interests. While communitarian ideas can be found in many historical texts,
       including Plato's Republic, the modern understanding of communitarianism has its roots in early sociological
       theories. Later, communitarianism grew as a reaction against John Rawls and the liberal position (Bell 2020).

       Constraints on Universalism

       Communitarians deny the notion of universal values and assert that values, being determined by society, can
       vary. Moreover, they argue that reliance on tradition and a belief in shared goals can help stabilize a society.
       Communitarians reject the notion of individualism, or the idea that self-reliance and personal goals should
       take precedence over social interests, and hold that "it makes no sense to begin the political enterprise by
       abstracting from the interpretive dimensions of human beliefs, practices, and institutions" (Bell 2020). A
       Rawlsian framework that asks us to imagine ourselves in a theoretical position in which personal facts are
       unknown to us doesn't make sense, when our values are in fact determined by the society we find ourselves in.
       According to this view, the community is the focal point for enforcing a sense of responsibility for protecting
       the fundamental rights of others.

       Principles of Communitarianism

       Sociologist Amitai Etzioni (b. 1929), the founder of the Communitarian Network, elaborates on three main
       principles at the heart of communitarianism. First, human beings need social interaction. Etzioni points to
       existing literature showing that individuals in solitary confinement in prisons, as well as elderly persons living
       alone and without a support network, experience significant psychological and physiological harm. Societies
       that embrace community and prioritize community involvement have a much greater chance of remaining
       healthy than societies that do not (Etzioni 2015).

       Next, societies have moral norms that are enforced by members of the community. We are motivated to obey
       moral rules, such as picking up our trash when in public places, keeping our promises, and helping others
       whenever possible, due to the corresponding praise or blame we receive from our communities. Etzioni claims
       that this sort of community oversight can take the place of laws that must be enforced by police and other
       authorities. He explains, "We will agree with each other on what's right and what's wrong, and we reinforce it

                                                                                                                                          11.3 · Political Legitimacy and Duty 357

by nothing more than by public education and by mutually appreciating when people do what needs doing and
express our concern when they do not" (Etzioni 2015).

Finally, people have not only rights but also responsibilities. In the United States, for example, the notion of
individual rights is so strong that often the connection between rights and social responsibility is overlooked.
Etzioni gives the example of the competing concerns of personal privacy and national security. We recognize
that it is important to maintain our right to privacy; however, we also recognize that sometimes it is necessary
to make certain information public to protect the general welfare of the society. Rather than positioning this
scenario as a war of competing values, the communitarian sees it as an opportunity to balance the needs of the
individual with those of the community (Etzioni 2015).

Mahatma Gandhi and Ahimsa

Some political obligations are primarily to individuals. This view can be seen in the writings of the Indian
activist Mohandas K. Gandhi (1869-1948), better known as Mahatma Gandhi, who believed his primary
responsibility was to the people of India. He and many other Indians wanted to drive the British colonizers out
of their country. Gandhi's obligation to bring about Indian independence existed independent of any obligation
to obey the government. According to Gandhi, "Civil disobedience . . . becomes a sacred duty when the State
has become lawless or, which is the same thing, corrupt. And a citizen that barters with such a State shares in
its corruption or lawlessness" ([1969] 1994, 172). Thus, it becomes a duty to disobey the government
predicated on the obligation to serve both oneself and others. Gandhi offers the following injunction: "Let each
do his duty; if I do my duty, that is, serve myself, I shall be able to serve others" (n.d., "Hind Swaraj"). Gandhi is
not advocating that people simply serve their own self-interest; he says that "service without humility is
selfishness and egotism" ([1940] 1998, 443).

Gandhi recommends robust restraints while disobeying the government. The doctrine of ahimsa, or non-
harming--a key idea in Indian philosophy and religion--constrains how one may disobey the government and
even governs all interactions in the process of nonviolent noncooperation with the government. Speaking of
ahimsa, Gandhi notes, "For one who follows this doctrine there is no room for an enemy" (n.d., "Ashram").
Gandhi calls his particular doctrine satyagraha, or embodying or holding to the truth. One who follows this
doctrine is a satyagrahi. For Indians resisting the British, satyagraha took the form of passive, nonviolent
resistance to the injustice perpetrated by India's colonial invaders. The person grounded in ahimsa and
satyagraha does not act out of anger or violence, which is why Gandhi says, "A satyagrahi loves his so-called
enemy even as he loves his friend. He has no enemy" (n.d., "Epigrams"). For Gandhi, a person's first duty was
to practice ahimsa. Indeed, he practiced ahimsa to the extent that he went on a hunger strike to end
Hindu-Muslim infighting once India began to establish its own government. Moreover, he refused to defend
himself when he was physically attacked multiple times throughout his life. These obligations to his moral
code, as he saw it, existed apart from the government or any law it might have passed.

Gandhi's writings and political work raise the question, What are people's obligations when it comes to obeying
specific laws? Most theorists separate the obligations to the state from those to the law. For example, American
civil rights leaders and activists such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Medgar Evers, and Rosa Parks recognized
the legitimacy of the government, but they opposed laws that they felt were unjust. They popularized the idea
of civil disobedience as a means of opposing unjust laws.

             There are people who ask me whether I am the same man that I was in 1920, or whether there has been
             any change in me. You are right in asking that question. Let me, however, hasten to assure that I am the
             same Gandhi as I was in 1920. I have not changed in any fundamental respect. I attach the same
             importance to nonviolence that I did then. If at all, my emphasis on it has grown stronger. There is no real
             contradiction between the present resolution and my previous writings and utterances.

             Occasions like the present do not occur in everybody's and but rarely in anybody's life. I want you to know
             and feel that there is nothing but purest ahimsa in all that I am saying and doing today. The draft resolution
             of the Working Committee is based on ahimsa; the contemplated struggle similarly has its roots in ahimsa.
             If, therefore, there is any among you who has lost faith in ahimsa or is wearied of it, let him not vote for this
             resolution.

             Let me explain my position clearly. God has vouchsafed to me a priceless gift in the weapon of ahimsa. I
             and my ahimsa are on our trail today. If in the present crisis, when the earth is being scorched by the
             flames of himsa [harm, the opposite of ahimsa] and crying for deliverance, I failed to make use of the God-
             given talent, God will not forgive me and I shall be judged unwrongly of the great gift. I must act now. I may
             not hesitate and merely look on, when Russia and China are threatened.

             Ours is not a drive for power, but purely a nonviolent fight for India's independence. In a violent struggle, a
             successful general has been often known to effect a military coup and to set up a dictatorship. But under
             the Congress scheme of things, essentially nonviolent as it is, there can be no room for dictatorship. A
             nonviolent soldier of freedom will covet nothing for himself; he fights only for the freedom of his country.
             The Congress is unconcerned as to who will rule, when freedom is attained. The power, when it comes, will
             belong to the people of India, and it will be for them to decide to whom it placed in the entrusted.

     11.4 Political Ideologies

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify key ideologies or theories in political philosophy, such as conservatism, liberalism, egalitarianism,
             socialism, and anarchism.

         · Discuss distributive justice within political ideologies.
         · Demonstrate how alienation continues to be a problem for workers in modern industrial societies.

       When Bernie Sanders, the American senator from Vermont, ran for president of the United States in 2016 as a
       democratic socialist, he set off an intense debate in the country. What exactly was democratic socialism? This
       was a debate about political ideologies, or people's beliefs about how a society should be run. Ideology can
       shape policies and laws, as the individuals holding office and positions of authority and the people who elect
       them are often influenced by ideological beliefs. This section looks at some key ideologies that have influenced
       how people think about their rights and the responsibilities of government.

      Distributive Justice

       One of the important differences among the ideologies examined below is how they approach the question of
       distributive justice. Distributive justice can be seen as a moral framework made up of principles that seek to
       ensure the greatest amount of fairness with respect to distributions of wealth, goods, and services (Olsaretti
       2018). However, there is much debate surrounding what amounts to fairness. Is a just society one that provides
       for its members, allocating resources based on need, or is it one that allows for the greatest amount of personal
       freedom, even if that means that some members are radically better off than others? Furthermore, given that
       individuals begin at varying positions of social and economic status, should a society focus on meeting the
       needs of its disadvantaged members even if that results in an unequal distribution of goods, or should there be

as little governmental interference as possible?
It is tempting to see distributive justice as a theoretical moral concern. However, views on what constitute
basic needs, what resources should be considered public versus private, and whether or not there should be
restrictions on the free market have real, practical ramifications when considered by governing bodies. Given
this, it is important to keep in mind the role that principles of distributive justice play in the ideologies
discussed below.

Conservatism

Conservativism is a political theory that favors institutions and practices that have demonstrated their value
over time and provided sufficient evidence that they are worth preserving and promoting. Conservatism sees
the role of government as serving society rather than controlling it and advocates gradual change in the social
order, if and when necessary.
Edmund Burke and the French Revolution
Modern conservatism begins with the 18th-century Irish political theorist Edmund Burke (1729-1797), who
opposed the French Revolution and whose Reflections on the French Revolution (1790) served as an
inspiration for the development of a conservative political philosophy (Viereck et al. 2021). Shocked by the
violence of the French Revolution, Burke advocated against radical revolution that destroyed functioning
institutions that, though flawed, served a purpose. However, Burke supported the American Revolution
because the colonists had already established political institutions, such as courts and administrations, and
were taking the next gradual step: asking Britain to let them run these institutions on their own.

FIGURE 11.7 The Irish political thinker Edmund Burke is credited with developing the theories that form the basis
of modern conservatism. (credit: "Edmund Burke" by Duyckinick, Evert A. Portrait Gallery of Eminent Men and
Women in Europe and America. New York: Johnson, Wilson & Company, 1873. p. 159/Wikimedia, Public Domain)
Fundamental Principles
Conservatives such as Burke are not opposed to reform, but they are wary of challenges to existing systems
360 11 · Political Philosophy

       that have generally held up well. They believe that any sudden change is likely to lead to instability and greater
       insecurity. Moreover, conservatives are not against redistribution of resources, especially when it serves to
       alleviate severe poverty. However, they believe that such actions are best carried out at a local level (as opposed
       to a state or national level) by those who understand the needs of the individual community. Finally,
       conservatives are staunch supporters of property rights and oppose any system of reform that challenges
       them. Property rights serve as a check on governmental power and are seen as an essential part of a stable
       society (Moseley n.d.). As such, conservatism aligns with some principles of liberalism.

       Conservatism maintains that human nature is fundamentally flawed and that we are driven more by selfish
       desires than by empathy and concern for others. Therefore, it is the job of social institutions such as church
       and school to teach self-discipline, and it is the job of the government to protect the established, fundamental
       values of society. Along with this rather Hobbesian view of humankind and belief in the preservation of
       historical traditions, conservatives believe that weaknesses in institutions and morals will become apparent
       over time and that they will either be forced to evolve, be discarded, or be gradually reformed (Moseley n.d.).

      Liberalism

       Liberalism in political philosophy does not have the same meaning as the word liberal in popular American
       discourse. For Americans, liberal means someone who believes in representative democracy and is politically
       left of center. For example, liberals generally favor regulating the activities of corporations and providing social
       welfare programs for the working and middle classes. Liberalism as a political philosophy, however, has quite a
       different emphasis.

       Fundamental Principle of Liberty

       British philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) expresses the fundamental principles of liberalism in his
       work On Liberty (1859), arguing for limited government on the grounds of utility. His interest is in "Civil, or
       Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the
       individual" (Mill [1869] 2018). In this regard, he defends "one very simple principle," which is the minimizing
       of government interference in people's lives:

             The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the
             liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. . . . The only purpose for which power can be
             rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to
             others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. (Mill [1869] 2018)

       In Mill's view, real freedom is when people are able to pursue their own individual idea of "the good" in a
       manner they see fit. Mill's claim is at the heart of most variants of liberalism.

       Positive and Negative Liberty

       We are at liberty when we are neither constrained to act nor obligated to refrain from acting in a certain way. At
       least since Isaiah Berlin's (1905-1997) "Two Concepts of Liberty" (1958), this sort of liberty has been called
       negative liberty. Berlin, a British political theorist, suggests that negative liberty is "the area within which a
       man can act unobstructed by others" (Berlin 1969, 122). Negative liberty in the political realm often refers to
       the absence of government control over the lives of individuals, or in what we are reasonably able to do without
       interference. Conversely, Berlin thinks of positive liberty as "the wish on the part of the individual to be his
       own master" (131). We want our life decisions to depend on ourselves and not on external forces. "I wish to be
       the instrument of my own, not of other men's, acts of will," says Berlin (131). The ability to participate in
       democratic institutions, for example, is a form of positive liberty.

       The Welfare State and Social Justice

       Some theorists hold that negative liberty has limits when it comes to how much liberty, in practice, a person
       has at their disposal. The theory of justice that sees individuals as having claims on resources and care from
       others is often called welfare liberalism. Such theorists are not in favor of limited government and believe that

the well-being of citizens must be a vital component of our agreement to obey a government. American
philosopher John Rawls (1921-2002) famously makes this argument in his seminal book A Theory of Justice
(1971), in which he attempts to articulate an account of fairness that satisfies our intuition that human
freedom and social welfare are both important.

Rawls begins with the idea that society is a system of cooperation for mutual advantage. Given the fact of
today's pluralistic societies, people reasonably disagree about many important issues, which means we must
find a way to live peaceably together with our differences and collectively determine our political institutions.
In addition, Rawls believes that there are deep inequalities embedded in any basic social structure, which
result from the fact that we are all born into different positions and have different expectations of life, largely
determined by the political, economic, and social circumstances that attend those positions. Therefore, Rawls
says, we must find a way to distance ourselves from our own particular concepts of such ideas as justice, the
good, and religion and begin with relatively uncontroversial facts about human psychology and economics. We
should then imagine ourselves in an "original position" behind the "veil of ignorance"; that is, we should
imagine we do not know any facts about our personal circumstances, such as our economic status, our access
to education and health services, or whether we have any talents or abilities that would be beneficial to us
(Rawls 1999, 11). We also remain ignorant of any social factors such as our gender, race, class, and so forth.
Because Rawls assumes that no one wants to live in a society in which they are disadvantaged, operating from
this position offers the greatest chance of arranging a society in a way that is as fair and equitable as possible.
For instance, we would not support a system that forbade all left-handed individuals from voting because we
ourselves might fall into that group.

Rawls argues that two major principles should govern society. First, the "liberty principle" states that each
person has an equal right to the same basic, adequate liberties. Basic liberties are liberties such as freedom of
speech, freedom to hold property, and freedom of assembly. Second, the "difference principle" states that any
social and economic inequalities must satisfy two conditions: (1) they must be attached to offices and positions
open to all under conditions of "fair equality of opportunity," and (2) they must be to the greatest benefit of the
least advantaged members of society. Note that Rawls is not advocating for an equal distribution of goods or
advantages; rather, he says that any distribution of goods or power that is not equal can further disadvantage
already disadvantaged individuals. His goal is to create a society that seeks to address inherent structural
inequalities as well as possible (Rawls 1999, 13).

Egalitarianism

Rawls's theory of justice has much in common with egalitarian theories. The term egalitarianism refers to a
broad family of views that gives primary place to equality. The root egal (from the French) means "equal."
Egalitarian theories assert that all individuals should enjoy equal status and moral worth and that any
legitimate system of government should reflect this value. More specifically, egalitarian theories do not argue
that all individuals should be treated exactly the same; rather, they insist that individuals are all deserving of
rights, including civil, social, and political rights.

Some theorists argue that equality of opportunity for welfare, meaning equality of opportunity to obtain
resources, is the most important type of equality. In addition to resources, equality of opportunity includes a
consideration of how individuals have acquired certain advantages. For example, nepotism (giving
opportunities based on familial connections) and biases based on personal traits such as gender or race
interfere with an individual's ability to compete for resources. Any society that seeks a truly level playing field
needs to contend with these issues.

One way to examine equality is to look at what individuals are able to do. The Indian economist Amartya Sen
popularized a framework now known as the capability approach, which emphasizes the importance of
providing resources to match individual need. This approach creates opportunities for each person to pursue
what they need to live a flourishing life. An example of the capability approach is basic income, in which a city,
state, or country might combat poverty by awarding everyone below a certain income level $1,000 per month.

       Minister's Office, Government of India/Wikimedia Commons, GODL-India)
       The capability approach advocates "treating each person as an end" and "focus[ing] on choice and freedom
       rather than achievements" (Robeyns and Byskov 2021). According to American philosopher Martha Nussbaum
       (b. 1947), the capability approach would improve both justice outcomes and quality of life. She argues that a
       certain number of resources are necessary to enjoy a basic set of positive capabilities that all humans possess.
       Thus, each individual should be provided with those resources so that their life is not "so impoverished that it
       is not worthy of the dignity of a human being" (Nussbaum 2000, 72). What is beneficial about the capability
       approach is that it recognizes and respects the diverse needs of individuals based on different experiences and
       circumstances.
       Listen to philosopher Martha Nussbaum discuss how the capabilities approach aids in creating a positive
       quality of life.

      Socialism

       Rather than look to the individual, the often confused triad of socialism, Marxism, and communism examines
       inequality from an economic perspective. While socialism and communism both seek to address inequalities
       in goods and resources, socialism says that goods and resources should be owned and managed by the public
       and allocated based on the needs of the community rather than controlled solely by the state. A socialist
       system allows for the ownership of private property while relegating most control over basic resources to the
       government. Sometimes, as with democratic socialism, this is done through the democratic process, with the
       result that public resources, such as national parks, libraries, and welfare services, are controlled by a

Critique of Capital

While what are commonly called "Marxist ideals" did not originate solely with Karl Marx, he is responsible for
coauthoring perhaps the most famous treatise criticizing capitalism, The Communist Manifesto (1848), and
laying out a vision of a yet-unrealized true communist society. As such, it is important to examine his ideas in
more detail.

Marx is critical of the private accumulation of capital, which he defines as money and commodities.
Stockpiling of capital allows for private accumulation of power. Marx holds that the value of an object is
determined by the socially necessary amount of labor used in the production of that object. In a capitalist
system, labor is also a commodity, and the worker exchanges their work for a subsistence wage. In Marx's view,
workers' labor in fact creates surplus value, for which they are not paid and which is claimed by the capitalist.
Thus, the worker does not receive full value for their labor.

Alienation

Marx identifies several kinds of alienation that result from the commodification of labor. To illustrate this,
imagine some factory workers who have recently moved to a large city. Prior to the move, they lived in a small
village, where they worked as furniture makers. They were responsible for each stage of the production, from
imagining the design to obtaining the materials and creating the product. They sold the product and kept the
profits of their labor. Now, however, they work on an assembly line, where they are responsible for producing a
small part of an overall product. They are alienated both from the product and from their own productive
nature because they have no hand in the product's design and are involved in only a small part of its
construction. They begin to see their labor, and by extension themselves, as a commodity to be sold.

The result of selling their labor is that they begin to see others as commodities as well. They begin to identify
people not by who they are but by what they have accumulated and their worth as a product. In this way, they
become alienated from themselves and from others, seeing them always as potential competition. For Marx,
this leads to a sense of despair that is filled with material goods, thus solidifying the worker in their
dependence on the capitalist system.

Anarchism

While the idea of negative liberty decries unnecessary government intervention in people's lives, anarchism
literally means "no ruler" or "no government." The absence of a political authority conjures an image of the
state of nature imagined by Thomas Hobbes--that is, a state of chaos. Anarchists, however, believe that
disorder comes from government. According to this view, rational individuals mostly desire to live peaceful
lives, free of government intervention, and this desire naturally leads them to create societies and institutions
built on the principles of self-governance.

Motivations for Anarchism

One defense of anarchism is that governments do things that would be impermissible for private individuals.
French philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865) observes that governments monitor citizens'
activities and attempt to control their behavior through force. The more technology governments have, the
greater their attempts to control people. Proudhon ([1849] 2012) observes that such treatment is against
human dignity.

Proudhonian anarchists are aware of the argument that people may have consented to give up some of their
364 11 · Political Philosophy

       power to the government (as people do in a representative democracy, for example), which means that they
       must accept the treatment they receive. Yet Proudhon would deny that there is any example in history of a just
       government. Lysander Spooner (1808-1887), the 19th-century anarchist, says that all governments have come
       into existence through force and maintain their existence through force (Spooner 1870). Thus, some defend
       anarchism on the grounds that governments violate human rights.
       Limits of Anarchism
       Criticisms of anarchy are often twofold. The first is that without an organized police force, society would be
       unable to control outbreaks of violence. A related concern is that without a judicial system to arbitrate disputes
       and mete out justice, any resolution would be arbitrary. Anarchists, on the other hand, claim that most
       incidents of violence are the result of socioeconomic imbalances that would be resolved if the government
       were dismantled. Social anarchism, for instance, points to community involvement and mutual exchange of
       goods and services as a solution (Fiala 2021).
       Yet some people associate anarchism with political violence, and in fact, some anarchists see violence as an
       unavoidable result of clashes with a violent and oppressive government. One of the most famous anarchists,
       Emma Goldman (1869-1940), wrote in her essay "The Psychology of Political Violence," "Such acts are the
       violent recoil from violence, whether aggressive or repressive; they are the last desperate struggle of outraged
       and exasperated human nature for breathing space and life" (1917). However, many anarchists favor
       nonviolent tactics and civil disobedience, such as protests and the creation of autonomous zones, as opposed
       to political violence (Fiala 2018).

       FIGURE 11.9 Born in Lithuania in 1869, Emma Goldman experienced anti-Semitic persecution before moving to the
       United States at age 16 and becoming a factory worker. She was quickly introduced to the anarchist movement and
       became a prolific writer and passionate speaker advocating the movement's principles. (credit: "Emma Goldman on
       a Street Car, Library of Congress)
       Anarchism and Feminism
       Within anarchism, anarcha-feminism seeks to fight against gendered concepts that create inequity.

                                                                                                                                                        11.4 · Political Ideologies 365

Traditional gender roles only serve to cement unequal power distribution and further the class divide.
Particularly, traditional concepts of women's role in the domestic sphere mirror the depersonalization of the
worker, with the woman seen as an extension of the home and domestic labor, rather than an independent
autonomous person. It is worth noting that anarcha-feminism is in direct opposition to Proudhon, who
believed that family was an essential aspect of society and that the traditional role of women within the family
was necessary for its success (Proudhon 1875).
The author and poet bell hooks believes that the concerns driving anarchism can provide a motivation for
current social action. She notes that the gaps between the rich and the poor are widening in the United States
and that because of the "feminization of poverty" (by which she means the inequality in living standards due to
gender pay disparity), a grassroots radical feminist movement is needed "that can build on the strength of the
past, including the positive gains generated by reforms, while offering meaningful interrogation of existing
feminist theory that was simply wrongminded while offering us new strategies" (hooks 2000, 43). She sees
such a "visionary movement" (43) as grounded in the real-life conditions experienced by working-class and
impoverished women.
Feminists historically have had to fight to make space for themselves within anarchist movements. The
Spanish female collective Mujeres Libres formed during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) in reaction to what
they saw as a dismissal of women's issues by the anarchist movement. Members of Mujeres Libres sought to
support female activists and improve the lives of working-class women through literacy drives, employment
programs, and child care facilities in both neighborhoods and factories (Ackelsberg 1985). These and other
initiatives that focused on creating opportunities for women helped develop a sense of social engagement and
foster a desire for social change.

Summary

11.1 Historical Perspectives on Government

Early political philosophers were concerned with ideas of justice and how best to ensure the most virtuous city.
In Plato's imagined city, the most just city is one in which each member of society occupies the social role they
are the best equipped for based on their talents. The city is governed by guardians, who are trained from
infancy to protect the needs of the society, with the wisest and most virtuous of these becoming philosopher-
kings, the natural rulers. Al-Farabi borrows much from Plato but considers those best able to rule to be
determined by heaven. Al-Farabi's supreme ruler is the founder of the city--not an historical founder, but
rather one who possesses both practical and theoretical knowledge and is not bound by any precedent or prior
authority. The Mohists, in turn, think that we must have leaders that display virtues so that we may emulate
them and become virtuous ourselves. The Mohists believed that individuals were essentially good and wanted
to do what was morally right, but they often lacked an understanding of moral norms.

11.2 Forms of Government

Whereas Plato and Al-Farabi believed that good government could be achieved by having a virtuous leader,
philosophers and laypeople have advanced other structures of government that they feel might better
accomplish this purpose. Monarchies placed political decisions in the hands of a ruler who was chosen by God
and so must be virtuous. Ruling authority in an aristocracy is in the hands of a small number of individuals
considered to be elite members of society. However, ideas of representative government arose as class systems
changed and social contract theory became popular. Later, totalitarian governments emerged as the new
ideologies of communism and fascism sparked revolutions in the 20th century.

11.3 Political Legitimacy and Duty

The concept of political legitimacy grounds the authority of a political system. This is important because it is
difficult to defend the right to rule if a system of government is not accepted by the people. The sociologist Max
Weber identifies three sources of legitimacy: traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal. If we accept the
legitimacy of a political system, then one must consider what obligations exist between the state and its
citizens--and what avenues exist if these obligations are not met. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Medgar Evers, and
other members of the civil rights movement recognized the legitimacy of the United States government but felt
it was not fulfilling its obligations to all of its citizens equally.

11.4 Political Ideologies

Political ideology refers to beliefs about the ways in which society should be governed. Generally, this includes
beliefs about what rights and responsibilities individuals have as well as how goods and resources should be
distributed. Often, individuals will hold similar views in some respects, and likewise, many ideologies have
features in common. This can make it difficult to create sharp distinctions between them. However, because
ideological beliefs influence the actions of those who hold positions of authority in a society, it is important to
attempt to understand their major underlying features. Some of the most common ideologies fall under the
umbrellas of egalitarianism and conservatism, including liberalism, socialism, and anarchism, among others.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

12.1  Enlightenment Social Theory
12.2  The Marxist Solution
12.3  Continental Philosophy's Challenge to Enlightenment Theories
12.4  The Frankfurt School
12.5  Postmodernism

INTRODUCTION The modern era has witnessed rapid change that improved the lives of many but also created
new social problems. The 17th to 19th centuries included the Enlightenment, the scientific revolution, and the
Industrial Revolution. During this period, great unrest occurred, with social contract theory spawning
revolutions in Europe and the Americas. The emergence of capitalism on the ruins of feudalism fueled the rise
of a low-paid urban labor force and a ballooning of numerous related social ills, such as poverty and crime.

Philosophers around the world and throughout history--including Buddha, Plato, and Confucius--have
proposed systems of thought to address the social problems of their age. Three major philosophical
movements arose to address the challenges of the modern era. In Europe, the Enlightenment--often dated
from 1685 to 1815 and also called the Age of Reason--inspired societies to turn to reason, science, and
374 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       technology to achieve better lives for individuals and steady progress for the human race. New fields of social
       science arose, among them sociology, as a means of impartially studying and presenting solutions to social
       problems. New institutions were developed to implement these solutions, many of which still exist
       today--among them democratic government, national banks and lending programs, and a wide array of
       nonprofit organizations to serve those in need.

       The economic progress of this era relied on the system of capitalism, which many thinkers in the early 19th
       century blamed for producing the bulk of human suffering they witnessed. These thinkers increasingly
       embraced a type of socialism called Marxism, which advocated for a communist revolution that placed the
       working class in control of the government and economy. Marxist ideology predicted that communist
       revolutions would inevitably take place as capitalism advanced within the industrializing world and that these
       revolutions would create a society devoid of major social problems. Neither of these predictions were realized.
       Instead, Russia, China, and many countries in Africa, Asia, and South America underwent communist and
       socialist revolutions but failed to achieve the economic or political equality that Marx had envisioned.

       Marxist theorists began rejecting both the inevitability of revolution and the Enlightenment belief that the
       pursuit of knowledge would lead to progress. Instead, they viewed knowledge as reflective of systems of power.
       They argued that philosophers must take on a new role. Rather than be impartial observers, philosophers must
       change the way people engage in public discourse in order to cast light on oppression and ultimately
       accomplish Marx's goal of an equal society. This branch of philosophy became known as critical theory.
       Currently, politicians, school board members, teachers, and parents--among others--are active in debates
       about the inclusion of critical race theory in educational curriculums.

       This chapter examines the philosophies of Enlightenment social theory, Marxist theory, and critical theory that
       inform so much of the way we live our lives today.

     12.1 Enlightenment Social Theory

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Evaluate Enlightenment ideas of progress.
         · Describe positivism.
         · Outline the emergence of empirical sociology as a means of solving social problems.

       Enlightenment thinkers proposed that human reason coupled with empirical study of the physical world
       would lead to progress--namely, the advancement of science and the improvement of the human condition.
       While time-, labor-, and life-saving scientific advances benefited many, the economic developments of the era
       exacerbated inequality and pushed many others into poverty. Concerns also grew about the power of
       governments and other institutions and the role of the individual in increasingly complex and interconnected
       economic and social systems. Political theorists such as John Locke (1632-1704) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau
       (1712-1778) proposed social contract theory, which spoke to the protection of individual freedoms. And new
       fields emerged to study and attempt to address the social problems that were developing.

           CONNECTIONS

       The chapter on political theory examines social contract theories that addressed the protection of individual
       freedoms.

      Rationalism and Empiricism

       Enlightenment thinkers proposed that the knowledge needed to improve social conditions could be gathered
       through rationalism, which regards reason as the source of most knowledge, and empiricism, which relies
       upon the evidence provided by experiments. The French thinker René Descartes (1596-1650) argued that true

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                           12.1 · Enlightenment Social Theory 375

knowledge could be acquired through reason alone, without relying on experience. Descartes's famous quote "I
think therefore I am" insists that we know what we know due to abstract reason. For example, knowing that
one plus one equals two is a function of reason rather than personal experience.

Other Enlightenment thinkers, including the English philosophers Francis Bacon (1561-1626) and John Locke
(1632-1704), believed that knowledge could be gained only through empirical methods, including direct and
indirect observation and experience. According to these thinkers, we make deductions from observations that
suggest patterns or connection. These deductions can then be tested by systematically observing further
phenomena and recording and analyzing data surrounding these phenomena. The scientific method is an
empirical method solidified during the Enlightenment period that has become the standard way of conducting
any type of objective research.

While rationalism and empiricism seem to be making opposing claims about truth, each has value, and the
two can work together. The technological advances of the last 200 years--such as the launching of astronauts
into space; the invention of radio, television, and the internet; and the eradication of diseases such as
polio--can be said to be the result of both rationalism and empiricism.

chapter on logic and reason.

Kant and Ethical Progress

The German Enlightenment thinker Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) proposed that reason alone could guide
individuals to identify ethical codes that would result in an improved society. These codes, which he called
categorical imperatives, could be derived by determining which rules for ethical behavior we might wish to
apply to everyone without exception.

     CONNECTIONS

The chapter on normative moral theories digs deeper into Kant's ethical theory.

Kant believe that applying reason in this way could usher humanity toward a moral society in which each
individual would enjoy the greatest possible freedom. However, Kant also believed that this work of reasoning
out a moral code could not be accomplished by individuals but must be undertaken by entire societies. Nor
could the work be accomplished in one generation; instead, it may take centuries of trial, reflection, and
education. Yet, through this pursuit, societies would progress with each generation, ultimately reaching a
more perfect moral code and a more ideal society (Dupré 1998).

Comte's Positivism

The French philosopher Auguste Comte (1798-1857) crafted a social theory with the goal of pushing humanity
forward toward a more peaceful society--one that could weather the storms of the political revolutions that he
experienced in his youth. Considered the first philosopher of science, Comte analyzed the development of the
different branches of science that existed in his time. Based on this work, he proposed the law of three stages
for the development of societies. In the first stage, individuals attributed the events of life to supernatural
forces. In the second stage, individuals recognized that human efforts and natural forces were largely
responsible for many events while still acknowledging the power of supernatural forces. In the third stage,
individuals shift from focusing on causation to the scientific study of the natural world, human society, and
history. In this third stage, Comte believed that humanity would reject religion and focus only on laws or
postulates that can be proven. Comte called this third stage positivism.

       Grounded in this positivist approach, Comte proposed the establishment of a science of society, which he
       called sociology. He believed that society, like an organism in nature, could be studied empirically and that this
       study could result in human progress. Comte's conception of sociology as a field of study remained in the
       theoretical realm. A few decades after he first proposed it, however, his theoretical ideas for a new discipline
       crossed the Atlantic Ocean and found a home in universities in the United States. Here great minds--such as
       W. E. B. Du Bois, discussed in the next section--established sociology as a practical discipline that could inform
       the policies and programs of governments and institutions.
       Comte believed that humanity would struggle to transition to positivism, as religions provided comforting and
       meaningful structure and rituals. As a result, Comte founded his own church in 1849, which has as its
       theoretical legacy the secular humanism of today.

       Comte struggled with mental health and spent much of his later years in psychiatric hospitals. During this time, he
       established the structure and rituals for his church. Watch Dr. Bart van Heerikhuizen (https://openstax.org/r/

       era. Describe the type of church or alternative social institution you would establish to serve the needs of society in

      Du Bois and Empirical Sociology

       W. E. B. Du Bois, a prominent American intellectual and civil rights activist, pioneered the use of empirical
       methods in the field of sociology. When Du Bois first engaged with sociology, the young field of study was
       largely theoretical. Du Bois criticized early sociologists for making broad generalizations about human

societies based on vague, personal impressions rather than first seeking to gather evidence (Westbrook 2018,
200). Du Bois set out to convert sociology into a scientific discipline.
After receiving his PhD from Harvard University in 1895, Du Bois came to the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia. Here he conducted a complex investigation into the obstacles that African Americans faced in
becoming self-supporting. Over 15 months, Du Bois conducted 2,500 door-to-door interviews, collecting data
on demographics, education, literacy, occupation, health, membership in civic organizations, criminality, rates
of alcoholism, income levels, home ownership rates, voting practices, and the integration of African Americans
into the larger society. He compared his findings with data compiled by the US Census Bureau and other
sources to gain more insight. For example, comparing his data regarding the occupations of people living in
the Seventh Ward, an African American neighborhood, to 1890 census data on the occupations of people in the
whole of Philadelphia, he found that a significantly greater percentage of African Americans were engaged in
low-skilled, low-paying occupations. Du Bois's study and his subsequent book, entitled The Philadelphia
Negro: A Social Study, became the first empirical analysis of racism in the United States.

Today we take for granted our ability to find statistics such as the divorce rate, the crime rate, or the average
salary for a job in the region where we live. However, the collection of this kind of data and its use as a tool to
inform public policies aimed at addressing social problems is a product of Du Bois's determination to bring
science to the study of social issues.

     12.2 The Marxist Solution

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the dialectic method.
         · Contrast the Hegelian and Marxian concepts of dialectic.
         · Outline the stages of Marx's proletariat revolution.
         · Describe how Maoism reframed Marxism as an anti-imperialist revolution.
       Unlike Enlightenment social theory, Marxist theories did not try to solve specific social problems that arose
       from industrialization and urbanization. Rather, they advocated removing the economic system that they felt
       caused these problems--capitalism. When German philosophers Karl Marx and Frederick Engels published
       The Communist Manifesto in 1848, they made a prediction: the workers would overthrow capitalism in the
       most advanced industrial nation, England. The natural forces of history, they argued, made this revolution
       inevitable. They derived their views of these historical forces from the work of German philosopher Georg
       Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) on the dialectic method.

      Hegel's Dialectic Method

       Hegel argued that history itself was the movement created by the interaction between a thesis (an original
       state) and a force countering that original state (antithesis), resulting in a new and higher state (synthesis).
       This dialectic can be likened to a grade report: based on the original grades (the thesis), a student will ideally
       reflect on their performance and address areas of weakness (antithesis) to ultimately arrive at a higher
       understanding of the topics under study (synthesis).
       Hegel argued that in various eras of history, Absolute Spirit--which might be understood in many ways,
       including God or the collective human consciousness--confronts its own essence and transitions to a higher
       state. Hegel saw this most clearly in the life of Jesus and the birth of Christianity. Hegel presents Jesus as a
       rational philosopher who reflects on and confronts Judaism--antithesis challenging thesis. The resurrection of
       Jesus following his crucifixion symbolizes an awakened consciousness both in the individual of Jesus and in
       humanity. Within this framework, the birth of Christianity following Jesus's resurrection is viewed as the
       synthesis, the higher state (Dale 2006).

Marx's Dialectical Materialism and the Proletariat Revolution

In contrast to Hegel's idealistic dialectic, Karl Marx (1818-1883) proposed a view of the dialectic called
dialectical materialism. Dialectical materialism identities the contradictions within material, real-world
phenomena as the driving force of change. Most important to Marx were the economic conflicts between social
classes. The Communist Manifesto, written by Marx and his collaborator Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) states,
"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles" (Marx and Engels [1969] 2000, ch.
1). Marx and Engels note that in every epoch of history (as understood at the time) society has been divided
into social orders and that tensions between these social orders determine the direction of history, rather than
the realization of any abstract ideals. Specifically, they identified the colonization of the Americas and the rise
of trade with India and China as the revolutionary forces that created and enriched the bourgeois class,
ultimately resulting in the death of feudalism. Similarly, Marx regarded the clash of economic interests
between the bourgeoisie (owners of the means of production) and the proletariat (workers) as the
contradiction that would bring down capitalism and give rise to a classless society (Marx and Engels [1969]
2000).

     CONNECTIONS

For a deeper dive into Marx's views, visit the chapter on political philosophy.

Marx laid out a detailed plan for how the proletariat revolution would occur. Marx proposed the concept of
surplus value as a contradictory force within capitalism. Surplus value was the profit the capitalists made
above and beyond the wages of the workers. This profit strengthens the capitalists' monetarily and so gives
them more power over the workers and a greater ability to exploit them. Marx viewed this surplus value as a
key part of the "economic law of motion of modern society" that would inevitably lead to revolution (Marx
[1954] 1999).
Despite there being competition among workers for jobs, Marx believed that conflict with their employers
would bind them. As capitalism advanced, the workers would form into a class of proletariats, which would
then form trade unions and political parties to represent its interests. As the revolution advanced, the most
resolute members of the working-class political parties, those with the clearest understanding of the
movement, would establish the communist party. The proletariat, led by the communists, would then "wrest,
by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the
380 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       State" (Marx and Engels [1969] 2000, ch. 2). The communist party would need to rule society as "the
       dictatorship of the proletariat" and enact reforms that would lead to a classless society.

       These developments did, in fact, materialize--but in Russia, not in England, as Marx had predicted. Marx had
       expected the revolution to begin in England, since it was the most industrial society, and to spread to other
       nations as their capitalist economies advanced to the same degree. The unfolding of actual events in a way
       contrary to Marx's predictions led Marxists and others to doubt the reliability of Marx's system of dialectical
       materialism. This doubt was compounded by the realizations that the Russian communist party was
       responsible for killing millions of farmers and dissidents and that some working-class parties and unions were
       turning to fascism as an alternative to communism. By the early to mid-20th century, opponents of the
       capitalist system were questioning orthodox Marxism as a method of realizing the ideal of a government by the
       working class.

                THINK LIKE A PHILOSOPHER

       Watch "Karl Marx on Alienation (https://openstax.org/r/KarlMarxonAlienation)" from the series A History of Ideas.
       The video examines Marx's claim that the alienation and oppression created by capitalism would fuel revolution in
       the working class. He called for the workers to revolt, as "they had nothing to lose but their chains."

       Questions:

         · Was Marx wrong about the marginalization occurring within and through a capitalistic economy? Using at least
             one credible source, offer an argument (based on your source) that either supports or refutes his claim. Does
             your argument resonate with your lived experience?

         · Where was or is the revolution? Should we dismiss Marx (or at least his claim that alienation occurs through the
             oppression rendered by privately owned means of production) given the absence of a global revolution?

      Revolutionary Movements of the 20th Century

       During the first two decades of the 20th century, revolutions swept across the globe. Contrary to Marx's
       prediction, these did not occur in the most industrialized countries. Rather, the Ottoman Empire (in Turkey),
       the Russian Empire, and the Chinese empire all fell to coalitions of different groups, including advocates for
       representative government who embraced Enlightenment philosophies, socialists and communists
       implementing their versions of Marxism, and factions within the military that sought to empower their nations
       through modernization.

       Lenin's Imperialism

       In 1917, Russian revolutionary leader and Marxist theorist Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924) published a pamphlet
       proposing to explain why communist revolutions were not occurring in the most advanced industrialized
       capitalist economies. Lenin suggested that capitalism had morphed into imperialism. Rather than continuing
       to squeeze their own working classes at home for profits, large national monopolies had gained access to both
       cheap raw material and labor and new markets in Africa, Asia, and South America. The result, Lenin argued, is
       that communist revolutions will take place in these subjugated nations rather than in the most industrialized
       countries (Lenin [1963] 2005).

       Mao's Reframing

       The military losses of the once-great Chinese empire to imperialist invasions over the course of the 19th and
       early 20th centuries and the resulting humiliations played a major role in the Chinese revolution of 1911.
       Imperialist Japan's conquering of northern China provoked an on-and-off military alliance between Chinese
       democratic reformers and the Chinese Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong (1893-1976), that eventually
       deteriorated into civil war. Adopting Lenin and his predecessors' views of imperialism, Mao reframed the

Marxist revolution. Imperialist nations represented capitalists and the semifeudal, colonial, and semicolonial
states that they subjugated represented the proletariat. The Chinese revolution, Mao argued, was part of a
global revolution against capitalism that would see subjugated nations throw off imperialist chains and
establish Marx's vision (Mao [1966] 2004).
Mao's reframing of the Marxist revolution has profoundly impacted the course of history. Anti-imperialist,
socialist groups in Africa, Asia, and South America helped their countries achieve independence. Often
displacing other nationalist groups that supported revolution, they succeeded at one period in establishing a
large network of small socialist states. Today, as workers in industrialized nations have failed to embrace
communism, Marxists largely envision their battle to be against what they view as modern-day imperialist
nations.
Unlike Russia and industrialized nations, China lacked an organized working class that might provide the
Communist Party with the numbers and material support needed to launch a revolution. As a result, Mao
addressed his rhetoric not only to the proletariat proper but to the peasantry as well. He defined a different
class struggle--one between the peasants and the landlord class. "The ruthless economic exploitation and
political oppression of the peasants by the landlord class forced them into numerous uprisings against its
rule," Mao noted in the Little Red Book--a selection of Mao's quotes first published in 1964 that all individuals
were strongly encouraged to own and study (Mao [1966] 2000, ch. 2). Mao extended the revolutionary class
even further to include members of the intelligentsia and the petty bourgeoisie, a term describing those
managing small-scale commercial undertakings. Mao urged all these people to join the peasants and the
proletariat and become "saviors of the people" by ousting the Japanese imperialists and establishing a new
democracy based on Marxist principles. Mao even extended membership in the revolutionary class to
members of the bourgeoisie who held strong nationalist, anti-imperialist views: "Being a bourgeoisie in a
colonial and semi-colonial country and oppressed by imperialism, the Chinese national bourgeoisie retains a
certain revolutionary quality" (Mao [1966] 2004, § 5).
Mao's reframing of the proletariat afforded Marxist movements far greater flexibility in choosing supporters
and defining their enemies. Like Mao's reenvisioning of the Marxist revolution, this shift enabled the spread of
Marxism within the less-industrialized world.

       Cultural Revolution and Reeducation

       Mao identified the transformation of China from a feudal monarchy to a representative democratic system to a
       Marxist democracy as a series of cultural revolutions. Despite Mao's highly inclusive definition of the
       revolutionary element, he strongly emphasized the primacy of the proletariat and the Communist Party. In
       discussing the new democracy, Mao explained, "This culture can be led only by the culture and ideology of the
       proletariat, by the ideology of communism, and not by the culture and ideology of any other class" (Mao [1966]
       2004, § 12). Mao had galvanized the support of many groups to win control of China. Now, Mao needed a
       mechanism to maintain the primacy of the Communist Party and communist control of the nation once
       imperialist Japan had been evicted from northern China.

       Mao found his mechanism with a method he called self-criticism. Mao warned that the party must not become
       complacent after achieving success. The minds of comrades, Mao explained, gather dust and must be washed
       from time to time. Engaging in regular self-criticism meant that the party might avoid mistakes and respond
       quickly and effectively to setbacks. A deeper motivation for self-criticism, however, stemmed from the
       Communist Party's desire to establish and maintain control over the new society.

       In theory, self-criticism would consist of groups of comrades sitting together, discussing their ideas, reporting
       on their dealings, and helping each other improve. Mao described how self-criticism should proceed: "If we
       have shortcomings, we are not afraid to have them pointed out and criticized, because we serve the people.
       Anyone, no matter who, may point out our shortcomings. If he is right, we will correct them. If what he
       proposes will benefit the people, we will act upon it" (Mao [1966] 2000, ch. 27).

       In practice, as early as the 1930s, self-criticism sessions turned from small groups that shamed individuals
       into public events in which "class enemies" were denounced, humiliated, and beaten, often by people whom
       they were close to--such as family members, students, or friends. Indeed, Mao recognized these practices as
       essential to the revolutionary movement: "A well-disciplined Party armed with the theory of Marxism-
       Leninism, using the method of self-criticism and linked with the masses of the people; an army under the
       leadership of such a Party; a united front of all revolutionary classes and all revolutionary groups under the
       leadership of such a Party--these are the three main weapons with which we have defeated the enemy" (Mao
       [1966] 2000, ch. 1). Mao's attempts to reeducate his people culminated in the Cultural Revolution (1966-1977),
       during which mobs and militias murdered somewhere between hundreds of thousands to millions of citizens
       who were deemed class enemies.

       Whereas in practice, self-criticism in China resulted in brutality and repression, the idea that communication
       and self-examination can serve as a tool of liberation has continued to develop.

       In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars began to challenge both empiricism and rationalism. In particular,
       scholarship in the disciplines of hermeneutics and phenomenology questioned what we can know and how we
       should approach the acquisition of knowledge. Though these fields did not address social issues, they
       informed critical theory, which provided a new perspective on why Enlightenment social theory may not be
       enough to solve social problems. This section examines these ideas that lay the groundwork for critical theory.

Hermeneutics

The area of philosophy that deals with the nature of objective and subjective meaning in relation to written
texts is called hermeneutics. Hermeneutics is the study of interpretation. When engaged in hermeneutics, we
are asking questions such as author's intent, how the audience interprets the text in question, the assumptions
that fuel the reader to make the conclusions they come to, etc. Hermeneutics is of great importance to this
chapter as it deals with the possibilities of seeing a thing from not just one perspective but several. One of the
key ideas of hermeneutics is the suggestion that truth is relative to perspective and is not fixed.

FIGURE 12.7 Hermeneutics challenges the idea that a text "means" just one thing, pointing instead to the
relationship between text and reader as creating a diversity of possible meanings. (credit: "How My Professors
Annotate Their Books" by Michael Pollak/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Historicity
Historicity is the philosophical view that everything that we encounter gains its meaning through the
temporal events that surround its introduction to and maintenance in the world. In this view, both the author
and the text produced by the author are products of history. Historicity asserts that there is no such thing as
unmediated meaning; no textual claim stands apart from the events in time that give rise to it. Hermeneutics
took up the concerns of historicity when it engaged the question of whether the construction of a text could
possibly reveal more about the meaning than the author intended. For example, the analysis of a Charles
Dickens novel usually focuses on the struggle of Victorian society to come to terms with the inhumane
conditions brought about by the industrial revolution in England. Dickens himself was forced to work in a
boot-blacking factory at a young age. Yet his writing communicates ideas that he was not necessarily aware of.
His first edition of Oliver Twist presented the villain Fagin using anti-Semitic stereotypes. When an
acquaintance made him aware of this, Dickens initially denied it, but the subsequent edition replaced many
instances of the term the Jew with the name Fagin (Meyer 2005).
Reception and Interpretation
If hermeneutics is the art of understanding, then it follows that authentic communication is a discussion
between what is transmitted by the text and what the audience receives. Reception includes not just what is
heard or read but what is perceived. For example, the biblical book of Revelations has caused hundreds of
years of fierce battles over its proper interpretation. Some readers hold that the events spoken of within the
text will literally happen. Others approach it with a solely historical mindset, viewing it as furnishing a
message of hope to an oppressed community during a specific time in the past. And some view it as expressing
allegorical ideas about the processes of change and growth. Which reading is correct? According to
hermeneutics-based biblical scholar Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976), one must have "a living relationship" with
384 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       the text one wants to understand. Stated differently, one must engage the historical, literary, cultural,
       socioeconomic, religious, and political background within which the text was written to fully grasp its
       significance.

       Hermeneutics rejects both the absolute power of rational thought propagated by Descartes and the empiricism
       promoted by other Enlightenment thinkers. In fact, hermeneutics challenges the basic idea of things having
       one absolute meaning. Instead, meaning is understood as being derived not from an objective source but from
       the reader. In doing so, hermeneutics regards the knowledge gained from objective investigations (such as
       scientific experiments) as one of many possible viewpoints.

       Ricoeur's Narrative Accounts of Self and Society

       French philosopher Paul Ricoeur (1913-2005) held that there was nothing that a text says by itself. Perhaps
       more clearly, he argued that any text is only capable of saying what we say it says. What someone does when
       they "understand" a literary work or the words of another person in conversation is to create meaning based
       on the available words. Even if the author of a text were with us to interpret every word, we still could not arrive
       at "the" meaning of the text, since it is doubtful that we could ever experience the literary work from the same
       context as the writer (Gill 2019). Discourse is the name Ricoeur assigned to the process of making meaning
       out of the texts and dialogues that have been presented to us. As opposed to the identification of things in the
       natural sciences, a process limited in possible meanings, discourse possesses endless interpretative
       possibilities.

       In the later part of Ricouer's career, he switched his focus from symbols to metaphor and narrative. For
       Ricouer, a metaphor is not simply the exchange of one word for another. Rather, a metaphor is a way of saying
       that which is in some sense unsayable. There is something that radiates beyond the metaphor to the point that
       the substituted whole is beyond the sum of its parts. By "narrative," Ricoeur meant not stories themselves but
       the norms structuring how stories are told and received (Ricoeur 1991, 8, 10). In this perspective, there is no
       pure narrative unmediated by the reader's perspective.

      Phenomenology

       Phenomenology, very generally, can be defined as the study of how an individual encounters the world
       through first-person experience. One can dive deeper to identify several areas of inquiry within
       phenomenology, such as the nature of experience, the use of symbols to convey experience, objective vs.
       subjective experience, the connection between experience and values, and the experiential importance of
       religious ideas. Phenomenology argues that the starting point of philosophical reflection must be the realm of
       experience and not the realm of abstract ideas. Instead of starting with the purely mental idea of a thing,
       phenomenology suggests that we reflect on how the experience of a thing affects us. For example, a
       phenomenological approach would encounter a chair from the perspective of the purpose it is serving at that
       particular moment (perhaps it's being used as a table) and not what the idea of "chair" may indicate.
       Phenomenology tasks us with working toward an understanding of various types of experiences involving the
       thing in question.

       Phenomenology and Reality

       Phenomenology was largely developed by French thinker Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961) and German
       philosopher Edmund Husserl (1859-1938). Husserl argued that when one begins the phenomenological
       investigation, one must suspend the temptation to assert that an object is in essence what it appears to be.
       Rather, Husserl advocated that we focus on how the thing appears to us. Husserl thus provided the foundation
       of the phenomenological project: the relinquishing of assumptions about the objects of experience.

Merleau-Ponty further rejected Descartes's distinction between the mind and the body. Merleau-Ponty argued
that we cannot separate perception or consciousness from the body, as we perceive the outside world through
our bodies. The body structures our perception. For example, Merleau-Ponty pointed to psychological studies
of phenomena such as phantom-limb syndrome and hallucinations to show that the body mediates our
perception of the outside world (Merleau-Ponty 2012).
Martin Heidegger's (1889-1976) brand of phenomenology, focusing on the nature of human being (what he
referred to as "Dasein"), argued that being by necessity has to occur in the world, as being cannot manifest
without a world. This view challenged attempts to discover the nature of being in the realm of theory and ideas.
Heidegger proposed that abstract ideas don't reveal much about being since they are not in the world. If we
want to analyze the nature of being, we must not focus on individual instances of beings and our external
assumptions about them, but rather examine the world, the realm in which being itself occurs. For Heidegger,
what gives rise to the experience of being is more revealing than an investigation of things (Smith 2013).
For example, this view would privilege experiences from everyday life, such as driving to the store or greeting a
neighbor on the sidewalk, as more informative on the nature of being than abstract philosophical reflections
on transportation or neighborly interactions. As another example, consider the difference between music that
aligns with standards of music theory and that which does not. In the case of the former, a song is good
because it follows abstract ideas of harmony, uniform time signatures, etc. In the case of the latter, a song may
break some or all the rules of music theory but still present a phenomenological reality of experiences of joy,
pain, angst, or anger. In fact, Heidegger was very interested in works of art and their function to authentically
imitate life as it is and not as abstract concepts say it should be.
Phenomenology and Ethics
There is a strong connection between ethics and phenomenology. The phenomenological vantage point of
reflecting on experience engenders a sense of wonder. Some philosophers would assert that ethics has this
sort of awe-inspiring quality; we do the "right" action because it compels us. From a phenomenological
perspective, the ethical response, like all experience, cannot be reduced to biological, chemical, or logical
386 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       reasons. That which persuades us to do something we are convinced of to be "good" or "right" makes a claim
       that transcends either of these. In other words, there is a difference between someone not causing
       unnecessary harm to another merely because the law prohibits it and a person who has truly been persuaded
       by the phenomenological presentation of another human that they matter greatly and should not be harmed
       unnecessarily.

       Phenomenology deeply engages the questions of ethics by investigation of the nature of immediate human
       experience. Allowing oneself to be authentically confronted with the suffering of other humans can cause us to
       want to fight for those who are suffering, even when abstract conceptual ethics might indicate that this is not
       our responsibility. For example, a person is not required by any abstract legal or ethical mandate to give one of
       their kidneys to a stranger. But when they are confronted phenomenologically with the suffering experience of
       the person who needs the kidney, they may be moved to donate their kidney even though they do not have to.

      Existentialism

       Existentialism can be defined as the philosophical focus on the human situation, including discussions of
       human freedom, the making of meaning, and reflections on the relevance of the human sciences and religion.
       Existentialism's phenomenological roots along with an emphasis on human freedom provides its foundation.
       In the existentialist view, the world of experience and meaning is created from the ground up, rather than
       moving from the abstract realm into the world. This reversal is the basis of human freedom: if humans create
       the overarching structures of society, then these structures lack the transcendent foundation that would
       qualify them for objectivity. In other words, if humans created all of the ideas many take to be pre-existent and
       necessary to our world, then these ideas are obviously not pre-existent and are not necessary. If these
       structures aren't more or less fixed in the way that the law of gravity is, then we can change them as needed.
       Existentialism is grounded in the belief in human freedom. The world does not cause an individual's actions,
       as the world and the individual are one, hence the individual is free. From human freedom comes the
       responsibility to engage the world and shape it as one sees fit to.

     12.4 The Frankfurt School

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the main goal of critical theory as developed by the Frankfurt School.
         · Describe the Frankfurt School's revision of Enlightenment and Marxist ideas.
         · Evaluate communicative action as a tool for liberation.
         · Explain how critical theory is messianic.

       What we know as critical theory emerged from the work of a group of early 20th-century Marxist German
       philosophers and social theorists at the Institute for Social Research at Goethe University in Frankfurt,
       Germany--a group that came to be known as the Frankfurt School. It arose within the turbulent political
       environment of the socialist revolutions of the early 20th century and the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany.

       Following World War I, the socialist 1918-19 November Revolution dethroned the existing monarchy in
       Germany, replacing it with a parliamentary system that was later known as the Weimar Republic. Felix Weil
       (1898-1975), who would go on to provide the financial backing for what would become the Frankfurt School,
       was on the front lines of the revolution, serving in the Frankfurt Workers' and Soldiers' Council. The son of a
       wealthy entrepreneur, Weil aligned himself with philosophers, artists, and others who had been shifted to the

left by the experiences of WWI and by other socialists. In 1923, Weil helped establish what was known as
"Marxist Study Week," a gathering of left-leaning thinkers, many of whom would later be affiliated with the
Institute for Social Research. Although the Institute for Social Research was founded in 1924, it was under the
leadership of Max Horkheimer, who became director in 1930, that the institute began to focus on practical
responses to social oppression (Horkheimer [1972] 1992).
In 1933, in response to the rise of the Nazi regime, the institute moved from Frankfurt to Geneva, Switzerland
(Löwenthal 1981). From Geneva, the institute relocated to New York City, where it was made a part of Columbia
University. It was while the institute was part of Columbia that the Frankfurt School gained notice and prestige,
with its research methods gaining acceptance among other academics. After the end of World War II, some of
the Frankfurt School intellectuals returned to West Germany while others remained in the United States. A full
return of the institute to Frankfurt occurred in the 1950s (Held 1980).

The Formation of a Critical Theory

Although the Frankfurt School did not articulate one singular view, one identifying mark of its critical theory
was a push toward emancipating humanity from the multitude of forces viewed as enslaving it. Max
Horkheimer (1895-1973) argued that a plausible critical theory must do several things: explain the ills of
society, identify the means by which change can occur, provide a rubric for critique, and articulate reasonable
goals (Horkheimer [1972] 1992). The Frankfurt School not only sought to free those oppressed through
cultural, economic, and political structures but also sought to free philosophical theory from the chains of
oppressive ideologies. The members of the Frankfurt School critiqued Enlightenment thought, revised key
Marxist concepts, and proposed new strategies pertaining to how social change can be accomplished.

Critique of the Enlightenment Concept of Knowledge

The Frankfurt School was critical of the Enlightenment view of true knowledge as conceptual, hence separate
from the world. Drawing on the work of other branches of philosophy that had arisen in continental Europe
388 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       during the 19th and 20th centuries--in particular, phenomenology and hermeneutics--the school focused on
       how the context within which we experience a phenomenon or observe an object can change our
       interpretation of its meaning. The Frankfurt School rejected the Enlightenment's faith in the ability of reason
       to lay bare the secrets of the universe. For these thinkers, knowledge did not consist of absolute "facts" but
       instead an awareness of the structures of our social world that shape what we believe to be facts (Corradetti
       2021).
       While many philosophical systems revolved around abstract ideas made popular by the Enlightenment, the
       critical theory developed at the Frankfurt School attempted to engage the world as it was and not as
       philosophical frameworks painted it to be. The theorists of the Frankfurt School asserted that philosophical
       ideas are not abstract concepts. Rather, the ideas that structure the world as we live in it are the result of social,
       political, cultural, and religious forces and are therefore lived issues. Moreover, to the degree that these forces
       are oppressive, so are the accepted beliefs or knowledge generated by these forces. The purpose of true
       knowledge is thus to inform us on how the social world can be liberated from marginalizing and oppressive
       concepts (Corradetti 2021).
       Horkheimer's Rejection of the Primacy of Reason
       The Enlightenment had established a hierarchical relationship between philosophy--and by extension
       reason--and science. Kant had positioned reason itself as the key to understanding science and to making
       sense of how scientific discoveries fit into the overall framework of knowledge. According to the Kantian view,
       proper philosophical reflection was based in reason. Horkheimer rejected this prioritization of reason. He
       asserted that the objects of scientific reflection were shaped and determined through context (Horkheimer
       [1972] 1992). Horkheimer and others criticized Kant and Enlightenment philosophy as abstract, irrelevant, or
       in the worst case, enabling the oppression that occurred since Kant's time. Instead, the Frankfurt School
       offered a focus on how philosophy could be used to make a practical difference within that world.
       Benjamin's Disruption of the Status Quo
       A common denominator among the multiplicity of ideas within the Frankfurt School could arguably be what
       German-Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) called the "messianic." By this, he meant a
       disruption within the status quo that eventually responds in various ways to the oppression occurring in a
       society (Horkheimer [1972] 1992). Jewish and Judeo-Christian theology prophesies a messianic redeemer who
       will eventually bring peace to an unstable world. Benjamin adapted the term to indicate a conceptual
       resistance to hegemonic systems (another term for the power structures of the status quo). This resistance is
       not part of and does not flow from linear history but rather interrupts it. Benjamin understood systems such as
       capitalism to be linear pathways of history that the messianic impulse interrupts, thus bringing forth a reality
       that does not flow from past to present but always is. Benjamin held that such a disruption of linear time
       disrupts systems of power by creating a classless moment (Khatib 2013).
       One example of Benjamin's idea of the messianic would be the eradication of the socially constructed
       hierarchy of race. Disrupting this concept would presumably result in a society devoid of the stratification that
       is connected to notions of race. The difficulty with this idea is that messianic moments within human societies
       don't seem to last. With the messianic deconstruction of one status quo (such as race) arises another
       construction that eventually takes the place of the former as the status quo (such as class).

The Revision of the Marxist Dialectic
The Frankfurt School amended the dialectical method to address what they saw as the shortcomings of Marx's
belief that the progression of the world from capitalism to socialism was inevitable. As we can see now, a
socialist future has yet to be the inevitable end point of all capitalist societies. In the hands of Frankfurt School
theorists, the dialectical method became not a forecast for humanity's future, but a "down and dirty"
understanding of the arbitrariness of the social situation in any given era (Horkheimer [1972] 1992). This
understanding indicated that what is to come must be shaped in a real way by intentional action, as opposed to
theoretical reflection. While utilizing elements of Marxist philosophies, many Frankfurt School thinkers held
that social transformation was not inevitable but needed to be worked toward in conscious ways.

Jürgen Habermas's Communicative Action

The Frankfurt School sociologist and philosopher Jürgen Habermas (b. 1929) is the most prolific figure
associated with the Frankfurt School, producing work touching on a variety of topics in social life (Bronner
2011). Habermas took Max Horkheimer's place as the chair in sociology and philosophy at the Institute for
Social Research in 1964.
A prized possession of many societies is a democratic right to free speech; this right was championed by
Habermas. As articulated by Habermas, the emancipation of a society is fueled by more than the mere act of
people saying what they feel. Rather, people must say what they feel in a public forum in which their ideas can
be challenged--in a forum through which people debate freely and thus sharpen their ideas. Habermas viewed
this sort of open discussion as having the potential to shape and transform how political systems are run.
Habermas calls this sort of pressure by dialogue communicative action.
The foundation upon which communicative action rests is the ground of language. Communicative action
views language not as an unchanging system that will always produce certain conclusions but as a process of
390 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       discovery that is most effective when the ideas we hold most dear are put to intense scrutiny. Language
       becomes the process by which humans create and agree upon the norms that are most important to them
       (Bronner 2011).

       Habermas viewed communicative action as taking place in the public sphere. The public sphere refers both to
       the spaces in which people discuss the issues of the day and the collective conceptual realm of people involved
       in such discussions. The public sphere is a realm outside of nation and state politics where people can be
       persuaded to engage in some sort of political action (Asen 1999). Habermas contrasts the public sphere with
       the private sphere, which is the realm where the mechanisms that perpetuate society reside, such as the
       organizations and enterprises responsible for the production of commodities within an economy (Habermas
       1989, 30).

       Modern-day examples of the public sphere might be social media platforms or coffeehouses. The hip-hop
       element of rap is another type of public sphere, with rapper Chuck D of Public Enemy famously stating that rap
       is the "CNN" of Black America. Public sphere theory asserts that the best governments are the ones that take
       heed of the communicative action that takes place in the public sphere (Benhabib 1992).

      Paulo Freire's Critical Pedagogy

       Inspired by Frankfurt School thinkers, Brazilian philosopher Paulo Freire (1921-1997) made key
       contributions to a school of thought known as the critical pedagogy movement. Freire asserted that the
       education provided to people living in the postcolonized world wasn't adequate for emancipation. Freire
       argued that the type of education needed would move toward a deconstruction of the means by which
       knowledge production is structured and disseminated in a colonial society. Similar to Habermas's
       communicative action, Freire affirmed that authentic communication must occur between teacher and
       student for true education to take place. True education involves asking "why" questions of the most
       foundational aspects of the society. This challenging of assumptions prompts the student to consider whether
       the foundational aspects of a society are actually beneficial or are simply accepted as normal and natural since
       things have "always" been this way. For Freire, you are only authentically human when you live a life that
       practices free critical reflection, which leads to emancipation (Freire [2000] 2012). In other words,
       emancipated humans not only think for themselves but also question the very ways in which society says we
       should think.

     12.5 Postmodernism

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Outline the main tenets of postmodernism.
         · Analyze structuralist theories in psychology and linguistics.
         · Evaluate the post-structuralist response to structuralism.
         · Explain concepts central to the thought of Derrida, Nietzsche, and Foucault.

       Many modern scholars embraced the idea that the world operates according to a set of overarching universal
       structures. This view proposes that as we continue to progress in terms of technological, scientific, intellectual,
       and social advancements, we come closer to discovering universal truths about these structures. This view of
       progression toward truth gave rise to a school of thought known as structuralism, which is pervasive in many
       academic fields of study, as discussed below. Postmodernism departs from this way of thinking in rejecting
       these ideas and contending that there exists no one reality that we can be certain of and no absolute truth.

      Structuralism and Post-structuralism

       The philosophical battle over whether there is one nonnegotiable reality took shape in conversations around
       structuralism and post-structuralism. Structuralists historically looked to verbal language and mathematics
       to show that symbols cannot refer to just anything we want them to refer to. For example, most people would

                                                                                                                                                             12.5 · Postmodernism 391

say it is ridiculous to use the word car to refer to a dog. Rather, language and mathematics are universal
systems of communication emerging from a universal structure of things. This claim sounds similar to
Platonic idealism, in which the structures that ground our world are understood as intangible "forms."

     CONNECTIONS

You can learn more about Plato's concept of forms in the chapter on metaphysics.

Post-structuralists argue that universal structures are abstract ideas that cannot be proven to exist. They
contend that structuralists are mistaken in their understanding of the internal workings of language--or any
system--as unmediated (or not influenced by the outside world). This mistake, they argue, had misled people
into believing in a universal structure of things. Post-structuralism suggests that the meaning of things is in
perpetual authorship, or is always being created and recreated. Post-structuralists dispute the claim that any
universal system of relations exists. Rather, they argue that anything presented as a universal system is in fact
the product of human imaginations and almost certainly reinforced by the power dynamics of a society.

One clear example of the post-structuralist critique of structuralism can be found in the debate over
psychoanalysis.

Freud's Structuralism in Psychology

The theory of psychoanalysis is based on the idea that all humans have suppressed elements of their
unconscious minds and that these elements will liberate them if they are confronted. This idea was proposed
and developed by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). For Freud, psychoanalysis was not only a
theory but also a method, which he used to free his patients from challenges such as depression and anxiety.
In Freud's early thinking, the "unconscious" was defined as the realm in which feelings, thoughts, urges, and
memories that exist outside of consciousness reside. These elements of the unconscious were understood to
set the stage for conscious experience and influence the human automatically (Westen 1999). Freud later
abandoned the use of the word unconscious (Carlson et al. 2010, 453), shifting instead to three separate terms:
id, referring to human instincts; superego, indicating the enforcer of societal conventions such as cultural
norms and ethics (Schacter, Gilbert, and Wegner 2011, 481); and ego, describing the conscious part of human
thought. With these three terms, Freud proposed a universal structure of the mind.

Post-structuralist and Feminist Critiques of Psychoanalysis

Post-structuralists point out that Freud's ideas about psychoanalysis and universal structures of the mind
cannot be proven. The subconscious foundations on which psychoanalysis is grounded simply cannot be
observed. Some have argued that there is no substantive difference between the claims of psychoanalysts and
those of shamans or other practitioners of methods of healing not grounded in empirical methods (Torrey
1986). French philosopher Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) and French psychoanalyst Felix Guattari (1930-1992)
took an even harsher approach, presenting psychoanalysis as a means of reinforcing oppressive state control.

Belgian philosopher Luce Irigaray (b. 1930) and others have criticized Freud's ideas from a feminist
perspective, accusing psychoanalysts of excluding women from their theories. In this view, psychoanalysis is
based on a patriarchal understanding. Those taking this view point out that Freud made a number of
patriarchal claims, including that sexuality and subjectivity are inseparably connected, and that he viewed
women as problematic throughout his life (Zakin 2011). Yet many psychoanalytic feminists express a critical
appreciation for Freud, utilizing what they find valuable in his theories and ignoring other aspects.

Ferdinand de Saussure and the Structure of Linguistics

Along with US pragmatist C. S. Pierce (1839-1914), Swiss philosopher, linguist, and semiotician Ferdinand de
Saussure (1857-1913) was responsible for creating a system of linguistic analysis known as semiotics.
Semiotics is an analysis of how meaning is created through symbols, both linguistic and nonlinguistic. One of
392 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       the foundational tenets of Saussure's linguistic theory is the idea that language has both an abstract (langue)
       component and an experiential (parole) component, what we hear or see when it is used every day. A word
       alludes to an intangible essence represented by a sound or collection of visible symbols (Fendler 2010). This
       audible or visual expression has a distinct life from that which it represents. Language is a system that
       functions according to certain rules, which allow for some things but not others. For example, we can't say a
       person is walking and standing still at the same time (Nöth 1990). As an audible or visual expression, however,
       language is also a product of society. For example, the word dope, which conventionally meant narcotics, has
       also come to signify something that is well-done. Saussure held that there were structural laws that define how
       linguistic signification operated; the semiotics of Saussure and Pierce were the means of discovering these
       laws. Semiotics became a cornerstone of structuralism.

       Wittgenstein and the Linguistic Turn

       Structuralism was accompanied by what is known in philosophy as the linguistic turn. The term linguistic
       turn comes from Austrian philosopher Gustav Bergmann (1906-1987). It refers to philosophical movements in
       the Anglophone world starting in the early 20th century that privileged verifiable statements over statements
       that could not be verified. Since the statement "I can see clearly now" could be verified by a vision test, it would
       have more value than the statement "God exists," which is not verifiable (Rorty 1991, 50).

       The view that language has internal continuity was championed by the early work of Austrian philosopher
       Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) but rejected in his later work. In later works, such as Philosophical
       Investigations, Wittgenstein concludes that language is verifiable only within its particular context. For
       example, the claim "God exists" may not be verifiable for an adherent of analytic philosophy (a term for the
       branch of philosophy concerned with statements that can be proved to be logically possible through analysis).
       However, the claim might be verifiable for a person who has had an experience with a particular deity or
       deities, as their very experience is the proof.

       Key Post-structuralist Ideas about Self and Text

       Associated with the thought of French philosophers Michel Foucault (1926-1984), Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995),
       and Roland Barthes (1915-1980) and US philosophers Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) and Judith Butler
       (b. 1956), among others, post-structuralism proposes new ideas about our understanding of the self and our
       interpretations of texts. Post-structuralism proposes that there is no such thing as a preexistent human "self"
       outside of its construction by society; what we call the "self" is a confluence of geographical region of birth,
       upbringing, social pressure, political issues, and other situational circumstances. For the post-structuralist,
       however, there is an experiencing entity perpetually in process, and that experiencing entity cannot be
       constricted to the boundaries of what we think of as the "self." Similarly emphasizing context, post-
       structuralists argue that the meaning intended by the author of a text is secondary to the meaning that the
       audience derives from their encounter with the text and that a variety of interpretations of a text are needed,
       even if the interpretations that are generated are conflicting.

      Deconstruction

       Closely related to post-structuralism is deconstruction. Accredited to Algerian-born French philosopher
       Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), deconstruction aims to analyze a text to discover that which made it what it was.
       Derrida rejected the structuralist approach to textual analysis. In the structuralist framework, there was a
       focus on how a text fits into a larger framework of linguistic meaning and signifying (Barry 2002, 40). Derrida,
       among others, held that these structures were as arbitrary as other facets of language, such as the arbitrary
       decision to use "tree" to refer to a large plant with a bark, trunk, and leaves when we could have called it a "cell
       phone" and have procured the same symbolic use (Thiselton 2009). Derrida asserted that texts do not have a
       definitive meaning but rather that there are several possible and plausible interpretations. His argument was
       based on the assertion that interpretation could not occur in isolation. While Derrida did not assert that all
       meanings were acceptable, he did question why certain interpretations were held as more correct than others

all of our thinking is riddled with a false, that is, unjustified and unhelpful, privileging of one thing over another." The
narrator offers several examples: speech over writing, reason over passion, men over women, etc. According to
Derrida, this unquestioned privileging prevents us from seeing the supposedly lesser part of the equation.

Questions:

  · Can you deconstruct an idea that, to this point, you have simply accepted as correct?
  · What are the merits of what Derrida called the opposing or underprivileged counterparts of this idea?
  · Why do you think the underprivileged meanings have been overlooked?

Deconstruction is Auto-deconstruction

Derrida observed that social relations, which have come about through centuries of human evolution, assign
meanings to things and our experience of things (Derrida 1997). Deconstruction hinged on what Derrida called
"différance," the separation between the ways a thing can be conceptualized and the ways a thing can be
experienced. For example, the experience that we name the "human" is not fully containable through our
attempts to define the concept. However, in our reference to the many competing notions of "human," we have
(perhaps unknowingly) artificially demarcated the experience, creating the appearance of the "human" as
something with an essential identity.

To deconstruct a concept is to strip meaning from its supporting layers in order to make clear its complexity
and instability. Derrida's idea of différance is an integral part of "auto-deconstruction," or the process by which
deconstruction happens automatically (without intentional philosophical reflection). Auto-deconstruction is
always present, but the human is not always attuned to see how things we see as definitive are deconstructing
right before us. Auto-deconstruction could be thought of in terms of something as simple as the elements that
constitute a chair. If we think about how the chair is made up, we might begin to lose sight of the idea of "chair"
394 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       and begin to see it in terms of color, material, height, length, width, contrast to other objects in the room in
       which it resides, etc. Whether or not we focus on the confluence of things that make up the event of the chair,
       this tension of différance is what provides the perception of "chair" (Derrida 1997).

      Ethics in Post-structuralism

       Nietzsche's Genealogy
       When German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) famously declared that "God is dead," he rejected
       God as a basis for morality and asserted that there is no longer (and never was) any ground for morality other
       than the human. The removal of the notion of sure foundations for ethical behavior and human meaning can
       stir a sense of anxiety, a fear of living without a place of certainty (Warnock 1978). This fear and anxiety inform
       the existential notion of the "absurd," which is simply another way of stating that the only meaning the world
       has is the meaning that we give it (Crowell 2003). In this motion away from objective assertions of truth, one
       comes to what Nietzsche calls "the abyss," or the world without the absolute logical structures and norms that
       provide meaning. The abyss is the world where nothing has universal meaning; instead, everything that was
       once previously determined and agreed upon is subject to individual human interpretation. Without the
       structures of fixed ethical mandates, the world can seem a perpetual abyss of meaninglessness.
       Although Nietzsche lived prior to Derrida, he engaged in a type of deconstruction that he referred to as
       genealogy. In On the Genealogy of Morality, Nietzsche traces the meaning of present morals to their historical
       origins. For example, Nietzsche argued that the concepts we refer to as "good" and "evil" were formed in
       history through the linguistic transformation of the terms "nobility" and "underclass" (Nietzsche 2007,
       147-148). Nietzsche held that the upper classes at one time were thought to be "noble," having characteristics
       that the lower classes were envious or and would want to emulate. Therefore, "noble" was considered not an
       ethical "good" but a practical "good." A person simply had a better life if they were part of the ruling class. Over
       time, the concept of "noble" took on a more ideal meaning, and the practical characteristics (e.g., reputation,
       access to resources, influence, etc.) became abstract virtues. Because the lower classes were envious of the
       upper classes, they found a theoretical framework to subvert the power of the nobility: Judeo-Christian
       philosophy. In Judeo-Christian philosophy, the "good" is no longer just a synonym for the nobility but a
       spiritual virtue and is represented by powerlessness. "Evil" is represented by strength and is a spiritual vice.
       Nietzsche views this reversal as one of the most tragic and dangerous tricks to happen to the human species.
       In his view, this system of created morality allows the weak to stifle the power of the strong and slow the
       progress of humanity.

Foucault on Power and Knowledge

For French philosopher Michel Foucault (1926-1984), "power" at the base level is the impetus that urges one
to commit any action (Lynch 2011, 19). Foucault claimed that power has been misunderstood; it has
traditionally been understood as residing in a person or group, but it really is a network that exists
everywhere. Because power is inescapable, everyone participates in it, with some winning and others losing.

Foucault contended that power affects the production of knowledge. He argued that Nietzsche's process of
genealogy exposed the shameful origins of practices and ideas that some societies have come to hold as
"natural" and "metaphysically structural," such as the inferiority of woman or the justification of slavery. For
Foucault, these and other systems aren't just the way things are but are the way things have been developed to
be by the powerful, for their own benefit. The disruptions promoted by critical theory are viewed as
insurrections against accepted histories--disruptions that largely deal with a reimagining of how we know
what we know--and understood as a weapon against oppression.

Political Movements Informed by Critical Theory

Although critical theory can seem highly abstract, it has inspired and informed concrete political movements
in the 20th and 21st centuries. This section examines two of these, critical race theory and radical democracy.

Critical Race Theory

One of the most controversial applications of critical theory concerns its study of race. Critical race theory
approaches the concept of race as a social construct and examines how race has been defined by the power
structure. Within this understanding, "Whiteness" is viewed as an invented concept that institutionalizes
racism and needs to be dismantled. Critical race theorists trace the idea of "Whiteness" to the late 15th
century, when it began to be used to justify the dehumanization and restructuring of civilizations in the
Americas by Britain, Spain, France, Germany, and Belgium. As these colonizing nations established new
societies on these continents, racism was built into their institutions. Thus, for example, critical race theorists
argue that racism not as an anomaly but a characteristic of the American legal system. Ian Haney López's
White by Law: The Legal Construction of Race argued that racial norms in the United States are background
assumptions that are legally supported and that impact the success of those socially defined by them. Critical
race theory views the institutions of our society as replicating racial inequality.

The idea of institutionalized racism is not unique to critical race theory. Empirical studies, such as those
carried out by W. E. B. Du Bois, have outlined the structure of institutionalized racism within communities.
Critical race theories are unique in that they do not see policies that arise from these empirical studies as a
solution because these policies, they argue, arise within a power structure that determines what we accept as
knowledge. Instead, critical race theorists, like other branches of critical theory, turn to the philosopher, the
teacher, or the student to relinquish their role as neutral observers and challenge the power structure and
social institutions through dialog. Critics of this approach--and other critical theory approaches to
education--worry that these programs seek to indoctrinate students in a manner that bears too close a
resemblance to Maoist "self-criticism" campaigns.

Radical Democracy

"Radical democracy" can be defined as a mode of thought that allows for political difference to remain in
tension and challenges both liberal and conservative ideas about government and society. According to radical
democracy, the expectation of uniform belief among a society or portion of a society is opposed to the
expressed and implied tenets of democracy (Kahn and Kellner 2007). If one wants freedom and equality, then
disparate opinions must be allowed in the marketplace of ideas.

One strand of radical democracy is associated with Habermas's notion of deliberation as found in
396 12 · Contemporary Philosophies and Social Theories

       communicative action. Habermas argued for deliberation, not the normalizing of ideas through peer pressure
       and governmental influence, as a way in which ideological conflicts can be solved. Though Habermas admitted
       that different contexts will quite naturally disagree over important matters, the process of deliberation was
       viewed as making fruitful dialogue between those with opposing viewpoints possible (Olson [2011] 2014).
       Another type of radical democracy drew heavily on Marxist thought, asserting that radical democracy should
       not be based on the rational conclusions of individuals but grounded in the needs of the community.

Summary

12.1 Enlightenment Social Theory

Enlightenment thinkers proposed that human reason, coupled with empirical study of the physical world,
would lead to progress--the advancement of science and the improvement of the human condition. Kant
proposed that reason alone could guide individuals to identify ethical codes. The application of reason, in this
way, would usher the human race toward a moral society in which each individual could enjoy the greatest
freedom. However, this work of reasoning out the moral code could not be carried out by individuals but
societies over a period of generations. Comte proposed the establishment of a science of society, which he
called sociology. He believed that society, like an organism in nature, could be studied empirically. In this way,
social problems could be addressed, and the human race could progress.

12.2 The Marxist Solution

Unlike Enlightenment social theorists, Marxist theorists did not try to solve social problems that arose from
industrialization and urbanization. Rather, they worked toward removing the economic system that they felt
caused these problems, capitalism. Marx proposed an alternative to the Hegelian dialectic, called dialectical
materialism. He looked to the contradictions within material, real-world phenomena as the driving force of
change. Marx regarded alienation and the clash of economic interests between the bourgeoisie (capitalists)
and the proletariat (workers) as the contradiction that would bring down capitalism and give rise to a classless
society.

12.3 Continental Philosophy's Challenge to Enlightenment Theories

In the section dedicated to hermeneutics, or the exploration of meaning as it flows from interpreting written
texts, critical theory's stressing of context was continued. The section examined the notion of historicity or the
claim that meaning is not somehow prior to reading a text (perhaps in the mind of the writer) but that meaning
is somehow related to and generated from both the introduction of a text and the maintenance of that same
text. Meaning may indeed by plural. Ricoeur went so far as to assert that the text does not say anything in and
of itself. The text articulates what we as the interpreter generate. Thus, interpretation results in endless
possibilities.

12.4 The Frankfurt School

While critical theory encompasses multiple perspectives, the origin of the approach is traced to Frankfurt,
Germany, in 1923. There were several commonalities among Frankfurt School thinkers. Most adopted tenets
from Karl Marx's philosophy. Critical theorists sought to build upon Marx's call to free humanity from
oppressive economic and cultural forces. As noted by Max Horkheimer, a plausible critical theory must explain
the ills of society, identify the means by which change can occur, and give a rubric for critique and articulate
reasonable goals.

Equally as important to critical theory was the liberating of philosophy itself from what was perceived as the
limiting boundaries as set by the key thinkers during the Enlightenment. Critical theory dethroned the
prioritization of reason and replaced it with a reciprocal acknowledgment of the importance of context and
reason. Hegel's core concept of dialectical movement was also revised from an inevitable forecasting of
predetermined events to a tool used to gain insight into specific historical contexts. Habermas's notion of
communicative action illustrates how critical theory has stressed context over objective reasoning when
searching for meaning.

12.5 Postmodernism

Within the postmodernism perspective, there is no absolute truth, and there are multiple right ways of belief.
The postmodern view challenges the intellectual faith born in modernity that humanity might someday come
closer to discovering universal truths.
398 12 · Key Terms

The tension between structuralism and post-structuralism parallels the tension between modernity and
postmodernity. Ferdinand de Saussure advanced a theory in which meaning was embedded within a linguistic
structure but the meaning itself is expressed through multiple mechanisms. With the so-called linguistic turn
in philosophy, a challenge to the existence of universal systems (structures) was launched. As noted, three
post-structuralist themes were: 1) the self itself is not static but a confluence of various forces, 2) the meaning
of the author was secondary to the meaning derived from the audience, and 3) interpretations, even if
conflicting, were necessarily plural. Derrida's notion of deconstruction, of the need to consider the meaning
accepted and the meaning obscured, followed intellectually from post-structuralism. If we deconstruct
meaning, we work toward understanding the greater reasons surrounding why some interpretations were
privileged and others rejected.

A "genealogy" is the historical map that traces the past origins of present meanings. Nietzsche and his radical
historicism used genealogies to draw meanings in a world thought of a void of objective meanings. Michel
Foucault argued that tracing genealogies can help us expose shameful origins of practices and ideologies that
foster oppression. Foucault sought to expose when power was used to oppress and when it was used to harm.
Knowledge, argued Foucault, once freed from oppressive conventions, ought to be used to develop the self.
