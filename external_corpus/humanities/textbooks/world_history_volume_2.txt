About World History

World History is designed to support both semesters of the world history course offered at both two-year and
four-year institutions. Serving a student base of both majors and non-majors in the field, as well as an
institutional variation in requirements of one or two semesters depending on the plan of study, the course
introduces students to a global perspective of history conveyed within an engaging narrative. Concepts and
assessments are presented in ways to help students think critically about the issues they encounter so they
can broaden their perspective of global history and how the topics studied apply to their current life as citizens
of the world.
2 Preface

    The text shows how historical content and the ways in which history is studied are relevant to modern-day
    needs and situations. The narrative shows readers the why of historical events and people, providing context
    and import to engage students. A primary goal of the book is to include content, scholarship, and activities that
    explore a variety of perspectives, including those traditionally underrepresented in this canon.

    Being able to thoughtfully achieve a global approach requires explicit discussions about the challenge
    historians face in their work. Each instructor and student enters the classroom with a construct that informs
    their existing understanding as well as their ability to understand and to appreciate novel perspectives. World
    History works to present an honest and authentic view of history for students to explore. The authors and
    reviewers achieve balance by introducing and juxtaposing people's experiences of history for a rich and
    nuanced discussion. New resources and new voices are integrated into the text in a deep and meaningful
    manner. Primary source material represents the cultures being discussed from a firsthand perspective
    whenever possible, showing a variety of experiences and voices that stress the interconnected nature of people
    and societies throughout history. Moreover, the work of diverse and underrepresented scholars and
    scholarship bolsters the text's ability to embrace diversity of thought and interpretation while spotlighting
    parts of history and places that often receive less coverage in history textbooks. Students will be challenged to
    use empathy to understand others' ways of thinking in order to better understand, analyze, and evaluate
    today's changes in the world.

   Pedagogical Foundation

    Learning Objectives

    Every module begins with a set of clear and concise learning objectives that have been designed to be both
    measurable and meaningful. These objectives closely align with current teaching practice and aim to help the
    instructor decide what content to include or assign, and to guide student expectations of learning. After
    completing the module and end-of-module exercises, students should be able to demonstrate mastery of the
    learning objectives.

    Key Features

    Various features throughout each chapter engage students with the content while having them practice some
    of the most essential skills in the study of history, such as the examination of primary sources, the analysis of
    multiple accounts of an event or period, the study of non-textual artifacts, and the exploration of how specific
    historical topics connect to today's world.

      · In Their Own Words: Students are presented with a textual primary source for review and/or analysis,
          with discussion/reflection questions included. This feature bolsters the foundational importance of using
          primary sources in historical studies.

      · Dueling Voices: Learners are given either a historiographical debate, or a side-by-side primary source
          reading that offers two different interpretations of the same event. Sometimes these are directly
          contrasting, and sometimes they help elucidate different perspectives. Discussion questions are included.
          This feature highlights that history is an interpretive discipline and that historians must regularly grapple
          with conflicting and at times contradictory information and approaches.

      · Beyond the Book: Non-textual sources-- such as art, physical objects, or architecture--are presented for
          study with the goal of helping students understand the value of these kinds of sources in historical work.
          Discussion questions open up conversations about how to understand these important artifacts.

      · The Past Meets the Present: Students explore how an aspect of chapter content speaks to an issue in the
          present day, and have the opportunity to engage further in the topic with reflection/discussion questions.

      · Link to Learning: This feature provides a very brief introduction to online resources--videos, interactives,
          collections, maps, and other engaging resources--that are pertinent to students' exploration of the topic at
          hand.

Section Summaries
Section summaries distill the information in each section for both students and instructors down to key,
concise points addressed in the section.
Key Terms
Key terms are bold and are followed by a definition in context. Definitions of key terms are also listed in each
end-of-chapter Glossary, as well as a book-level Glossary appendix.
Assessments
A variety of assessments allow instructors to confirm core conceptual understanding, elicit brief explanations
that demonstrate student understanding, and offer more in-depth assignments that enable learners to dive
more deeply into a topic or history-study skill.

  · Review Questions test for conceptual apprehension of key concepts.
  · Check Your Understanding Questions require students to explain concepts in words.
  · Application and Reflection Questions dive deeply into the material to support longer reflection, group

      discussion, or written assignments.

Answers to Questions in the Book

The end-of-chapter Review, Check Your Understanding, and Reflection Questions are intended for homework
assignments or classroom discussion; thus, student-facing answers are not provided in the book. Answers and
sample answers are provided in the Instructor Answer Guide, for instructors to share with students at their
discretion, as is standard for such resources.

    significant challenges in their courses and their lives, doing their own work and maintaining a high degree of
    authenticity will result in meaningful outcomes that will extend far beyond their college career. Faculty,
    administrators, resource providers, and students should work together to maintain a fair and positive
    experience.
    We realize that students benefit when academic integrity ground rules are established early in the course. To
    that end, OpenStax has created an interactive to aid with academic integrity discussions in your course.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

1.1 Developing a Global Perspective
1.2 Primary Sources
1.3 Causation and Interpretation in History

INTRODUCTION What is history? Is it simply a record of things people have done? Is it what writer Maya
Angelou suggested--a way to meet the pain of the past and overcome it? Or is it, as Winston Churchill said, a
chronicle by the victors, an interpretation by those who write it? History is all this and more. Above all else, it is
a path to knowing why we are the way we are--all our greatness, all our faults--and therefore a means for us to
understand ourselves and change for the better.

But history serves this function only if it is a true reflection of the past. It cannot be a way to mask the darker
parts of human nature, nor a way to justify acts of previous generations. It is the historian's task to paint as
clear a picture as sources will allow.

Will history ever be a perfect telling of the human tale? No. There are voices we may never hear. Yet each new
history book written and each new source uncovered reveal an ever more precise record of events around the
world (Figure 1.1). You are about to take a journey into human history.
10 1 · Understanding the Past

    1.1 Developing a Global Perspective

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Identify the role history plays in higher education
        · Discuss the ways in which the study of history can build skills for lifelong learning and success
        · Explain how the features of this text will optimize your learning experience
      From the legends of Troy heralded by Homer to the contents of digital archives accessed by modern students,
      the human story has fascinated and instructed those who have tried to understand its complexities. Knowing
      the past has long been considered a mark of civilization, and its study has never been more important. We
      have all heard the philosopher George Santayana's observation, "Those who do not learn from history are
      doomed to repeat it." Yet because history is an ever-changing collection of events influenced and shaped by a
      variety of causes and outcomes, it never truly repeats at all.
      Santayana's comment rings true, however, in that we can discern patterns of human behavior by careful study
      of the past. To know history is to know ourselves, and understanding history's nuances opens our imaginations
      to the possibilities each new situation creates. It is this knowledge of possibilities that allows the student of
      history to see the present with more clarity and prescience.

     World History as Preparation for Life After College

      History is more than a series of names and dates; those are simply its building blocks, the pieces necessary for
      completing the whole picture. History is a story, the human story, that connects us both to each other and to
      the generations that lived before us. And today we study history in a way that grounds students in this shared
      past while also preparing them for their futures. The liberal arts are intended to help students find fulfillment,
      to better themselves and their communities through meaningful self-reflection and development. But they
      have also always prepared students to enter the workplace by honing career skills. To say that a world history
      class prepares students for the workplace is simply to acknowledge what has always been true.
      This world history text has several key features that will help you understand the past in ways that are relevant
      to the present. Perhaps most important is its recognition that the study of world history prepares us to meet
      modern challenges. To cover the history of the whole world is daunting, perhaps, but a student must be
      prepared to engage with the globalization processes that have dominated history for the past few centuries.
      People around the globe are more integrated than ever by social and economic forces that transcend national
      boundaries. Both your private and public lives will require knowledge of the world and its people.
      Understanding the diversity of peoples and ideas and possessing cultural empathy and awareness will allow
      you to meet global complexities with competence.
      The study of history will also enhance your critical-thinking and analytical ability, both of which consistently
      appear among the top ten skills desired by employers (Figure 1.2). Other skills that have become increasingly
      important include adaptive thinking, social intelligence, cross-cultural competency, and media literacy. This
      final skill is critical to modern workplaces. History teaches students how to assess and analyze the material
      they are reading, as well as how to develop and present content in a meaningful and persuasive way. It also
      hones a creative mindset that is flexible and open to interpretations and ideas outside our own worldview.

FIGURE 1.2 Do You Have These Skills? The top skills employers will value in 2025, according to the World
Economic Forum, include innovative inquiry and creative thinking. You will develop and practice many of these skills
in this course. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Without question, skills such as critical thinking, analysis, and creativity are developed best through the study
of history. Historians must be truly multidisciplinary in the sense that they observe and gather as much
information as they can and then interpret that data with the aim of drawing conclusions. The historian also
must be a creative thinker because the source material--the data--is human, making it the most complex data
imaginable. Historical data is as diverse as the people who make it, and it might be everything from the edicts
of kings to the tunes played by street musicians. Historians must also be effective communicators. Who cares
about a story nobody reads or a product nobody buys? What company in the world could not use and value
someone who can think critically and creatively and then explain and communicate effectively? Historical
thinking also provides students with a stronger sense of self, with avenues to explore human existence, and
with the skills necessary to navigate the complexity of their world and future workplaces.
This text and its assessment questions will encourage you to analyze large amounts of information, to
understand a myriad of concepts, and to make connections across topics. Developing cultural awareness and
empathy is also critically important, and studying world history is a way to ensure you have this necessary
skill. The influential job site Indeed.com says, "In our workplaces, in our world, we are a diverse people.
Cultural competence is increasingly important as our means of communication and collaboration in working
environments evolve. Learning how to respect, communicate and collaborate with an increasingly diverse
work culture is crucial to optimizing a company's efficiency and productivity."

World History and Global Citizenship

The study of world history recognizes the integrated nature of modern life and prepares students for diverse,
global workplaces. Knowing about the world will prepare you to be a global citizen, someone who may reside
in only one nation but who self-identifies as part of the larger world community. Issues in need of solutions,
like climate change, social justice, and human rights, are global in scale. You must know the world to be the
change it needs. How do you fit in the global environment? What is your story, and how is it linked to that of
others?
In many ways, the idea of global citizenship emerged from the human wreckage of the two world wars.
Beginning in 1948, the United Nations (UN) established a series of universal declarations that conceived of all
people as deserving of human rights and dignity (Figure 1.3). Three such declarations further affirmed the
rights of women (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, also known as
CEDAW, 1979), of children (The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 1959), and of people with disabilities
(The Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, 1975). The UN regularly requires that member nations
report on progress in these areas. Words and declarations help to create an ethos, a set of guiding principles.
So, in addition to participating in global economies that transcend lines on a map, many in our world recognize
12 1 · Understanding the Past

      that we have also agreed to a series of rights and obligations that do the same.

      FIGURE 1.3 Human Rights, Codified. Eleanor Roosevelt is shown holding a poster of the UN Universal Declaration
      of Human Rights in November 1949. Roosevelt, the former First Lady of the United States, chaired the committee
      that drafted the declaration. (credit: "Eleanor Roosevelt UDHR" by FDR Presidential Library & Museum/Flickr, CC BY
      2.0)
      A BBC poll in 2015-2016 surveyed eighteen countries and found that more than half the respondents believed
      themselves to be "global citizens." It also found that in times of prosperity, sentiments favoring a world
      community grow, while in times of strife, people tend to revert to more local, national identities. Though no
      one can see the future, it is difficult to imagine turning the clock back on the processes of globalization.
      Whether you would like to be a global citizen of the world or not, understanding the world is essential.

     Features of This Textbook

      This text is a great place to begin your journey into the world's past. It has several features that will help you
      understand the history of world civilizations from the fifteenth century and the beginning of the early modern
      period until today. For the most part, it adopts a traditional chronological approach, studying events in
      roughly the order in which they took place. The first few chapters will explore changes that took place in
      particular regions of the world in the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries. In Exchange in East Asia and the
      Indian Ocean, you will learn about the civilizations that were connected through Indian and Pacific Ocean
      trade--India, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and Japan. Early Modern Africa and the Wider World studies the
      civilizations of West and East Africa. The Islamic World explores two great Islamic empires, the Ottoman and
      the Safavid, in southwest Asia, which we commonly call the Middle East. Beginning with Foundations of the

Atlantic World, the chapters cover events that integrated the world's different regions, such as colonization,
global trade, political revolutions, and wars and intellectual movements like the Enlightenment.

Each chapter features maps prominently and will help you frame world cultures in their geographic and
historical context. You will engage with firsthand accounts of key people and events--including instances in
which people's recollections of the same events might differ. And the text will highlight links between the past
and the present to emphasize how earlier knowledge applies to our world.

Of particular note are the feature boxes within each chapter. These present documents and images from the
eras you are studying. Sometimes you will be guided outside the text--such as in the Link to Learning boxes--to
explore other digital resources that clarify content, expand on ideas, and highlight interesting new work
happening in the field. Finally, where appropriate, the text will offer material relevant to your current
experiences, to help you understand the links between the past and the present. Following is a quick reference
to these features.

In Their Own Words

In Their Own Words feature boxes present a source composed in the period the chapter covers and allow you
to examine it in context, learning how to critically analyze source material. A short series of questions will help
to guide your analysis.

Dueling Voices

Dueling Voices feature boxes present either an ongoing historical debate or conflicting reports of the same
event or idea that were written around the time it occurred or emerged.

Beyond the Book

In Beyond the Book feature boxes, you can explore the value of art, architecture, music, film, and other
physical objects as sources in interpreting history. The goal is to demonstrate that the human story resides in a
great deal more than just the written word itself. You may also have the opportunity to do some experiential
learning.

The Past Meets the Present

The Past Meets the Present feature boxes ask you to understand the connections between the material in the
chapter and the present. They will prompt you to think about the relevance of a particular historical issue in
today's world.

Because this is a global history, we tried to be true to the essence of world cultures by presenting people's
names in forms as close as possible to their language of origin. These spelling choices have been made by
experts in their field based on current research. For example, the text uses the pinyin system of transliteration
for writing Chinese names, as opposed to the older Wade-Giles system, because pinyin is the system adopted
by the People's Republic of China and more closely approximates the sounds of Mandarin Chinese. In
languages using the Latin alphabet, accents have been retained on all personal names (Hernán Cortés,
Napoléon Bonaparte); however, in transliterated languages such as Chinese and Arabic, we have avoided
accents and apostrophes whenever possible, unless they are necessary to aid pronunciation and enhance
readability. In naming events, places, and other items of historical interest, we have generally chosen the most
commonly encountered English variants. Finally, dates are given using the Gregorian calendar, the
international standard for civil calendars, with "BCE" to indicate developments occurring before the Common
Era and "CE" to mark events in our own era. However, since nearly all the events in this second volume of
World History took place during the Common Era, these indicators are not generally used; you should assume
all dates refer to the Common Era unless otherwise noted.

The study of world history also requires a strong understanding of geography. You might assume that maps are
fairly cut and dried. After all, we can clearly demonstrate where things are, can't we? For most of history,
14 1 · Understanding the Past

      however, this was not actually the case. Maps are some of the most contested pieces of historical evidence we
      have because they were almost always made from the perspective of the one making the map, not as an
      objective practice. Most civilizations put themselves at the center of their known world, for instance. Maps
      have also been used to aid in the conquest and suppression of peoples. During the Age of Exploration, as you
      will learn in Foundations of the Atlantic World, the Pope arbitrarily divided inhabited territory that was new to
      Europeans and granted it to Spain and Portugal. Centuries later in Berlin, Germany, European diplomats drew
      lines on a map of Africa to apportion territory among colonial powers (discussed in Expansion in the Industrial
      Age). Think of how written history might change if our surviving maps were indigenous in origin. Even when
      humanity acquired knowledge of the size and space of things, maps remained inaccurate, often showing
      Europe as larger than it is and regions of the Global South--Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia and
      Oceania--as smaller than their actual size.

      Maps also present challenges because some territories are claimed by more than one political entity. There are
      many examples in the distant past, and even today, of contested regions, such as Crimea and Taiwan, that can
      make presenting regional geographies difficult. Crimea is claimed by both Russia and Ukraine, and Taiwan
      claims independence while China considers Taiwan part of its territory. The text will highlight these regions as
      they arise in the human story so you can explore geography's complexities.

    1.2 Primary Sources

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES

      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
        · Identify different types of primary sources
        · Analyze primary sources in a historical context
        · Interpret primary sources effectively

      Historians develop interpretations of the past based on source material, and we do the same in this book. From
      ancient hieroglyphs to works of art to blog posts, from histories and biographies written by later scholars to
      Google Maps, sources help us build our interpretations of the human story.

     Learning to Evaluate Documents and Images

      There are two main kinds of historical sources, primary and secondary. A primary source is a gateway to the
      past because it is an object or document that comes directly from the time period to which it refers. Primary
      sources might be government documents, menus from restaurants, diaries, letters, musical instruments,
      photographs, portraits drawn from life, songs, and so on. If a historian is looking at Ancient Egypt, a statue of a
      pharaoh is a primary source for that time period, as are hieroglyphs that tell of the pharaoh's reign. Primary
      sources, when we have them, are considered more valuable than other sources because they are as close in
      time as we can get to the events being studied. Think, for example, of a court trial: The ideal is to have the trial
      quickly so that witness testimony is fresher and therefore more reliable. With the passage of time, people can
      forget, they might subconsciously add or take away parts of a memory, and they may be influenced to interpret
      events differently.

      A secondary source is one written or created after the fact. A twentieth-century biography of an Egyptian
      pharaoh is a secondary source, as are a map drawn in the 1960s to identify the battle sites of World War II
      (1939-1945) and a museum curator's blog post about the artistic achievements of the Ming (1368-1644).

                                                                                                                                                              1.2 · Primary Sources 15

These types of scholarly sources are critical for the evolution of historical knowledge and are often the place
students begin to form an understanding of past events. Secondary sources are useful for setting context and
placing a topic in relationship to others of the same era. They also provide access to scholarly research based
on primary sources for students whose access might be limited by language or geography. Good research
requires both types of sources and some attention to historiography, which is the study of how other
historians have already interpreted and written about the past.

All primary sources are not equal. History technically begins with the advent of writing, when humans began
to deliberately make records and, after that, to develop the idea that preserving the past was a worthwhile
endeavor. This is not to say that there isn't anything valuable to be found in the oral histories of preliterate
societies, or in prehistoric cave paintings and archaeological artifacts. For historians, however, the written
word is more accurate evidence for building narratives of the past. For example, imagine a modern magazine
with a rock or pop star on the front, dressed for performance in a vibrant or provocative style. If that were the
only piece of evidence that existed five hundred years from now, how would historians interpret our era?
Without context, interpretation of the past is quite difficult. Studying artifacts is certainly worthwhile, but text
offers us greater clarity. Even if the cover of the magazine bore only a caption, like "Pop star rising to the top of
the charts," future historians would have significantly more information than from the photo alone. However,
even textual sources must be met with a critical eye. "Fake news" is not new, but the speed at which it travels
today is unprecedented. We must investigate the full context of any source and look for corroboration.

It takes time to develop the skills necessary to interpret primary sources. As an example, consider the act of
reading a poem. You can read the surface of a poem, the literal meaning of the words presented. But that
seldom reflects the true meaning the poet meant to convey. You must also look for nuances, hidden meanings,
or repeated metaphors. We approach a primary source in a similar way.

There are four key areas to consider when interpreting sources: the author, the audience, the intent, and the
context. Here are some key questions to ask yourself when exploring a new source:

1. What kind of source is it? Government documents have a different purpose than personal diaries. A
      former president commenting on a political issue has a different view from a comedian doing the same.

2. Who authored the source and why? Is the author responsible for simply recording the information, or was
      the author involved in the event? Is the author reliable, or does the author have an agenda?

3. What is the historical context? How does the source relate to the events covered in the chapter?

None of the answers disqualify a source from adding value, but precisely what that source brings to the overall
picture depends heavily on those answers.

     LINK TO LEARNING

This is a presentation on working with primary sources (https://openstax.org/l/77PrimarySB) produced by the
Smithsonian. Pay particular attention to section 2, "Documents." Read through it and take note of the kinds of
questions to ask as you critically assess primary sources. You may want to write them down or have them on
hand for reference as you work your way through this text.

In a world where many sources are available in digital format, searching online, as many students do, is a
convenient way of doing research. But the internet has just as much misinformation as it has legitimate
sources. Historians evaluate the strength of both primary and secondary sources, especially online. How do we
decide what a good source is? Some clues are more obvious than others. For example, it is unlikely any truly
scholarly material will be found on the first page of a Google search, unless the search terms include key
phrases or use targeted search engines such as Google Scholar. Online encyclopedias may be a good place to
start your research, but they should be only a springboard to more refined study.

Your work is only as strong as the sources you use. Whether you are writing a paper, a discussion post online,
16 1 · Understanding the Past

      or even a creative writing piece, the better your sources, the more persuasive will be your writing. Sites like
      Wikipedia and Encyclopedia.com offer a quick view of content, but they will not give enough depth to allow for
      the critical thinking necessary to produce quality work. However, they are useful for introducing a topic with
      which you might not be familiar. And if you start with encyclopedic sources, you can often find pathways to
      better sources. They might spark new lines of inquiry, for instance, or have bibliographic information that can
      lead you to higher-quality material.
      Always make sure you can tell who is producing the website. Is it a scholar, a museum, or a research
      organization? If so, there is a good chance the material is sound. Is the information cited? In other words, does
      the source tell you where it got the information? Are those sources in turn objective and reliable? Can you
      corroborate the site's information? This means doing some fact checking. You should see whether other
      sources present similar data and whether your source fits into the narrative developed by other scholars. Does
      your school library list the site as a resource? Finally, if you are not sure, ask. Librarians work in online spaces
      too, and you can generally reach out to these experts with any questions.
      As you explore world history via this text, you will be asked many times to read and interpret primary sources.
      These will normally be set off as feature boxes, as noted earlier. Let's work through a few examples. The goal is
      to become more familiar with the types of questions you should ask of sources, as well as the variety of sources
      you will work with throughout the text.
      First, an image exercise. The following images are exterior and interior views of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, a
      wonder of the late antique world whose name means "Holy Wisdom" in Greek. Buildings and other material
      objects change as they are affected by historical events. Images of them can tell us much about those events
      and the people who enter or interact with them.
      The first set of images (Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5) provide a likeness of the famous church at the time it was
      built, during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (483-565 CE). The domed structure was unique for
      its engineering and stunning in its effect. Decorated with Greek iconography, the visual images and symbols
      used in a work of art, the basilica stood as an emblem of Justinian's power, the awesome nature of the Christian
      God, and the surviving wealth and stability of the East. Churches at the time were meant to inspire awe;
      because most people could not read, stories of religious figures and events were told through highly decorative
      and symbolic images, and obedience and a desire to join a religious community could be motivated by the
      buildings' grandeur. As you study the renderings, reflect on the following questions: What are the key features
      of the building? What does it make you think about? What does it tell you about the period in which it was
      built? What would you think about it if you were a poor sixth-century farmer, an urban merchant of some
      wealth, or a foreign leader?

because the engineering was flawed. Thanks to their durability, those of Hagia Sophia were a marvel at the time it

In 1453, nearly a thousand years after the reign of Justinian, the city of Constantinople (now called Istanbul in
present-day Turkey) was conquered by Muslim Turks. According to contemporary accounts of the conquest,
when the Ottoman leader Sultan Mehmed II came to the Hagia Sophia, he recognized its beauty and saved it
from destruction. To Muslims, the Christian God and the Muslim God are the same, so Mehmed made the
church a mosque--following a long tradition in the Middle East of continuing the use of sacred spaces.
Minarets, towers from which the Muslim call to prayer is issued, were added at the four corners of the building,
and Arabic writing was placed beside the ancient Greek iconography.
The second set of images (Figure 1.6 and Figure 1.7) show the Hagia Sophia as it stands today, having also been
a museum and now serving as a mosque once again. The building tells a tale spanning hundreds of years and
highlights many fascinating aspects of the region's history. But without the context, its meaning would be far
less clear.

     Documentary Sources: Competing Narratives

      Textual, or written, primary sources are considered the best possible resource for historians. They tend to offer
      both far more context and far more information than other types of sources, and sometimes clues about the
      writer's intent. But even they must be approached with method and scrutiny. We must evaluate the author,
      audience, intent, and context in order to accurately interpret a primary source document. Some questions you
      might ask about the author include the following: Who wrote the piece and what is their background? What
      was important to the author? Why might the author have written what they did? In some cases, the answers
      will be fairly obvious. In others, a deeper inspection might reveal hidden motives.

You must also take into account the planned audience for a document: For whom was it written? Was it meant
to be public or private? Is it a letter to a friend or an essay submitted for publication? For a modern example, is
it a text to a friend or to a mother? Texts will one day be a source for historians to use, but knowing who sent
them, and to whom, will be essential to interpreting them correctly. (For fun, search online using the term
"misinterpreted texts.")
In addition to considering the audience, you should think about the intent: Why was the document written?
Was it intended to be a factual account of an event? Was it meant to persuade? Is it a complete falsification?
Often people write things that present them in the best light rather than reveal weaknesses.
Finally, you should reflect on the circumstances of the document's creation. Some questions you may want to
ask include the following: What is the general time period of the document, and what was that time like? What
was happening when the individual wrote the document? Was there any sort of intimidation or distress? Is it a
time of war or peace? Is there religious conflict? Is there an economic crisis? A health crisis? A natural
disaster? Could the writer have been fending off an attack or lobbying for one? Are we missing other
perspectives or voices we would like to hear?
The answers to these questions will shape your interpretation of the primary source and bring you closer to its
true meaning. Most text-based sources have meanings beyond the obvious, and it is the historian's job to
uncover these. Be sure to keep these questions in mind throughout this course and whenever you undertake
historical research or are considering the accuracy of information you encounter (Figure 1.8).

FIGURE 1.8 Evaluating Primary Sources. These key questions to ask about primary sources help us evaluate the
author, audience, intent, and context. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
To gain experience using these questions, consider the two accounts in Child Labor in Great Britain, both
recorded in the Hansard, the official report of debates in Parliament and dealing with the same subject from
different perspectives. According to the first account, which is recorded as a direct speech delivered to
Britain's House of Commons (one of the two chambers of Parliament) on March 16, 1832, by reformer Michael
Sadler, children who worked in textile factories suffered terribly. The second account, which is a reporting of
the speech delivered to the House of Commons by one of Sadler's opponents, John Thomas Hope, argues that
child labor is not necessarily a bad thing. What should historians do with such competing texts? How do they
decide what each one adds to the true story of child labor in the Industrial Revolution? If you were to read only
one of these accounts, what important information or point of view would you miss? As you read, keep these
questions in mind.

      Child Labor in Great Britain

        In the 1830s and 1840s, Great Britain was rapidly industrializing, and workers including children were laboring in
        factories and mines. Many British people pressed Parliament to limit child workers' time to no more than ten
        hours per day. In the first excerpt below, reformer Michael Sadler urged the House of Commons to regulate
        children's labor. In the second, one of Sadler's opponents, John Thomas Hope, argues that child labor in textile
        factories should not be regulated.

              The parents who surrender their children to this infantile slavery may be separated into two classes. The
              first of these, and, I trust, by far the most numerous, consists of those who are obliged, by extreme
              indigence, so to act, but who do so with great reluctance and with bitter regret: themselves, perhaps,
              out of employment, or working at very low wages, and their families, therefore, in a state of great
              destitution, what can they do? The Overseer, as is in evidence, refuses relief if they have children
              capable of working in factories whom they refuse to send there. They choose, therefore, what they
              deem, perhaps, the lesser evil, and reluctantly resign their offspring to the captivity and the pollution of
              the mill: they rouse them in the winter morning, which, as the poor father says before the Lords'
              Committee, they "feel very sorry" to do--they receive them fatigued and exhausted, many a weary hour
              after the day has closed--they see them droop and sicken, and, in many cases, become cripples and die,
              before they reach their prime: and they do all this, because they must otherwise suffer unrelieved, and
              starve.

              --Michael Sadler, speech to the House of Commons, March 16, 1832, as recorded in the Hansard

              [Mr. John T. Hope] doubted, in the first place, whether a case of necessity for parliamentary interference
              was fairly made out. . . . It was obvious, that if they limited the hours of labour, they would, to nearly the
              same extent, reduce the profits of the capital on which the labour was employed. Under these
              circumstances, the manufacturers must either raise the price of the manufactured article, or diminish
              the wages of their workmen. If they increased the price of the article, the foreigner would enter into
              competition with them. . . . [Hope] was informed that the foreign cotton manufacturers, and particularly
              the Americans, trod closely upon the heels of our manufacturers. If the latter were obliged to raise the
              price of their articles, the foreign markets would in a great measure be closed against them, and the
              increased price would also decrease the demand in the home market. To avoid these ruinous
              consequences the manufacturers would, in all cases where it was possible to dispense with their labour,
              cease to employ children at all, and employ a greater number of adults than before. [Michael Sadler]
              seemed to consider this an advantageous course; but [Hope] could not concur with that opinion,
              because the labour of children was a great resource to their parents and a great benefit to themselves. .
              . . It was, therefore, on these grounds, because, he doubted in the first place, whether Parliament could
              protect children as effectually as their parents; secondly, that he did not think a case for parliamentary
              interference had been made out; and thirdly, because he believed, the Bill would be productive of great
              inconvenience, not only to persons who had embarked large capital in the cotton manufacture, but even
              to workmen and children themselves, that he should feel it his duty to oppose the measure.

Textual Sources: The Importance of Language

The different types of language used in a source are clues to its interpretation. Linguists call the use of
language rhetoric. Rhetorical choices, decisions about the way words are used and put together, are often
deliberate and intended to achieve a certain outcome. For example, think about the way you talk to a professor
versus the way you talk to a friend. We must closely examine the rhetorical choices in any primary document
to correctly interpret it. To practice this skill, consider the 1887 speech given by Senator George G. Vest, a
Democrat from Missouri, regarding whether women in the United States should be given the right to vote in
Senator Vest on Women's Suffrage and the guiding questions that follow.

                                                                                           IN THEIR OWN WORDS

 Senator Vest on Women's Suffrage

  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, governments debated whether women should be given the
  right to vote. Opponents such as Senator George G. Vest, Democrat of Missouri, claimed they acted in women's
  and society's best interest by denying women suffrage. In 1887, when Vest delivered this speech to Congress,
  Democrats tended to be anti-Black and anti-immigrant, and they found their greatest support in the rural south.
  How does Vest depict himself as a supporter of women? Where is his anti-immigrant bias revealed?

        If this Government, which is based on the intelligence of the people, shall ever be destroyed it will be by
        injudicious, immature, or corrupt suffrage. If the ship of state launched by our fathers shall ever be
        destroyed, it will be by striking the rock of universal, unprepared suffrage. [. . .]

        The Senator who last spoke on this question refers to the successful experiment in regard to woman
        suffrage in the Territories of Wyoming and Washington. Mr. President, it is not upon the plains of the
        sparsely settled Territories of the West that woman suffrage can be tested. Suffrage in the rural districts
        and sparsely settled regions of this country must from the very nature of things remain pure when
        corrupt everywhere else. The danger of corrupt suffrage is in the cities, and those masses of population
        to which civilization tends everywhere in all history. Whilst the country has been pure and patriotic,
        cities have been the first cancers to appear upon the body-politic in all ages of the world. [. . .]

        I pity the man who can consider any question affecting the influence of woman with the cold, dry logic
        of business. What man can, without aversion, turn from the blessed memory of that dear old
        grandmother, or the gentle words and caressing hand of that dear blessed mother gone to the unknown
        world, to face in its stead the idea of a female justice of the peace or township constable? For my part I
        want when I go to my home-- [. . .] the earnest, loving look and touch of a true woman. I want to go back
        to the jurisdiction of the wife, the mother; and instead of a lecture upon finance or the tariff, or upon the
        construction of the Constitution, I want those blessed, loving details of domestic life and domestic love.
        [. . .]

        I believe [women] are better than men, but I do not believe they are adapted to the political work of this
        world. I do not believe that the Great Intelligence ever intended them to invade the sphere of work given
        to men, tearing down and destroying all the best influences for which God has intended them. [. . .]

        Women are essentially emotional. It is no disparagement to them they are so. It is no more insulting to
22 1 · Understanding the Past

              say that women are emotional than to say that they are delicately constructed physically and unfitted to
              become soldiers or workmen under the sterner, harder pursuits of life.

              What we want in this country is to avoid emotional suffrage, and what we need is to put more logic into
              public affairs and less feeling. There are spheres in which feeling should be paramount. There are
              kingdoms in which the heart should reign supreme. That kingdom belongs to woman. The realm of
              sentiment, the realm of love, the realm of the gentler and the holier and kindlier attributes that make the
              name of wife, mother, and sister next to that of God himself.

              I would not, and I say it deliberately, degrade woman by giving her the right of suffrage. I mean the word
              in its full signification, because I believe that woman as she is to-day, the queen of the home and of
              hearts, is above the political collisions of this world, and should always be kept above them.

     Hidden in History

      Historians begin their work with a research question and seek to find the sources necessary to build an
      authentic narrative that answers it. One challenge is that written sources are undeniably valuable but often
      leave out important details. For example, many speak only of the lives of elites. It is not terribly difficult to find
      information about kings, queens, and other rulers of the past, but what of their families? Their servants? What
      of the ordinary people who lived under their rule?

      Some groups of people remain hidden in our account of history because few records talk about their lives and
      experiences. Historians of the 1960s began to revolutionize the discipline by studying history "from the
      bottom up." In other words, they began to focus on just those groups that had long been ignored. They used
      sources like church records, newspapers, and court hearings to illuminate the lives of the poor and illiterate.
      Court hearings were one venue in which the words of people from all backgrounds were recorded as they
      served as witnesses and as accused. Mothers and fathers also sought out those who could write letters for them
      to get pardons for loved ones convicted of crimes. These kinds of sources shed light on those whose voices
      were rarely heard, either while they lived or after they died. Great strides have been made in the field of social
      history, which looks beyond politics to the everyday aspects of life in the past. But it remains difficult, lacking
      records, to represent women, the poor, and minority communities on an equal footing with those who have
      traditionally held power.

      These kinds of limitations can also apply to regions of the world. Civilizations with long-standing and
      abundant historical documents often have more complete histories than others. Much is known, for example,
      about European history and Chinese history, both of which have deep roots in the written word. Europe, after
      all, had Herodotus, and China had Sima Qian. Herodotus, who lived in the fifth century BCE, is called the father
      of history in the West; he wrote the history of the Greco-Persian wars. Sima Qian, born in the middle of the
     second century BCE, is referred to in China as the father of history for his work Records of the Grand Historian,
      a sweeping history of the Han dynasty. The Middle East and India also have rich textual histories. In Africa and
      Latin America, the historical record is less full.

      In the case of Latin America, the historical record was significantly altered when the Europeans arrived.
      Believing that much of the writing of Indigenous people that they found spoke of a religion and culture they
      meant to replace, the conquerors deliberately destroyed it. Writing Africa's history is complicated by both its

size and its diversity, as well as its colonial past. Due to the extremes of climate, surviving written documents
and even archaeological evidence are not easily found, and what exists of written history is often tainted by the
bias of the colonial observers who wrote it. New scholarship is emerging in both regions, generated by
historians who look with fresh eyes and seek to understand history as it was. To gain some insight into the way
history is relevant to the present, read Chinua Achebe on the Value of Indigenous History and consider the
questions posed.

                                                                           THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT
 Chinua Achebe on the Value of Indigenous History

  The following is an interview with the noted Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe (1930-2013) in The Atlantic.
  Achebe, author of several important books including Things Fall Apart, which explores the impact of British
  missionary work in Nigeria, speaks to both the historic legacy of colonialism--the practice of controlling another
  people or area, usually for economic gain--and the need to first see ourselves independently and then in relation
  to others (Figure 1.9).

  FIGURE 1.9 Chinua Achebe. This is a photo of the young Chinua Achebe in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1966. (credit:
  "Chinua Achebe, 1966" by The New York Times/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

        But, of course, something doesn't continue to surprise you every day. After a while I began to
        understand why the book [Things Fall Apart] had resonance. I began to understand my history even
        better. It wasn't as if when I wrote it I was an expert in the history of the world. I was a very young man.
        I knew I had a story, but how it fit into the story of the world--I really had no sense of that. Its meaning
        for my Igbo people was clear to me, but I didn't know how other people elsewhere would respond to it.
        Did it have any meaning or resonance for them? I realized that it did when, to give you just one example,
        the whole class of a girls' college in South Korea wrote to me, and each one expressed an opinion about
        the book. And then I learned something, which was that they had a history that was similar to the story
        of Things Fall Apart--the history of colonization. This I didn't know before. Their colonizer was Japan. So
        these people across the waters were able to relate to the story of dispossession in Africa. People from
        different parts of the world can respond to the same story, if it says something to them about their own
        history and their own experience.

    1.3 Causation and Interpretation in History

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe causation as it is used in the study of history
        · Identify the levels of causation
        · Analyze the role of interpretation in producing an accurate historical record
      The study of history has always been about more than giving a recounting of past events. It is about
      remembering our shared past, making human connections that traverse centuries, and helping us know more
      about ourselves. Once we know how to muster as many facts as we can, we must consider the next
     step--understanding causation. Causation is the why behind events; understanding it is the way historians get
      at the heart of the matter. The powerful and public forces that change society and government are also present
      when individuals make choices about their lives. What, then, are the forces that shape history, that shift it one
      way or another, that move people to change on both an individual and a societal level?
      All of us see these historical causes through the lens of our own experiences, circumstances, and value
      systems. Historians, particularly those trained in recent times, work to eliminate as much bias as they can, but
      we cannot wholly disconnect ourselves from our environment and beliefs. Bias can even sometimes act as a
      positive force, allowing us to look at the past in new ways. For example, historians in the 1960s and 1970s
      began to question their discipline's traditional focus on elites and sought out new sources that highlight the
      lives of more ordinary people. Driven by a bias in favor of the counterculture and politics of the era, they
     wanted to know more about what all people experienced.

     Levels of Causation

      In their quest for the why of an event, historians look at both the immediate and the long-term circumstances
      of that event. Not all causes are equally significant; we need to rank them in importance. Let us begin with a
      thought exercise. At this moment in your history, you are reading this textbook. Why? Perhaps you would say,
      "Because the instructor told me to, and it will be on the test." Certainly that is a valid reason. But if you think a
      bit more deeply, you might also say, "I want to do well in my education so I can be successful." And at an even
      deeper level, "Society tells me that education is necessary to realize my full potential, find fulfillment, and
      participate in the community."
      Think of all the other things that caused you to be here in this moment. There are no wrong answers; just
      explore the levels of causation behind your reading right now. Now rank them in order of importance. Which
      causes had the most influence on you, and which were more remote? Your response might look something like
      a pyramid (Figure 1.10). The primary cause is the most immediate. It is the spark. The secondary cause is
      once removed. The tertiary cause offers the broader context.

To reach a true understanding of why you are reading your text, you needed to know yourself well, understand
the connection between education and career, and assess how social factors, such as the value employers place
on education, influence your decision-making. The more aspects of causation historians can find, the closer
they can get to the true nature of the event.
Let's try another example, this one from history. Why did the United States enter World War II in 1941? In this
case, the immediate cause was Japan's attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, but hostilities
had been brewing for some time. The president of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had been looking
for ways to help the British fend off a potential German invasion, and Japan and the United States had long-
standing issues over the use of power in the Pacific (Figure 1.11).

Here is one more example. In 1453, Mehmed II laid siege to the city of Constantinople. Why? Mehmed II was
the leader of the Ottoman Empire, the sultan. He had been badly treated by his father, and when he ascended
the throne, he felt he had something to prove. The Ottomans had tried several times to take Constantinople
because it lay at the crossroads of many civilizations. Conquest had long been a reliable mechanism for

      factors played a role in the siege undertaken by Mehmed II. Can you order them by importance? This is the
      point where historians usually disagree, even about events for which most of the facts are clear. A historian
      who believes powerful leaders are the most influential factor driving events would rank Mehmed's personal
      goals first (Figure 1.12). Base your ranking on the strongest arguments you can make.

      There can be more than three causes to any event, of course, and because human choice always plays a role,
      we sometimes cannot separate events on the big stage from the smallest of personal moments in history. The
      context of the Ottoman Empire's continuous expansion set the scene in this example, and Mehmed II's desire
      to prove his ability was the spark.

      and follow the same process.

     Interpretation in History

      Hand in hand with bringing causation to light is discovering what informed the choices people made in the
      past. What makes people act as they do? For much of history, we found the answer in the actions of
      elites--tsars, sultans, kings, and queens. The first historians largely concerned themselves with the study of
      wars and rulers, in accordance with the great man theory of history that credits leaders and heroes with
      triggering history's pivotal events. Although these historians gave some attention to historical detail, there was
      also an equal measure of bravado, exaggeration, and political spin in their work. This seemed reasonable in a
      world where the king's choice became everyone's choice and where sources rarely spoke about anyone other
      than noble lords and ladies. That this type of history remained the norm for so long was also a function of who
      was writing it.
      In the West, Thomas Carlyle, a nineteenth-century Scottish historian, considered the study of the lives of "big
      men" enough to understand all of history. Higher education was the privilege of only the rich; it must have
      seemed quite natural to believe that only the elites could move history. These ideas began to change, however,
      if slowly. In the early nineteenth century, a new school of thought called Romanticism emerged. The Romantics
      believed there was greatness in everyday life. Even a small flower was worthy of a poem, and the plight of a
      lowly squire was as important as the worries of the great lord of the manor, for both were essential actors in the
      human experience. The advent of Romantic art, poetry, music, and novels paved the way for a broad
      reexamination of what was worth knowing and studying. Writing a little later, in 1860, the Russian novelist Leo
     Tolstoy argued that there is more to history than the actions of one person. In his novel War and Peace, he
      contended that the "general mass of men" who participate in history are the ones who truly cause events.

 Great Men, or Everyone?

  In an 1840 lecture on heroes, Thomas Carlyle coined the term "Great Men" to describe the kind of history he
  considered worthy, the study of elite men in positions of power. In his novel War and Peace, the Russian novelist
  Leo Tolstoy argued that there is far more to history than the actions of one person. In the following excerpts,
  consider the viewpoint of each writer.

        As I take it, Universal History, the history of what man has accomplished in this world, is at bottom the
        History of the Great Men who have worked here. They were the leaders of men, these great ones; the
        modellers, patterns, and in a wide sense creators, of whatsoever the general mass of men contrived to
        do or to attain; all things that we see standing accomplished in the world are properly the outer material
        result, the practical realization and embodiment, of Thoughts that dwelt in the Great Men sent into the
        world: the soul of the whole world's history, it may justly be considered, were the history of these. [. . .]

        We cannot look, however imperfectly, upon a great man, without gaining something by him. He is the
        living light-fountain, which it is good and pleasant to be near. The light which enlightens, which has
        enlightened the darkness of the world; and this not as a kindled lamp only, but rather as a natural
        luminary shining by the gift of Heaven; a flowing light-fountain, as I say, of native original insight, of
        manhood and heroic nobleness;--in whose radiance all souls feel that it is well with them.

        --Thomas Carlyle, "Lecture on Heroes"

        In historical events (where the actions of men are the subject of observation) the first and most
        primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will of those who
        stood in the most prominent position--the heroes of history. But we need only penetrate to the essence
        of any historic event--which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it--to be
        convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself
        continually controlled. It may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning
        of historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the
        people of the West moved on the East because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this
        happened because it had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the earth was
        stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what
        upheld the earth, but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets. There
        is, and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes. But there are laws
        directing events, and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot
        comprehend. The discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt
        to find the cause in the will of some one man, just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the
        planets was possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth.

        --Leo Tolstoy, War and Peace

    · Which kind of history do you prefer, the "great man" kind or what we might call the "everyone" kind? Why?
    · Whose argument is more convincing, Carlyle's or Tolstoy's? Why?

While on one hand historians began to look at people of the lower classes as more integral to the human story,
history as a discipline became dominated by the same set of colonial powers that were conquering much of the
globe in the nineteenth century. Therefore, two divergent streams of thought were operating simultaneously,
and the picture of history both expanded in terms of class and contracted in terms of diversity. One of the early
European schools of thought was progressive history, which viewed history as a straight line to a specific
destination. Historians with this "progressive" view believed societies were becoming more democratic over
28 1 · Understanding the Past

      time and that the advance of republican governments was inevitable. Their perspective might also be
     considered a form of teleological history, which proposes that history is moving to a particular end, a
      culmination of the human experience. Progressive historians believed in the betterment of people and of
      society, so long as it occurred on a European model. Progress looked only one way: the Western way. Consider
      what Chinua Achebe (quoted in Chinua Achebe on the Value of Indigenous History) would have said about
      European democracy and republicanism.
      In the twentieth century, particularly after World War I, the idea of inevitable human progress seemed
      laughable. People grew more willing to question the authority of elites because these leaders were of little help
      once war began. Historians became more interested in the irrational aspects of the human condition, the
      psychology behind people's choices. This is one reason for the rise of contemporary intellectual history,
      which looks at the ideas that drive people to make certain choices and focuses on philosophical questions and
      the history of human thought.
      The counterculture of the 1960s in the West deepened people's desire to challenge existing norms, such as the
      lack of rights for women and for racial minorities. The field of social history, guided by the concept that
      history is made by all people and not just elites, became much more important during this period (Figure
     1.13). In this context, young historians and sociologists began to develop new ideas. In their 1966 book The
     Social Construction of Reality, for example, sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann argued that our
      belief systems are informed by social constructs, ideas that have been created and accepted by the people in a
      society, such as the concepts of class distinction and gender. Social constructs influence the ways people think
      and behave.

      FIGURE 1.13 Trends in Historical Thought. Historians' thinking has led from the progressive school of interpretation
      to the more contemporary fields of intellectual and social history. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,

      To understand history, you must understand the social construction of reality, which is the way people define
      roles and perceive themselves within a social context. Consider our earlier thought exercise. You believe
      education is important. Why? Who has said that to you in the past? How did you come to believe it? In other
      words, what is your social construction of education, and where did it come from?
      Social constructs exist everywhere and inform many decisions we make, often on a subconscious level. For
      example, consider the following questions:
      1. What do you buy a five-year-old girl for her birthday? What do you buy for a boy the same age? What

            influenced your decision?
      2. What would you wear to a job interview? What would you wear to a party? Why?
      3. To which person standing at the front of a classroom would you give more respect: a woman dressed in a

      tailored suit, or a man wearing jeans and a t-shirt? Why?

In addition to examining reality as socially constructed, twentieth-century historians made interpretations
through the lenses of Marxism, which considers history to be driven by class struggle, women's history (now
usually referred to in the context of gender history), which sees history as driven by power differences between
men and women, and postcolonialism, which focuses on the history of places formerly occupied by colonial
powers. In the process we call revisionism, each additional lens revised the great man story of history, adding
new key players and viewpoints.

Let us look at one more example. How would each school of historical thought approach the story of colonial
Latin America between the Spanish conquest that began in 1493 and the independence movements of the
1820s? The progressive historian might explore the growth of democratic legal systems or people's increased
interest in republican forms of government. The intellectual historian might consider the Indigenous literature
and philosophy of the period. The social historian would look at what conquered people ate, how they worked,
and what they looked for in marriage partners. A Marxist historian would examine unfair labor practices and
moments of class conflict like rebellion or riot. The gender historian would focus on the role that social
constructs of gender played in the lives of people in the past. And the postcolonialist would highlight why
aspects of colonialism, such as racism and poverty, remain influential after independence. All these
interpretative elements help us weave a more complete picture of the past.

The variety of interpretations open to historians also helps us put in the final piece, which is the practice of
historical empathy, the ability to meet the past on its own terms and without judgment or the imposition of
our own modern-day attitudes. To fully embrace the study of the past, the student of history must be able to set
aside the assumptions of the modern era. Everyone has a set of biases, generated by the people who influence
our lives and the experiences that shape who we become. Historians must spend the time necessary to
investigate these biases and understand how they affect their interpretations. It is not the historian's job to
pass judgment on the past, but to present it as clearly as possible and to preserve that clarity for future
generations. This may mean reflecting impartially on historical positions, attitudes, or decisions we might find
abhorrent as viewed from today's world. However, the more strands of history we can investigate and bring
together, the more accurate the picture will be. And there is still much work to be done. For example, recent
and ongoing research into LGBTQ+ studies, Indigenous studies, and the history of the Global South will
continue to sharpen our image of the past.

The bottom line is that interpretation plays a central role in the field of history. And changes in our
interpretation increase the number of ways we can get a clearer picture of those who lived before us. The
danger lies in using only one lens. Yes, historians choose some causes as more important than others, but only
after considering all the information available.

Section Summary

1.1 Developing a Global Perspective

Knowing the past, the human story, has long been considered a mark of civilization, and its study has never
been more important. The study of world history provides the skills necessary to meet global workforce needs
while at the same time developing a sense of self and place in our global community. You will gain critical-
thinking and analysis skills that will help you fulfill the role of a global citizen in our interconnected world.
This text will help you approach history with an open mind, and it will engage you in meaningful ways, often
highlighting content that remains relevant in today's society.

1.2 Primary Sources

Primary sources are the first-hand evidence with which historians form a foundation of knowledge of the past.
Interpreting them requires attention to four key areas: the author, the audience, the intent, and the context.
Secondary sources offer valuable starting points for inquiry and context, but students must be aware of any
bias they contain. Despite the efforts of generations of historians, there are still people and regions we do not
know much about. We must hope that new generations of historians will continue to hone our interpretation of
the past.

1.3 Causation and Interpretation in History

The historian's main job is to discover why history happened as it did. What caused the events that have
shaped our shared human past? To answer this question, historians apply rigorous interpretative methodology
rooted in the search for causation. They study events for both immediate causation and contributing factors,
while avoiding judgment and remaining open to revision. You now have the tools you need to fully engage with
the material in this text and begin your journey into the human past.

INTRODUCTION The sixteenth century was a time of exploration and the beginning of global ocean trade.
When European nations such as Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, England, and France were just setting out
on voyages of exploration and beginning to forge maritime trade networks, a thriving oceangoing commerce
was already being carried on in the Indian Ocean. From the coastal provinces of India to the Straits of Malacca
and the ports of Southeast Asia, China, and Japan and back again, raw materials of great value and
manufactured products of great beauty traveled (Figure 2.1). Along with them went religious beliefs,
philosophies, technological developments, and other cultural influences.

2.1 India and International Connections

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the roles of Babur and Akbar in the rise of the Mughal Empire
  · Describe the distinctive aspects of the Mughal Empire's hybrid culture
  · Analyze the effects of geography, conquest, and immigration on Gujarat's role in Indian Ocean trade

      networks
  · Discuss the rise of the Maratha Empire
  · Explain how internal conflicts in India contributed to the success of European colonization
At the center of world trade in the sixteenth century was India, especially the ports on its western coast, such
as the cities in the Sultanate of Gujarat. Through these harbors came the wealth and the people of the Indian
Ocean world, creating a society notable for its prosperity and diversity. The desire to control this wealth
attracted both European explorers and Indian dynasties, such as the Mughals and Marathas, and eventually, it
brought them into conflict.

The Mughal Empire

Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur had always dreamed of founding a great empire. His father, the ruler of a small
central Asian state named Fergana in what is now Uzbekistan, was a descendant of the famous conqueror
Timur. His mother came from the family of the Mongol leader Chinggis Khan. In 1494, at the age of eleven,
Babur became ruler of Fergana following his father's unexpected death, and he set himself the task of gaining
control of all the lands that had once fallen to his illustrious ancestor Timur. In 1504, he made a bold move.
Striking out across the Hindu Kush mountains accompanied only by his family and two hundred fighting men,
he conquered the city of Kabul in Afghanistan. In 1526, using tactics he had learned from the Persians, with
whom he had allied in the past, including the use of artillery, Babur defeated the much larger army of the Delhi
Sultanate, a Muslim state in northern India, and established the Mughal (the Persian pronunciation of Mongol)
Empire.
36 2 · Exchange in East Asia and the Indian Ocean

      Despite his desire to become ruler of India and his fascination with his new land, Babur did not adopt Indian
      culture. Although he was intrigued by the subcontinent's animals, plants, and climate, he had little interest in
      its people or in the Hindu religion. He described the people of India as lacking both personal beauty and
      manners. He admired the land's wealth but strove to re-create for himself and his family a taste of his
      homeland by designing gardens in the Persian style. He remained firmly oriented toward central Asia and
      maintained a post road and waystations connecting the Mughal capital of Agra to Kabul. When he died, he was
      interred at Agra, but to honor his wishes, his body was later taken home to Kabul for burial.

          LINK TO LEARNING

     The Baburnama (Book of Babur) is a sixteenth-century illustrated account of Emperor Babur's exploits. Among
     the illustrations in the Baburnama (https://openstax.org/l/77Baburnama) are pictures of his battles, travels,
      and life at court.

      When Babur died in 1530, his eldest son Humayun inherited Mughal India. Humayun's reign was not a
      successful one. After only ten years, he was forced to flee after being defeated in battle by Sher Shah Suri, the
      ruler of the Indian state of Bihar. Humayun sought refuge at the court of the Safavid Shah Tahmasp in Persia,
      where he became deeply immersed in Persian culture. In 1555, he returned to India and won back his throne,
      but his victory was short-lived. Only a few months after retaking the Indian city of Delhi, Humayun died after
      tripping on a steep staircase.

      Humayun's fourteen-year-old son Akbar inherited the throne. Although he was illiterate, possibly because of
      severe dyslexia, Akbar became the greatest of the Mughal emperors. Unlike his father and grandfather, who
      had remained oriented toward central Asia, Akbar embraced India. He actively sought to incorporate Indians,
      both Muslim and Hindu, into his kingdom. Although he was aggressive militarily and expanded the bounds of
      the Mughal Empire across the northern part of the subcontinent and into the central plains to the south, he
      allowed local rulers to retain control of their lands so long as they submitted to him.

      To consolidate his hold on India, Akbar married the sisters and daughters of local rulers, both Muslim and
      Hindu. He did not force his Hindu wives to convert to Islam, and their marriage ceremonies included both
      Hindu and Muslim elements. Akbar, did, however, introduce to India an institution found elsewhere in the
      Muslim world: The women of the royal family were physically secluded in a harem. Women's separation from
      the men of the court did not mean they were not influential, and wives, mothers, and even nursemaids often
      played a role in important political decisions. Nevertheless, during Akbar's reign, efforts to remove women
      from public life also led to the disappearance of their names from official records, and the practice of
      segregating them spread from Mughal households to those of the Hindu ruling classes, who adopted the
      custom.

      Although Hindus were undoubtedly influenced by Mughal customs, Akbar made no effort to enforce
      conformity to Islamic customs or to impose the Muslim religion on his subjects. In 1568, he abolished the
     jizya, a tax imposed on non-Muslims. He allowed new Hindu temples to be built, which had previously been
      prohibited, and provided several of them with money to support their activities. Sharia, the legal code of Islam,
      was applied only to Muslims, and a Hindu law code governed Hindus. Both Hindus and Muslims were
      welcomed into the army and Akbar's administration.

      Akbar revolutionized his empire's bureaucratic apparatus. The realm was divided into provinces, and each
      province was assigned a governor, a chief judge, a military commander, and a financial administrator. Akbar
     appointed civil servants known as mansabdars. Promotion was based on effort: Acting in ways that displeased
     Akbar could result in demotion or transfer to a less desirable location. Each mansabdar was also responsible
      for recruiting cavalry to serve in the Mughal army.

      Akbar ordered his empire to be surveyed and fields assessed to determine how much revenue they would
     yield. The mansabdars were then compensated for their labor with taxes collected on specific units of

farmland. As they rose higher in rank, more land was assigned to them. These lands were also periodically
reassigned, however, and upon a mansabdar's death, all his wealth reverted to Akbar. A mansabdar's son might
be allowed to inherit his father's property, should the emperor choose. These policies ensured that those
charged with administering the empire remained loyal to Akbar.
Not only did Akbar marry Hindu women and welcome Hindus into his administration, but he also proved
tolerant of other religions and their adherents. He erected a hall to serve as a venue for religious debate (Figure
2.4). At first, only Muslim scholars took part, arguing matters of law and theology among themselves and
answering questions Akbar posed. Soon, however, Akbar grew dissatisfied and came to regard some of their
positions as too rigid. He then invited representatives of other religions to participate, including Portuguese
Jesuit missionaries. Akbar found Christianity interesting, but he rejected the Jesuits' teachings regarding the
divinity of Jesus and reportedly found their insistence on monogamous marriage amusing.

Akbar eventually abandoned all recognized religions, however, and created his own personal cult called Din-i
Ilahi (the Divine Faith). This religion combined elements of many different faiths, and Akbar assumed a
prominent role at its center. In 1579, he issued a decree proclaiming that all religious questions were to be
decided by him. He was regarded by adherents of his cult as the agent of God who, in his role as representative
of the divine, was bound to tolerate all religions. Akbar ceased performing the obligatory five prayers that
Muslims must intone every day and began to worship "divine light." He also began the practice of appearing
daily to his subjects on a balcony so they could view him, reminiscent of a Hindu practice in which
worshippers receive blessings by viewing the image of a deity. All these changes greatly disturbed Muslims in
Akbar's court.
For the most part, however, India prospered under Akbar. His conquests left much of the subcontinent united
and peaceful. Although illiterate himself, he amassed a large library of books in many languages, employed
large numbers of translators and scholars, and established schools for both Muslims and Hindus. Domestic

      and international trade flourished. Gold and silver flowed into India in exchange for textiles, spices, and
      precious gems. Handicraft industries boomed, and merchants grew wealthy. The peasants were heavily taxed
      to pay for the empire's bureaucracy, but they were excused from paying in full in times of drought or other
      natural disasters.
      Among those who benefited from the prosperity of Akbar's reign were wealthy Mughal women, who reinvested
      in commerce the revenues derived from landed estates, gifts of the emperor and his predecessors to female
      relatives. They used the profits they earned to endow mosques, build shelters for travelers, support artists and
      poets, and fund charitable endeavors. They also used their wealth to give gifts to the emperor and court
      officials, one of the ways in which they attempted to influence the workings of the Mughal government.
      Akbar's successors could not equal his achievements. When he died in 1605, his son Jahangir assumed the
      throne. Jahangir wanted to outshine his father and employed a large studio of artists who portrayed him in
      countless images as superior to other rulers. The paintings produced in Jahangir's studio were influenced by
      European paintings, especially portraits, that were given to him by the English, with whom he had established
      a commercial relationship. Jahangir patronized Muslim scholars, who had been scandalized by Akbar's
      religious policies. But like his father, he established an imperial cult, and devotees claimed Jahangir appeared
      to them in dreams and could heal them. Also like Akbar, he welcomed people of many religions at his court and
      married both Muslim and Hindu women. Like his grandfather Humayun, Jahangir often drank heavily, which
      took a toll on his health. As he weakened physically, he allowed his favorite wife Nur Jahan, a Persian Muslim,
      to assume significant power in his government. She took part in public rituals, engaged in diplomacy, and
      issued imperial edicts. She also helped Jahangir choose a son to succeed him and arranged a marriage
      between this son, Shah Jahan, and her niece (Figure 2.5).

with his importance, he commissioned the building of the Peacock Throne, an elevated platform covered by a
vault ornamented with gold, semiprecious stones, and peacock sculptures, and he embarked upon numerous
building projects. The most beautiful of these was the Taj Mahal, a tomb erected in 1631 for Shah Jahan's
favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal, who had died the previous year giving birth to their fourteenth child (Figure 2.6).
The tomb, in the city of Agra, perfectly reflects the hybridized Indo-Islamic culture of the Mughal dynasty and
is considered an exemplary work of Persianate architecture. It was built in a garden at one end of a reflecting
pool and features a large dome surrounded by four free-standing minarets, towers from which the Muslim
faithful are called to prayer. While tombs in that part of India were normally made of common materials such
as sandstone, the Taj Mahal is covered in white marble in a style befitting the resting place of a Muslim holy
man. It is embellished with semiprecious stones and bears verses in elegant calligraphy, chosen from the
Quran by Shah Jahan himself.

River in Agra. On either side of it are sandstone mosques. (credit: "Taj Mahal" by David Castor/Wikimedia Commons,

In 1648, Shah Jahan moved the capital of the Mughal Empire from Agra to Delhi, where he embarked on
another massive building project, the Red Fort. Inside this red sandstone fortress, palaces and administrative
buildings were constructed, many of white marble or stucco polished or adorned with glazed tiles to resemble
marble. Canals and Persian water wheels supplied the city with water, and a sewage system carried it away.
Perfumed water flowed in channels through the city. Within the city walls, officials erected grand houses of
their own. Mosques and gardens were built, many paid for by wealthy Mughal women. These building projects,
while they greatly enhanced the beauty of Agra and Delhi, drained the treasury and led to increases in the tax
burden of India's peasants.

The Sultanate of Gujarat

Despite their power, the Mughals never controlled all of India, and several areas remained relatively free of
their dominance. In the sixteenth century, one such area, the Sultanate of Gujarat on the northwestern coast of
India, was an important center of Indian Ocean trade. Gujarat was located on the Arabian Sea, close to Persia
and the Arabian Peninsula (Figure 2.7). From May through September monsoon winds blew, and the resulting
ocean currents pushed sailing ships from East Africa and Arabia in the direction of Gujarat and other spots on
the western coast of India, such as the province of Kerala to the south. In the winter months, the monsoon
winds and currents reversed, helping sailors return home. In the period between these changes brought by the
monsoons, foreign sailors and merchants made their home on India's western coast, and thriving commercial
hubs developed with a year-round population of both Indians and non-Indians.

      In 1573, Emperor Akbar incorporated Gujarat into the Mughal Empire. Through its harbors moved the wealth
      of India, and the port cities of Surat and Khambat were especially busy. Among the goods exported were fine
      cotton textiles purchased by buyers in East Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. In addition to warehouses and
      trading companies owned by Indians, Arabs, and Persians, the port cities contained rest houses for travelers,
      shops, and banking houses. In addition to being a commercial hub, Gujarat was a place of learning. Many
      Islamic scholars made it their home, and several cities had large mosques and religious schools, some of which
      were built with funds provided by Hindu rulers.

                                                                                                     BEYOND THE BOOK

        Surat was a prosperous port on the coast of Gujarat, the region conquered by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1573.
        The sixteenth-century painting presented here, by court painter Farrukh Beg, commemorates this event, showing
        Akbar seated on a black horse greeting the town's residents (Figure 2.8). This painting is one of many such

        as the official chronicle of his reign.

    · In what ways does this image indicate that Surat was a wealthy community?
    · Where can you see the influence of Islam?
    · How is the ethnic diversity of the city's residents indicated?

The populations of Gujarat's ports were diverse. Although most residents were Hindus, other religious
communities were well represented. For the most part, these were trade diaspora communities, communities
established by merchants from foreign lands who came to do business but often settled and married into the
local population. The most significant of the trade diaspora communities in Gujarat were those founded by
Muslims. Some of their inhabitants were the descendants of merchants who had arrived from Persia or the
Arabian Peninsula as early as the eighth century, or descendants of Hindu merchants who had converted to
Islam to better do business with Arab and Persian merchants. Sharing the faith of their business partners
helped build the trust necessary for transacting business in distant lands, ventures that might take many years
to become profitable.
Sufis, Islamic mystics, had arrived in India in the eleventh century, and a substantial number of Muslims had
Sufi ancestors. Yet other Muslims were descended from soldiers who had arrived in India in the armies of
central Asian or Afghan invaders from the tenth through the thirteenth centuries. There were also large
numbers of Parsis in the cities of Gujarat. The Parsis were Zoroastrians, members of a religious sect that
worshipped fire and whose ancestors had arrived in India from Persia in the seventh century. They may have
fled Persia after the Islamic conquest for fear of religious persecution, or they may have settled in India before
42 2 · Exchange in East Asia and the Indian Ocean

      the conquest and never returned home.

      Also present in Gujarat were Jews and Nestorian Christians, who had split from the larger Christian Church in
      the fifth century over an argument regarding whether Jesus was of one nature--divine--or two--one human
      and one divine. The Nestorian Christians had come primarily from Syria and Persia. A larger Christian
      community lived in Kerala. Gujarat also housed small communities of Indian Jains (followers of Jainism) and
      Buddhists.

      The great religious and ethnic diversity of Gujarat contributed to its commercial success because merchants
      there traded more easily with others of the same religion and ethnic background in other parts of the world.
      Arabs traded with Arabs and Persians with Persians. Jews in Gujarat maintained ties with Jewish communities
      elsewhere in India, North Africa, and the Middle East. The prominence of the Muslim merchant community in
      Gujarat was undoubtedly aided by the fact that the Mughal emperors were Muslim. By the middle of the
      seventeenth century, however, Mughal dominance in India was being threatened.

     The Rise of the Maratha Empire

      Aurangzeb I was the last of the exceptional Mughal rulers in India. In 1658, he seized control of the Mughal
      throne and set about attempting to conquer rulers of states on the Deccan Plateau in southcentral India. He
      also led an Islamic revival in the Mughal domains. A pious man who frequently stopped in the midst of battle to
      perform the required daily prayers, Aurangzeb sought to eliminate all non-Islamic practices from his court. He
      refused to hunt, which had been a traditional pastime of Mughal rulers, and did not listen to music, although
      members of his court continued to do so. He eliminated the debates of scholars of different religions that his
      predecessors had sponsored, as well as other practices such as weighing himself against an equivalent amount
      of gold on the anniversaries of his birth and coronation, because he considered it an inappropriate display of
      excess. Aurangzeb patronized Muslim scholars and had them compile a collection of Islamic law written in the
      Persian language.

      A skilled commander in battle, Aurangzeb expanded the bounds of the Mughal state. However, he proved
      unable to easily incorporate non-Muslims into his empire. Although at times he gave money to Hindu temples
      as previous Mughal emperors had done, at other times he ordered the destruction of the temples of Hindus
      who resisted his rule. He also imposed a special tax on Hindu pilgrims and, eventually, a tax on all non-
      Muslims. Hindus who served in his administration did not have to pay this tax; nevertheless, they often
      received less compensation than did Muslim administrators. Muslim immigrants to India were also favored
      over Indian-born Hindus for important positions in Aurangzeb's administration.

                                                                                                IN THEIR OWN WORDS

      Wifely Devotion

       One Hindu custom Aurangzeb I sought to stamp out was the practice of sati (or suttee), the self-immolation of a
        Hindu widow following her husband's death. The practice seems to have arisen sometime after 500 CE and was
        practiced primarily by members of aristocratic Hindu warrior families, who might choose to burn themselves
        alive to honor their husbands or might be pressured to do so by the husband's family. Despite Aurangzeb's
       prohibition, sati continued among many pious Hindus. An excerpt from the autobiography of the seventeenth-
        century Hindu poet Bahina Bai demonstrates the extreme devotion a Hindu woman was to have for her husband.

              I want my thought concentrated on my husband. The supreme spiritual riches are to be attained through
              service to my husband. I shall reach the highest purpose of my life through my husband. If I have any
              other God but my husband, I shall have committed . . . a sin. . . . My husband is my means of salvation . .
              .

              Without a husband, one does not keep God in mind. Blessed is she who knows herself as a dutiful wife.

        She carries along at the same time her household duties, and her religious duties. Such an one bears the
        heavens in her hands. . . .

        She who in everything accepts her husband's wishes in a noble spirit, and though it might mean even
        death will not violate his command, blessed is she in this present world, blessed is . . . her family. For
        her comes the summons to heaven. In body, speech and mind she submits herself to her husband. . . .
        Without enquiring the right or the wrong of it, she is willing to give her very life to fulfill his wish. She
        serves her husband as prescribed by religious rites, and is ever at his side like a slave.

        --Bahina Bai, Bahina Bai: A Translation of Her Autobiography and Verses, translated by Justine E. Abbot

    · According to Bai, why should a woman obey her husband? What benefits does she derive from obedience?
    · Why might a woman have been willing to engage in an act as extreme as sati?

Aurangzeb clashed with Sikhs in northern India. The religion of Sikhism, a monotheistic faith that combines
elements of Hinduism and Islam, was established in the Punjab region of northwestern India in the fifteenth
century. The Mughals persecuted the Sikhs, and Aurangzeb sought to control the succession of Sikh gurus, the
community's religious and political leaders. His execution of the guru Tegh Bahadur inspired even greater
resistance to Mughal authority.

Among the many Hindus who opposed Aurangzeb were the Marathas, a group from the western uplands of the
Deccan Plateau. Many Marathas had gained experience as soldiers in the armies of both the Muslim and Hindu
rulers. The most powerful of their leaders, Shivaji, had acquired his military experience in this way (Figure
2.9). When he led his own armies into battle against Mughal forces, he proved a formidable opponent,
defeating Aurangzeb's commanders time after time. Shivaji's success on the field of battle and the rich spoils
that fell to his troops attracted many followers. In 1663, he defeated a much larger Mughal army after
withstanding a siege for more than two years. Less than a year after this victory, Shivaji's forces invaded
Gujarat and seized control of the port of Surat.

      Shivaji dressed for battle. (credit: "Portrait of Shivaji" by The British Museum/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
      Aurangzeb attempted to make an ally of Shivaji, summoning him to the Mughal court in 1666 and awarding his
      son, who was still a child, a royal title. Shivaji was treated with contempt by his Mughal hosts, however, and
      following Aurangzeb's attempts to detain him, he escaped and resumed war against the Mughals. Eight years
      later, Shivaji had himself declared an emperor on par with Aurangzeb, in effect declaring his right to rule his
      own territory and placing himself in a position of authority above other Maratha leaders.
      Shivaji sought to eliminate Mughal influence by making the local language of Marathi the vernacular of his
      court instead of Persian, the language of the Mughals. He ran his court according to Hindu tradition and
      replaced Persian political terminology with terms from Sanskrit, the sacred language of Hinduism. All
      educated Hindus were familiar with Sanskrit, unlike Marathi, which Hindus in other parts of India could not be
      expected to speak. Sanskrit served a function in Shivaji's kingdom similar to that served by Latin in medieval
      Europe or Chinese in East Asia: It was the language of the educated elite. Shivaji led processions to local Hindu
      holy sites and also patronized Sanskrit scholars. Despite his dedication to Hinduism, however, he gave money
      to Islamic institutions and did not discriminate against Muslims. When Aurangzeb imposed a tax on non-
      Muslims in the Mughal Empire, Shivaji wrote to inform him that he could not be a good Muslim if he did not
      understand that God had created all people, not only Muslims.
      Beginning in 1674, Shivaji embarked on a campaign to subdue the southern and central parts of the Indian
      subcontinent and bring them under the control of the Maratha Empire (Figure 2.10). Although he died in 1680,
      the war between the Mughals and the Marathas continued. Years of fighting emptied Mughal coffers, and in
      1705 Maratha armies gained control of the Gujarat coast. Stretched too thin, the Mughals began their retreat
      from Maratha territory.

As the Mughals grew weaker, the Marathas grew stronger. Over the course of the next twenty years, Maratha
armies gained control of roughly one-third of India. The Maratha bid to dominate all of India was brought to a
halt, however, when Ahmad Shah Durrani, the king of Afghanistan, marched eastward against both the Mughal
and Maratha empires, seeking to expand his domain. As Indians and Afghans made war on one another,
European colonizers steadily gained control of India.

European Colonialism

In 1488, a Portuguese ship's captain, Bartolomeu Dias, had sailed around the Cape of Good Hope at the
southern tip of Africa, but his restless crew made him turn back before he could further explore the Indian
Ocean. Dias was one of many Portuguese explorers who had ventured out into the Atlantic Ocean in the
fifteenth century following Portugal's capture of the Muslim port of Ceuta on the Moroccan coast in 1415. Ceuta
lay at the end of caravan routes that brought the gold of West Africa across the Sahara Desert. After he assumed
the throne in 1433, King Edward of Portugal granted to his younger brother Henry (nicknamed "the Navigator"
by historians in the nineteenth century) the right to authorize exploration south of Cape Bojador on the
46 2 · Exchange in East Asia and the Indian Ocean

      northwest coast of Morocco. Edward also gave Henry the rights to any profits derived from trade with regions
      that these explorers discovered.
      Eager to find the source of West Africa's gold, Henry sponsored voyages down the African coast. Gradually, the
      Portuguese advanced southward, establishing trading posts as they went. Although gold was the main object of
      trade, enslaved people were also purchased and sold in Lisbon. Henry collected a 20 percent tax on the trade
      and used the money to fund yet more voyages.
      After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, access to the known routes to spices and other
      Asian goods that Europeans desired lay entirely in Muslim hands. Other Europeans had long resented the
      monopolization of the spice trade by the Venetians and Genoese, who had been granted trading concessions by
      the Ottomans. Now there was an even greater incentive to find new routes to the lands of the East. It was for
      this reason that, in 1492, Christopher Columbus, in the employ of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain,
      ventured out into the Atlantic in search of an oceanic route to India.
      In 1494, following Columbus's landing in the Caribbean, Spain and Portugal signed the Treaty of Tordesillas,
      ratifying Pope Alexander VI's decision that all non-Christian lands west of a line drawn one hundred leagues
      west of the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa, which Portugal already claimed, were to belong to Spain.
      Non-Christian lands east of the line were given to Portugal (Figure 2.11). Four years later, another Portuguese
      sailor, Vasco da Gama, became the first European to sail all the way to India after rounding the Cape of Good
      Hope.

      FIGURE 2.11 The Treaty of Tordesillas. Without reference to the sovereignty of the people who lived there, the

      easternmost portion of South America, which eventually became the Portuguese colony of Brazil. (credit: "Treaty of
      Tordesillas, 1494" by "Ultimadesigns"/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
      In 1498, da Gama sailed north along the east coast of Africa and from there across the Indian Ocean to the
      southwestern coast of India, where he landed in the port of Calicut (Kozhikode) in what is today the state of
      Kerala (Figure 2.12). Da Gama had come to India on a quest to find an all-water route to Southeast and East
      Asia, the source of spices, silks, porcelains, and other Asian goods. Europeans had had access to such luxuries
      for centuries, but they were expensive. They had to be carried overland, which limited the amounts that could
      be brought to Europe, and they also passed through the hands of many intermediaries between their point of
      origin and their European consumers. Finding an all-water route to the source was intended to eliminate these

problems, and the nation that did so stood to become very wealthy. Before the voyages of the Portuguese, trade
with Asia had been monopolized by northern Italian merchants, especially the Venetians, to the envy of
merchants in other countries. Da Gama hoped to change this.

FIGURE 2.12 The "India Run." Working for Portugal, Vasco da Gama sailed north along the east coast of Africa and
across the Indian Ocean to Calicut, in the southern Indian province of Kerala, establishing what became the typical
sea route to India, the carreira da Índia, or "India Run." (credit: modification of work "Map of Portuguese Carreira da
India" by "Walrasiad"/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0)
Of all the goods da Gama sought, spices were the most desirable. They were used not only in cooking but also
as ingredients in medicines, and their scents were employed to mask less pleasant odors. While this type of
Portuguese ship, called a caravel, had relatively little space for cargo, a small amount of pepper and other
spices would fit in the hold and still earn substantial profits in Europe.
Caravels did have certain advantages. They were larger and sturdier than most craft that sailed in the Indian
Ocean, and they were heavily armed, as well as relatively fast and stable in heavy seas. If merchants in India
proved unwilling to sell to the Portuguese at the low prices the Europeans set, the caravels' captains blocked
access to Indian ports so that Arab and Persian merchants were unable to trade.
Da Gama's success in reaching India and the value of the goods with which he returned led to future
expeditions. In 1500, Pedro Alvares Cabral established a factory, a trading post with offices and warehouses, at
Calicut to trade for pepper, and he also secured trade agreements from local rulers in Cochin (Kochi) and
Kannur, both in Kerala. To eliminate competition, Cabral had his men seize Muslim merchant ships in the
harbor, strip them of their cargoes, and burn them, and he then bombarded the port. Approximately six
hundred Muslim sailors were killed. Indians attacked the Portuguese factory in Calicut to avenge the assault on
the Muslim traders.
Relations between local rulers and the Portuguese did not improve when da Gama returned in 1502. He
demanded that all Arabs be expelled from Calicut, and when this order was refused, he bombarded the city as
Cabral had done. Establishing a pattern that they and other Europeans later replicated throughout India, the
Portuguese sought to divide and conquer by entering into alliance with some local rulers to the disadvantage of
others, a strategy made easier in later decades by the weakening of the Mughal Empire. When the Portuguese
48 2 · Exchange in East Asia and the Indian Ocean

     allied with the ruler of Cochin, the hereditary ruler of Calicut, called the zamorin, invaded Cochin in response.
      In retaliation, the Portuguese destroyed the fleet that sailed once a year from Calicut to Egypt to sell spices for
     the zamorin.
      Beginning in 1502, the Portuguese also attempted to increase their revenues by demanding that ships trading
     in the Indian Ocean carry a cartaz, a document bearing the Christian cross. The money paid for this document
      went into the Portuguese royal coffers, and by forcing ships to sail to a Portuguese post in India to purchase
      one, the Portuguese government hoped also to increase commerce for its merchants in the ports it controlled.
     Ships that did not carry the cartaz had their cargoes seized and were sunk. Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu
      captains objected to having to bear a document with the Christian cross, and all non-Portuguese resented
      Portugal's attempts to dominate Indian Ocean trade.
      To protect their economic interests, a diverse and formidable group of opponents assembled to thwart these
     Portuguese efforts. Following the destruction of his spice fleet, the Hindu zamorin of Calicut and Calicut's
      Muslim merchants turned to Egypt for help. At the time, the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt controlled not only that
      land but also the Levant (greater Syria) and much of the Arabian Peninsula as well. (The Mamluks were an elite
      group of formerly enslaved warriors who ruled Egypt following the defeat of the Abbasid caliphate.) In the early
      sixteenth century, this area was the center of the spice trade with Europe that, before the arrival of the
      Portuguese in India, had been carried out by Venetian merchants in the port of Alexandria. Egypt's Sultan Al-
      Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri thus asked Venice for assistance, which the city-state provided in the form of ships
      and gunners (Figure 2.13). At the same time, spurred by a desire to combat the Muslims of the Indian Ocean,
      the king of Portugal sent a fleet to India.

In 1508, the Mamluk sultan's Egyptian fleet, together with ships belonging to the Sultanate of Gujarat, clashed
with Portuguese ships in the harbor of Chaul on the west coast of India. Although the Portuguese commander
and his flagship were lost in the battle, the remainder of the Portuguese fleet escaped to the port of Cochin, and
the Mamluk's fleet was too badly damaged to give pursuit. In 1509, the Portuguese decisively defeated a
combined Egyptian-Gujarati-Calicut fleet in the port of Diu, one of the main ports of the Sultanate of Gujarat.
The Portuguese did not take control of Diu, but they received the right to establish a trading post there and a
substantial payment in gold from the city's Muslim merchants.

The Portuguese took possession of additional territory in India in subsequent years, including the city of Goa
on the subcontinent's western coast. Goa became the base of the Portuguese State of India, the name Portugal
gave to its holdings in the Indian Ocean. Jesuit priests accompanied Portuguese sailors, merchants, and
soldiers to these ports and began in earnest to convert Indians to Roman Catholicism. Although most Indians
remained Hindu or Muslim, the Portuguese gained converts among lower-status Hindus who hoped that by
adopting the Portuguese religion, they might improve their social position. Some may also have believed that
becoming Roman Catholics would enable them to do business with the Portuguese, just as converting to Islam
may have seemed a wise business move for members of earlier generations of merchants.

The Portuguese also won both converts and allies on the island known to them as Ceilão, or Ceylon in English
(modern-day Sri Lanka), after once again taking advantage of divisions among local rulers. In 1551, the king of
Kotte was assassinated, and his Buddhist successor turned to the Portuguese for assistance in maintaining his
hold on the throne amid a struggle with his brother, the king of Sitawaka, an ally of Calicut. The Portuguese
erected a fortress on Ceylon and also proceeded to convert some of the population to Roman Catholicism,
including Kotte's new ruler. As a result, upon his death, the ruler of Kotte left his kingdom to the king of
Portugal.

In 1565, Muslim rulers on the Deccan Plateau joined forces with the zamorin of Calicut, the king of Sitawaka,
and the sultan of Aceh (Indonesia) to again attempt to expel the Portuguese in the War of the League of the
Indies. They also sought help from the Ottoman Empire. The assistance of the Ottoman Fleet would have
helped counter Portuguese dominance of the seas, but the Ottomans' need to suppress revolts on the Arabian
Peninsula and do battle with the city-state of Venice kept them from participating.

Reports of the marvelous wealth of India and the riches amassed by Portuguese merchants encouraged the
Europeans of other nations to seek their fortunes in the Indian Ocean. In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I of England
granted a monopoly on trade in the Indian Ocean to the British East India Company (also known as the English
East India Company or the East India Company).1 The British East India Company was a joint stock company
in which numerous merchants pooled their money to fund trading voyages and share the profits. An
expedition to India required an enormous outlay of money that few individuals could afford, and if they could,
they might lose their entire fortunes if the expedition were unsuccessful. By pooling funds, none had to risk all
they owned.

Dutch and French merchants also formed joint stock East India companies. While the Dutch focused most of
their attention on the islands of Indonesia, France competed with England and Portugal to harvest the wealth
of India. In 1661, Charles II of England received Bombay (Mumbai) as part of the dowry of his Portuguese wife,
Catherine of Braganza, and leased it to the British East India Company. France, in turn, established a trading
post at Surat in 1668 and founded others in the years that followed. Europeans often partnered with Indian
merchants who sought new investment opportunities outside the subcontinent.

In 1685, the Mughal governor of Bengal increased taxes on English trade in the region. The British East India
Company refused to pay and sought to wrest control of the territory from the Mughals. English ships blockaded
Mughal ports on India's west coast, interfering with both Mughal trade and the passage of Muslim pilgrims on

1 The political entity of Britain was formed after the union of England and Scotland following the death of Elizabeth I. The kingdom
of Great Britain was officially formed in 1707. It is a bit anachronistic to refer to the British East India Company before the nation of
Great Britain existed, but that is the name by which the company is most commonly known.

      their way to Mecca. In response, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb seized control of company possessions and,
      in 1689, began a blockade of Bombay, starving the English into submission. Company representatives were
      forced to pay a substantial fine before their trading privileges were returned to them.

      In their attempt to resist English expansion, the Mughals turned to the French for assistance. Already rivals in
      trade, beginning in 1754 France and Britain found themselves enmeshed in a war in North America for control
      of that continent. This conflict, called the French and Indian War, soon spread to Europe where fighting broke
      out in 1756. As part of this now-global conflict, called the Seven Years' War, French and British armies and
      navies engaged in battle in India as well. France allied itself with the Mughal Empire. In 1756, the French, who
      had greatly expanded their commercial activity in Bengal, pressured the region's ruler to attack the British
      Fort William near Calcutta (Kolkata). The following year, the British struck back, defeating Bengali and French
      forces at the Battle of Plassey, allowing the British to trade unopposed in Bengal. In 1761, the British destroyed
      the French post of Pondicherry (Puducherry).

      With both the Mughals and the Marathas weakened after years of combat with one another as well as with
      invading Afghans and encroaching Europeans, small states in northern India broke away from their control
      and recognized British authority in exchange for acknowledgment of their claims to rule. The chaos that
      ensued helped the British in their quest to gain control of India. In this way, through a combination of alliances
      and military victories and the use they made of existing divisions between its kingdoms and rulers, the British
      gradually gained control of India.

    2.2 The Malacca Sultanate

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES

      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
        · Identify the factors that led the rise of the Malacca Sultanate
        · Discuss the significance of Malacca as a center of trade
        · Analyze the Portuguese invasion of Malacca and its consequences

      Like the Sultanate of Gujarat, the Malacca Sultanate was blessed by its geography. Located on the northern part
      of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the southern part of the Malay Peninsula, it controlled access to the
      narrow Malaccan Straits, the most direct route between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, a branch of
      the Pacific Ocean. All trade moving between India, Southeast Asia, and China went through these waters.

     The Rise of the Malacca Sultanate

      When the remnants of the Srivijaya Empire on the island of Sumatra were destroyed by the Majapahit Empire
      in the thirteenth century, a refugee named Sang Nila Utama, who claimed to be a descendant of Alexander the
      Great, founded the Kingdom of Singapura on the island of Singapore. Singapura developed into a prosperous
      center of trade. However, its wealth led to attacks by both the Majapahit and the Ayutthaya Kingdom in Siam
      (now Thailand). In 1398, Singapura too was destroyed, and Parameswara, its last king and a prince of the
      Srivijaya Empire, fled with his followers. He made his way to a fishing village at the mouth of the Malacca River
      on the Malay Peninsula that belonged to a tribe called the Orang Laut ("sea people"). The Orang Laut had
      already given refuge to others fleeing from Majapahit, and a mixed population of Hindus, Buddhists, and
      Muslims had taken up residence there. Parameswara, supposedly inspired by the courage of a small deer that
      did not fear his hunting dogs, decided this was the spot on which to build a new kingdom.

      The city Parameswara and his followers founded in around 1400, called Malacca (Melaka), became a thriving
      trading port that grew to occupy both the northern coast of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, on either side of
      the Malaccan Straits (Figure 2.14). The Orang Laut kept the seas in the area free of pirates, and Arab, Persian,
      Indian, and Chinese merchants came to do business. Many decided to stay. Parameswara married the daughter
      of an Indonesian Muslim ruler and converted to Islam, changing his name to Iskander (Persian for Alexander)
      and taking the title of sultan. This enabled Malacca to form close relationships with other Muslim states on

Sumatra that traded with Gujarat. Through the Malaccan Straits flowed silks, spices, and porcelain, as well as
Malaccan products such as tin that was mined to the north of the city. The Malaccans also planted orchards of
sago palms, which provided an important foodstuff, a starchy ingredient of bread and noodles that was traded
throughout the region.

Malacca also established relations with China's Ming dynasty, whose Admiral Zheng He visited Malacca six
times during the voyages he undertook in the service of the Yongle emperor. When the growing power of Siam's
Ayutthaya Kingdom threatened Malacca, Ming envoys let the Siamese know that Malacca was a vassal state of
China and thus not to be interfered with. By the time the Ming dynasty had turned inward in the mid-fifteenth
century and ceased to trouble itself with matters involving foreign states, Malacca had grown strong enough to
fend off Ayutthaya and repulsed two attacks made by that kingdom in 1446 and 1456. With Ayutthaya no
longer a threat, the Sultanate of Malacca was free to spread its influence, and the religion of Islam, throughout
Southeast Asia.
From Malacca, religious teachers, many of them Sufis, brought Islam across the Malay Peninsula, and people
on nearby islands also became converts. The sultans of Malacca and other Muslim rulers paid generously for
the construction of mosques and religious schools (Figure 2.15). By the early 1600s, Islam had become the
dominant religion in the Indian Ocean, and only on the island of Bali was Hindu influence still substantial. On
Java, the home of the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit Empire, the adoption of Islam was marked by warfare
between Muslims living on the coast and Hindus and animists (people who worship the supernatural power
they believe exists in all things in the universe) in the interior. For the most part, however, conversion was
peaceful. Merchants were especially eager to convert in order to connect themselves with the established
network of merchants in India, Persia, Arabia, and Africa who followed the same faith. They could then also
count on the protections of Islamic law. Sufi religious teachers were amenable to adapting Islam to local
religious traditions, allowing people in some regions to continue worshipping nature spirits and permitting
women to retain an active role in local commerce, as was common in Southeast Asia.

      Malacca reached the height of its power in the late fifteenth century under the reigns of Sultan Mansur Shah
      and his son Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah. During this period, often thought of as "the golden age" of Malacca,
      Mansur Shah pursued an expansionist policy, adding the gold-rich state of Pahang on the east coast of the
      Malay Peninsula to his kingdom. The ruler of Majapahit, fearing Malacca's strength, sought peace by marrying
      his daughter to Mansur Shah and conceding to him a number of Majapahit territories. States throughout the
      Malaysian archipelago acknowledged the ruler of Malacca as their overlord.

      Read about the Malay legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang (https://openstax.org/l/77MalayLegend) or the Fairy
      Princess of Mount Ophir. Note how different features of the story are related to historical incidents and real
      people. What does this legend indicate about the wealth and power of the Malaccan sultans?

      Assisting the sultans of Malacca to maintain control over the city were nine elite knights. Preeminent among
      them was Hang Tuah, who spoke multiple languages including Arabic, Persian, and Mandarin and was adept in
      the use of numerous weapons. It was his responsibility to guard the seas surrounding the Straits of Malacca
     and keep them free of pirates. Order was also maintained by the establishment of the office of shahbandar.
      Foreign traders were divided among four separate districts in the city, and each district was assigned an
     official known as the shahbandar to supervise them and collect taxes.
     A legal code called the Undang-Undang Melaka ("law of Melaka") governed conduct in the port. Influenced by
      Islamic law, it punished behavior such as robbery, adultery, and drunkenness. One of the most important parts
     of the legal code for merchants was the section on maritime law called the Undang-Undang Laut Melaka. This
      code governed everything from the behavior of sailors and traveling merchants toward the captain of the
      merchant vessel, to the order in which trade was to take place when the ship put into port (the captain was
      allowed to trade his goods first), to rules specifying how those who quarreled or stole other passengers'
      property should be treated.
      The Malaccan rulers' ability to regulate the conduct of sailors and merchants both in their city and aboard
      their ships made the port a more desirable place in which to do business. Merchants need not fear that
      Malacca was a lawless place, as many ports were. The city quickly became the main port for trading Indian
      cloth and Chinese porcelain as well as goods such as spices from the Malay Archipelago. This growth in the

wealth and prominence of Malacca helped make the fifteenth century a golden age.

The dominance of Malacca in the Indian Ocean trade spread the Undang-Undang Melaka throughout the
islands of Indonesia. It also made the Malay language the premier language of trade throughout the coastal
regions of Southeast Asia. In the fourteenth century, a special script for writing it was developed, based on
Arabic script. In the fifteenth century, Malaysian literature, which had been transmitted only orally before,
flourished, another characteristic of this golden age in the Malaccan Sultanate.

European Malacca

In 1509, a Portuguese fleet arrived in Malacca, bringing Diogo Lopes de Sequeira with orders from the king of
Portugal to establish trade with Malacca, which would allow Portugal to replace Venice as the center of the
spice trade in Europe. According to Tomé Pires, the apothecary to the king of Portugal who traveled to
Southeast Asia in search of spices, "Whoever is Lord of Malacca has his hand on the throat of Venice." The
reigning sultan Mahmud Shah and others at his court were intrigued by the possibility of becoming trading
partners with the Portuguese and possibly putting Portugal's warships to use against rival kingdoms, as some
Indian rulers had done. Many Indian Muslims in Malacca, however, especially Gujaratis, were aware of
Portuguese attacks on Muslim merchants in India and opposed any dealings with the Europeans. Initially,
Mahmud Shah gave the Portuguese permission to establish a factory (a trading post), but then, on the advice of
Indian and Javanese Muslim merchants, he sent ships to attack them in 1510. Sequeira and his ships managed
to escape, but several Portuguese were taken captive.

In 1511, the Portuguese military commander Alfonso de Albuquerque arrived from India at the head of a large
fleet bearing more than one thousand armed troops and demanded the return of those Portuguese who had
been taken prisoner the year before. The sultan delayed as he attempted to assemble an army to defeat the
Portuguese, but after a week of waiting, Albuquerque bombarded the city. The prisoners were promptly
released, but the sultan refused Albuquerque's demands for reparations and the right to build a fortress.
Albuquerque then landed his troops in the city with the help of Hindu, Chinese, and Burmese merchants, who
hoped to use Portuguese influence to gain dominance over their Muslim rivals. Within a month, the Portuguese
had gained control of Malacca, and Mahmud Shah had fled. Albuquerque erected a fortress to guard the city's
entrance and made Nina Chatu, a Hindu merchant who had helped free the Portuguese prisoners, the city's
chief administrator. Newly minted coins were distributed, and people were informed that trade would go on as
before.

Things did not go quite as the Portuguese planned, however. The deposed sultan established a new base in the
Riau Islands of Indonesia and from there launched attacks on the Portuguese in Malacca. Following his death
in 1528, Mahmud Shah's sons continued to attack the Portuguese from their kingdoms in Johor and Perak.
Unwilling to do business in Portuguese Malacca, many Muslim merchants avoided the port and conducted
trade in either Johor or the Sultanate of Aceh on the northern coast of Sumatra.

In 1606, the government of the Netherlands, eager to gain an advantage over its European competitors, signed
a treaty with the sultan of Johor. In exchange for help destroying the Portuguese in Malacca and freeing Johor
from Aceh's domination, the sultan promised the Dutch control of the port with the understanding that they
would make no further territorial conquests in the region or attack Johor. In 1629, with Dutch assistance,
forces from Johor destroyed Aceh's navy and killed nearly twenty thousand Aceh troops. In 1641, the Dutch
and troops from Johor defeated the Portuguese, and the Dutch East India Company took control of Malacca.

      The Portuguese had not been satisfied to take just Malacca. They had a greater prize in mind--the legendary
      Spice Islands, the source of the nutmeg, mace, and cloves they coveted.2 Having learned of the location of the
      Banda Islands in the Indonesian archipelago where nutmeg and cloves grew in abundance, Afonso de
      Albuquerque dispatched three ships with Malay pilots to find them, believing them to be the Spice Islands. The
      hostility of the Bandanese, however, dissuaded the Portuguese from attempting to establish a factory there.
      One of the original three ships sailed on in search of another spice-rich island group, the Moluccas (Malaku)
      (Figure 2.16). Here, the Portuguese were able to establish trade relationships with the Sultanate of Ternate, a
      city-state in the Moluccas.

      FIGURE 2.16 The Banda Islands. The Banda Islands, a spice-rich island group, lie in the center of the Moluccas, an
      archipelago in the east of Indonesia. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
      The primary interest of Sultan Hairun of Ternate was in using Portuguese military power in his contests with
      rival states. The Portuguese, meanwhile, had nervously noted that visitors from Mecca, the Ottoman Empire,
      and other Southeast Asian Islamic sultanates frequented Ternate. As Catholics who sought to convert the
      people of the Indian Ocean to their religion and who considered Muslims enemies, they feared the growth of
      Islam in the region would interfere with both their commercial and evangelical efforts and might endanger
      their safety. Eventually, Portuguese efforts to convert people to Christianity angered Muslim inhabitants and
      strengthened their devotion to Islam. After Hairun's death, his son and heir Sultan Babullah declared a holy
      war against the Portuguese and drove them from the Moluccas in 1575.
      Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese veteran of Albuquerque's attack on Malacca, also dreamed of finding a route
      to the Spice Islands. He planned, however, to discover a westward route by sailing west from Portugal, instead
      of taking the long route eastward around the tip of Africa and through the Indian Ocean. When the Portuguese
      king declined to fund the exploratory voyage, Magellan approached the king of Spain, who provided him with
      the funds and ships he needed. The crew came from many countries, which was common aboard ships at that
      time.
      In 1519, with a fleet of five ships and a crew of two hundred seventy, Magellan departed from Spain. He crossed
      the Atlantic and sailed around the southern tip of South America, where the fleet spent the winter. On March 6,
      1521, with their fresh water nearly exhausted after three months spent crossing the Pacific, they sighted
      Guam, and not long after, they made landfall in the Philippines. At the port of Sugbu on the island of Cebu,
      Magellan and the Spanish were welcomed by the ruler, Rajah Humabon, whose ancestor, a prince of the south
      India Chola dynasty, had come to the Philippines from Sumatra.

As other Portuguese had done, Magellan attempted to convert the people he encountered to Christianity.
Humabon, his wives, and many of his subjects agreed. By converting, Humabon hoped to secure Magellan's
assistance in defeating Lapulapu, a rival ruler. Magellan consented to the plan, and at the Battle of Mactan on
April 27, 1521, he was killed. Humabon, for unknown reasons, attacked Magellan's remaining men. The
survivors fled to the Moluccas and from there sailed home to Spain. Only eighteen men survived the voyage,
and Spanish ships did not return to the Philippines until 1565, when they conquered Cebu. Then in 1570, the
Spanish attacked the Muslim trading center of Maynila when one of its rulers refused to become an ally of
Spain. The Filipinos were defeated, and in 1571, the Spanish established the city of Manila, which became
their capital in the East Indies.

 Lapulapu: A Filipino Folk Hero

  Lapulapu, the indigenous leader who defied and defeated Ferdinand Magellan, has been a folk hero in the
  Philippines for hundreds of years, representing the spirit of the Filipino people and their unwillingness to be
  dictated to by non-Filipinos. He is referred to as Cali Pulaco in the 1614 poem "Que Dios le perdone" ("May God
  pardon him") by Filipino poet Carlos Calao. Another spelling of his name, Kalipulaku, was used by the Filipino
  activist Mariano Ponce when he agitated for the Philippines' independence from Spain in the nineteenth century.
  Lapulapu is also mentioned in the 1898 Declaration of Independence.
  In the twentieth century, statues of him were erected in Manila, the capital of the Philippines (Figure 2.17), and
  on Mactan Island, the site of Magellan's defeat. His image has appeared on Filipino currency, and he is shown in
  silhouette holding his weapons on the seal of the Philippine National Police. He is invoked in songs and has
  appeared as a character in films and television shows. Filipino Muslims have tried to claim him as a hero of Islam,
  even though he was most likely not Muslim. In 2017, Rodrigo Duterte, then president of the Philippines,
  proclaimed April 27, the anniversary of the Battle of Mactan, to be Lapulapu Day.

      In 1609, the Dutch East India Company attempted to establish a fortress in the Banda Islands. The men sent to
      negotiate the agreement with the Bandanese were killed, however. In 1621, the Dutch returned and forced the
      inhabitants to sign a treaty. When the Bandanese violated the treaty's terms, Dutch soldiers and Japanese
      mercenaries killed many of the community's most important leaders and burned their villages. The surviving
      islanders were forced to cut down sago palm trees, a valuable source of food, and plant spice trees in their
      place.

      The islands' land was divided up and given to Dutch colonists, and enslaved Southeast Asians, European
      indentured servants, and convict laborers were set to work raising nutmeg, which was sold to the Dutch East
      India Company. The exception was Ambon Island, which the Dutch set aside to grow cloves. Clove trees on all
      other islands were destroyed, and anyone attempting to grow or sell cloves without permission was given the
      death penalty. To maintain a monopoly on the spices and thus keep prices high, the Dutch had already driven
      out English settlers attempting to colonize some of the outlying islands, and then, realizing they might be
      unable to control these islands, they destroyed all the nutmeg trees that grew there. In 1619, the Dutch also
      sent enslaved Bandanese to Java to build the Dutch settlement of Batavia (Jakarta).

      The Dutch attempt to maintain their spice monopoly was destined to fail, however. Winds and seabirds spread
      seeds to other islands. Ships' captains from other countries managed to return to Europe with holds filled with
      spices purchased from Southeast Asian kingdoms that had not fallen under the control of European powers.
      The English captain Sir Francis Drake, for example, purchased cloves from Sultan Babullah of Ternate. As
      ships grew larger, the volume of spices shipped to European ports increased, driving down prices and profits.
      The Dutch were not solely reliant on the spice trade, however, for they were able to take advantage of an
      opportunity not available to the Portuguese and Spanish, dedicated as they were to the propagation of Roman
      Catholicism. That opportunity was trade with Japan.

    2.3 Exchange in East Asia

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES

      By the end of this section, you will be able to:
        · Identify the factors that affected exchanges between Japan, its East Asian neighbors, and Europeans
        · Analyze how interactions with Europe influenced China during the Ming and Qing dynasties
        · Describe China's relationship with its neighbors during the Ming and Qing dynasties
        · Discuss the importance of education, culture, and science to Korean national identity

      Indian Ocean societies welcomed cultural and economic exchanges among people of many different
      ethnicities and religions. East Asian societies, however, had a different response to such exchanges. While
      Japan, China, and Korea were members of the same economic networks as the societies of the Indian Ocean
      and participated in some of the same cultural trades, they attempted, with varying degrees of success, to limit
      the effects at home of contact with outsiders and their ideas.

     Japan

      In the 1400s, Japan was locked in what seemed to be unending internal strife. The Ashikaga shoguns (military
      overlords) who supposedly ruled the country were too weak to prevent their vassals from fighting one another
      or to deal with pirate bands that attacked the coasts of Japan, Korea, and China (Figure 2.18). Powerful samurai
     began to style themselves daimyos ("great lords") and ruled their territories as if they were independent
      kingdoms; they imposed their own laws, collected tolls from those who entered, and recruited warriors loyal
      only to them, instead of to the shogun or the emperor. From this period of chaos emerged a succession of three

powerful samurai who came to be known as "the three unifiers." Beginning in the 1560s, Oda Nobunaga began
to unite Japan under his rule. He was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. These men
ended the incessant violence, united Japan under a strong central government, and defined the relationship
their nation had with the West.

In 1543, Portuguese ships arrived in Japan. It was the logical end point of a route that had taken them around
the coast of Africa, eastward through the Indian Ocean, and into the Pacific. They wished to trade. They also
wished to win converts for the Roman Catholic Church, as they had done elsewhere in Asia. The Portuguese
were soon followed by the Spanish in 1549, and on the heels of the Portuguese and Spanish came the Dutch
and the English. These last two nations, however, were less interested in religion than in profit.
The Jesuit priests brought by the Spanish and Portuguese proved quite successful at winning souls. Those like
Gaspar Vilela, who arrived in Japan in 1556, often learned the Japanese language so they could communicate
directly with converts. By 1600, more than 100,000 Japanese had become Roman Catholics, and half the
Jesuits serving in Japan were Japanese. Nagasaki, on the southern island of Kyushu, was the most
Christianized community in Japan and had ten churches. Although most samurai were not interested in
becoming Roman Catholics, they were nevertheless interested in something else the Europeans had to
offer--guns. Many daimyos became Christian or offered the missionaries support in an effort to obtain
weapons and gunpowder to assist them in their battles with rival samurai.
Guns had a great impact on Japanese warfare even though they were difficult to aim and slow to reload. One
gun did not give its possessor an advantage in battle over opponents armed with swords, pikes, or lances.
However, when soldiers massed together and groups of them fired in succession, as Europeans fought, they
58 2 · Exchange in East Asia and the Indian Ocean

      could easily defeat those armed with traditional Japanese weapons. Oda Nobunaga made use of this new style
      of fighting. In 1575, at the Battle of Nagashino, he and his vassal Tokugawa Ieyasu used companies of samurai
      armed with European guns to defeat the warriors of the Takeda clan. By 1582, the year he was assassinated by
      one of his vassals, Oda had unified the central portion of the main Japanese island of Honshu, including the
      area surrounding Kyoto, the seat of the emperor.

      Upon Oda's death, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a vassal of his, succeeded to his position after defeating the army of
     Oda's assassin. By 1590, Hideyoshi had defeated all the daimyos in Japan and required that they declare their
      loyalty to him. He disarmed non-samurai and forbade peasants to leave the land or become soldiers, while also
      forbidding samurai to take up any occupation other than war.

      Unlike Oda Nobunaga, who had been relatively unconcerned with the activities of Christians, Hideyoshi was
      more suspicious of them. A devout Buddhist, he disapproved of Christians' eating of cattle and horses and was
      horrified by the destruction of Buddhist temples and objects of worship by some overly zealous converts, acts
      in which Gaspar Vilela had participated. In 1587, Hideyoshi ordered Christian missionaries to leave Japan.
     The edict was not enforced, but the Jesuits, alarmed, asked Christian daimyos to help them attack the shogun,
      which they refused to do. In 1590, the Jesuits in Japan resolved instead to refrain from intervening in Japanese
     affairs, but they secretly continued to provide funds for Christian daimyos.

     Neither approach was completely successful in avoiding Hideyoshi's ire. In 1596 the San Felipe, a Spanish ship
      sailing from the Philippines to Mexico, was caught in typhoons in the Pacific and wrecked on a sandbar in the
     harbor of Urado, on the Japanese island of Shikoku. The local daimyo confiscated the vessel's cargo, which
     Japanese law allowed, and when the ship's captain protested, the daimyo suggested he approach Mashita
      Nagamori, one of the shogun's officials, for assistance. Accordingly, the Spanish captain sent two men to the
      capital of Kyoto to meet with Nagamori.

      There they produced a map of Spain's empire in the Americas and explained how converting the Indigenous
      population to Christianity had helped Spain to gain control of this vast territory. Nagamori reported this
      information to Hideyoshi, perhaps with the intent of providing an excuse for retaining hold of the ship's cargo.
      Fearing that the Spanish intended to conquer Japan and planned to seek assistance from Japanese Christians,
      Hideyoshi ordered the arrest of the missionaries who had remained in Japan in violation of his 1587 decree.
      The Jesuits, however, had deliberately made their proselytizing efforts less public since 1587, and they were
      largely being ignored. Thus, of the twenty-six Christians arrested, most were Japanese, and twenty-three were
      of the Franciscan order. In February 1597, all were crucified in Nagasaki. They became known as the Twenty-
      Six Martyrs of Japan.

                                                                                                IN THEIR OWN WORDS

      The Expulsion of the Missionaries

        In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered Christian missionaries to leave Japan. He had not always been opposed to
       Christianity. Some of his loyal daimyos were Christians, and Christians had offered prayers for his success when
        he invaded Korea. Like his predecessor Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi was willing to tolerate Christianity if it did not
        disrupt traditional Japanese practices or interfere with his plans to consolidate his power over other samurai. By
        1587, however, he had become convinced that it posed too many threats. Following are the edicts he issued in
        1587. As you read, note the various reasons he gives for expelling the missionaries.

              1. Japan is the country of the gods, but has been receiving false teachings from Christian countries. This
              cannot be tolerated any further.

              2. The [missionaries] approach people in provinces and districts to make them their followers, and let
              them destroy shrines and temples. This is an unheard of outrage. When a vassal receives a province, a
              district, a village, or another form of a fief, he must consider it as a property entrusted to him on a

        temporary basis. He must follow the laws of this country, and abide by their intent. However, some
        vassals illegally [commend part of their fiefs to the church]. This is a culpable offense.
        3. The padres [Catholic priests], by their special knowledge [in the sciences and medicine], feel that
        they can at will entice people to become their believers. In doing so they commit the illegal act of
        destroying the teachings of Buddha prevailing in Japan. These padres cannot be permitted to remain in
        Japan. They must prepare to leave the country within twenty days of the issuance of this notice.
        4. The black [Portuguese and Spanish] ships come to Japan to engage in trade. Thus the matter is a
        separate one. They can continue to engage in trade.
        5. Hereafter, anyone who does not hinder the teachings of the Buddha, whether he be a merchant or
        not, may come and go freely from Christian countries to Japan.
        --Toyotomi Hideyoshi, "Edict: Expulsion of Missionaries"
    · How tolerant was Toyotomi Hideyoshi of European Christians? What specific actions angered him? Why?
    · Does Hideyoshi object to the Christian faith itself? Explain your answer.

In 1592, Hideyoshi invaded Korea, a vassal state of the Ming dynasty, but Chinese troops stopped the Japanese
advance. In 1597, he attacked again and was again defeated, this time by Chinese and Korean troops and
Korea's navy. In 1598 he died, leaving his five-year-old son Hideyori to inherit his position. However, the five-
member council that was to rule until Hideyori came of age was soon divided, and the two sides made war
upon each other. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu, a vassal of Hideyoshi, defeated his opponents at the Battle of
Sekigahara (Figure 2.19), and he became shogun in 1603.

     To consolidate power, Tokugawa Ieyasu rewarded loyal daimyos with gifts of land. He allocated 15 percent of
      Japan's richest rice-producing land to himself and his heirs. The next-best land, about half of that available,
     was given to his "inside daimyos," samurai who were related to him or who had declared their loyalty before
      the Battle of Sekigahara. The remaining land, less fertile or farthest away from the new capital of Edo (modern-
     day Tokyo), was given to the "outside daimyos," samurai clans that had proclaimed loyalty only after his victory
     or that had fought against him. Ieyasu prohibited daimyos from forming alliances, including marriages,
      without his approval. He also required them to spend every other year in Edo, where it would be more difficult
      for them to formulate rebellion.

      The peace and unity that Tokugawa Ieyasu's rule brought to Japan ushered in a period of prosperity and
     cultural blossoming. The daimyos took control of the lands that had belonged to their samurai, and the
     samurai moved to the cities in which their lords' castles were located. The daimyos established schools where
      the sons of their vassals studied Chinese characters, learned the Confucian classics, and were instructed in
      military skills. Temple schools taught the children of artisans and merchants. Tokugawa Japan boasted a high
      level of literacy, which supported a thriving publishing industry. In Edo alone, there were hundreds of shops in
      which people could buy or rent novels and other types of books. People visited restaurants and theaters in
      their leisure time, and those who could afford to do so traveled to Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, often at
      festival time.

      Like Hideyoshi, Ieyasu also feared that Christians posed a threat to Japan, a belief Dutch and English
      merchants seeking trade advantages encouraged. Ieyasu was aware of hostile Portuguese and Spanish actions
      in India and the Philippines and did not intend to surrender control of Japan. He also feared that by adopting
     the foreign faith, he would give disloyal daimyos opportunities to conspire against him. He was encouraged in
      this belief when a Christian samurai forged a document to help another Christian samurai claim land he
      desired and a scandal erupted. The forger, caught, also claimed that a plan existed to kill an official of the
      shogun's government.

      In 1614, Ieyasu outlawed the practice of Christianity and ordered missionaries to leave the country. Japanese
      Christians were warned that if they did not renounce their faith, they would be killed. It was clear to Ieyasu that
      the best way to keep Christian influence--and other dangerous forces--out of the country was to ban the entry
      of foreigners and forbid Japanese to leave. Preventing Japanese from leaving the country would also keep
     daimyos from conspiring against him in foreign lands.

      In 1624, the Spanish were banned from entering Japan. In 1639, Ieyasu prohibited the entry of the Portuguese.
      The Dutch, who had refrained from missionary activity, were still allowed to enter Japan to trade. However, to
      limit any harmful influence on their part, Dutch merchants were confined to a settlement on Dejima Island in
      the harbor of Nagasaki, in a walled compound they were not allowed to leave. Only licensed trade officials and
      translators (a position that became hereditary) could have contact with them. The English might have been
      extended the same rights, but finding trade with Japan not as profitable as they had hoped, they no longer sent
      ships. Chinese merchants were also still allowed to enter the country, but their trade was confined to Nagasaki,
      and they were forced to live in a special Chinese enclave. In 1635, Japanese were forbidden to leave the
      country except on special missions, like transacting trade with Korea, China, and Russia.

      Despite efforts of the shogun's government to prevent Japanese contact with Europeans, "Dutch learning,"
      knowledge gained from the Dutch on Dejima, played an important part in Japanese life in the seventeenth and
      eighteenth centuries. In 1640, European books were banned with the exception of medical treatises and books
      on sailing. In subsequent years, the bans intended to isolate Japanese from Western knowledge relaxed. Ailing
      Japanese who could not find relief from Japanese doctors visited physicians on Dejima. Trade in Western
      goods was allowed to some extent in Nagasaki, and government officials were allowed to purchase maps,
      clocks, medical instruments, telescopes, and novelties like European seeds and birds. In the early eighteenth
      century, prohibitions on books were relaxed, and works on medicine, science, and geography were translated.
      Thus, "Dutch learning" provided a foundation for Japanese scientific and technological development and kept

people informed of what was happening in Europe, even though most could not leave the country.

China's Dynastic Exchanges

Japan was not the only nation that turned inward in the seventeenth century. China did so as well when the
Hongwu emperor, the first Ming dynasty emperor, attempted to reverse the effects of foreign occupation after
defeating the Mongols in 1368. To prevent the dangerous effect of outside ideas and potential challenges to his
rule, Hongwu decided that Chinese contact with foreign lands would consist primarily of visits by vassals from
tributary states. By limiting trade to the exchange of tribute goods, China also hoped to pressure other nations,
which greatly desired its products, to accede to its demands. One of the strongest of these demands was that
the Ashikaga shoguns prevent Japanese pirates from preying on China and its vassal state of Korea, which the
Japanese rulers were unable to do. In 1371, all private foreign trade was forbidden. Several years later, all
foreign trade officially came to an end when the Maritime Trade Intendancies' offices in the port cities of
Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Quanzhou, through which all tribute goods were to flow, were closed. Harbors were
filled with rocks and wooden stakes to prevent ships from using them. Ships were destroyed or left to rot in
their docks. A shore patrol was instituted to catch anyone attempting to engage in trade. Though the
punishment was death, smugglers widely violated the rule.

By cutting off access to foreign trade outside the tribute system, the Ming government greatly reduced its tax
revenue, which left it constantly short of funds. To reduce the cost of government, Hongwu made wealthier
peasant families responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order in their villages, saving the expense of
paying officials to do so. Soldiers' families were given land to farm in order to make the army self-supporting.
High taxes were imposed on merchants and scholarly elites. These reforms were largely unsuccessful. Soldiers
often could not raise enough food to support themselves and either sold the land they had been given or
deserted. Even wealthy peasants could not always afford to provide the services the government expected of
them. Local officials lacked necessary funds, and they began to impose additional fees on peasants.

Hongwu's son, the Yongle emperor, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty, was a bit more curious about the
world outside China and more desirous of tribute than his father. Between 1405 and 1421, he dispatched
Zheng He, a trusted palace eunuch, on a series of six voyages throughout the Indian Ocean. The purpose of
these voyages was to demonstrate the wealth and power of China by distributing gifts to foreign rulers, thus
prompting them to pledge themselves as vassals and offer tribute to the Ming emperor.

The first fleet departed in 1405. It consisted of 317 ships and 27,000 people, including sailors, soldiers,
scholars, craftspeople, and fortune-tellers. It rode the monsoon winds from the coast of Fujian in southeast
China to the Kingdom of Champa in southern Vietnam, where the crew traded silks and porcelain for lacquer
wood, rhinoceros horn, and elephant ivory. The ships then visited Aceh, Majapahit, and several other city-
states in Indonesia, where many Chinese merchants lived. From there, they moved on to Sri Lanka and Calicut.
In Calicut, the crew traded for pearls, peppers, gems, and coral. On the return leg, Zheng He brought diplomats
from the states he had visited to meet the emperor. On later voyages, the ships visited Persia, Arabia, and East
Africa, and on one return trip, a ship carried a giraffe as a gift for the Ming emperor (Figure 2.20).

      by China National Museum/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain; credit b: modification of work "Chinese woodblock
      print, representing Zheng He's ships" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
      In 1430, the Xuande Emperor, the Yongle emperor's grandson, ordered Zheng He to undertake his seventh and
      final voyage. These forays were China's last significant effort to make contact with overseas lands for many
      decades, however. Factions at court worried about the effect of outsiders and their ideas on the empire, as well
      as the cost of the trips. Following Zheng He's death, his charts and records were destroyed, and the ships of the
      fleet were left to rot.
      China continued to interest itself in the affairs of territories it bordered, however. In 1406-1407, China invaded
      Vietnam to restore the Tran emperor to his throne after it had been usurped. A Vietnamese revolt ended
      China's occupation of the country in 1427. The victorious Lê dynasty then pledged loyalty to China as a vassal
      state. In 1449, a Chinese military expedition into Mongol territory ended in the slaughter of the Chinese at the
      Battle of Tumu. In 1592 and 1597, Ming armies helped Korean troops repel a Japanese invasion. At other
      times, though, the Ming attempted to avoid conflict whenever possible. After the 1449 defeat of the Chinese by
      western Mongols (known as the Oirat) at the Battle of Tumu, construction began on a new Great Wall to
      supplement the original Great Wall, the earthen fortifications erected by the Qin in the third century BCE. It
      was hoped that the new fortification would protect China from the outside world.
      China needed money to pay for this massive project, however, as well as such other projects as the extension of
      the Grand Canal to Beijing, which the Yongle emperor had made his capital, and the building of a massive
      complex of palaces and imperial offices in Beijing known as the Forbidden City. In 1567, the Ming dynasty
      reversed the policy that had prohibited foreign trade, and soon European merchant ships began arriving
      again. In 1577, Portuguese merchants, who had already been trading in China in violation of the law, were
      given permission to establish a factory at Macao. Of even greater interest to the Chinese, though, were Spanish
      galleons from Manila, carrying silver from mines in the Americas. When they left China, these ships took with

them Chinese silks, satins, taffetas, velvets, damasks, and brocades, as well as ready-made clothing. One ship
carried fifty thousand pairs of silk stockings. The Spanish also carried out the blue and white Chinese
porcelain that had become the rage in Europe, along with ginger, cotton cloth, pearls, musk, saltpeter to make
gunpowder, sapphires, rubies, and cages of songbirds along with other exotic goods.

China's economy boomed, and many Chinese peasants began to focus on producing goods for the foreign
market. Some specialized in raising cotton and weaving cotton textiles. Others raised mulberry trees and
harvested their leaves to sell to families that raised silkworms (which feed on the leaves). Peasants who
specialized in the raising of silkworms in turn sold their cocoons to others, who boiled them to kill the larvae
and unreeled them to make silk thread. This thread was sold to households that wove silk cloth, which might
then be passed on to those who specialized in embroidery. In Jingdezhen in Jiangxi province, people mass-
produced porcelain.

As the Ming economy grew, so too did its population. Crops from the Americas such as sweet potatoes and
maize were adopted by many peasants, especially those who lived in hilly, dry regions like Sichuan. These
crops grew well and provided abundant calories for farm families. Hot and sweet peppers from the Americas
were added to regional cuisines, transforming them, and peanuts added not only variety but an important
source of fat in diets lacking meat. These new crops ultimately proved harmful, however. As hillsides were
cleared to plant corn, for example, regions became deforested and lost their valuable topsoil. Population
growth was also not accompanied by an increase in cultivated land sufficient to support the added numbers of
people, and in many regions, farmers found themselves tilling smaller fields as the generations passed.

New wealth led many commoners to imitate the nobility, building large homes with courtyards and gardens,
purchasing fine rosewood furniture, collecting art and antiques, and hiring tutors to educate their children and
prepare their sons for the examinations that would earn them jobs in the imperial bureaucracy. Restaurants,
inns, and taverns sprang up in market towns and cities across the country as people became able to afford
leisure activities. A flourishing printing industry produced not only agricultural manuals and copies of the
Confucian classics but also plays and novels, some with erotic scenes and storylines. Guidebooks advised
people traveling on business about where to stay and eat and also provided information about sites of
historical interest. Increasingly, people began to travel for pleasure as well. In the cities prostitution boomed,
and at the very top of a complex hierarchy, courtesans hired themselves out to wealthy merchants to entertain
male guests at parties by playing music or competing with them in poetry contests.

Not all members of Ming society were pleased by the changes taking place in China. The burst of commercial
activity made many prosperous, but not everyone benefited. As income disparities grew, resentments did as
well. Members of noble families were appalled by the fact that many commoners could now dress and live as
they did. Greater opportunities for commoners and changes in the structure of society were reflected even in
the interpretation of the teachings of Confucius. Zhu Xi, a Confucian scholar of the Southern Song dynasty
whose works were influential at the beginning of the Ming dynasty, had agreed with Confucius that all people
possessed the ability to lead moral lives, but he believed this inner morality could become evident only
through a process of intensive education. In the middle of the Ming dynasty, however, the scholar Wang
Yangming rejected Zhu Xi's teachings. According to Wang, morality was intuitive, and people could cultivate
their moral natures while still participating in the mundane affairs of everyday life. Even the uneducated could
understand moral truths. Other writers of the Ming era criticized the traditional structure of the family, which
Confucius had considered the basis of an orderly society, and preached that it was not necessary to conform to
what society considered "proper" modes of behavior. These doctrines frightened the more conservative
members of society.

      Proper Behavior for Women

        In East Asia in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, public concern for the morals of a rapidly changing
        society was reflected in a focus on women's behavior. Chinese and Japanese scholars wrote works admonishing
        elite women about how to behave so as to protect their reputations and those of their families. Following are
        excerpts from treatises of advice for women from both of these countries, the first from China and the second
        from Japan.

              With the decline of education today, women in the inner quarters have really ceased to be governed by
              rites and laws. Those born in villages are accustomed to hearing coarse words and those [born] in rich
              households have loose, proud, and extravagant natures. Their heads are covered with gold and pearls
              and their entire bodies with fine silks. They affect lightheartedness in behavior and cleverness in
              speech, but they mouth no beneficial words and perform no good deeds. . . .

              At the high end are those [women] who wield their writing brushes and aspire to [develop] their talents
              in . . . poetry so as to brag that they are superb scholars. At the low end are those who strum vulgar
              [tunes] on their stringed instruments and sing lascivious words, almost like prostitutes.

             --Lü Kun, Models for the Inner Quarters

              A woman must always be on the alert and keep a strict watch over her own conduct. In the morning she
              must rise early and at night go late to rest. Instead of sleeping in the middle of the day, she must be
              intent on the duties of her household; she must not grow tired of weaving, sewing, and spinning. She
              must not drink too much tea and wine, nor must she feed her eyes and ears on theatrical performances .
              . . ditties, and ballads . . . . In her capacity as a wife, she must keep her husband's household in proper
              order. If the wife is evil and profligate, the house will be ruined. In everything she must avoid
              extravagance, and in regard to both food and clothes, she must act according to her station in life and
              never give in to luxury and pride.

      The days of the Ming were numbered. In the early seventeenth century, the onset of one of the intervals of the
      Little Ice Age, a period of cooling in the northern hemisphere, brought low temperatures and droughts in many
      parts of the country, leading to famine in some areas. Floods devastated other regions. Farmers whose crops
      had failed or who had inherited plots of land too small to support their families were unable to pay their taxes
      or their rents. Even those who could pay had difficulty finding the silver with which the law said taxes must be
      paid.

      The government needed silver more than ever. The cost of supporting the imperial family had grown
      astronomically; over the years, court officials had used their positions to amass great wealth, often through
      corruption, and the war in Korea had been tremendously costly. With silver in short supply, the emperor sent
      court officials to the provinces, supposedly to inspect mines. In reality, the job of the officials was to confiscate
      silver held by merchants. When a group of Chinese officials arrived in Manila in 1603 to take silver from
      Chinese merchants there, the Spanish, believing China was planning to attack the city, killed twenty thousand

Chinese residents and were no longer willing to trade with China. With the imperial government lacking
sufficient funds to pay the army, Chinese soldiers were laid off. In 1627-1628, hungry, impoverished, and
angry soldiers and peasants rose up in revolt in northern China. By 1632, violence had spread to other
provinces. This made it even harder for government officials to collect taxes, which Beijing had raised in 1639,
angering people even more.

North of the Yellow River, discontented peasants formed an army led by Li Zicheng. In the area between the
Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, other rebels were led by Zhang Xianzhong. Province after province erupted in
violence. In April 1644, Li Zicheng's peasant army seized Beijing. In desperation, the last Ming emperor
hanged himself in the palace garden after killing most of his family. Li declared himself the ruler of China and
the founder of a new dynasty. He did not rule long enough to establish his dynasty, however. The next rulers of
China were the Manchus.

The Manchus were members of an ethnic group that lived northeast of the Great Wall in southern Manchuria.
They were descended from Jurchen pastoralists who had established the Jin dynasty that ruled northern China
from 1115 to 1234 until their defeat by the Mongols. The Manchus had then settled down and become farmers.
In the late sixteenth century, the Manchu leader Nurhaci formed the Manchu tribes into a state that paid
tribute to the Ming emperor. In 1616, as the Ming dynasty began to collapse, the Manchus attacked Chinese
settlements on the Liaodong Peninsula. They forced artisans to provide weapons for their army and farmers to
provide food. Officials and army officers who were willing to submit to them were given positions in the
Manchu administration. Those who rebelled were massacred.

Following Nurhaci's death in 1626, his son Hong Taiji proclaimed himself the leader of the Qing ("pure,"
"clear") dynasty. As he expanded Manchu control over Chinese territory, he adopted Chinese forms of
administration and incorporated greater numbers of Chinese officials in his government. Chinese bureaucrats
and army officers, disgusted with the corruption of the Ming government and its inability to respond to the
country's problems, began to defect to the Manchus in large numbers. Fearing ongoing chaos following Li
Zicheng's capture of Beijing, Ming general Wu Sangui, who was charged with guarding the eastern end of the
Great Wall, allowed the Manchu armies through. On May 27, 1644, Wu Sangui's troops and Manchu forces
defeated Li Zicheng's army and took control of Beijing. The Manchu armies swept south, but Ming resistance
there was fierce, and it was not until 1683 that all of China was brought under Manchu control.

Despite what many Chinese had feared, the early Qing emperors proved good rulers. They strove to preserve
their identity as Manchus, but they also embraced Chinese culture. The first Qing emperor, Kangxi, toured
China to acquaint himself with his new domain. He adopted the Chinese bureaucratic apparatus and ordered
that each of the government's six major ministries be led by Manchu and Han Chinese co-administrators.
Kangxi governed according to Confucian principles and maintained the system of imperial examinations for
government jobs.

The Manchu were careful to maintain their superior positions, however, and demanded loyalty from the
Chinese. For example, local positions in government were usually given to Han Chinese bureaucrats, but
supervisory positions were given to Manchus. All males were also required to demonstrate their acceptance of
Manchu rule by wearing the distinctive Manchu hairstyle; the front part of the head was shaved, and the hair in
the back was grown long and braided into a single queue. After 1645, men who did not wear their hair in this
fashion were subject to execution.

Like other Chinese rulers, Kangxi also supported Buddhism. He tolerated other religions, including
Christianity, which was permitted so long as Chinese Christians continued to be filial sons and daughters who
66 2 · Exchange in East Asia and the Indian Ocean

      venerated their ancestors, a practice the Jesuits supported. The Jesuits' efforts to learn the Chinese language
      and their respect for Chinese culture made them more successful at winning converts than the Dominicans
      and Franciscans. But members of these other orders grew jealous and complained to the Pope about the
      Jesuits' willingness to accommodate Chinese practices. When the Vatican ruled that all church services must
      be conducted in Latin and that Chinese Christians must be ordered to abandon their ancestral rites, Kangxi
      decreed that missionaries who complied would have to leave China.
      Kangxi and his successors Yongzheng and Qianlong attempted to redress the problems that had seemed to
      lead to the downfall of the Ming. They placed China on secure financial footing, and fearing that the Ming had
      succumbed to lax moral standards brought on by wealth and luxury, Qing scholars returned to the teachings of
      Zhu Xi. Morally suspect plays and novels were banned, and great emphasis was placed on traditional
      Confucian values. For example, Qianlong visited his mother every day to display his devotion to her (Figure
      2.21). Female chastity was encouraged, and so many memorial arches were erected by communities to
      commemorate "chaste widows," women who had refused to remarry after the death of their husbands, that the
      government attempted to bring an end to the practice in the nineteenth century by declaring that only women
      who committed suicide upon becoming widows could be so memorialized.

      FIGURE 2.21 Emperor Qianlong. Although he was a Manchu, Emperor Qianlong embraced Confucian values and
      tried to live the life of a Confucian scholar. Every day he spent hours working on affairs of state, visited his mother,
      and then dedicated himself to writing poetry and admiring works of art. This eighteenth-century painting of him in
      his study was made by Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian Jesuit at Qianlong's court. (credit: "Qianlong in his studies"

      The Qing, however, continued the Ming policy of interacting with other countries as little as possible. Like the
      Ming, they did intervene in Asia where it seemed their interests were at stake. For example, in 1683, the island
      of Taiwan, a base for pirates and a refuge for fleeing Ming loyalists, was made part of China. In 1720, Qing

armies took control of the city of Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. In the 1750s, they fought Mongols and Uighurs in
central Asia and incorporated the province of Xinjiang ("new province") into China.

During the Qing dynasty, China continued to rely on foreign trade income, and European demand for Chinese
products did not cease. The Qing remained wary of Europeans, however, and wished to minimize contact with
foreigners as the Japanese had done. Non-Chinese were allowed to reside in Macao, but after 1759 they could
conduct trade only through the port of Guangzhou and trade only with the Co-hong, the official Chinese
merchant guild. While in the city on business, they had to stay in a special quarter for Europeans. When they
had finished their transactions, they had to depart.

In the eyes of the Chinese, Europe was an inferior place that possessed nothing of interest. Although European
scientific knowledge was impressive to some, most Chinese merchants and officials maintained a disdainful
attitude toward the West that was reflected in the way in which Qianlong received Lord George Macartney, who
visited China in 1793 on behalf of the British king. Qianlong demanded that Macartney, as the representative
of an inferior monarch, demonstrate his respect by kneeling and knocking his head on the ground, the
traditional way in which vassals greeted the emperor. Macartney refused to do so, and Qianlong announced
that he was willing to accept the British monarch as a vassal but did not consider him an equal. He also refused
Britain's request to establish a permanent embassy in China. China, he noted, already had everything it
needed, and Britain had nothing of value to offer.

Korea and Its Neighbors

After the fall of the Mongols in China, Koreans were divided regarding the nature of their relationship with the
Ming dynasty. In the 1380s, Yi Seong-gye and his fellow general Choe Yeong won fame for themselves when
they defeated Japanese pirates who were raiding Korea. When the Ming dynasty attempted to annex Korean
territory, Choe Yeong declared himself in opposition to the Ming and advised an invasion of China's Liaodong
Peninsula. Yi Seong-gye was chosen to lead the army but instead took the opportunity to seize Korea's capital
and gain control of the government in 1388. In 1392, after ruling for four years through puppet kings, Yi
Seong-gye proclaimed himself the head of a new dynasty, the Joseon, named for an earlier Korean dynasty.
Ruling as King Taejo, he declared himself a vassal of the far more powerful Ming dynasty and established
friendly relations with China.

Taejo embraced Confucian principles, which, unlike Buddhism, focus on the maintenance of the family and of
social hierarchies instead of the well-being of the individual. Korean society was divided into rigidly defined
classes. At the top was a ruling class of civil bureaucrats and military officials called the yangban, who ruled
the country along with the king. Membership in this class depended on doing well on the imperial exams,
which were based on knowledge of the Confucian classics, like similar exams in China. As in China, wealthy
families and nobility of the former dynasty dominated the exams, because only the men in these families had
the time and money to acquire the education necessary to do well. Membership in a yangban family also
conferred the right to serve on local ruling councils and thus control their affairs. Eventually, membership in
the yangban became hereditary when only the sons of these families were allowed to take the imperial exams.
The yangban were supported by the labor of the sangmin, indentured servants who worked the land.

Unlike the yangban, the seonbi were scholarly, highly educated men who devoted themselves to lives of study
and served the public without financial reward. They did not covet riches and preferred scholarly pursuits,
believing their role was to serve as moral exemplars for the rest of society. They valued integrity above all else
and served as advocates of the common people even if that meant risking the displeasure of the king. Even
though they came from the same class as the yangban, their lack of interest in attaining wealth and power set
them apart.

The love of study and learning that characterized the seonbi flourished in the reign of King Sejong, the fourth
king of Korea. In 1442, Korean scholars developed a device to accurately gauge rainfall. Scholars also
developed a means of measuring the direction and velocity of the wind. An astronomical observatory was
68 2 · Exchange in East Asia and the Indian Ocean

      constructed, and a variety of sundials and water clocks were invented to measure time (Figure 2.22).
      Triangulation devices and surveying rods were used to measure the elevation of land. Sejong recruited
      scholars from the institution of research he had founded, known as the Hall of Worthies, to help him develop
     hangul, an alphabet that could capture the sounds of Korean speech. Hangul, which Sejong introduced in
      1446, was intended to be used by common people instead of the Chinese characters with which the elite
     yangban wrote.

      FIGURE 2.22 A Map of the Heavens. This fifteenth-century celestial globe, used to make astronomical
      observations, was invented by Jang Yeong-Sil during the reign of Korea's King Sejong. (credit: "Korean armillary
      sphere" by Wikimachine/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
      After the reign of Sejong, the Joseon dynasty encountered numerous difficulties. In 1592 and again in 1597,
      Japan invaded Korea. In the following century, the Manchus attacked Korea several times between 1627 and
      1636. In addition to problems caused by attacks from without, great division was created by fights between
     factions of the yangban class. These factions, the Easterners and the Westerners, engaged in violent conflict
      that persisted from generation to generation.
     Beginning in the late seventeenth century, disgust at the conflict among the yangban elites led many scholars,
      officials, and common people to support the Silhak movement, which promoted the study of the physical
      sciences and technology in order to solve practical problems instead of focusing narrowly on the Confucian
     classics (silhak means "practical learning"). Silhak proponents also advocated numerous social reforms,
      including land reform and revision of Korea's rigid social structure. These reformers argued that learning
      should promote the welfare of the people. They stressed social equality and the importance of Korean culture.
      Concern for the preservation of Korean culture was undoubtedly influenced by Korea's relationship to the
      countries that surrounded it. Buddhism and Confucianism, the philosophy on which the Joseon dynasty was
      based, were both introduced by the Chinese. Korean writing, painting, architecture, and pottery were also
      influenced by China. For centuries, Korean scholars wrote with Chinese characters. Over the centuries, Korea
      had been invaded by Chinese, Khitans, Mongols, Japanese, and Manchus. Nevertheless, the constant influx of

foreign ideas and material goods helped to reinforce in Koreans the separate sense of a distinctive Korean
identity. Trying to differentiate themselves from Chinese, Mongols, and Japanese, Koreans like the Silhak
reformers emphasized the importance of maintaining a Korean identity based on Korean history and culture.

Section Summary

2.1 India and International Connections

Although Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur, a Muslim who founded the Mughal Empire, made little effort to
assimilate to Indian culture, his grandson Akbar forged a culture that incorporated Indian and Persian, Hindu
and Muslim elements. Under him, the Mughal Empire grew to encompass most of northern and much of
central India, including the Sultanate of Gujarat, the heart of a rich Indian Ocean trade. Under Aurangzeb, who
attempted an Islamic revival and was largely intolerant of the Hindu population, the empire weakened as it
battled the Maratha Empire for dominance over the states of seventeenth-century India.

Europeans sought to control India's wealth. First the Portuguese attempted to establish trading posts in India
while forcing out Arab and other merchants. Indian rulers and the Mamluk sultan tried to force them from
India, but unsuccessfully. The Portuguese were assisted by alliances with some Indian rulers but soon found
themselves competing with the English and French, who also formed alliances with Indian rulers and took
advantage of their disputes with one another. As the Mughals and Marathas battled each other and the invading
Afghan forces, states in northern India broke free of their rule and allied themselves instead with the British,
allowing Britain to gradually consolidate its power in India.

2.2 The Malacca Sultanate

The Malaccan Sultanate was established around 1400 by Parameswara, the last king of Singapura. The city's
location on both sides of the Malaccan Straits destined it for success, because the straits were the route taken
by trading ships between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. The city grew wealthy and attracted a diverse
population of merchants from many countries, and the sultanate thrived under the leadership of Mansur Shah,
who expanded its territory. Its prosperity was also aided by its support for Islam and the formulation of a legal
code to regulate the conduct of foreign sailors.

In 1511, the Portuguese attacked Malacca and took over the city, but their insistence on converting the people
to Christianity resulted in their being expelled from both Malacca and the Sultanate of Ternate in Indonesia. In
the end, the Spanish took control of the Philippines, and the Dutch, who had no interest in spreading Roman
Catholicism, became the main European power in Indonesia.

2.3 Exchange in East Asia

East Asia was drawn into the network of global maritime trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The
Portuguese and Spanish arrived in Japan when powerful daimyos were each fighting to unify the country and
bring it under their rule. Guns brought by Europeans began to play an important role in Japanese warfare.

Many Japanese also began to convert to Christianity. In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu became the shogun of a united
Japan, and wishing to control the samurai and fearing Christian subjects would not be loyal, he prohibited
Christianity, banned the entry of the Portuguese and Spanish, and prohibited Japanese from leaving the
country except on government missions.

Following the expulsion of the Mongols, China also turned inward. The first Ming emperor, Hongwu, forbade
foreign trade. Needing money, however, the government permitted trade with Europeans in the second half of
the sixteenth century. Trade brought prosperity for Chinese farmers, artisans, and merchants, though changes
in their lifestyle alarmed conservatives. However, famines, floods, and the inability of the Ming government to
solve China's problems led to the dynasty's overthrow in 1644. The Manchu Qing dynasty attempted to reassert
traditional Confucian values while still trading with Europe.

Korea's Joseon dynasty, a vassal of China, also tried to structure its society on a Confucian model. The
seventeenth-century Silhak movement in Korea advocated the study of science and technology in order to
solve social problems.

3.4 The Trans-Saharan Slave Trade
INTRODUCTION The Portuguese built the castle of St. George of the Mine (later called Elmina) in the fifteenth
century, which many historians characterize as the beginning of the early modern period (Figure 3.1). Located
on the coast of present-day Ghana, the fortress gave the Portuguese a foothold in the West African gold trade,
which was by then largely in the hands of the kingdom of Songhai (Songhay). The economic health and
longevity of the Songhai Empire depended on the secure and smooth operation of the trans-Saharan trade in
goods across North Africa. Gold was then unquestionably the most prized of all West African commodities, and
in time, the trade in human cargo became equally important. With an eye toward their profit margins, the
Portuguese traders at Elmina combined the flows of trade in these two highly valued commodities, becoming
intermediaries who provided enslaved people from Benin to the Akan mines in modern-day Ghana and Côte
d'Ivoire. By the sixteenth century, Elmina had become one of the earliest direct links between European
slavers and the slave markets of the African interior.

3.1 The Roots of African Trade

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the main trade routes across the Sahara in the sixteenth century
  · Analyze the ways in which Islam facilitated the development of trans-Saharan trade
  · Identify the factors that contributed to the decline of the Mali Empire
Beginning in ancient times, trans-Saharan trade routes united many markets and products, linking the
commodities, buyers, and sellers of North and West Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Trade networks
spanned thousands of miles of sea and land and connected the distant trading centers and cities at their far
ends. In the Sahara, such cosmopolitan settlements as Awdaghost, Sijilmasa, and Djenné, all part of the Mali
Empire, linked desert trade routes. These trading centers made possible not only the widespread distribution
of raw materials and finished products necessary for commerce to thrive but also the diffusion of cultural
influences, including religion, to other civilizations.

Saharan Trade Routes

Camel caravans from North Africa began trekking across the Sahara Desert in antiquity (the period Before the
Common Era, or BCE). The trade reached a peak during the ninth to the fifteenth centuries of the Common Era
(CE), when lines of thousands of camels traveled a web-like network of trade routes that spanned the whole of
North and West Africa. They moved a variety of goods, including copper, salt, ivory, enslaved people, textiles,
and gold, northward from sub-Saharan West Africa to the Mediterranean coast, eastward to the Horn of Africa
and Egypt, and southward into the Sahel, the semiarid region between the Sahara Desert and the Sudanian
savanna to the south (Figure 3.4).

Long before the trans-Saharan trade route's golden age, commerce in the Sahara was relatively localized and
consisted of the exchange of agricultural products like rice, sorghum, and millet for the products of new
technologies such as iron goods or rare commodities such as salt. These early inter- and intraregional
exchanges were made possible by pack animals like mules, horses, and donkeys, but trade was limited because
these animals were biologically ill-suited for the extremes of the Saharan environment. When the Romans
conquered North Africa in the second century BCE, they introduced the camel, which was already a beast of
78 3 · Early Modern Africa and the Wider World

      burden in Egypt. Capable of lasting days without water and having feet and eyelashes adapted for travel in
      sandy environments, camels enabled the people of North Africa to carry on regular long-distance trade across
      the Sahara for the first time beginning in the eighth century CE. The camel saddle, invented by the Tuareg
      people of North Africa, enabled camels to be ridden, which furthered their usefulness to trans-Saharan trade.
      The introduction of the date palm also helped make systematic long-distance trade possible. The fruit of the
      date palm is high in sugar, a natural preservative, and when dried it provided a high-calorie, easily
      transportable food supply to fortify traders on long journeys.
      Trans-Saharan trade was also critically dependent on highly paid nomadic North African Berber (Amazigh)1
      intermediaries and the string of oasis towns that connected distant parts of the network in an otherwise
      unforgiving landscape (Figure 3.5). Oasis towns provided traveling merchants with places to rest, water their
      animals, and acquire provisions for the next leg of their journey. They served the same function as the
      caravanserais, inns for travelers that existed throughout the Islamic world, including along the Silk Roads in
      Asia, in the Middle East, and in Egypt and Morocco. The Imazighen's skills as caravan leaders and go-betweens
      facilitated the movement of everything from gold ingots to ostrich feathers across thousands of square miles of
      desert. Yet Amazigh traders were responsible for much more than the movement of goods and commodities.
      They were also devout believers in Islam who spread Islamic culture, law, custom, and tradition and helped to
      fuse a network of local and regional trade routes into a truly continent-spanning enterprise.

      Algeria. (credit: "Mountains of sand loom over the oasis village of Taghit in the Sahara" by The Central Intelligence
      Agency: The World Factbook/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
      A principal commodity exchanged during this early stage of trade was salt, which acted as a sort of currency.
      Not only is salt necessary to human and animal life, but it also helps to preserve foods, an important concern
      of people in an age before refrigeration technology existed. Communities on the edges of the desert acted as
      intermediaries in this trade, trading salt to forest tribes to the south that had access to goldfields. Only over
      time were other highly valuable trading goods introduced, such as gold and copper, which were then passed
      across the desert from tropical West Africa to the far reaches of the North African coast and beyond.

       1 There is a growing awareness about the use of the term Berber to describe indigenous North Africans, many of whom self-identify
       as Amazigh, or Imazighen (plural). With this understanding, although we have introduced the term Berber as the most commonly
       used name in English, we have generally preferred to use the term Amazigh in this text.

Trade across the Sahara gradually intensified between the fifth and seventh centuries CE, and in the eighth
and ninth centuries, a series of main links became established. These developments were made possible
primarily as the result of two important changes. First, the Ghana Empire of West Africa emerged as the
earliest large-scale political entity in the region, and second, the Islamic conquest of North Africa led to the
rise of Muslim states and a general cultural unification of the region. Combined, these developments brought
people with shared interests and similar characteristics together in conditions that enabled them to
consolidate and expand their economic interests, particularly as demand increased for gold from the Sudan.
As trade grew, Arab merchants in Morocco and in Islamic states in North Africa began to buy sub-Saharan
gold. By the eleventh century, the gold trade was so successful that it was influencing commerce and society in
the Mediterranean (Figure 3.6). For the first time, West African gold was used to mint European coins. This
growth in the market for gold spurred the expansion of new links in the trans-Saharan trade route and resulted
in the opening of a major trade artery between the towns of Sijilmasa, north of the Sahara, and Awdaghost to
the south.

present-day Morocco and Awdaghost in Mauritania were indirectly linked by routes that united other trading cities in
the surrounding region. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
One of the greatest early Sudanic empires, the powerful states that emerged in the region of West Africa south
of the Sahara Desert, was Mali. Mali brought together the key components that had contributed to the earlier
expansion of trans-Saharan trade. On the one hand, its rulers were Muslim, and the fact that they shared the
80 3 · Early Modern Africa and the Wider World

      same religion with many trans-Saharan traders strengthened the ties between these groups. On the other
      hand, these rulers exerted direct control over the goldfields at Bure. The vitally important trade centers of
      Timbuktu and Gao were part of the empire, as were the trading centers of Awdaghost, Oualata (Walata), and
      Tadmekka. Although both gold and salt remained the principal commodities of exchange, other commodities
      such as textiles, enslaved people, ivory, precious stones, and shea butter (a vegetable fat from the shea tree
      nut) were also regular exports.

      During the ninth to fifteenth centuries, caravans routinely plied the sands of the Sahara, moving goods from
      distant West Africa to Egypt and centers of trade in North Africa, and from there onward, either across the
      Mediterranean to southern Europe or overland by way of the Sinai Peninsula to the region of the Levant in the
      Near East (modern Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel). From there, West African commodities could arrive at
      one of the land-based western terminals of the Silk Roads in such trade centers as the coastal city of Tyre in
      Lebanon, and farther inland, at Aleppo in Syria. Africa at this time was a key player in the vast commercial
      enterprise that laid the foundation for the first global economies.

     The Spread of Islam

      The Arab conquests of North Africa and the gradual advance of Islam into West Africa from the eighth century
      did much to unify what had been largely regional trade into a truly cross-desert system of commerce. The
      spread and adoption of Islam by nomads, such as the Tuareg and Sanhaja of the Niger region, helped expand
      the networks of exchange. Shared values and rules established by Islamic tradition and law engendered a
      sense of mutual trust and respect among devout Muslim traders and caravanners. African traders and
      merchants recognized other benefits of conversion beyond the spiritual, which included guarantees afforded
      by contract law that was based on Islamic law and made possible by widespread Arabic literacy. They also
      enjoyed the extension of credit and promissory notes between multiple parties, who were all investors in a
      caravan, and an increasingly extensive information network in which oasis towns acted as centers of
      communication and exchange.

      Africans may also have been led to convert to Islam by other factors. A significant motivation was likely the
      harsh terms the conquering Muslims imposed on non-Muslims, which included exorbitant taxation as well as
      demands for hundreds (according to some sources, thousands) of enslaved people. These people, the majority
      of whom were probably Amazigh, were then shipped to markets in Damascus or Baghdad to be sold or
      transported onward to other market towns in the east. Since Islamic law forbade the enslavement of fellow
      Muslims, countless Amazigh people decided to convert to avoid being taken captive.

      Once Islam reached the savanna south of the Sahara, ruling African elites adopted it, and in some cases they
      blended it with their traditional beliefs, a process called syncretism. Muslims, who could read and write Arabic
      script, were sought after as administrators by rulers whose languages did not have their own alphabets. The
      tendency of non-Muslim kingdoms to employ Muslim merchant-scholars as advisers and scribes (as, for
      example, in the kingdom of Ghana) in turn helped raise the profile of Islam among Africans and further
      encouraged conversion.

      As commerce expanded, Islam gradually spread along the trans-Saharan trade routes and created a network of
      believers who trusted each other, thanks to a common language--Arabic--and shared values, traditions, and
      customs such as regular daily prayer. These shared social bonds and trust allowed trade to increase among
      peoples at some considerable distance who were otherwise unknown to one another. Another social
      interaction crucial to the widespread diffusion of Islam was intermarriage between Muslim traders and local
      women, who raised their children as Muslims. By the thirteenth century, Islam had spread into the region of
      Lake Chad and the Kingdom of Kanem by way of trans-Saharan trade (Figure 3.7).

The Mali Empire

Larger political entities emerged in Sudanic West Africa, beginning with the Mali Empire in the early
thirteenth century. Around 1235, Sundiata Keita, the founder of Mali, set about consolidating his control over
the heartland of the Mande people, a region centered on the well-watered grasslands of the upper reaches of
the Senegal and Niger Rivers. Sundiata convinced the other Malinke (also known as Mandinke) kings to
surrender their title, mansa (which means "ruler" in the Malinke language), to him. He thus became the sole
mansa, the religious and secular leader of all the Malinke people.
Sundiata then moved to expand the Mali kingdom by taking control of all the Soninke peoples (Figure 3.8). This
territory took in much of the former kingdom of Ghana and its nominally independent peripheral vassal states,
including Mema and Wagadu. These newly conquered territories were often administered indirectly, leaving in
place friendly puppet regimes to do the bidding of the Malian monarch, a political strategy that bred
resentment among certain of the Malian vassal states, including Takrur and Songhai. In a few short years, the
empire extended from the forested margins of the southwest through the grassland savanna country of the
Malinke and the southern Soninke to the Sahel of former Ghana. The kings of Mali were less interested in
conquering the various small kingdoms and chiefdoms of the grasslands than in taking the trading towns of
the Sahel that linked the regional economy to the vast trans-Saharan trade. These towns were key prizes to the
Malian monarchs and included Djenné, Timbuktu, and Gao. Throughout history, economic considerations
have often driven political decisions, like conquering neighboring people, made by rulers on all continents.

      When Sundiata's successors converted to Islam, Mali became the largest Islamic kingdom in West Africa.
      Although its heartland was the Niger floodplain, Mali's capital Niani was located at the Bure goldfields,
      enabling its rulers to exert direct control over the most valuable of all the raw materials transported along the
      trans-Saharan trade routes. Mali's fabulous wealth made it famous, and its rulers used that wealth to attract
      scholars and jurists from all over the Islamic world. For example, Mali's most famous ruler, the fourteenth-
      century Mansa Musa, transformed the trading center of Timbuktu by establishing mosques and schools there
      that became repositories of Islamic scholarship and learning.

      Trans-Saharan commerce also promoted the development of public works in Mali, including the building of
      social and religious structures. Travelers to West Africa were impressed by the palaces, walled cities, and
      mosques they saw there and often remarked on them. In the sixteenth century, Leo Africanus, a formerly
      enslaved Amazigh diplomat and writer (born al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan), visited Songhai and
      praised the fine architecture of the city of Timbuktu, particularly the walled palace of the king and the temple
      of "stone and mortar" that dominated the center of the city. While these buildings awed many visitors, none
      were quite as striking as Timbuktu's mosques. With its sunbaked brick walls and spiky pyramidal shape, for
      example, the Sankore mosque presented onlookers with a unique example of West African architecture at this
      time (Figure 3.9).

Timbuktu (https://openstax.org/l/77Timbuktu) and his experiences while there.

The fortunes of the Mali Empire were transformed in the fifteenth century, when a host of internal and external
challenges combined to fatally undermine the Sudanic kingdom, including rebellions, dynastic disputes, the
rise of powerful new neighbors, and the arrival of the Portuguese. These factors, which are explained next, had
the effect of weakening Mali economically and politically, setting it up for instability and collapse.
The successors of Mansa Musa, who died circa 1337, tended to be weaker and less influential than their
famous predecessor. During the brief reign of his son, Mansa Maghan, Timbuktu was raided and burned by the
Mossi, a people who lived to the south of the Niger bend. Although the Malians returned to the city and ruled it
for another hundred years, the Mossi raid demonstrated to others that the empire had been diminished. Later,
Tuareg nomads raided and caused havoc. They occupied and governed Timbuktu for the next forty years.
The attacks by the Mossi and Tuareg squeezed the enfeebled Malian Empire from the north and east. These
raids were followed by rebellions in towns, signaling a more dramatic shift in the region's geopolitics whereby
many of the empire's most important cities sought to break free of Malian rule. Between 1374 and 1387,
uprisings occurred in the salt-producing center of Takedda and in the major trading center of Gao. While
Mansa Musa II managed to subdue the Tuareg rebellion at Takedda, he was unable to control the Songhai of
Gao, who asserted their independence from Mali. By the 1430s, Mali had lost control not only of Timbuktu but
also of vassal kingdoms such as Mema to the north, and critical trading towns such as Djenné had also
regained their independence.

      Preserving Mali's Past

        Who owns a nation's history? Who decides what constitutes an appropriate expression of religious faith? In Mali,
        such issues have occasioned much debate in the recent past. Many of the Malian Empire's most important
        historical and religious sites are in danger as a result of political conflict. In 2012, members of the Tuareg
        separatist group, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, which seeks independence for northern
        Mali, and members of Ansar Dine, a group linked to al-Qaeda, attacked mosques in the city of Timbuktu.
        Members of these groups believe the mosques violate Islamic prescriptions for religious buildings and are
        "idolatrous."

        In Djenné, to the south, the preservation of Mali's Islamic heritage has encountered other problems. Each year
        since the Great Mosque was built, the residents of Djenné have applied a new layer of mud to replace the coat
        washed away during the rainy season. As time has passed, the layers have accumulated, damaging the structure.
        For several years, the practice had to cease while reconstruction of the building took place, angering the
        worshippers, who believe they acquire religious merit by repairing the mosque. Some residents also have cause
        to dislike the mosque's designation as part of a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
        Organization) World Heritage site in 1988; the designation protects not only the mosque but also the surrounding
        mud-brick houses from alteration. This has prevented those who live there from modernizing their homes.

          · Do you agree with UNESCO's position that "World Heritage sites belong to all the peoples of the world,
              irrespective of the territory on which they are located"?

          · Who has the right to decide how historical and religious sites should be treated? Why?

      As a result of weak rulers, rebellions, and attacks by the Mossi and Tuareg, the trading towns and routes on
     which the mansas depended for their wealth and power were gradually being stripped away from the Malian
      Empire when the arrival of the Portuguese in the fifteenth century complicated matters. The first Portuguese
      slave raids in West Africa took place on the Senegambian coast, the Atlantic coastline of Senegal and the
      Gambia in West Africa, in 1444. Initially, the raids caught Malian vassal territories off guard, but they soon
      recovered and effectively resisted further European encroachment. In 1462, the Portuguese were forced to
      negotiate a peace treaty, which limited them to trading along the Senegambian coast. This new, direct trade
      between a European power and Mande merchants along the coast was the first of several steps that ultimately
      rerouted much commerce away from the trans-Saharan trade routes of the West African interior.

      As the European threat gradually faded, pressure mounted on the Mali Empire's eastern and northern
      frontiers. There, the emergent Songhai Empire under the leadership of Sunni Ali was expanding, and in a
      series of conquests, it managed to annex the former Malian territory of Mema (1465), capture Timbuktu
      (1468), and seize Djenné (1473). By the end of the century, nearly all the lands the Mali Empire once ruled had
      been lost. What remained was little more than the Mande-speaking heartland and surrounding grassland. Mali
      continued in this diminished state until the late seventeenth century, by which time most non-Malinke people
     had asserted their independence and reverted to rule by individual mansas.

stretched from Senegal-Gambia on the Atlantic coast in the west all the way to Kano in the Hausaland region of
present-day Nigeria in the southeast, and to the salt-mining trade center of Taghaza in the north. Founded by
Sunni Ali in the late fifteenth century, Songhai reached its imperial height under the founder of the Askia
dynasty, Muhammad Ture, a general and provisional governor who overthrew Sunni Ali's legitimate successor.

The Rise of Imperial Songhai

The earliest dynasty of kings of the Songhai state was the Za , which tradition and later historical records
suggest ruled the kingdom during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Tradition also holds that the first
fourteen rulers of the Songhai state, which was initially centered on Kukiya, approximately eighty miles
southeast of Gao, were jahiliyyah ("ignorant of God"); jahiliyyah is a word used by Muslims to describe the
ignorance of people before gaining knowledge of Islam. Sometime in the 1000s, the dynasty converted to
Islam, possibly under Za Kusay. It was also at some point during this period that the political focus of the
kingdom shifted from Kukiya to Gao.

As kola nuts, dates, ivory, salt, leather, enslaved people, and gold passed through the capital, traders and
merchants prospered. While a boon locally, the prosperity of Gao drew the attention of the new and
expansionistic West African kingdom of Mali, which annexed Gao around 1325. This was the heyday of
imperial Mali, and for the next century, its rulers profited from Gao's trade and collected taxes from its kings.

To learn more about the Songhai Empire, watch The Songhai Empire: Africa's Age of Gold
(https://openstax.org/l/77AgeofGold) and consider why it is called a cosmopolitan empire. What was unique
about Timbuktu?

The annexation of Gao greatly expanded the Malian Empire, but it did not last. Periodic rebellions by the
peoples of Timbuktu, Takedda, and Gao, coupled with invasions from the north, civil war, and a struggling
economy, caused Gao's Malian rulers to withdraw from the region in the 1430s. The leader of the Songhai
rebels at Gao, Sunni Ali, became the first king of the new Songhai Empire. From his capital at Gao, Sunni Ali
engaged in a war of conquest against his Muslim neighbors. Marshalling his massive cavalry and fleet of war
canoes, the king extended his empire into the desert in the north and as far as Djenné in the southwest. In the
late fifteenth century, his army pushed southward beyond the Niger and raided deep into the Volta River Basin,
encroaching on the territory of the Mossi, multiple linguistic groups whose cultures differed but who were
loosely connected politically.

In 1468, Sunni Ali sacked Timbuktu. He drove its Amazigh governor from the city, killed many of its scholars,
and forced others into exile. Sunni Ali's conquest of Timbuktu earned him a reputation as a butcher and a
tyrant. "He perpetuated terrible wickedness in the city, putting it to flame, sacking it, and killing large numbers
of people," one chronicler from Timbuktu recorded. Sunni Ali's assault on the scholarly community at
Timbuktu prompted the survivors' exodus to Oualata, leading to a significant decline in Islamic scholarship at
Timbuktu. Many of the merchants who had thrived under the city's Tuareg overlords also fled. As a result, the
city slipped into a period of economic decline and did not recover until after Sunni Ali's death.

It was not enough for Sunni Ali to capture Timbuktu. Securing the vital corridor of trade along the growing
Songhai Empire's western frontier also required capturing the southern trading center of Djenné, a long-
standing point of exchange for caravans carrying salt, gold, and enslaved Africans bound for the Atlantic or
trans-Saharan slave trades. Sunni Ali attempted to capture Djenné for several years, but the fact that the city
was surrounded by water during the annual flooding of the Bani River made the task impossible. Only after a
seven-month siege was he finally able to subdue the city, which surrendered in 1473.

In contrast to his harsh actions at Timbuktu, Sunni Ali accommodated the community of Muslim scholars at
Djenné, where they remained great preservers of Islamic learning and continued to produce work on Islamic
86 3 · Early Modern Africa and the Wider World

      philosophy and the sciences through the seventeenth century. The mosque and university had thousands of
      teachers and students who mastered a wide range of subjects, including Islamic law, astronomy, math, and
      philosophy (Figure 3.10).

     The Reign of Askia the Great

      On the death of Sunni Ali in 1492, his son Sonni Baru came to the throne but reigned less than a year.
      Muhammad Ture, one of Sunni Ali's generals and provincial governors, challenged Sonni Baru, and when the
      two met in battle in April 1493, Sonni Baru was defeated. Muhammad Ture then usurped the throne and took
      power as Askia Muhammad, later known as Askia the Great. His reign marked the beginning of the Askia
      dynasty.
      Askia the Great strengthened the Songhai Empire and made it the largest in West Africa's history by adding
      tributary lands to the east and to the west. At its height, the Songhai Empire stretched from Kano in Hausaland
      in the southeast (present-day Nigeria) to Taghaza with its valuable salt mines in the north, and modern-day
      Senegal on the Atlantic coast (Figure 3.11). One of Askia's primary objectives was to control access to the major
     trade routes across the Sahara. His success in doing so was rapid: by 1512, it is chronicled that even the mansa
      of Mali was paying tribute to Askia.

Mali. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
Askia the Great also transformed the nature of Songhai rulership. Under Sunni Ali, Songhai administration at
the provincial level had been left in the hands of traditional rulers. Askia abandoned this model in favor of
designating royal family members or trusted servants. As appointees of the king, these provincial governors
were entirely dependent on the ruler and had to remain in his favor. The governors were invested with a great
deal of authority, however; they could, for example, raise their own armies to collect local taxes. Abandoning
the use of traditional rulers had the effect of strengthening the centralizing tendency of the state under Sunni
Ali. Whereas before such provincial officials might take advantage of dynastic struggles to assert their
authority and form a breakaway region or state, the placement of royally appointed officials closely aligned
with the king dramatically curtailed this risk. That the state remained intact despite frequent dynastic
struggles during Askia's later reign speaks to the success of this policy.
Islam was crucial to Askia the Great's consolidation of control. Not ethnically Songhai and thus unable to rely
on traditional institutions and rituals to legitimate his rule, Askia instead based his authority on Islam and
quickly set out to establish Songhai as a Muslim kingdom. In 1498, he declared a holy war against the non-
Muslim Mossi to justify his incursions into their territory. He also recognized the importance of Islam to trans-
Saharan trade and used his post-accession pilgrimage to Mecca to advertise his concern for the faith. During
his stopover in Cairo, Askia convinced Egypt's caliph, its spiritual and secular leader, to recognize him as
caliph of the whole of Sudan. While in Mecca he spent lavishly, contributing some 100,000 gold pieces to
charity and related almsgiving programs. He did not force his subjects to convert, however, and most retained
their traditional religious beliefs.

  Muhammad, is a written rendition of a tale told by a griot (a West African oral historian, poet, musician,
  storyteller, and praise-singer) and describes how Askia the Great established his empire. In the excerpt, Askia
  Muhammed is told how he can repent for having killed his uncle. The second excerpt is from Leo Africanus's

              Here are very rich merchants and to here journey continually large numbers of blacks who purchase
              here cloth from Barbary [North Africa] and Europe. . . . Here also is a certain place where slaves are sold,
              especially upon those days when merchants assemble. A young slave of fifteen years of age is sold for
              six ducats [gold coins] and children are also sold.

              The king of this region has a certain private palace in which he keeps a large number of concubines and
              slaves, who are watched by eunuchs. To guard his person he maintains a sufficient troop of horsemen
              and foot soldiers. Between the first gate of the palace and the inner part, there is a walled enclosure
              wherein the king personally decides all of his subjects' controversies. Although the king is most diligent
              in this regard and conducts all business in these matters, he has in his company counsellors and such
              other officers as his secretaries, treasurers, stewards and auditors.

              It is a wonder to see the quality of merchandise that is daily brought here and how costly and
              sumptuous everything is. . . .

              The rest of this kingdom contains nothing but villages and hamlets inhabited by herdsmen and

              had mighty troops of horsemen at his command; but he has since been constrained to pay tribute unto
              the kings of Zegzeg and Casena. Afterward Askiya the king of Timbuktu [Songhay] feigning friendship
              treacherously slew them both. And then he waged war against the king of Kano, whom after a long siege
              he took, and compelled him to marry one of his daughters, restoring him again to his kingdom,
              conditionally that he should pay unto him the third part of all his tribute [taxes]: and the said king of
              Timbuktu has some of his courtiers perpetually residing at Kano for the receit [receiving] thereof.

    · How do the two accounts differ in their description of Askia the Great?
    · According to these accounts, how did Askia establish and maintain power in his empire?
    · Would you consider Askia the Great to have been a strong ruler? Would you consider him to have been a

        benevolent ruler? Why or why not?

Askia the Great extended his territory deeper into the desert through military conquest. The advance of
Songhai's army forced the Tuareg nomads to flee, which allowed the Songhai to capture the salt-producing
center of Taghaza in the north. Askia did more to regulate trans-Saharan trade than any of his predecessors.
He not only introduced the use of standardized weights and measures but also employed trade inspectors at
each of the empire's major trade centers. The Hausaland kingdoms recognized the revival of trade under the
Songhai and its benefits and so came into the orbit of the Songhai Empire's broader trading network.
The primary sources of the Songhai Empire's wealth continued to be agricultural production centered on the
Niger floodplain and taxes on trade goods, especially gold and salt, both of which had also been key to the
economy of the Mali Empire. Salt remained Songhai's currency for external trade, while cowrie shells were
used for internal trade (Figure 3.12). Cowrie shells were imported from the Indian Ocean. They were thus
relatively scarce and could not be counterfeited. Gold remained the primary good transported along the trans-
Saharan trade routes, but enslaved captives and kola nuts were also exported. The empire imported a variety
of goods, including Saharan salt, luxury goods, horses, and cloth.

societies. Cowrie shells served a similar function in South Asia and East Asia. This shell was found with an Egyptian
mummy from the fourth century BCE. (credit: modification of work "Cowrie shell" by Metropolitan Museum of Art/

Timbuktu, which had been destroyed by Sunni Ali, revived during the rule of Askia the Great. Leo Africanus
observed that the city was a prosperous one filled with artisans and wealthy merchants as well as many
enslaved people. According to his sixteenth-century account, in Timbuktu there were "great numbers of
religious teachers, judges, scholars and other learned persons, who are bountifully maintained at the king's
expense. Here too are brought various manuscripts or written books from Barbary, which are sold for more
money than any other merchandise." By the mid-sixteenth century, public libraries had been established, and
scribes and calligraphers had been hired to copy books (Figure 3.13). As Islamic scholarship once again
flourished at Timbuktu, so too did higher learning. Students engaged in multiple tutorials in various fields of
study with Islamic scholars and, when they achieved mastery of these subjects, went on to become teachers

      themselves.

     The Decline of Songhai

      Under Askia the Great, the Songhai Empire flourished. Religious scholars and poets flocked to cities like
      Timbuktu and Djenné. Islam became more widely practiced. The state embarked on an ambitious
      infrastructure development scheme, including the construction of canals to enhance agricultural production.
      Trans-Saharan trade thrived. However, as Askia grew older, his personal power declined, and he relied heavily
      on his palace officials to manage the affairs of the empire. This alienated his family members, who grew
      resentful of the power of Askia's head chamberlain, Ali Fulan.
      In 1528 Askia's sons revolted, deposed him, and declared one of the brothers, Musa, king. Askia Musa's
      accession was not smooth, however, and civil war erupted. As Askia Musa waged battle against his kin to retain
      his position, dozens of his relatives were killed. Musa himself fell victim to this strife and was killed by his
      brothers in 1531, deepening the crisis and further destabilizing the state. As successive rulers' attempts at
      governing the empire failed, political chaos consumed the ruling class and military as they vied for control.
      Without effective administration from the center, Songhai weakened, and external groups began eyeing an
      opportunity to intervene and seize control of the lucrative trans-Saharan trade in salt and gold. This was

particularly the case for the Saadi dynasty of Morocco.

In 1578, the Saadi had repulsed an invasion by the Portuguese, but only at an enormous cost, draining the
imperial coffers. To stave off bankruptcy, Sultan Ahmad I al-Mansur Saadi cast about for new resources. All this
unfolded just as a sense of stability and calm had returned to Songhai under the reign of Askia Ishaq II, which
began in 1588. However, this revival of Songhai's fortunes proved short-lived; the Saadi invaded in 1591.
Although it was greatly outnumbered by the forces of Songhai, the Saadi army had an insurmountable
advantage: a stockpile of guns, ammunition, and cannon supplied by Queen Elizabeth I of England, who hoped
to make Morocco an ally against Spain. The Saadi army also contained many Spanish Muslims. In 1502, the
Spanish monarchs had ordered all Muslims in Spain to convert to Christianity, and many Muslims had fled the
country. Outmatched, the larger Songhai army was defeated at the Battle of Tondibi, and Askia Ishaq II was
killed.

Following their victory on the battlefield, the commander of the Saadi army, an enslaved Spanish eunuch
named Judar Pasha, moved on the key cities and trading centers of the empire. The Saadi sacked and pillaged
Djenné, Gao, and Timbuktu, burning them to the ground. To seal their victory, the invaders filled in water wells
and destroyed fields of crops. They spared few, not even women and children. The Songhai Empire's power
was rendered ineffective after the looting and destruction of these cities. A decade later, the empire was
shattered, its provinces divided into several smaller kingdoms and territories.

3.3 The Swahili Coast

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain how geography and climate contributed to the growth of trade along the Swahili coast
  · Identify the major commodities traded along the Swahili coast
  · Analyze the role of the slave trade in city-states along the Swahili coast
  · Describe the significance of Kilwa and Zanzibar to Indian Ocean trade

Not all of Africa's trade traversed the Sahara. The east coast of Africa was home to wealthy city-states that
engaged in oceanic trade with the Arabian Peninsula, India, and places farther east. Just as the cities of
Songhai linked sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa and the Mediterranean by means of trade, the African ports
on the Indian Ocean connected Africa to South and East Asia. These city-states were important hubs in the
trade between East and West and made some of the world's most desirable products available to people on
three continents.

The Rise of the Swahili City-States

Starting in the seventh century, settlements on the coast of East Africa began to participate in Indian Ocean
trade. Geographically, the area was well suited for oceanic trade. In the summer, the prevailing winds blew
sailing ships northeast toward the coast of India, and winter winds blew them in the opposite direction. A
seasonal trade thus developed, and trading ports grew. The standard ship of the region, called a dhow, was a
vessel made of coconut-wood planks sewn together with coconut fiber. It bore a triangular-shaped lateen sail,
which was perfectly designed to enable ships to sail both with and into the wind (Figure 3.14). However, dhows
were unable to ride the rougher waves near the southern tip of the African continent, and this limitation,
together with the fact that the monsoon winds grew weaker the farther south they went, kept trading ports
from extending the full length of the African coast.

      shows a dhow with lateen sails. Ships of this type carried the trade of the Swahili coast. (credit: "Aden half-anna
      stamp of 1937" by Unknown/Stan Shebs/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
      In the eighth century, Arab Muslim merchants began to settle permanently in the region and often
      intermarried with the African Bantu peoples who lived in the area. Marrying Bantu women enabled Arab
      merchants to sink roots in African coastal communities, and their wives' families helped them both establish
      commercial contacts and transact trade while they were away. In the twelfth century, large numbers of
      Persians settled on the East African coast as well. Their city-states, inhabited primarily by merchants and
      artisans, grew in size until a number of large port cities extended southward along the coast from what is now
      Somalia: Mogadishu, Barawa, Mombasa, Malindi, Pemba, Zanzibar, Kilwa, Sofala, and others (Figure 3.15).
      Some of the cities were built on islands, which made it easier for them to engage in maritime trade. The people
      of the coast came to speak Swahili, which combined the grammar of African Bantu languages with a Bantu and
      Arabic vocabulary. This common language enabled people from a wide variety of ethnic groups to trade with
      one another.

The Bantu people who lived along the coast of East Africa converted to Islam over the course of a few centuries.
Sharing a religion made it easier for them to interact with the Arab and Persian merchants and sailors who
inhabited cities on the coast of East Africa, as well as with Muslim merchants in North Africa, on the Arabian
Peninsula, and in India. Mosques and religious schools were built. The first mosques were built in the ninth
century. The version of Islam practiced by the people of the Swahili coast, however, made concessions to the
pre-Islamic practices of several of the area's African societies. In this syncretic version of Islam, ancestor
veneration continued, for example, as did the use of magical rituals to drive away spirits believed to cause
illness. Women also retained a higher status than they did in other Muslim societies, such as Persia.
A large variety of products were traded in the cities of the Swahili coast: gold, iron, copper, salt, valuable
hardwoods such as ebony and sandalwood, ivory, tortoise shells for making decorative objects like combs, and
animal hides. These goods were brought overland across trade routes from the African interior and then were
either purchased by the cities' inhabitants for their own use or resold elsewhere in Africa or in Arabia, Persia,
and India. From these places, the goods might travel even farther to Southeast Asia or China. Artisans in the
cities crafted pottery and wove cloth that became part of the trade too and were sold in Africa or overseas. The
goods of Asia also flowed into these cities, and the elites of the Swahili coast adorned themselves with glass
94 3 · Early Modern Africa and the Wider World

      beads from India, dressed in Chinese silks, and ate from Chinese porcelain. Some merchants embedded pieces
      of porcelain in the walls of their homes for decoration.

     Slavery on the Swahili Coast

      Enslaved people were also traded in the markets of East Africa, especially on the island of Zanzibar. East
      African societies such as the Yao, the Marava, and the Makua regularly made war upon one another and seized
      captives for sale. People captured in the interior were marched to the Swahili coast and held there until buyers
      for them could be found, although starvation, exhaustion, and disease killed nearly three-quarters before they
      could be sold. The primary buyers were Arab Muslims who wanted laborers but were not allowed to enslave
      fellow Muslims. Most of the enslaved Africans were destined for the Arabian Peninsula and elsewhere in the
      Middle East or North Africa, there to work as domestic servants or perform other types of labor. Some were
      sold as far away from their homes as India or China. Women and children were preferred for household
      service, but men might find themselves forced into service as soldiers, sailors, or agricultural workers.
      By the seventeenth century, the slave trade on the Swahili coast had assumed enormous proportions, with an
      influx of traders from Oman on the Arabian Peninsula. This growth was due partly to the rise in power of
      European states, which prevented Muslims from capturing and enslaving people from Eastern Europe as they
      had often done in earlier centuries. Between the beginning and the end of the seventeenth century, the
      number of enslaved people sold on the Swahili coast quadrupled from roughly one thousand to four thousand
      per year. Some scholars report that twice that number were sold.
      The activities of European slave traders, who arrived in the region beginning in the seventeenth century,
      quickly dwarfed those of the Muslim slavers. The Dutch East India Company purchased approximately half a
      million enslaved people in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to work in Dutch colonies in the Indian
      Ocean. The Portuguese purchased enslaved people from the island of Mozambique from the sixteenth to the
      early nineteenth centuries (Figure 3.16). The French enslaved more than one hundred thousand people in
      their Indian Ocean colonies of Réunion, Mauritius, and the Mascarene Islands, of which they took control in the
      eighteenth century. Even after Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807 and sent its ships to patrol the Indian
      Ocean to halt other countries' participation in the trade, the sale of enslaved people continued. People from
      East Africa were also sold into slavery in the Americas.

The Contest for the Swahili Coast

Kilwa, located on an island off the coast of what is now Tanzania, was the most powerful of the city-states of the
Swahili coast. According to legend, it was founded in the tenth century by Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi, the son of a
Persian noble and an enslaved Ethiopian woman. Ali supposedly settled the island after purchasing it from a
local Bantu king. Kilwa's location on an island made it better suited to engaging in the Indian Ocean trade than
its rival city to the north, Mogadishu in today's Somalia, and numerous Arab and Persian merchants came to
settle in it.
In the 1180s, the ruler of Kilwa gained control of the port city of Sofala, on the African mainland in what is now
Mozambique. Gold from the mines of the Kingdom of Mutapa flowed through Sofala, making it both wealthy
and powerful. Control of Sofala enabled the sultan of Kilwa to escape the dominance of Mogadishu, formerly
the most powerful city on the East African coast. The gold also allowed Kilwa to establish or assume control of
other cities and island states in East Africa, including Mombasa, Pemba, Mafia, Mozambique, Malindi,
Imhambane, Comoro, and Zanzibar.

        actually lived in Sofala. The city's marshy environment provided an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, and
        many Portuguese contracted malaria.

          · Why do you think the artists chose to depict it as they have?

      In the early sixteenth century, Portugal attempted to seize the wealth of the Swahili coast, aided by internal
      dissent within the Sultanate of Kilwa. In 1495, Kilwa's Emir Muhammad, the chief administrator of the city-
      state, had placed al-Fudail ibn Suleiman on the sultan's throne. Shortly thereafter, Emir Muhammad died, and
      his successor Emir Ibrahim engineered the assassination of al-Fudail ibn Suleiman. Emir Ibrahim then seized
      power for himself, claiming to rule on behalf of an absent prince. The rulers of several cities within the Kilwa
      Sultanate were not willing to accept Ibrahim as their overlord, however, and regarded the Portuguese as
      potential allies in their attempts to claim their independence. The Sheikh of Malindi had already signed a trade
      agreement with Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, in 1498 in order to compete in trade with both Kilwa
      and the rival city of Mombasa. Sheikh Isuf, the ruler of Sofala, also signed an agreement with the Portuguese in
      1502 in hopes of breaking free of Kilwa's dominance. The Swahili coast city-states had long been trade rivals,
      and their history of competition with one another prevented them from unifying in the face of the threat of
      Portuguese domination.

Although counselors had encouraged Emir Ibrahim to agree to trade with the Portuguese, he initially rebuffed
them. In 1505, Francisco de Almeida, another Portuguese explorer, landed five hundred Portuguese soldiers
on the island of Kilwa and replaced Emir Ibrahim with a Kilwan aristocrat called Muhammad Arcone, who was
more amenable to dealing with the Portuguese. The following year, Muhammad Arcone was assassinated by
supporters of Emir Ibrahim and succeeded by a ruler whom they favored. Fearing that the new Sultan Micante
would not be easy to control, the Portuguese removed him from power and gave the throne to Arcone's son,
Hussein ibn Muhammad.

Many Kilwans resented Portuguese interference in the governing of their city-state. They also disliked
Portugal's requirement that Kilwans ship goods only on Portuguese-owned ships, a practice that financially
harmed many Kilwan merchants. Supporters of Sultan Micante and embittered merchants rose up and did
battle in the streets with Portuguese soldiers and followers of Sultan Hussein. Residents fled the city as gangs
set fire to buildings. The Portuguese supported Hussein but also wisely chose to change the policy regarding
shipping, and gradually merchants returned to the city.

Portugal extended its control along the rest of the Swahili coast as well, establishing trading posts. Because the
coastal city-states had never before experienced attacks from the sea, their ports were not fortified and could
not easily defend against the Portuguese. The Portuguese were not interested in trading with East African
merchants on equal terms, and as they had in India, they looted and sank the ships of rival traders, most of
whom were Muslims. Many merchants left the region and moved northward, resulting in a decline in trade. On
the southern part of the coast, the Portuguese hoped to exploit the wealth of Mutapa and took control of the
kingdom in 1633, but the gold deposits were largely exhausted by this point, and their efforts to convert the
population to Roman Catholicism resulted in conflict. Some individual Portuguese did well, marrying African
women and receiving land and the right to trade from local African chiefs. For the most part, though, constant
conflict with city-states and the effects of tropical diseases such as malaria made it difficult for Portugal to
exploit the area.

Both the Ottomans and Somalis from the region of Mogadishu feared and resented Portuguese intrusion in
East Africa. Joint Somali-Ottoman attacks beginning in the second half of the 1500s wreaked havoc on
Portuguese efforts to control the region (Figure 3.19). These assaults were followed in the 1650s by attacks by
the Omani Sultanate. Portugal had established control over the coast of Oman in 1507. However, in the 1650s,
the Omani tribes united to drive the Portuguese out, and soon they began to challenge the Portuguese in East
Africa as well. In 1698, Fort Jesus, the Portuguese garrison at Mombasa, fell to Omani forces. (Fort Jesus is now
a UNESCO World Heritage site.) Soon thereafter, Portugal lost control of all its remaining colonies on the
Swahili coast except Mozambique. The Omani Sultanate had brought the Portuguese attempt to dominate the
region to an end.

      With the arrival of the Omanis, the city-state of Zanzibar grew to even greater prominence. The Omanis
      continued the profitable slave trade as well as the thriving trade in elephant ivory that had long been part of
      Zanzibar's economy. Land on the island was redistributed to Omani Arabs, and spice plantations growing
      primarily cloves were established, earning Zanzibar and the surrounding islands the nickname of Africa's
      Spice Islands.

    3.4 The Trans-Saharan Slave Trade

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe the emergence of Kanem-Bornu as a major slave-trading society
        · Explain the effect of the arrival of Europeans on the trans-Saharan slave trade
        · Analyze how the slave trade affected the trans-Saharan trade network in West Africa
      The sale of enslaved people had been a constant feature of African trade since its earliest days, and over time it
      became a key component in the continent-spanning network. For some kingdoms, economic well-being
      depended on the traffic in human cargo. But this trade also required a near-constant state of warfare and
      conflict, which had the effect of destabilizing certain regions, particularly around the Central Sudan. Then the
      advent of Europe's age of discovery and exploration in the fifteenth century transformed the nature of the slave
      trade in Africa. The wealth of Portugal, Spain, England, France, and the Netherlands--along with their firearms
      and manufactured goods--appealed to many West African polities, particularly those that emerged along the
      Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic coast following the decline of Songhai. These new states, such as Whydah and
      Dahomey, enriched themselves by providing the Europeans with captives, the vast majority of whom went to
      the Americas, in exchange for goods like guns. These developments altered the nature of society in Africa,
      militarizing states and reorienting African trade.

The Role of Kanem-Bornu

In about 900 CE, an empire called Kanem arose in the Central Sudan, located to the east of Ghana, Mali, and
Songhai, and confined initially to the northeast of Lake Chad. The accession of Humai I to the throne of Kanem
in 1087 marked the beginning of the Muslim Sefuwa dynasty. Around the same time, a fixed capital was
established at Njimi, east of Lake Chad. Over the course of the next century and a half, the mais (kings) of
Kanem established their control over the region. As in Ghana, the key to establishing and exercising this power
was control over the desert caravan routes (Figure 3.20).

FIGURE 3.20 Trans-Saharan Trade. Trans-Saharan trade routes (red dotted lines) were a key factor in the
development of the Kanem-Bornu Empire, which resulted from the expansion of the Kanem Empire south into Bornu
along the western shore of Lake Chad. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
It was under Dunama Dibbalemi in the thirteenth century that Kanem reached the height of its power and
influence. Commanding a cavalry force of some forty thousand, Mai Dunama II gained control of the Lake Chad
basin and extended the state's control over the trans-Saharan trade northward as far as the Fezzan (southern
Libya). Before the end of his reign, he established diplomatic relations with the kings of North Africa, especially
in Tunis, thus ensuring the safety of caravans journeying to the distant south from the Mediterranean coast.
This achievement guaranteed an increase in cross-Saharan traffic.
Although the Kanuri, the people of Kanem, mainly exported ivory and ostrich feathers, they also specialized in
the selling of captives to the Muslims of North Africa and later to Europeans, notably the Portuguese who paid
in guns and horses. The raids that produced these captives were justified in the name of jihad or holy war
against unbelievers, a practice that led to conflict between Kanem and its neighbors.
By the mid-thirteenth century, Kanem dominated the Central Sudan. The empire extended as far west as the
Niger River, as far east as the Wadai Sultanate (in eastern Chad), and north to the Sahara Desert. Crowning the
Kanuris' achievement during this period was the establishment of a tributary state in Bornu, southwest of Lake
Chad. Over the course of the next century, however, Kanem became overstretched and weakened by wars and
quarrels over succession, notably between the ruling Muslim Sefuwa dynasty, its sons, and the non-Muslim
Bulala pastoralists east of Lake Chad.
Between 1376 and 1400, the rebellious Bulala, who opposed the imposition of strict Islamic rule under the
Sefuwa, managed to assassinate five of the six Sefuwa kings. The result of this strife was a destabilized empire,
100 3 · Early Modern Africa and the Wider World

       which forced Mai Umar ibn Idris to abandon the capital at Njimi altogether. He led many of the empire's Kanuri
       to Bornu, in the savanna region on the western shore of Lake Chad, where they permanently settled (Figure
       3.21). Bornu was better situated to give the kings of the Sefuwa dynasty access to a wider trading network, and
       it already had established vital trading links with the Hausa kingdoms to the west.

       FIGURE 3.21 Kanem-Bornu. The kingdom of Kanem-Bornu was less a kingdom than the conjoining of two city-
       states, Kanem and Bornu. The longest-lived of all the African kingdoms, Kanem-Bornu depended primarily on trade
       in the enslaved, whom it acquired by raiding neighboring states. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax,
       under CC BY 4.0 license)
       The early decades of the sixteenth century witnessed a revitalization of the Sefuwa dynasty. Under Mai Idris
       Katakarmabe, who ruled from 1507 to 1529, the Sefuwa were able to defeat the Bulala. The Sefuwa also
       strengthened their grip on the people of Bornu as they entrenched their rule, prompting a series of internal
       revolts by the non-Muslim peasant population that they ruthlessly suppressed. The dynasty established firm
       control over the peasants of Bornu who, once they submitted to Islam, were no longer subjected to raids.
       The prosperity of Kanem-Bornu was tied to the trans-Saharan trade in enslaved people destined for the
       markets of North Africa and the Atlantic coast. By the end of the fifteenth century, Kanem-Bornu was trading
       about five thousand captives annually. During the second half of the sixteenth century, Mai Idris Aloma
       strengthened his army by importing firearms from North Africa. While the Songhai army failed to modernize,
       the rulers of Kanem-Bornu established strong relations with the Ottoman Empire in North Africa and gained
       access to Turkish mercenaries and advisers, who were brought in to train their new army (Figure 3.22). These
       changes, combined with the empire's position on the frontier of Islam in Central Sudan, enabled it to make
       deeper slave-raiding incursions against its non-Muslim neighbors.

Earth and Its Inhabitants, published in Europe in the 1890s. (credit: "Group of Kanem-Bu warriors" by New York

Kanem-Bornu peaked under Aloma, whose administrative and military reforms survived to sustain the empire
for more than one hundred years. By the end of the sixteenth century, however, the empire's power had begun
to fade. A century later, the state's capacity to maintain its territorial integrity had diminished so severely that
the king's rule extended effectively only westward, into Hausaland (present-day northern Nigeria). In the space
of a hundred years, Fulani from West Africa had made significant inroads against Bornu, and in 1808, they
seized the capital of Ngazargamu. The last Sefuwa king was killed in 1846, but Africa's longest-lived empire
managed to continue under new rulers until nearly the end of the nineteenth century.

The Arrival of Europeans

Europeans had long known that there were three ancient trade routes through the Saharan Desert. In the
western Sahara, the route ran from Taghaza to Timbuktu. Farther east, a second route connected the oasis
town of Ghadames with trade centers in Hausaland. Finally, there was a route connecting the major
Mediterranean port city of Tripoli with Bornu in the Central African interior. Centuries of caravan trade along
these routes had not, however, made them any less hazardous. Thus, those who knew the routes and the
location of key cities and oases, and who appreciated the inherent risks of Saharan weather patterns, were in
the best position to control and profit from trans-Saharan trade. It was therefore in the best interest of the
Muslim and Arab travelers and caravanners who possessed this knowledge to monopolize it. To share it would
undercut their profits. Consequently, European maps of the African interior remained sketchy; distances were
mere estimates, and the locations of important cities such as Timbuktu and Kano were a matter of guesswork.
Add to this the threat of raids and the possibility of a hostile merchant population, and to Europeans the
undertaking of a trans-Saharan journey by themselves seemed likely to be disastrous.
In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, however, pressures mounted on European powers to boost their
sources of national wealth--an urgency inflamed by the discovery of the Americas and the expense of traveling
and setting up competing colonies there. Increasingly, European states desired to circumvent the
102 3 · Early Modern Africa and the Wider World

       intermediaries who controlled the trade in exotic luxury goods and vital raw materials, such as Chinese silk,
       Indonesian spices, and African gold. It was no easy matter to wrest control from these merchants, whose
       monopolies were often supported by kingdoms and states that benefited from it. The challenge was quite
       severe for poorer European states, such as Portugal.

       When the Portuguese began their voyages along the West African coast, their immediate goal was not to
       discover a new trading route to India; rather, it was to secure West African gold. Europeans had been aware of
       the region's goldfields since the fourteenth century, when Sudanic gold had been imported as a raw material to
       mint European coins. By the mid-fifteenth century, the Portuguese had made inroads along the Senegambian
       coast, raiding Amazigh settlements on the island of Arguin (an extension of the trans-Saharan trade routes),
       taking captives to be enslaved on Iberian plantations, and exploring along the Senegal and Gambia Rivers in
       search of sources of gold. These ventures mark some of the earliest attempts at direct European involvement
       in trans-Saharan trade.

       The Portuguese monarchy also hired explorers such as Alvise Cadamosto, a Venetian slaver sent to scout the
       region of Senegambia. These efforts gave the Portuguese an opportunity to develop a clearer sense of the scope
       of trans-Saharan trade, including interactions with the Wolof, who sold enslaved people along the interior
       trade routes in West Africa. A few decades after Cadamosto had met the vassal kings of Mali in the Gambia
       region, the Portuguese established Elmina ("the mine"), a fort on the African coast south of the Akan goldfields.
       Located in present-day Ghana, Elmina was a fortified trading post from which the Portuguese traded copper,
       brass, and cloth with Africans for Akan gold. The mines at Akan also relied on enslaved workers, whom the
       Portuguese bought from Benin and then sold to Mande-speaking Dyula traders. By the turn of the sixteenth
       century, the Portuguese had also entered West Africa's cowrie-shell currency market, providing shells along
       with luxury goods to the regional market in exchange for still more gold. Progressively, they diverted traffic
       away from the centuries-old trans-Saharan trade routes and along the West African coast.

       The Portuguese first laid eyes on São Tomé and Príncipe, a pair of islands in the Gulf of Guinea, in the 1470s.
       By 1500, they had successfully settled both, which were prized for their strategic location off the West African
       coast and for their tropical climate and volcanic soil, ideal for planting and harvesting sugar. It was not long
       before large-scale sugar plantations sprang up on the islands and the Portuguese entrenched themselves in
       the Gulf of Guinea. The production of sugar is a notoriously labor-intensive process and requires a huge
       workforce. African chiefdoms and coastal intermediaries had demonstrated to the Portuguese their
       willingness to sell captives whom the Europeans could enslave as laborers where needed. Indeed, as the
       plantation economy on São Tomé expanded, its need for slave labor grew. By the early sixteenth century, the
       island was Europe's single largest sugar supplier and home to a vast enslaved workforce, which the settlers
       obtained from Elmina.

       Less than forty years elapsed between the Portuguese settlement of São Tomé and Príncipe and the first trans-
       Atlantic voyages of African captives who were sold into slavery in the Americas. Recognizing an opportunity to
       profit, chiefs on the African mainland engaged in raids against their neighbors to generate captives they could
       sell to the Europeans--first to the Portuguese and later to the Dutch, Spanish, French, and English. As
       competition rose among the European powers to establish trading posts along the West African coast, tensions
       flared among African polities as they either engaged in or resisted the growing trade in enslaved people.

       Then, when Songhai, the largest and most powerful of the Sudanic kingdoms in the sixteenth century, was
       shattered by the Moroccan army at the Battle of Tondibi (1591), the situation in West Africa was permanently
       altered. Without a powerful central authority, a host of small states emerged whose chiefs saw the benefits of
       dealing directly with wealthy Europeans rather than through the centuries-old system of caravan trade. These
       developments resulted in a dramatic change in the size and scope of the trade in enslaved Africans, from a few
       thousand people in the sixteenth century to tens of thousands in the seventeenth, and for much of the next
       century, an average of about forty-five thousand people per year.

The Later Trans-Saharan Slave Trade

Africa was transformed during the eighteenth century. This period witnessed the emergence of expansionist
new states in West Africa, such as Dahomey and Segou, whose wars of conquest generated captives for
European slavers. It also saw a sharp rise in conflict between African states and related growth in the trade in
enslaved captives. Such growth came at the expense of the historical trans-Saharan trade network, which was
disrupted and reoriented to prioritize the traffic in captive human cargo destined for coastal slave markets.
While the overall numbers varied by location, the general trend was an increase in the number of captives
being moved along the trans-Saharan corridors during the eighteenth century. This trade did more than
benefit merchants; in many instances, it provided a boon to businesses and firms related to the slave trade that
were located at trans-Saharan trading centers. The societies as a whole did not benefit, however, nor did the
people who were enslaved. As a result of this altered state of affairs, the scope of the trans-Saharan trade in
enslaved people doubled between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to an estimated 900,000 enslaved
people.

The development of the trading state of Whydah provides a unique window into these dynamics. Situated in
the Bight of Benin on the Gulf of Guinea, along what came to be called the Slave Coast, Whydah was
transformed with the arrival of the Europeans in West Africa in the fifteenth century (Figure 3.23). By the
seventeenth century, the French West India Company had moved its main trading site to Whydah, making it
one of the region's most important slave ports, second only to Luanda in Angola. By the end of the century, the
Dutch West India Company, the English Royal African Company, and the Portuguese all had moved their slave
markets to Whydah. Several of these European powers went on to establish coastal trading forts there.
Between 1650 and 1690, the number of captives brought to Whydah in caravans increased dramatically, from
about one thousand people per year to about ten thousand. It is estimated that in the quarter-century between
1700 and 1725, fully a third of all captives coming from Africa--approximately 378,000 of them--were taken
out of Whydah.
104 3 · Early Modern Africa and the Wider World

       FIGURE 3.23 Crowning a King on the Slave Coast. The kings of Whydah had a very close relationship with the
       European slavers who established trading centers along the Gulf of Guinea. In this French etching from about 1725,
       a new king is crowned before an audience that includes Europeans. (credit: "Coronation ceremony for the King of
       Whydah" by Gallica/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Whydah's flourishing trade in enslaved people did not result from wars waged by its own rulers, but from its
       location at the end point of trade routes between battling factions. One route originated from the former Mali
       Empire. Some captives from there wore Muslim clothing and had been in transit for three months before
       arriving in Whydah. Another route originated in the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo, which was engaged in a series of
       wars against the neighboring kingdoms of Nupe and Borgu. The value of enslaved captives passing through
       Whydah was enormous, and the slave trade benefited both the African slave merchants and the state, which
       was entitled to customs duties and taxes. From providing porterage services to supplying food and other
       necessities that made the trade possible, local businesses also profited from the sale of enslaved people. As
       elsewhere, the transport and sale of captives into slavery produced a profitable economy for virtually everyone
       involved, except for the enslaved people.
       In 1727, King Agaja of Dahomey conquered the kingdom of Whydah and incorporated it into his own (Figure
       3.24). The fall of Whydah was part of a larger campaign by Agaja to restore traditional social and political
       controls over the region, which was then home to several smaller Aja kingdoms including Dahomey. By 1737,
       Agaja had conquered the entire Slave Coast and brought it under Dahomey's control. However, initially
       Dahomey was reluctant to continue the practice of selling Africans to Europeans. This was not to the liking of
       the kingdom of Oyo, whose foreign trade depended on it. By the middle of the century, near-constant warfare
       against Oyo, which disrupted interior trade routes and hurt both kingdoms economically, convinced the rulers

of Dahomey to abandon their reluctance. They opted instead to exercise strict royal control over the Slave
Coast trade. Dahomey went on to become one of the major exporters of enslaved captives, which the state
traded in exchange for firearms. By the end of the century, Dahomey had become one of the most heavily
armed and militarized states in West Africa.

coastal region was known as the Slave Coast. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0

As Agaja and his successors extended their control over the Gulf of Guinea, the frontier of the slave trade on
the West African coast was pushed deeper into the African interior, beyond the kingdoms that ranged along the
Senegambia. It is estimated that well over half the captives taken and sold during the eighteenth century came
from the far interior, many from the Kingdom of Segou, located southwest of Djenné on the Middle Niger in
Mali.

               exacted of their manner of procuring them before they are suffered to pass. Sometimes indeed we sold
               slaves to them but they were only prisoners of war, or such among us as had been convicted of
               kidnapping, or adultery, and some other crimes which we esteemed heinous . . . .

               When our people go out to till their land they not only go in a body but generally take their arms with
               them for fear of a surprise, and when they apprehend an invasion they guard the avenues to their
               dwellings by driving sticks into the ground which are so sharp at one end as to pierce the foot and are
               generally [dipped] in poison. From what I can recollect of these battles, they appear to have been
               irruptions of one little state or district on the other, to obtain prisoners or booty. Perhaps they were
               incited to this by those traders who brought the European goods I mentioned among us . . . . Those
               prisoners which were not sold or redeemed we kept as slaves but how different was their condition from
               that of the slaves in the West Indies! With us they do no more work than other members of the
               community, even their master. Their food, clothing, and lodging were nearly the same as theirs, except
               that they were not permitted to eat with those who were free born, . . . Some of these slaves have even
               slaves under them as their own property and for their own use . . . .

               Generally, when the grown people in the neighborhood were gone far in the fields to labor, the children
               assembled together in some of the neighbors' premises to play, and commonly some of us used to get
               up a tree to look out for any assailant or kidnapper that might come upon us, for they sometimes took
               these opportunities of our parents' absence to attack and carry off as many as they could seize . . . .

           · According to Equiano, how did Africans come to be enslaved?
           · How common was it for Africans to enslave other Africans? How did Africans treat the people they enslaved?
           · What role did Europeans play in the trade?

       Founded by Mamari Kulubali in 1712, Segou made warfare a way of life. The Segou kingdom's economy was
       trade based, and its essential trade good was enslaved people the state acquired through raiding and warfare
       waged against its neighbors. These incursions reached as far as north as the Niger Bend and Timbuktu, which
       the Segou briefly occupied. Once captured, those seized by the Segou military faced two possible fates: they
       could be sold to desert nomads as part of the trans-Saharan slave trade, or they could be sold to caravan
       merchants who dealt with European slave traders on the Slave Coast.

       Although perhaps most pronounced in West Africa, the altered dynamics of trans-Saharan trade in enslaved
       people in the eighteenth century were also apparent in North Africa. Scholars have estimated that the
       Maghreb, encompassing Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, received an average of six thousand enslaved
       Africans every year between 1700 and 1799. About fourteen hundred enslaved people a year passed through
       Ghadames and the oases center of the Fezzan in Libya, both historically vital to the trans-Saharan trade
       between Central Sudan and Tripoli. But by midcentury, these centers--also the destination points for some
       caravans from West African trade centers such as Timbuktu--were sending larger caravans of captives to the
       markets at Tripoli. By the end of the eighteenth century, the numbers of the enslaved bound for market along
       the Mediterranean coast had increased by as much as a quarter, making the trade in enslaved Africans through
       Tripoli a key component of the region's economy.

Section Summary

3.1 The Roots of African Trade

Until the sixteenth century, caravans routinely plied the sands of the Sahara, moving goods, especially gold,
from distant West Africa to centers of trade in North Africa and Egypt. Towns in West Africa became
cosmopolitan stopping points, and as merchants, rulers, and caravan leaders converted to Islam for both
spiritual and financial reasons, Islam flourished alongside the caravan business. In the thirteenth century,
Sundiata Keita gained dominance over the Malinke and Soninke people, establishing the Malian Empire. Mali's
control of the Bure goldfields enabled it to prosper, and cities such as Timbuktu and Djenné became centers of
Islamic scholarship. The empire grew weaker following the death of Mansa Musa. It was unable to withstand
raids by the Mossi and Tuareg nomads or revolts by some of its subject cities. Although the rulers of Mali were
able to negotiate peace terms with Portuguese slave traders in the mid-fifteenth century, they were unable to
retain such vital trade centers as Gao, Timbuktu, and Djenné.

3.2 The Songhai Empire

The basis of the Songhai Empire's wealth was much the same as for the kingdoms that preceded it: salt, cloth,
and gold. Sunni Ali's program of annexation greatly expanded Songhai. Growth continued under his
successors, especially Askia the Great, who used Islam to further his control and brought Songhai into its
golden age. Not only did its rulers consolidate state control over trans-Saharan trade, but they also made the
empire an unparalleled center of Islamic learning and study in West Africa. The great cities of Timbuktu and
Djenné drew merchants and traders engaged in the caravan trade from across Africa, while their grand
mosques and schools made them magnets for pilgrims and scholars from across the Islamic world. Askia the
Great's successors could not maintain control of the empire, however, and in the sixteenth century, Songhai
was defeated by Saadi forces from Morocco seeking to gain control of the trans-Saharan caravan routes.

3.3 The Swahili Coast

City-states on the east coast of Africa grew in size and prosperity as they took advantage of wind patterns to
participate in Indian Ocean trade. Their people were united by a shared religion, Islam, and a shared language,
Swahili. Products from the interior of the African continent were sold by the Swahili traders to merchants from
Arabia, Persia, and India. In exchange, they purchased goods from India, Southeast Asia, and China. Enslaved
Africans were also sold in the Swahili city-states.

The most powerful of the states was Kilwa, which had grown wealthy through its control of the gold-rich city of
Sofala. When the Portuguese arrived in the late fifteenth century, they attempted to leverage the cities'
discontent with Kilwa's dominance to gain control of the region's trade, but a Somali-Ottoman alliance and the
Omani Sultanate ultimately drove them from all the city-states except Mozambique.

3.4 The Trans-Saharan Slave Trade

Kanem-Bornu, which dominated Central Sudan and maintained an active caravan trade with the states of
North Africa in the thirteenth century, was destabilized by revolts and rebellions in the fourteenth century.
Although it regained preeminence in the sixteenth century, by the end of that century, its power was at an end.
108 3 · Assessments

The collapse of both Songhai and Kanem-Bornu allowed emergent polities like Dahomey, Oyo, and Segou to
flourish, but tensions soon arose among them as competition for trade escalated. As warfare became
commonplace, trans-Saharan trade was severely disrupted.

At the same time, European powers such as Portugal began making steady inroads into African trade,
establishing trading posts along the coasts in regions like Whydah. By the eighteenth century, the European
demand for enslaved captives and the desire of African chiefs to exploit opportunities for financial gain
reoriented trans-Saharan trade away from traditional markets, such as those along the Mediterranean coast, to
coastal West Africa, with new emphasis on the acquisition and transport of captives. Many of the coastal states
became little more than arteries through which passed the caravans of captives destined for the markets of
European slavers.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

4.1 A Connected Islamic World
4.2 The Ottoman Empire
4.3 The Safavid Empire

INTRODUCTION In 1526, the Ottoman armies of Sultan Suleiman "the Magnificent" defeated the Hungarians
at the Battle of Mohacs, setting the stage for a showdown with the Habsburgs, the rulers of Austria, at Vienna. In
May 1529, Suleiman's army of approximately 100,000 soldiers set out from the Black Sea through the spring
rains for the culmination of Ottoman expansion into central Europe under his reign. Though somewhat
weakened by the loss of equipment to heavier-than-expected rain, they reached the walls of Vienna in
September and began the siege. Despite being greatly outnumbered, however, the Viennese defenders were
able to repulse each of the Ottoman advances (Figure 4.1).

Eventually, Suleiman was forced to admit defeat and retreat to Constantinople, the former capital of the
Byzantine Empire that was also commonly referred to as Istanbul (Greek for "to the city"). Although the 1529
siege of Vienna was a failure for the Ottomans, their bold move greatly alarmed kingdoms across Europe. It
also led Suleiman to direct his attention east toward Iran and control of Mesopotamia, areas he thought more
important for the security of his existing territory. By the end of his life in 1566, the Ottoman Empire was near
112 4 · The Islamic World

       the height of its power and territorial control. However, it was not the only large Muslim state to dominate
       Eurasia. The Safavids in Iran also expanded Islamic military, political, and economic power in the region we
       call the Middle East.

4.1 A Connected Islamic World

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the factors that characterized and often united the Muslim ummah after 1500
  · Explain the relationships among politics, religion, technology, and trade in the Islamic world after

      1500
  · Analyze the impact of Islamic political and legal institutions on the larger Muslim community
Beginning with its emergence during the life of the prophet Muhammad at the beginning of the seventh
century CE, the religion of Islam spread far and wide for several centuries and led to the establishment of
several caliphates, areas under the control of Muslim rulers called caliphs. Early expansion occurred largely
through conquests, such as those undertaken by the Prophet himself, the Rashidun Caliphate (the name given
to the rule of the four caliphs who succeeded Muhammad), and the Umayyad Caliphate, which emerged
decades after Muhammad's death and was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty based in Syria. These conquests
expanded the ummah, or the community of Muslims, into Iran, Spain, and the vast lands in between.
In 750, the Umayyad Caliphate succumbed to rebellion and gave way to the Abbasid Caliphate. This dynastic
transformation not only led to the elevation of Baghdad as the capital of the Abbasid world, but it also brought
with it a larger political division in the Islamic world. The Umayyads in Spain refused to recognize the new
Abbasid rulers and eventually established their own rival caliphate. In the centuries that followed, other parts
of the Islamic world did the same. By the year 1000, there were three rival caliphates: the Sunni Abbasids
ruling from Baghdad, the Shi`ite Fatimids ruling from Cairo, and a rival Sunni caliphate, the Umayyads, ruling
from Cordoba in Spain.
Over the next few centuries, a combination of trade and conquest expanded the ummah into West Africa and
India. The arrival of the Mongols in the thirteenth century resulted in increased expansion but also the end of
the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258. During the following few hundred years, the rise of the Ottoman Empire
brought a larger Islamic presence to southeastern Europe, and the Safavids came to power in Iran. (The land
114 4 · The Islamic World

       once called Persia became known as Iran during the Abbasid era, although foreigners still commonly referred
       to it as Persia until the twentieth century.) Steady Islamic trade in the Indian Ocean also expanded Islam into
       Southeast Asia. By 1500, the Islamic world was geographically expansive and politically, ethnically, and
       linguistically very diverse.

      Politics and Religion in the Ummah

       In the sixteenth century, the ummah was composed of a number of large and small Islamic empires and states.
       Among the large empires were the Mughal Empire of India (discussed in India and International Connections),
       the Safavid Empire of Iran, and the Ottoman Empire of the Mediterranean. There were many more small
       kingdoms in places like Morocco, Indonesia, the Swahili Coast, and parts of central Asia. However, despite this
       political fragmentation, the various parts of the larger Islamic world maintained an element of cohesiveness
       derived largely from their religion. Rival Islamic kingdoms might disagree with each other on issues of official
       doctrine or politics, but members of the ulama, a class of religious clerics and scholars who act as the primary
       interpreters of Islamic law, engaged in scholarly debates and collaborated with each other through
       correspondence. Shared basic beliefs and a reverence for the teachings of Muhammad united all Muslims.
       Religious and political institutions tended to maintain a similar structure and function in different locations:
       judges oversaw legal and religious disputes, and the ulama advised political rulers and ordinary citizens alike
       on policy by issuing nonbinding legal opinions called fatwas. In this way, the ulama helped unify the
       increasingly diverse Islamic world.
       Also helping to expand and unify Islam were communities of Islamic mystics called Sufis. Like mystics in other
       religions, Sufis engaged in ascetic practices, meditation, and ritual prayer in order to have a personal
       experience with God and directly gain access to divine love and wisdom. Often they used music, poetry, and
       dancing to transcend their connection to the world and enter a trance-like state in which they could
       experience the divine presence. Sufism began in the seventh century, during the Umayyad Caliphate. By the
       sixteenth century, Sufi orders had been established throughout the Islamic world. These orders, often
       described as "brotherhoods" even though some admitted women, formed around a leader who also served as
       the group's religious teacher. Sufis who achieved a special closeness with God were revered as saints, and their
       graves became sites of pilgrimage. Because Sufi practices often attracted the attention of ordinary people for
       whom complex theological treatises and abstruse legal debates held little interest, Sufis helped introduce
       Islam to places as far-flung as North and West Africa, central Asia, and India and served as missionaries of the
       expanding religion.
       Through a combination of imperial conquest, trade, Sufi missionary work, and migration, by 1500 the religion
       of Islam had expanded far and wide. As Muslims migrated to other lands, they usually established familiar
       Islamic religious institutions in their new communities. This provided a level of consistency for local people as
       well as for travelers, traders, and visitors. It also facilitated movement and exchange within the Islamic world
       and helped to unify Muslims as individual polities rose, fell, and were replaced. The result was a great
       geographic and ethnic diversity of the faith, and in places like India and Indonesia, new converts blended
       Islamic practices with indigenous traditions (Figure 4.4). Throughout the Islamic world, Arabic script was also
       adapted to write the local languages, such as Kurdish, Pashto, Urdu, and Punjabi.

Not everyone exposed to Islam or incorporated into the Islamic world adopted Islam. Many Christians in
southeastern Europe and southwest Asia continued to practice their religion within the larger Islamic
environment. The expansion of Islam into India occasionally invigorated Hinduism and other religions there.
While allowed to practice their religions, people in these non-Muslim communities granted protection by
Muslim rulers, called dhimmis, were required to acknowledge the sovereignty of Muslim leadership. The
dhimmi system was intended to provide religious minorities with official standing within the Muslim
community and grant them legal protection, but it usually also included some restrictions on their public lives,
such as their clothing choices, and it limited the jobs they could hold and thus their social mobility. The most
common hardship was the jizya, or poll tax (Figure 4.5).
116 4 · The Islamic World

       in Bulgaria have paid the jizya tax. (credit: "Jizya document Chokmanovo 1615" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons,
       Public Domain)
       Life was often harder for dhimmis than for Muslims of the same social class, and non-Muslims in many places
       converted to improve their social standing and chances for upward mobility. Merchants often converted to
       Islam to gain access to Islamic trading networks and potential business partners. Non-Muslim men seeking to
       marry Muslim women, whether for love or to gain connections to a prominent family, were required to convert.
       Christian and Jewish women could marry Muslim men without converting, but a Muslim woman could marry
       only a Muslim man.

      Islamic Trade Networks

       Islam had arisen in a region defined by trade and travel. Many prominent early Muslims, including
       Muhammad himself, were traders or members of trading families. And thanks to the institutional continuity
       specified under sharia, Islamic religious law, trade soon became closely regulated, the taxes levied on
       imported goods were systematized, and markets were inspected and administered in the same way
       throughout the Islamic world. By the sixteenth century, the flags of Islam flew from Spain and Morocco in the
       west to the gates of China in the east. However, these territories were not unified under one political leader.
       Instead, what brought them together into one collective ummah despite their political, ethnic, and linguistic
       differences was a network based on trade and travel, which carried Islam farther than its armies ever could.
       Trade routes crisscrossed the larger Islamic world, connecting far-flung regions. By sea, Muslim merchants
       traded from India and Southeast Asia (especially the country of Indonesia) to East Africa, Egypt, and the
       Arabian Peninsula. Muslims in central Asia and China traded overland with merchants in Iran, East and North
       Africa, and the Balkans. Caravans crossing the Sahara extended trade into West Africa. Along these trade
       routes traveled merchants, missionaries, scholars, and many others. Their movement facilitated not only the
       expansion of Islam but also the spread of languages like Arabic and Persian, which became the languages of
       commerce, scholarship, and literary expression. It also allowed for the flow and exchange of new technologies,

Dhimmi and other non-Muslim populations were frequently encouraged to participate in trade because of
their specializations and contacts in distant areas. Armenian Christians, for example, were heavily involved in
the silk trade, and their presence was welcomed in major trade centers. Jewish communities were linked by a
trade network they had established between Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Being
exempt from the financial provisions of sharia, which forbade charging interest on loans, Jewish people rose to
prominence as moneylenders and bankers, usually serving both Muslim and Christian clients. (Jewish law
forbade them to loan money at interest to other Jewish people.) And Muslims traveled and traded widely,
guided by Muhammad's often-cited hadith, or saying, "Seek knowledge, even unto China."
Islamic communities sprang up along the Silk Roads, the land routes between the Middle East and China, and
in other places where Muslim merchants traveled, such as East Africa, West Africa, and India. When
merchants established themselves in non-Muslim communities, they often intermarried with the local
population, and the children resulting from these marriages were usually raised as Muslims. Members of the
existing merchant community often converted to Islam to forge closer relationships with Muslim traders. Once
a Muslim community had been established, religious scholars often followed to found mosques, schools, and
charitable organizations. In this way, Islam spread throughout Asia, Africa, and the Balkans.
When merchants arrived in a new city, they usually selected a prayer leader, often a member of the ulama who
also served as a judge. A Muslim market inspector vouched for the accuracy of weights and measures, verified
business contracts between Muslim merchants, certified the sizes of loads being shipped out, and ensured that
businesses adhered to sharia. The consistency with which Muslim merchants and traders operated was a key
advantage of contracting with them to transport goods long distances. Another benefit was the widespread use
of letters of credit, which were recognized in other Islamic lands and allowed merchants to travel without
carrying large amounts of gold.
Trade earned profits for participating states in two ways. The first was by bringing in direct income from
importing and selling goods, including spices, ivory, salt, silks, and other luxury items, as well as enslaved
people. Given their central location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia, Muslim merchants frequently
acted as intermediaries who purchased goods from one area and sold them to merchants from another. The
second financial benefit of trade was the receipt of taxes that states levied on goods being transported through
their territory.
118 4 · The Islamic World

       Given the profit potential of the goods traded, robbers and bandits were a constant threat. Governments thus
       sponsored inns called caravansaries at regular intervals on major trade routes, usually one day's journey
       apart, where traders could rest and store their goods securely (Figure 4.7). Wealthy individuals might also
       build caravansaries, providing shelter for travelers as an act of piety. Weak states that could not guarantee
       security for traders and travelers often found trade routes shifting out of their territory if they became too
       risky.

       FIGURE 4.7 A Medieval Caravansary. This caravansary in Iran was built in the twelfth century and served as a
       fortified place for travelers to rest. Caravansaries were usually located far from urban centers in areas that were

       In addition to the shipment of material goods like agricultural products, precious metals, and spices, the
       transportation of enslaved people was also facilitated along Islamic trading routes. Since sharia forbids
       Muslims from enslaving other Muslims, it became common practice to enslave non-Muslims from regions
       within reach of Islamic slavers. Common sources included North and sub-Saharan Africa, central and eastern
       Europe, India, and Indonesia. Enslaved people being moved around the Islamic world were traded for a great
       variety of goods like cloth, pottery, glassware, and precious metals. Muslim traders also acted as
       intermediaries, passing enslaved people from Africa to merchants in central Asia and Europe, and they were
       the primary traders engaged in transporting enslaved people across the Sahara Desert (Figure 4.8).

Within the Islamic world, women outnumbered men among the enslaved two to one. Men were primarily
employed in domestic work or service within the estates of the rich, laboring on irrigation projects and in
mines or taking care of animals. Most women were kept in wealthy households, where they became domestic
servants such as nursemaids or were kept for sexual purposes. Although enslaved people did have legal
recourse if mistreated or abused, it was difficult for them to access the courts without the aid of a sympathetic
free person. There was no social stigma to prevent a slave owner from recognizing his children with an
enslaved woman; the children were born free, and the mother gained her freedom upon the death of her
owner.
Muhammad encouraged the freeing of enslaved people, and many Muslims did so. Enslaved men and women
were also allowed to purchase their own freedom. This, together with the fact that the children of enslaved
women and their owners were born free, meant that it was difficult to maintain a permanently enslaved
population in the Islamic world or to make the enslaved population self-reproducing. Those who sought to use
enslaved workers thus frequently needed to replenish their labor force by making new purchases, ensuring
120 4 · The Islamic World

       that the trade in enslaved people remained important in the Islamic world until the nineteenth century.

      Technology in the Islamic World

       Despite the absence of centralized political authority, communication across long distances was possible in the
       Islamic world because Arabic, the language of the Quran, also served for most scholarly and administrative
       purposes as well as religious ones. Scholars were widely scattered but rarely were they isolated, and most
       traders carried letters across long distances as part of their cargo. Scientists were thus able to compare their
       observations, students learned from advisers and mentors in far-off lands, and members of the ulama sought
       counsel from colleagues they might never meet.
       Because of the dominance of trade and travel in the Islamic world, scientific and technological innovations that
       supported these endeavors were especially prized. Mapmaking, for example, was particularly valued. Maps
       were created by geographers who collected information about the known world through either their own
       observations or knowledge disseminated by others. For example, in 1513, the Ottoman admiral and
       cartographer Piri Reis completed a map of the known world (Figure 4.9). To do so, he relied on observations
       made by Christopher Columbus, Portuguese explorers in India, and several Arab sources. Unfortunately, only
       about one-third of his map has survived.

One of the travelers who produced a wealth of geographic information for Islamic mapmakers was Ibn Battuta,
a fourteenth-century Moroccan reputed to have traveled more than seventy-three thousand miles during his
lifetime. He initially journeyed to Mecca to perform the hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, but then decided
to continue exploring north and east of Arabia instead of going home. He eventually made his way to China,
returning via East Africa and crossing the Sahara to Mali as an envoy of the king of Morocco. Toward the end of
his life, Ibn Battuta dictated his memoirs of his travels, which not only were important for mapmakers of his
time but also remain a valuable primary source for historians today. Other travelers also produced hajj
narratives that pilgrims often used as guides to the lands they passed through.
Beyond developing devices useful for trade and travel, Islamic innovators also devised systems for using
location and compass headings to calculate the qibla, the direction toward Mecca that Muslims must face while
praying. Early methods relied on crude directions ("Mecca is east"), but by the ninth century, mathematical
calculations were being used. By the fourteenth century, mathematics had progressed to the degree that
Shams al-Din al-Khalili, the official timekeeper of Damascus, applied advanced trigonometry to calculate the
122 4 · The Islamic World

       qibla for a range of locations with such precision that today's satellite technology is barely able to improve on
       it. These and other efforts to fix a person's location on the globe led to advancements in astronomical
       measurements, as did the need to calculate prayer times each day based on the sun's position in the sky.
       Military technology, especially the use of gunpowder, also greatly advanced in this period. Originally
       developed in China, gunpowder was transmitted to the Islamic world in the thirteenth and fourteenth
       centuries, possibly first introduced by the Mongols. By the fifteenth century, the Janissary corps of the Ottoman
       Empire were using firearms like the arquebus, an early long gun, in battle. And it was the Ottomans who
       famously used artillery in the siege of Constantinople in 1453. The Ottoman Empire was not the only Islamic
       state to use and improve upon gunpowder arms. Both the Safavids in Iran and the Mughals in India were
       famous for their ability to arm their soldiers with firearms like the powerful matchlock rifle (Figure 4.10).

       FIGURE 4.10 The Matchlock Rifle. The matchlock, shown here in the arms of a Mughal officer in the sixteenth
       century, was a powerful and portable firearm used by Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal armies. (credit: "Officer of the
       Mughal Army, c.1585 (colour litho)" by The Bridgeman Art Library/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       In 1974, historians Marshall G. S. Hodgson and William H. McNeill theorized that the adoption of gunpowder
       technology was what led to the rise of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal realms, coining the term "gunpowder
       empires" as a description of them. Today that theory is largely disputed, but the name has remained. What
       these empires had in common was their conception of the entire state as a military force, in which all political,
       economic, and cultural resources were coordinated by the central government to strengthen the army and
       maintain internal and external security. Their view of the state and their ability to consolidate resources in
       order to pay for technological advances also enabled these three empires to research, develop, and deploy new
       military technologies, including firearms and cannon, much more quickly than their enemies did. For more
       than two centuries, they were among the strongest and most stable economies in the world, and their
       patronage of art and culture produced works of visual art, architecture, and literature that are still considered
       among the best ever produced. Collectively, the so-called gunpowder empires earned the awe, envy, respect,
       and fear of their contemporaries in Europe, Africa, and Asia.

 Perspectives on Trade in the Muslim World

  An emphasis on how Muslims should conduct business affairs is found in some of the hadith or sayings of the
  prophet Muhammad, himself a trader. Sunni Muslims consider hadiths collected by al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud, and
  Ibn Majah among the most authentic guides to behavior. Shi`ites place more faith in stories narrated by
  Muhammad's daughter Fatima and her husband, Muhammad's cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib, whom they recognize as
  the Prophet's direct successor as leader of the Muslim community.

        There will be three types of people whom Allah will neither speak to them on the Day of Resurrection
        nor will purify them from sins, and they will have a painful punishment: They are, (1) a man who
        possesses superfluous water along the road who withholds it from travelers. . . . (3) a man who sells
        something to another man . . . and swears a false oath that he has been offered so much for it
        whereupon the buyer believes him and buys it although in fact, the seller has not been offered such a
        price.

        --Sahih al-Bukhari 7212

        Hakim asked [Muhammad]: "A man comes to me and wants me to sell him something which is not in my
        possession. Should I buy it for him from the market?" [Muhammad] replied: "Do not sell what you do
        not possess."

        --Sunan Abi Dawud 3503

        Transactions may only be done by mutual consent.

        --Ibn Majah Vol. 3, Book 12, Hadith 2185

  Almost a millennium later, the philosopher and historian Ibn Khaldun wrote about the importance of
  governments allowing trade:

        As we have stated, the dynasty is the greatest market, the mother and base of all trade. [It is the market
        that provides] the substance of income and expenditures [for trade]. If government business slumps
        and the volume of trade is small, the dependent markets will naturally show the same symptoms, and to
        a greater degree. Furthermore, money circulates between subjects and ruler, moving back and forth.
        Now, if the ruler keeps it to himself, it is lost to the subjects. This is how God proceeds with His servants.

        --Muqaddimah, Chapter 3, section 40

124 4 · The Islamic World

       The Ottoman Empire was the foremost and longest-lived of the Islamic empires of the early modern world. It
       was formed by a small group of Turkic-speaking warriors assisted by Anatolian and Balkan Christian warlords
       and their followers at the end of the thirteenth century. For nearly seven hundred years, the Ottoman state lay
       at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, ruling over a population diverse in ethnicity, language, and
       religion. In 1453, the Ottomans conquered Constantinople. A century later, the city, then called Istanbul, was
       one of the largest in the world, occupying a prize position on the Bosporus, the sea passage between the Black
       Sea and the Mediterranean, and facilitating trade between the Silk Roads and Europe. At its height under
       Sultan Suleiman I in the sixteenth century, the Ottoman military was the most technologically advanced in the
       Mediterranean world, threatening the gates of Vienna to the west, reaching the Persian Gulf to the east, and
       conquering Yemen and the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina to the south (Figure 4.11). In the
       seventeenth century, as its enemies grew stronger, the empire became more inward-looking, focusing less on
       external expansion and more on resolving domestic affairs, professionalizing its bureaucracy, and conducting
       internal reforms.

       FIGURE 4.11 Area of Ottoman Control. At its height, the Ottoman Empire (orange) stretched from the Balkans to

      Culture and Society

       The Ottoman state originated in the fertile plains of Anatolia (also known as Asia Minor, roughly modern-day
       Turkey), which lies between the Aegean Sea to its west, the Black Sea to its north, the Mediterranean Sea to its
       south, and the Zagros Mountains to its east. The lands of Anatolia were attractive to the nomadic Turkic
       peoples who lived in the semifertile Eurasian steppe, a band of grassland that runs from east to west between
       western China and Hungary. As the Turkic peoples extended their control over northern Iran in the tenth and
       eleventh centuries, a group of Turkic warriors established their own state, ruled by the Seljuk dynasty.
       Over the next century and a half, this Seljuk state grew to control much of central and southern Anatolia. The

Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century transformed the political landscape in Anatolia, however, and a
number of small Turkic principalities emerged in the region in the wake of these disruptive invasions. The
Turkic principality in the northeastern corner of Anatolia rose to prominence around 1300, under the
leadership of Osman I (Figure 4.12). Osman raised an army and began to take territory from the neighboring
Byzantines.

FIGURE 4.12 Osman I. This detail of a miniature painted in 1584 shows Osman I seated (at center) amid courtiers
and attendants. (credit: modification of work "Osman Gazi (I)" by Seyid Lockman/Wikimedia Commons, Public

Osman's son Orhan continued the campaign upon his father's death, expanding the territory under his control
to encompass much of northwestern Anatolia. The state Orhan established became the Ottoman Empire,
named for his father Osman. By the fourteenth century, the Ottoman Empire had expanded into southeastern
Europe, effectively surrounding the Byzantine city of Constantinople. In 1453, Ottoman armies marched into
the city and made it the capital of their expanding realm. Over the next century, successive rulers expanded
the empire deeper into Europe, down through Syria and Palestine, and across North Africa.
At the height of the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century, the Muslim-controlled state exerted dominance
over a vast expanse of territory that included not only Muslims but also many dhimmis: Christians, Jewish
people, and others. For example, the Ottoman-controlled areas of the Balkans in southeastern Europe were not
only much more densely populated than Anatolia but were also overwhelmingly Christian. The Christian
populations in southeastern Europe were some of the oldest in the Christian world and unlikely to convert to
Islam in any large numbers. This reality led the Ottomans to implement a system under which dhimmis were
able to govern their own affairs according to their own religious laws. This became known as the millet
system, a term that comes from the Arabic word millah, meaning nation.
126 4 · The Islamic World

       Millets were organized around religious identity: Orthodox Christians comprised one millet under the
       Orthodox patriarch in Istanbul, Armenian Christians were a second, and Jewish people a third. Other groups,
       such as the Syriac-speaking Christians and the Coptic Christians of Egypt, were later given their own millets.
       Millets had their own courts to settle their affairs; a dhimmi would appear in a sharia court only if dealing with
       a Muslim in a legal or business matter, or with the state itself. The millet system was intended to give non-
       Muslims a degree of autonomy and the ability to conduct their affairs according to their own customs and
       norms.
       Among the most striking measures imposed on Christian communities in the Balkans and Caucasus was the
       devshirme ("gathering"), the enslavement of youth for state and military service. Conceived as a form of
       taxation on the Christian territories of Ottoman-controlled Europe, this system gathered boys between eight
       and ten years of age from specified villages, converted them to Islam, and gave them an education designed to
       create an elite military force in the service of the sultan. They were selected for both their physical attributes
       and their intelligence. The training was harsh and emphasized discipline, endurance, and loyalty to the sultan.
       Most became part of an elite corps of soldiers known as the Janissaries (from the Turkish words yeni cheri,
       meaning "new soldier"). Janissaries were expected to serve as bodyguards to the sultan, to whom they were
       fiercely loyal and who paid them directly.
       A small number of young men who demonstrated exceptional intellect were sent to the palace school to receive
       language and other training in preparation for becoming the empire's trusted administrative elite. The idea
       was to create a self-perpetuating system of administrators and military leaders who had been raised by the
       Ottoman state, and whose loyalty was not to their families, whom (in theory) they never saw again, but to the
       sultan and the system of which they were a part. In this way, political infighting within the government could
       be avoided because personal identity, ethnicity, and religion were suppressed and nepotism eliminated. The
       devshirme system lasted until the late 1600s.
       The Ottomans brought knowledge of horses, military organization, and statecraft to their early empire. They
       followed their Seljuk predecessors in holding Persian culture and style in high esteem. While Arabic was
       considered the language of learning and religion, Persian was often the language of poetry and literature, even
       in the otherwise Arabic-speaking court of the Abbasid caliphs. The Ottoman Empire is often described as
       Persianate, meaning its culture, including visual art and architecture, was heavily influenced by that of Persia,
       but it was not Persian itself (Figure 4.13). Turkish was the language of administration and education; it was
       written in an adapted version of the Perso-Arabic script, and it incorporated numerous loan words from both
       Persian and Arabic. A parallel tradition of high poetry in Turkish called divan poetry also developed, which
       used the rhyme schemes and poetic meters of Persian poetry. In the seventeenth century, during the long
       conflict between the Ottomans and the Safavids in Iran, Turkish replaced Persian as a literary language, to
       emphasize the Turkish nature of the Ottoman state and distinguish its culture from that of its rival.

Most people in the Ottoman Empire could not read or write. As in most of the early modern world, primary
education was considered the domain of religious institutions, not the state, although schools were often
endowed by members of the sultan's family. Basic schools called mekteps taught young Muslims to recite the
Quran, and each millet was allowed to coordinate education for its own children. Schools tended to provide
education in the preferred local language, since Turkish was required only of those who interacted directly
with the state. This is one of the main reasons that Turkish did not eventually replace local languages like
Arabic, Bulgarian, Greek, and Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian, although in some places people who were not
ethnically Turkish did speak only Turkish. Local languages like Bosnian also incorporated many loan words
from Ottoman Turkish. Multilingualism was valued for trade and commerce and let European traders
communicate easily with local agents and business partners. It also allowed new immigrant groups to retain
their languages. For example, after Jewish people were expelled from Spain in 1492, many resettled in the
Ottoman Empire, particularly in Izmir, Salonica, and Istanbul, where they continued to speak Judeo-Spanish
128 4 · The Islamic World

       (often called Ladino).
       Education past the basic primary level was generally accessible mainly to the wealthy. Some boys from average
       and poor families managed to attend local schools, but most people needed their children to help with
       agricultural work or assist in their father's business. Boys from elite families went to private schools, and girls
       from similar families were educated at home by a private tutor. This was also the case among the millets.
       Millets provided schools for members of their community; a private school for Greek Christians opened in
       Istanbul in 1454, for example. The further education of exceptionally bright children from the lower classes
       might be sponsored by a wealthy local patron or landowner, often with the condition that the children go to
       work for the patron's business after finishing school.
       Following the construction of a lavish palace complex in Istanbul in the early 1460s, important changes took
       place in the royal court and the Ottoman style of government. Over the next century, successive Ottoman
       sultans ruled less frequently from constantly moving military encampments--as had been their practice--and
       took up longer periods of residence at the new palace, later given the name Topkapi. One result of this change
       to a more stable home was the reentry of women into the public and political life of the Ottoman court, which
       had once been more usual in the Seljuk state.
       After Sultan Bayezid I's wife had been captured and held hostage by the Mongol conqueror Timur in the 1400s,
       it became the practice for sultans not to marry but to simply take concubines, women who did not have the
       same legal status as an official wife and whose chief purpose was to bear children for the sultan. Suleiman I
       defied this tradition to marry Hurrem, a young woman from Ruthenia (now western Ukraine) who had been
       captured and enslaved by Crimean Tatars. While a captive, Hurrem was eventually taken to Istanbul and
       purchased by Suleiman's mother as a gift for her son. As Hurrem Sultan, she became one of the most
       important and influential women in Ottoman history, setting a precedent for the powerful wives and chief
       concubines who followed her in what became known as the Sultanate of Women (Figure 4.14).

The wife or mother of the reigning sultan had unequaled power over the imperial family and frequently gained
popularity by funding public monuments and buildings for use by the public, including soup kitchens, bath
houses, fountains, and schools. Many of these were vaqfs, charitable endowments intended to help the poor or
to serve religious purposes. Wealthy women (and men as well) often donated land or buildings along with
funds to assist the public.

Outsiders who sought favor often wrote letters to or sent female relatives to plead their case with the sultan's
wife or mother. She in turn might transform her popular influence into political power by conspiring with
palace administrators like the palace's chief eunuch, becoming one of the most powerful people in the empire.
The chief wife and the sultan's mother were often rivals for political prominence; clashes could occur between
them and also with the sultan's chief (male) advisers at court. The Sultanate of Women lasted more than a
century, ending in the late seventeenth century when a number of sultans died unexpectedly in a short period.
The result was instability in the palace and a weakening of the interpersonal relationships between the
imperial family and outside advisers upon whom the Sultanate of Women had relied.

 A Visit to Hurrem Sultan by a Genoese Noblewoman

  During the reign of Sultan Suleiman, high-ranking delegations were often sent between Istanbul and its trading
  partners in Genoa and Venice. It then became customary for the chief delegate's wife to visit Hurrem Sultan in
  the harem. One of them later described the event as follows.

        I was received by many eunuchs in splendid costume blazing with jewels, and carrying scimitars in their
        hands. They led me to an inner vestibule, where I was divested of my cloak and shoes and regaled with
        refreshments. Presently an elderly woman, very richly dressed, accompanied by a number of young
        girls, approached me, and after the usual salutation, informed me that the Sultana Asseki [the sultan's
        chief wife] was ready to see me. All the walls of the kiosk in which she lives are covered with the most
        beautiful Persian tiles and the floors are of cedar and sandalwood, which give out the most delicious
        odor. I advanced through an endless row of bending female slaves, who stood on either side of my path.
        [. . .] The Sultana, who is a stout but beautiful young woman, sat upon silk cushions striped with silver,
        near a latticed window overlooking the sea. Numerous slave women, blazing with jewels, attended upon
        her, holding fans, pipes for smoking, and many objects of value.

        When we had selected from these, the great lady, who rose to receive me, extended her hand and
        kissed me on the brow, and made me sit at the edge of the divan on which she reclined. She asked many
        questions concerning our country and our religion, of which she knew nothing whatever, and which I
        answered as modestly and discreetly as I could. I was surprised to notice, when I had finished my
        narrative, that the room was full of women, who, impelled by curiosity, had come to see me, and to hear
        what I had to say.

        The Sultana now entertained me with an exhibition of dancing girls and music, which was very
        delectable. When the dancing and music were over, refreshments were served upon trays of solid gold
        sparkling with jewels. As it was growing late, and I felt afraid to remain longer, lest I should vex her, I
        made a motion of rising to leave. She immediately clapped her hands, and several slaves came forward,
        in obedience to her whispered commands, carrying trays heaped up with beautiful stuffs, and some
130 4 · The Islamic World

               silver articles of fine workmanship, which she pressed me to accept. [. . .] I was led from the room in
               precisely the same manner in which I had entered it, down to the foot of the staircase, where my own
               attendants awaited me.

       Other than the sultan's mother or wife, women in the Ottoman Empire played no role in politics. They were
       active in other areas of life, however. Unlike European women before the nineteenth century, married and
       unmarried Ottoman women could buy, inherit, and own property and bequeath their wealth to others upon
       their death. They could borrow and lend money and sue to protect their rights in court. Marriages were usually
       arranged by parents, but at least in theory, women had to consent to the match and could later obtain a
       divorce. Elite and middle-class women's time was occupied in raising their children and supervising their
       households. If they lived in towns or cities, they socialized with other women, often meeting them at
       bathhouses. On their rare ventures out in public, they wore veils as a sign of their status.
       Women from the working class might manufacture goods in their homes and peddle them in the streets.
       Although they could invest in businesses, they were largely excluded from the official guild system, which
       admitted only male artisans. There were a number of female-dominated trades, however, such as nursing and
       dancing, and women often made a living doing laundry. They also belonged to the various Sufi orders. Of
       course, the lives of both Muslim and non-Muslim women differed depending on where in the Ottoman Empire
       they lived. The lives of peasant women were different from those of city dwellers, and besides caring for the
       home and children, they might assist their male relatives with chores on the farm.
       The synthesis of the Ottoman Empire's diverse cultural base is perhaps most evident in its cuisine, which
       incorporated cooking styles and ingredients from places all over the world including Greece, Iran, the Balkans,
       the Arabian Peninsula, and central Asia. Following the discovery of the Americas, Ottoman cooks were among
       the first to incorporate ingredients from there, such as maize, peppers, tomatoes, and pumpkins, into their
       dishes. The Ottomans also likely introduced foods from elsewhere in Asia, like sesame, into the kitchens of the
       Middle East. Many dishes, such as rice pilafs from Egypt, Iran, and central Asia and Indian tandoori casseroles,
       were elegantly re-created for the imperial court in the kitchens of Topkapi Palace and then adopted in less
       extravagant versions by people throughout the empire. Food was an important symbol of power and
       generosity, and Topkapi could host up to four thousand people for a banquet. Each year, the sultan provided a
       lavish feast for the Janissary corps, the Ottoman Empire's most elite troops. At one point in the eighteenth
       century, ten thousand troops were fed at once (Figure 4.15).

The birth of an heir, a royal wedding, and the funeral of the sultan (or his wife or mother) were all occasions
upon which the palace was expected to hold public banquets. Soup kitchens fed thousands of people each day
in major cities throughout the empire, as did the caravansaries. At the same time, public refusal to partake of
the sultan's food also conveyed a powerful message. When upset with imperial policies, the Janissaries
symbolically turned their metal soup bowls upside down and beat them like drums. The sound reverberated
around the capital, signaling their displeasure for all to hear.

                                                                           THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT
 Cuisine at the Topkapi Palace

  One item often found in contemporary Eastern Mediterranean cuisines is baklava, a confection of pastry layers
  and nuts drenched in syrup. Recipes in cookbooks from the Abbasid era use flatbreads soaked in sugar syrup and
  tossed with toasted nuts; the kitchens at the Topkapi Palace introduced very thin layers of pastry called filo.
  Throughout the empire, wealthy estates replicated the technique; a woman who could produce filo thin enough
132 4 · The Islamic World

         to read through was a worthy bride. Today, cultures from Greece to Afghanistan argue over where baklava
         originated, which nuts to use, and whose method for producing filo is best.

         The palace cooks also elevated traditional methods from the steppes and flatlands of Central and West Asia,
         such as grilling small pieces of meat on skewers for a dish known as kebab. They experimented with different
         cuts and kinds of meat, richly spiced and served atop mountains of rice seasoned with saffron, still one of the
         world's most expensive spices. Today, shops selling kebabs are common in Europe and the Middle East, and
         shish (a Turkish word meaning "skewer") kebabs are popular in the United States.

         Dumplings called manti, believed to have originated in Xinjiang among the Uyghurs, are found in variations from
         China to the Balkans. The Topkapi chefs learned to produce these dumplings, smaller than a teaspoon and
         delicately flavored. Recipes appeared in an English-language Ottoman cookbook in 1880.

         The Ottomans also used their location on the spice-trading network to incorporate Asian spices into their cuisine.
         Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, wife of Britain's eighteenth-century ambassador to the Ottoman Empire,
         complained that the flavors were too intense. In a letter home, she reported commanding her chef to prepare
         blander dishes the English preferred.

         Today the food of the Ottoman Empire is consumed around the world. Sherbet--originally a chilled Iranian
         drink--was introduced to Italy in the seventeenth century by way of the empire, and soon consumers in France
         and England were delighting in it as people do today. In the twentieth century, yogurt (from the Turkish "to
         knead" or "to be curdled") was first mass-produced in western Europe by Isaac Carasso, an immigrant from the
         Ottoman Empire. Named for his son Daniel, it is sold in the United States as Dannon.

           · How has "Middle Eastern" cuisine influenced the cuisines of western Europe and of the United States?

       Coffee drinking occupied a position in Ottoman life that was on par with--indeed, perhaps more important
       than--feasting, and the Ottomans first introduced it to Europe. The practice began in Arabia and spread to
       other places in the Islamic world. The first coffeehouses were established in the Ottoman Empire in the
       sixteenth century during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, where they provided spaces for men to
       socialize, do business, and exchange news. Men of all social classes frequented coffeehouses, and men of little
       education could listen to literate men reading aloud from books, hear poets recite their newest works, and
       watch scholars engage in debates. Political discussions were common, and the Ottoman government often sent
       spies to listen for signs of dissent or potential rebellion. Talk of politics was especially frequent at coffeehouses
       favored by Janissaries. While many Muslim clerics had no objection to coffee because it was not forbidden by
       sharia, some clerics disapproved of it because of its stimulating qualities, and unsuccessful attempts to ban it
       were made in the sixteenth century. In the seventeenth century, Sultan Murad IV, fearful that rebellion might
       be plotted in coffeehouses, banned them, and citizens who persisted in drinking coffee risked being sentenced
       to death.

       Many Muslim clerics and scholars also objected to the smoking of tobacco, which had been introduced from
       the Americas in the sixteenth century and become popular in the Ottoman Empire by the seventeenth century.
       They saw tobacco as an intoxicant that affected people in the way wine or coffee did, and also as bad for health.
       Some denounced it as a foreign practice introduced by European Christians for the purpose of harming
       Muslims. Tobacco was also damned by its association with the coffeehouse, where much smoking took place,
       and when Murad IV closed the coffeehouses, he also outlawed tobacco smoking with the death penalty for
       violators.

its power in the seventeenth century. The early empire was born on the dividing line between Europe and Asia
and balanced between them for nearly its entire existence. The collapse of the Byzantine Empire allowed the
Ottoman sultan to rule from a capital city situated between the two continents. After establishing his new
capital in Istanbul, Mehmed II issued a call for citizens of the empire to come and settle there to restore its
economic vitality (Figure 4.16). This was necessary because the city had experienced steady demographic
decline over the previous few centuries. At first, Mehmed offered free housing to anyone who moved there
voluntarily; later, he ordered thousands of Serbs, Armenians, Greeks, Jewish people, and Turks to settle in the
city. Although he would not live to see it, within a century Istanbul was by far the largest city in Europe, with
nearly a half million residents, and it dominated the land and sea trade between Europe and Asia.

Over the next century, the Ottoman Empire extended its influence into Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and North
Africa. Under Ottoman control, the Egyptian Red Sea fleet battled the Portuguese for dominance in the Indian
Ocean, sending troops and armaments to aid allied rulers in India and ships to the straits of Malacca. The
Ottoman Empire is generally considered to have reached its pinnacle by the rise of Sultan Suleiman I in 1520.
During his reign, Ottoman armies continued their Balkan expansion by conquering Serbia and Hungary, and
in 1529 they laid siege to Vienna, then the seat of the Habsburg Empire.
Although Vienna was never conquered, the threat of military conquest by the Ottomans was a constant worry
for the Habsburgs. Queen Elizabeth I of England, also a rival of the Habsburgs, sent an embassy and military
advisers to Istanbul to propose an anti-Habsburg alliance. Despite the Ottoman alliance with England, the
Ottoman's war with the Habsburgs quickly reached a stalemate, where it remained for several decades.

       Suleiman's strength and military dominance of the Mediterranean world, along with the splendor of his capital
       city and the riches flowing through the empire, earned him the title "the Magnificent."

       To most Ottomans, however, Suleiman was known as "the lawgiver." Most Ottoman subjects were unaware of
       their legal rights until Suleiman's rule. Although Ottoman law was based on sharia, a certain amount of
       interpretation was required in matters such as criminal law, management of lands, and tax law. These laws
       were thus usually established by decree. Over the course of two and a half centuries, different parts of the
       empire were subject to decrees issued by many sultans, often substantially different from one another and
       sometimes contradictory. Suleiman reviewed the laws, ensured their compliance with Islamic principles, and
       issued a single unified law code for the empire that remained in force for three centuries. He also ordered the
       new law code to be publicized widely, so every Ottoman subject knew they had the right to have disputes heard
       in a court of law and judged fairly. These reforms won Suleiman wide acclaim and popularity as a ruler who
       cared about his people. Suleiman died in 1566 while commanding an expedition into Hungary. His death was
       kept secret for two months so as not to demoralize the troops; it was not until they returned to Istanbul that his
       death was made public in time for the coronation of his son as Selim II.

       The period of Ottoman history after Suleiman's rule has often been described by historians as a time of slow
       decline, leading to the empire's disintegration beginning in the nineteenth century. This largely European
       interpretation attributes the ebbing of Ottoman power to two factors: the rise of European military might and
       Ottoman territorial overextension. In this view, the winds of change began to blow in 1571 when the Ottoman
       navy was destroyed in a naval battle at Lepanto in Greece by the Holy League--a confederation of the Spanish
       Empire, the Papal States, Venice, and Genoa, among others. The battle effectively ended Ottoman naval
       supremacy in the eastern Mediterranean, as well as Ottoman enthusiasm for continuing its naval rivalry with
       Portugal, the Netherlands, and France in the Indian Ocean.

       With this loss, the curtain was drawn back on the legend of Ottoman invincibility. European military
       technology caught up to and then surpassed Ottoman capabilities over the seventeenth and eighteenth
       centuries. Ottoman territory was then gradually lost to European kingdoms, particularly in the western part of
       North Africa and in the Balkans. While the empire's land wars against the Habsburgs in Europe continued for
       another century, culminating in yet another failed siege of Vienna in 1683, it was also recognized at court that
       foreign wars were becoming more expensive but leading to far less economic and territorial gain.

       From the north, the growing power of Russia became another threat. Beginning in the seventeenth century,
       Russian forces pushed south across the steppes toward Ottoman territory. Under Tsar Peter the Great, Russian
       armies temporarily captured the Ottoman-held territory of Azov in the Crimea along the Black Sea in 1696. In
       the late eighteenth century, Russia's expansion ramped up again, eventually leading it deep into Ottoman
       territory with control over the northern coast of the Black Sea. Often aided by Austria, Russia steadily
       undermined Ottoman control over the Balkans, and over the nineteenth century, its influence came to replace
       Ottoman sway in the region.

       More recently, historians have refined this older interpretation of Ottoman decline. According to the newer
       view, the threats from Europe in the west and the Safavids in the east convinced the Ottoman rulers to try
       making their control over their core territory more efficient. They sent delegations to several countries in
       Europe and to Mughal India to observe local systems and make recommendations for improvements at home.
       Several European military advisers were brought to Istanbul to train soldiers, and Ottoman scientists and
       engineers were sent to European universities to learn more about engineering, history, and military
       modernization and the ways in which they could be applied at home. Although the Ottoman Empire had
       become weaker by the nineteenth century, these reforms nevertheless helped it to survive into the twentieth
       century.

      Science and Technology

and learning, following the examples set by the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs and other prominent Muslim
leaders. The core of all education was religious; there was no separation between what today would be
considered religious philosophy or doctrinal study and the "hard sciences" such as astronomy, chemistry,
mathematics, and physics. On the contrary, scientific investigation was considered an act of devotion because
of its exploration and discovery of the intricacies of the divinely created universe.

From the very beginning of the state, institutions of higher learning--madrasas--were established in major
cities. Patronage of science, art, and culture reached a new level under Sultan Mehmed II. Mehmed founded
the first institution of higher learning in the new capital, the Fatih complex, which included a hospital, public
kitchens, a library, and schools. The Fatih hospital remained operational into the nineteenth century.

As Istanbul developed as the imperial capital, many other such institutions came to be established there.
Another complex of charitable institutions, the first one designed and built in Istanbul by Mimar Sinan, the
master architect and engineer of Armenian origin, was a teaching hospital endowed by Hurrem Sultan, the
wife of Sultan Suleiman. It was also common for wealthy Jewish and Christian patrons to establish their own
vaqfs to fund projects that benefited their communities, because these trusts were exempt from inheritance
taxes. Teaching hospitals were considered important recipients of vaqf funds given that hospital care was
provided free of charge.

The geographic diversity of the empire was an advantage to the development of medical science because it was
now possible to compare the results of medical treatments and experiments in several different geographic
and climate zones. For this reason, many important medical treatises of the day were written in the Ottoman
Empire. The tradition of medical writing built upon the foundation established by such famous Muslim
scholars and physicians as Ibn Sina, who composed The Canon of Medicine in the tenth century. The works
produced by physicians who made their home in the Ottoman Empire included one of the first treatises
dedicated to dentistry, written by the Spanish Jewish scholar Musa bin Hamun, who made his home in the
Ottoman Empire after the Jewish people were expelled from Spain.

 The Architect of an Empire

  Mimar Sinan was the chief architect of the Ottoman Empire. Of Armenian origin, he was a member of the
  devshirme as a youth and began his career as a military engineer in the Janissary Corps. He first came to the
  attention of the sultan Suleiman after he was able to construct a bridge over marshland that was impeding the
  progress of the Ottoman Army. Sinan lived to be nearly one hundred years old and designed more than three
  hundred structures (Figure 4.17).

         Domain)
         In writing his autobiography toward the end of his life, Sinan had this to say about the start of his illustrious
         career:

               When Sultan Süleyman set out for Moldavia and arrived on the banks of the River Pruth, a bridge was
               needed for the army to cross. . . . Since it was a marshy place, they were bewildered as to how to build a
               bridge. His Excellency the late Lutfi Pasha said, "My felicitous padishah, the construction of this bridge
               can be achieved with the skill and ability of your servant Sinan. . . . He is a master of the world and a
               skilled architect." . . . In ten days I built a noble bridge and the army of Islam and the shah of humankind
               crossed it. . . .
               By the grace of God, . . . the office of [chief] architect fell vacant. . . . Lutfi Pasha said, "The architect
               must be Sinan. There is no one capable of this work other than him." . . . It was true that the thought of
               abandoning my career [as a Janissary] gave me pain, but in the end I accepted, seeing it as an
               opportunity to build many mosques and thereby fulfill many desires in this world and the next.

northern Europe around the same time. Taqi al-Din also developed steam turbines and mechanical clocks and
conducted research into the optical refraction of light. His work illustrates the way scientific discoveries
transcended religious and national divisions; he himself had set out to improve on astronomical techniques
devised by Ulugh Beg at Samarkand (in today's Uzbekistan), and in turn his own research was consulted by
Tycho Brahe in Denmark when Brahe was developing his ideas about astronomy. Taqi al-Din's works were also
collected by the Dutch mathematician Jacob Golius, who brought them to the library of Leiden University in
the Netherlands in the seventeenth century.

     4.3 The Safavid Empire

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the factors that contributed to the rise of the Safavid Empire
         · Discuss the similarities and differences between Twelver Islam and Sunni Islam
         · Describe the political structure of the Safavid Empire
       To the east of the lands of the Ottomans, another Islamic empire emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth
       century. Based in Iran, the Safavid Empire at its height ruled over much of what is now Armenia, Azerbaijan,
       Bahrain, Georgia, and Iraq, as well as parts of several neighboring countries including Turkey, Turkmenistan,
       and Uzbekistan (Figure 4.19). Like the Ottomans and Mughals, the Safavids developed a powerful military, ran
       a strong and well-organized central state, and fostered a climate in which artistic and intellectual culture
       flourished. The Safavids also introduced Shi`ism as the state religion at a time when Iran's population was
       mostly Sunni, and in doing so they fostered the deep divisions between Shi`ism and Sunnism that continue to
       characterize relations between Iran and other Islamic nations today.

      The Rise of the Safavid Empire

       The Safavids began not as a political dynasty, but as the hereditary leaders of a Sufi order based in the city of
       Ardabil, located in today's northwestern Iran. The order in Ardabil was founded in the thirteenth century by
       the Sufi master Zahed Gilani, and little is known about its beliefs and practices in its earliest stages. We do
       know that Zahed appointed his son-in-law and disciple Safi al-Din Ardabili to succeed him, which angered his
       family and some of his followers.

Safi al-Din renamed the order after himself--Safaviyya--and made a number of reforms that reshaped it from a
local order to a religious movement that sought followers from around Iran and neighboring countries. While
Safi al-Din's origins are lost to history, it is generally believed that he came from a family of Azeri-speaking
Kurds, although even this is uncertain. (Azeri is a Turkic language.) The Safavid family later claimed that Safi
al-Din was descended from the Prophet through Muhammad's daughter Fatima and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi
Talib. This genealogy was most likely invented by court historians during the sixteenth-century reign of Shah
Ismail I. However, several scholars went one step further and extended the family's history back to the biblical
Adam.

Initially, like most of Iran's population, the Safavids were primarily Sunni Muslims. Like that of many Sufi
orders, their ideology incorporated elements of both Sunni and Shia doctrines to proclaim a universal message
and attract followers from both sects. However, Safi al-Din's great-grandson Junayd made several changes to
the order's doctrine, adopting specifically Shia ideas. Junayd believed the Safavids should use their popular
religious mandate to seek military and political power for themselves, and he found Shia doctrine more
appropriate for his vision.

Junayd's son Haydar created a solid political and military framework by establishing a Safavid military order
known as the Qizilbash, after their distinctive red hats (qizil means "red" in Azeri). Haydar declared a religious
war against the Christian residents of the Caucasus, but in order to reach them, he had to pass through the
territory of the Shirvanshahs, who were allied with his enemies. Although at first he was able to negotiate safe
passage for his army, the Shirvanshahs, already uneasy about Haydar's growing power, used his eventual
attack on one of their cities as an excuse to declare war on the Safavids. Haydar was killed in battle in 1488. His
son Ali Mirza took his place, but within a few years his capital at Ardabil was conquered by his enemies. Ali
Mirza was also killed, and his infant brother Ismail was sent into exile.

After being sheltered by allies, the twelve-year-old Ismail emerged from exile in 1499 claiming to be the Mahdi
or messiah and began rallying the Qizilbash troops who had fought for his father and brother. They embarked
on a military campaign, winning victory after victory until, in July 1501, Ismail entered the Shirvanshah
capital of Tabriz and declared himself shah, or emperor, of all Iran (Figure 4.20). At the time, he governed only
Azerbaijan and part of the Caucasus. By 1511, however, Ismail's troops had driven the Uzbek people across the
Oxus River, establishing the eastern borders of modern Iran. The Safavids also staged incursions into eastern
Anatolia; these triggered a conflict with the Ottoman Empire that continued for the length of the Safavids'
reign. Not only had Ismail's forces occupied the empire's border cities, but he had begun recruiting for his
army among the ethnic Turkish tribes of eastern Anatolia and encouraging the Shia Muslims in Ottoman lands
to revolt against their Sunni rulers.

       inheritance from his Greek grandmother, is clearly visible. (credit: "Portrait of Shah Ismail I of Persia" by Uffizi

       In response, the Ottoman sultan Bayezid II deported the Shi`ites of his empire from Anatolia to other regions
       where they would be unable to heed the Safavid call. As the Safavids continued to push westward into Ottoman
       territory, Bayezid's son Selim I responded by invading Iranian Azerbaijan, laying waste to Tabriz in 1514 and
       attempting to destroy the Qizilbash. The loss of his capital Tabriz to the enemy--and to a Sunni Muslim at
       that--was a huge blow to Shah Ismail's standing among his own armies, made worse by the fact that he had
       declared himself invincible based on his fictionalized semidivine ancestry.
       After Ismail's death in 1524, ten years of internal strife followed as rival Qizilbash factions fought for
       dominance and the right to be regent to Ismail's ten-year-old heir Tahmasp. Tahmasp went on to become the
       longest-reigning Safavid shah. Disappointed by his experience navigating the rivalries within the Qizilbash, he
       began using enslaved Christians from Circassia and Georgia in the palace administration and civil services
       instead of members of the Qizilbash. Tahmasp faced several challenges at home and abroad, however.
       Although he successfully repelled an attempt by the Uzbeks to invade northeastern Iran, they remained a
       threat to the east, and war with the Ottomans flared up soon afterward when Suleiman's armies invaded Iran in
       the mid-1530s. Tahmasp's desire to fend off the Turkish threat led him to ally himself with a rising European
       power, the Habsburg Empire.
       The Habsburg emperor Charles V, concerned by the Ottomans' progression toward Vienna, approached first
       Ismail and then Tahmasp about an alliance. By agreement, the Safavids would attack the Ottomans whenever
       the Ottomans attacked the Habsburgs to divide the Ottoman army between two fronts of battle and thereby
       weaken it. In 1536, the Ottomans formalized their own alliance with the king of France, an enemy of the
       Habsburgs, who sent a military adviser to counsel Sultan Suleiman about his war with Iran in 1547.
       Two decades of warfare severely strained the Iranian economy, however, and Tahmasp sought peace with the
       Ottomans. Under the Peace of Amasya, concluded in 1555, Armenia and Georgia were divided between the two
       empires; the Ottomans gained control over Iraq and access to the Persian Gulf, while Iran's control over
       Azerbaijan was guaranteed. Tahmasp also moved his capital from Tabriz to Qazvin, closer to the Caspian Sea
       and at less risk of capture or siege by Ottoman forces. The two states finally laid down arms and declared a
       peace that lasted more than thirty years.

It did not last forever, however. The borders of Iran were secure at the end of Tahmasp's reign, but his son and
grandson were ineffective leaders who failed to keep the Qizilbash rivalries from once again destabilizing the
country, which led to yet more incursions by Ottoman and Uzbek forces. Tahmasp's grandson Abbas I,
generally considered the strongest Safavid shah as well as one of the greatest rulers in Iranian history, found
himself compelled to take up arms once again (Figure 4.21). During his reign, the Safavid state reached the
height of its military, political, and economic power. Abbas I reformed the military and civil service and built a
showpiece capital city, Isfahan, which remains one of the masterworks of Persian Islamic art and architecture.

Chehel Sotoun Palace in Isfahan, Iran, depicts Shah Abbas I, who ruled over Iran at the height of the Safavid
dynasty's power. (credit: "Abbas I of Persia" by Unknown/"TRAJAN 117"/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
By the time the seventeen-year-old Abbas was crowned shah in 1588, Iran was in chaos. After waging war
against the Uzbeks, Abbas realized that fighting the Ottomans with the country in upheaval would be nearly
impossible. As a result, he signed a peace treaty in 1590 that gave nearly half his territory, including the
former capital of Tabriz, to the Ottomans. Abbas then returned to the issue his grandfather had taken up:
taming the Qizilbash, whose disputes had plunged Iran into civil conflict that twice nearly brought the country
to ruin. His grandfather had acquired over thirty thousand enslaved people employed as civil servants and
palace administrators; turning to the Caucasus region again, Abbas decided to also create an enslaved soldier
corps like the Ottoman Janissaries.
With his new army behind him, Abbas undertook to gain back the territories lost to the Uzbeks and Ottomans.
The Safavid armies quickly reconquered Khorasan from the Uzbeks and moved on to Azerbaijan. The
Ottomans sued for peace in 1612, relinquishing the Caucasus to the Iranians. An attempt to recapture the
territory in 1618 resulted in a devastating loss for the Ottomans.
Despite near-constant war, during this time Iran reached new cultural and economic heights. In 1598, Abbas
142 4 · The Islamic World

       moved his capital from Qazvin to Isfahan in the central Iranian plateau, far from the constantly shifting
       borders with the Ottomans and Uzbeks and closer to the Persian Gulf and the newly arrived traders of the
       British and Dutch East India Companies. The city was built as a showpiece, with administrative buildings and
       public markets opening on the enormous Naqsh-e Jahan ("Exemplar of the world") Square (Figure 4.22).

       FIGURE 4.22 Naqsh-e Jahan Square. The Shah Mosque, built by Abbas I, is located on the south side of Naqsh-e
       Jahan Square in the center of Isfahan. The square, a UNESCO World Heritage site, still serves as a gathering place
       today. (credit: "Naqsh-e Jahan Square" by Bijan Tehrani/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)
       The city center was unique. All levels of society could mix there, from members of the royal court whose
       pavilion overlooked the square, to the Shi`ite clergy whose mosque was at the square's southern end, to foreign
       dignitaries, members of the military, merchants, and commoners. A soup kitchen distributed free food to the
       needy, and occasionally the square was cleared for polo games, public ceremonies, and festivals. To populate
       his new capital, Abbas ordered several different populations to settle in it, including Armenians, Jewish
       people, Circassians, and other Caucasian peoples, many of whom had been displaced during his war against
       the Ottomans in their homelands. The cathedral Abbas ordered built for the Armenian Christians still serves
       that community in Isfahan today.
       After Abbas's death, the Safavid state met another internal threat, this time from the Georgian kingdom of
       Kakheti. After Abbas had ordered the mass deportation of Georgians to central Iran, he sent Oghuz Turks
       (Turcomen) to settle the area; the local population that remained refused to allow them to do so, however, and
       staged a military rebellion. Although the Safavids were eventually able to reestablish authority, they never
       achieved their earlier level of control.
       Iran also continued to face threats from outside. In the early eighteenth century under the reign of Tsar Peter
       the Great, Russia began to encroach on the northern shores of the Caspian Sea and to compete for influence in
       the Caucasus. The armies of Peter the Great took the Caucasus in the Russo-Persian war of 1722-1723, while
       the Ottomans reoccupied northwestern Iran. The entry of European ships to the Indian Ocean trade cut off
       much of Iran's direct access to Africa and South Asia. Over the course of the 1730s, Nader Afshar, one of the
       Safavid vassals, established himself as a strong military ruler. He was able to reverse many of Iran's territorial
       losses to the Russians and Ottomans; however, he had no interest in sharing power. In 1736, Nader deposed
       the infant Abbas III and crowned himself shah, bringing the Safavid Empire to an end and establishing the

short-lived Afsharid dynasty.

Establishing Shi`ism as the State Religion

The Safavids declared Shia Islam the state religion of Iran in the early 1500s, and it remains so to this day,
encompassing about 10 percent of the worldwide Muslim population. The Shia movement originated with a
dispute over Muhammad's successor after his death in 632. One faction, which became known as the Sunnis,
supported the candidacy of Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, Muhammad's father-in-law. The other faction wished the
leadership to remain within Muhammad's biological family and backed Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's cousin
and son-in-law, whom they believed the Prophet had chosen as his successor. This group became known as the
Shia.

The Shia believe Ali, who finally succeeded Uthman to become the leader of the Muslim community in 656,
was the first legitimate imam, the title they give their spiritual leader rather than "caliph." They view the line of
Muhammad that descends through Ali and his wife Fatima, Muhammad's daughter, as the only source of
definitive religious guidance. About 95 percent of Shia also believe Ali was the first of twelve infallible leaders
chosen by God, so this sect is often called the Twelvers. Twelvers hold that the twelfth and final imam,
Muhammad al-Mahdi, went into "mystical hiding" in the ninth century and will return, along with Jesus, to
defeat evil on earth and herald the Day of Judgment. The remaining 5 percent of Shia are Zaydis or Seveners, a
sect established by Zayd, the great-grandson of Ali, who disagree with Twelvers over the identity of the seventh
imam.

Sunnis respect Ali and all the Twelve Imams, but they do not believe the Twelve alone were divinely chosen to
lead the Muslim community. In their view of Islam, any pious man who followed the example of Muhammad
could lead the Muslim community.

Shi`ism was not officially tolerated by the Sunni caliphs of the Umayyad and Abbasid Empires because of its
perceived challenge to their rule. For this reason, most Shia movements developed far outside the control of
these caliphates, in places like Morocco, Yemen, Iran, and central Asia. After the Mongol conquest of Baghdad
in 1258, the Sunni caliphate became a weak figurehead position that held only symbolic authority. During the
period of Mongol rule over Iran and the Caucasus, the distinction between Shia and Sunni became less
important than it had been. When Ismail crowned himself Shah in 1501, most of Iran's population was Sunni.
When he declared Twelver Shi`ism to be the state religion of Iran, he hoped to unify his Iranian subjects by
having them adopt a form of Islam that gave them a unique identity and distinguished them from their military
and political enemies the Ottomans and the Uzbeks, who were both Sunni.

Historians generally agree that the Safavids' efforts to convert Muslims in their empire to Shi`ism utilized
coercion and force. Shah Ismail, who saw himself as infallible and semidivine, believed his strong religious
convictions had won him the Iranian throne, and he used his political and military authority to impose his
religious ideology on the country (Figure 4.23). He ordered all Iran's Sunni Muslims to become Shi`ites. Sunni
clerics and theologians were given the choice of conversion or exile. Sunnis who resisted conversion but
remained in Iran faced death. To spread the new beliefs and win converts, Ismail brought Shia scholars to Iran
from Lebanon and Syria. He used state funds to construct schools where Shia beliefs were taught and to build
shrines to Ali and members of his family. Ismail also invited foreign Shi`ites living in places where they were
persecuted by the Sunni majority to move to Iran, promising them land and protection.

       The conversion efforts of the Safavids have left long legacies in the Islamic world. Though the majority of
       Muslims in Azerbaijan and Iran considered themselves Shia by the time the Safavid era ended in 1736, Nader
       Shah attempted to restore Sunnism as the dominant sect. But there was little public enthusiasm, and after his
       death most who had claimed to adopt Sunnism during his reign quietly reverted to Shi`ism. At the same time,
       however, the Safavids' conversion policy brought tensions between Sunni and Shia to a level not seen since
       Muhammad's death. The hostility between the sects that continues today is usually traced to the Safavid era
       and the dynasty's military rivalry with the Ottomans, especially after the sultan acquired the Sunni title of
       caliph in 1517.
       The Safavids were generally more tolerant of non-Muslim subjects than they were of the Sunni. Nevertheless,
       Safavid rulers were aggressive toward the Armenians, Georgians, and other Christians in the Caucasus region,
       whom they considered potentially rebellious. They sought to control these populations by enslaving or
       deporting their members, and nobles were often requested to convert to Shi`ism. Christians elsewhere in the

Safavid realm, however, were given considerable freedom to build churches and honor their own customs and
beliefs. Abbas I was particularly lenient toward the Armenian Christian population of Isfahan, due to their
participation in the lucrative manufacture and export of silk. Spain and the Vatican sent several embassies to
Iran hoping to enlist it as an ally against the Ottomans. The pope also hoped Abbas would allow the
construction of a cathedral in his new capital city of Isfahan, but on their arrival his emissaries found three
Roman Catholic churches already there (Figure 4.24).

Safavid Government and Culture

During the Safavid period, Iran was ethnically quite diverse. Safi al-Din is believed to have come from a family
of Kurds who spoke Azeri. As the Safavid order developed, its members intermarried with other Turkic groups
such as the Turcomen, Lar, and Bakhtiyari, and with Georgian, Armenian, and Pontic Greek Christians within
their lands and bordering territories. Through his mother, Shah Ismail I was descended from the Komnenos
dynasty that once ruled the Byzantine Empire. He used Persian as the language of government and composed
poetry in Azeri, contributing to its development as a literary language. The Qizilbash were largely Turcoman,
another Turkic group with its own language. Various groups of Persian-speaking peoples lived in the Iranian
plateau and were usually described as "Tajik."
The Safavid shahs were wary of groups that sought to exert too much power over them and the government.
One of the reasons the Qizilbash were eventually replaced as palace administrators, bureaucrats, and military
elites is that they had occasionally used their collective power to render some of the weaker shahs mere
146 4 · The Islamic World

       figureheads. However, beneath the shah and the powerful elites, the Safavid hierarchy was unique for its time
       in being largely based on merit; worth and talent, not status or birth, were the keys to upward mobility. Even
       those in hereditary positions had to prove themselves capable or be replaced. This system brought the
       brightest and most talented into government service while preventing the development of an entrenched and
       unchecked aristocracy.
       Shi`ism's rise created a new religious hierarchy in Iran. Given the sect's government sponsorship, the Shia
       ulama were often able to act as intermediaries between the people and the government. They formed an early
       alliance with merchants, for instance, establishing and administering vaqfs to protect the merchants' property
       and assets. Through this alliance many members of the ulama became landowners themselves, creating a
       religious aristocracy that gave them a level of political independence. When the Safavid state weakened in its
       later years, the ulama were able to step in and use their newly acquired wealth to benefit their communities.
       This strengthening of direct ties between the ulama and the people, and the separation of the religious
       establishment from the state, is believed to be one of the reasons Shi`ism long outlasted the Safavid era.
       The stability of the Safavid system allowed art and culture to flourish; the Safavid era is considered one of the
       high points of Perso-Islamic culture. Two distinct schools of painting developed: the Turkmen school in
       western Iran and the Timurid school based in Herat (in today's Afghanistan). Shah Tahmasp supported both
       schools at a royal painting workshop where artistic masters were invited to work with luxury materials such as
       gold leaf and ground lapis lazuli (Figure 4.25).

       one of the most prized examples of visual art. Iranian ceramics became highly valued for export because of
       their remarkable similarity in style and quality to treasured Chinese porcelain, with even more intricately

 The Art of the Book

  The most distinctive and prized artworks of the Safavid era were illuminated manuscripts of well-known texts
  decorated with miniature paintings. In these paintings, artists used mineral-based dyes, which produced brilliant
  and long-lasting colors (Figure 4.26). Wealthy patrons commissioned artists--like those in the studio of Shah
  Tahmasp--to paint these miniatures either to illustrate books or to be kept as a separate piece of art in an album
  of similar works.

  The art of these miniature paintings relies on a style called "nonrepresentational." Instead of depicting a scene
  naturalistically, it uses forced or even impossible perspectives to show action on multiple tiers, revealing activity
  behind doors or walls that some of the subjects in the painting cannot see. The subjects, even if they sponsored
  the work, are generally idealized rather than actual persons. Representation of the human form has been
  forbidden in Islamic art at times; in Persian illuminated manuscripts, the artists' response was to use the image
  to bring a specific person to the viewer's mind without representing them accurately.
  Miniatures were an important form of Persian art long before Islam appeared; Persian artists were prized at the
  court of the Abbasids, and artistic styles derived from their work, such as the nonfigurative elements used in the

         Despite the strong rivalry between the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, all three empires produced paintings of
         this type (Figure 4.27). While strongly influenced by Persian miniatures, Mughal miniatures tended to represent a
         more realistic depiction of animals and humans.

       As Tahmasp's royal studio was to painting, Abbas's capital at Isfahan was to architecture. While Naqsh-e Jahan
       Square provided a focus, the city also featured a broad tree-lined avenue called the Chahar Bagh, stretching
       over four kilometers from the square to a royal country estate (Figure 4.28). This street was flanked by palaces
       and public gardens that featured fruit trees and fountains with running water. The city was designed as a treat
       for the senses, employing artistic motifs in tilework and calligraphy, broad sweeping arches and domes that
       mimicked the sky, the sounds of running water and wind blowing through leaves, and the scents of flowering

avenues, and bridges and commissioning structures in other cities based on the style cultivated in the capital.
Many of these are now symbols of Iranian nationhood.

As in the Ottoman Empire, wealthy Safavid women raised their public stature by becoming patrons of the arts
and endowing public buildings. Royal and elite women often funded the construction or maintenance of
caravansaries, demonstrating the value of trade to both the state and individual wealth. Safavid art and artistic
production reflected Iran's location at the center of global trade routes, incorporating elements and styles from
countries with which Iran conducted trade. The production of silk was one of the most important industries in
Iran. Persian carpets of silk and wool were in high demand in Europe and other parts of the Islamic world. The
Ardabil carpet, still one of the largest Persian carpets in existence, was made during the Safavid period. It is
34-1/2 by 17-1/2 feet and is on view at London's Victoria and Albert Museum.

Section Summary

4.1 A Connected Islamic World

By the sixteenth century, the religion of Islam had spread far beyond its point of origin in Southwest Asia.
Islamic communities, large empires, and a number of Islamic kingdoms thrived in West and East Africa,
southeastern Europe, India, and Southeast Asia. But although no single powerful caliphate held all these areas
together, the religion of Islam allowed for a degree of cohesiveness and unity, despite theological
disagreements. As a result, trade in all types of goods unified the wider Islamic world, flowing along numerous
trade routes and through markets overseen by Muslim market inspectors. Local states encouraged trade
through their territories because it brought them economic benefits and access to new ideas and technologies.
This trade often occurred with the cooperation of the many non-Muslim communities that lived in the Islamic
world, such as Jewish people and Christians.

In addition to goods and people, trade routes also carried ideas, knowledge, and technologies that also served
as a cohesive force. Some led to improvements in mapmaking and navigation. Others had military
applications, such as new firearms and artillery. These weapons provided advantages to some of the large
Islamic empires of the era, like the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals.

4.2 The Ottoman Empire

The Ottoman Empire was one of the most diverse political entities of its time. Sultans such as Suleiman I
encouraged people of all ethnicities to settle there, and under the millet system, each religious community had
its own leader, regulated its own affairs, and educated its own children. This diversity is reflected in the
languages spoken in the empire. Turkish was for interacting with the government, Arabic for scholarship and
in religious settings, and Persian for literature.

The empire reached its greatest heights under Suleiman I, known in the West as "the Magnificent" and among
Ottomans as "the lawgiver" for his creation of a legal code that applied throughout the realm. Under Suleiman
and his successors, science flourished, and important advances were made in fields such as astronomy and
medicine. The Ottoman Empire began to decline in power following the defeat of its forces by European navies
at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. In the seventeenth century, the Ottomans found their power being eclipsed by
that of Russia in the Black Sea region.

4.3 The Safavid Empire

The establishment of the Safavid state under Shah Ismail I in 1501 was followed by rapid territorial expansion,
but conflict between factions of the Qizilbash military corps allowed the Ottoman and Uzbek empires to take
advantage and capture territory. Shahs Tahmasp and Abbas I created a corps of enslaved people from the
Caucasus to serve as their new elite military force and eventually replace the Qizilbash.

The Safavid shahs were committed to Shi`ite Islam and forcibly converted the Sunni Muslims in their
territories. They were generally more tolerant of non-Muslims, particularly those who did not live in the
Caucasus or along the border with the Ottoman Empire. But the Safavids' militance and their intolerance of
Sunnis heightened tensions between Sunnis and Shia throughout the Muslim world, a rift still apparent today.
The stability of the Safavids' political system allowed for a flourishing of art, however, as exemplified in
miniature painting, ceramics, and royal architecture. After Abbas, the growing power of Russia and other
neighboring kingdoms led to a weakened Safavid state, which came to an end when Nader Shah of the Afsharid
dynasty crowned himself shah in 1736.

5.4 The Atlantic Slave Trade

INTRODUCTION The sixteenth century was a time of momentous change in Europe. The Age of Exploration
began in the late 1400s with forays into the Atlantic by two European nations--Portugal and Spain. Although
these countries took the lead and Christopher Columbus has been glorified as a central figure in the history of
that exploration (Figure 5.1), they were soon joined by other European players including England, France, the
Netherlands, and Denmark. Their extensive overseas exploration and the exploding web of connections in the
Atlantic World--the Columbian Exchange, the colonization of the Americas, and the development of the
Atlantic slave trade--forever changed people's understanding of what the world was like and the face and
direction of history. Yet far more was altered in the sixteenth century than the human conception of the earth;
profound changes in European religious belief also transformed the way many Christians thought of the life
they hoped for beyond this one.

5.1 The Protestant Reformation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the causes of the Protestant Reformation
  · Describe differences between Protestant and Catholic beliefs
  · Discuss the spread of Protestantism in Europe and the wars of religion
  · Describe the Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation
When Columbus set sail across the Atlantic in 1492, the people of western and central Europe, regardless of
their country or language, were united by a common religion. In the same year as Columbus's momentous
voyage, Spain defeated the last Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula and expelled Jewish people from
the land. Muslims were given a brief respite, but in 1501 they too were ordered to leave or to convert to
Catholicism. With the exception of small Jewish communities in the Low Countries (Belgium and the
Netherlands) and the German lands, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, the people of western and
central Europe were uniformly Roman Catholics. Challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church were
brewing, however, and the passage of less than a century found Europeans hopelessly divided over matters of
faith as the result of an event known as the Protestant Reformation.

The Origins of the Protestant Reformation

The Protestant Reformation began in 1517, but its seeds had been sown years earlier. Over the course of the
Middle Ages, the Catholic Church had grown richer, and its higher clerical offices had become dominated by
people motivated more by the desire for wealth and power than by spiritual concerns. Although Europe's
peasants remained devoutly attached to their faith, critics claimed that popes acted less like Christ's
representatives on earth and more like secular princes, intervening in European political affairs and even
commanding armies. Members of the clergy often lived lavishly in palatial surroundings and dressed
themselves in silks and furs. Some had mistresses and illegitimate children, who were often given positions in
the church. Wealthy families often purchased church offices for their members, and some men held bishoprics
158 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       (areas under the authority of a bishop) in more than one place at a time by hiring other men to perform their
       offices. Secular rulers, kings, and princes jealous of the church's power sometimes vied with the pope for
       control of the churches in their territory and welcomed opportunities to reject the church's authority.

       During the fifteenth century, in the city-states of northern Italy, an intellectual movement called humanism
       had taken hold. Humanism stressed the value and dignity of human beings, and its scholars believed that,
       through the study of the philosophy, history, and literature of ancient Greece and Rome, people could improve
       themselves and live a "good life," which, in turn, would improve the societies in which they lived. Italian
       humanists were often devout Christians, and their study of ancient authors did not lead them to reject the
       teachings of the Catholic Church.

       In the second half of the fifteenth century, northern European scholars championed a form of humanism
       whose explicit goal was to make people better Christians. Northern Renaissance humanism, also called
       Christian humanism, stressed the study of the works of Greece and Rome together with the teachings of the
       early Christian fathers to improve the state of the human soul. The goal of learning was to awaken an inner
       sense of piety, and northern Renaissance humanists such as Desiderius Erasmus encouraged people to use
       Christian teachings as a guide to daily life. This inner transformation, they believed, was superior to engaging
       in such outer forms of religious devotion as going on pilgrimage or fasting at prescribed times of the year. By
       becoming better Christians, people would ultimately reform the church.

       Discontent among some European Catholics and an interest in spiritual transformation in northern Europe set
       the stage for a German monk named Martin Luther to try to eliminate the questionable practices of the
       medieval Roman Catholic Church. Luther's actions began the Protestant Reformation.

       In 1517, Luther, then a professor at the University of Wittenberg in Germany, became outraged when the
       Dominican friar Johann Tetzel began to sell indulgences in Wittenberg, authorized by Albert, archbishop of
       the city of Mainz. Indulgences were a way to reduce or even cancel the time after death during which people
       needed to suffer in purgatory to atone for their sins before reaching heaven. These rewards could be earned by
       performing actions of great religious merit, such as going on Crusade. However, the church also taught that the
       pope controlled a store of merit amassed by Jesus and the Christian saints, whose virtue was so great they had
       entered heaven with grace left over. The church could allot this "extra" virtue to someone else in the form of an
       indulgence.

       Luther had long been obsessed with thoughts of achieving salvation, the goal of all Christians. He was horrified
       at the idea that sinners might believe they could enter heaven not through repentance or God's mercy but by
       paying for an indulgence. He drafted ninety-five arguments explaining why the sale of indulgences was wrong,
       and according to many historians, he then nailed the Ninety-five Theses to the door of the castle church at
       Wittenberg. He also distributed printed copies throughout Germany and sent a copy to Archbishop Albert, who
       passed it along to Rome.

                                                                                                  IN THEIR OWN WORDS

       The Ninety-five Theses

         Martin Luther argued that the sale of indulgences was wrong. He believed only God could grant forgiveness and
         that humans could do nothing to ensure their salvation, which depended entirely upon God. This is known as the
         doctrine of justification by faith. Luther also said the pope had no control over purgatory and that there was no
         foundation in the Bible for the belief that the merit amassed by Jesus and the saints could be given to others. His
         intent in the Ninety-five Theses was to spark a discussion within the church that would lead to reform. Following
         are several of the theses.

               6. The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring and showing that it has been remitted by God;
               or, to be sure, by remitting guilt in cases reserved to his judgment. If his right to grant remission in these

        cases were disregarded, the guilt would certainly remain unforgiven.

        35. They who teach that contrition is not necessary on the part of those who intend to buy souls out of
        purgatory or to buy confessional privileges preach unchristian doctrine.

        36. Any truly repentant Christian has a right to full remission of penalty and guilt, even without
        indulgence letters.

        37. Any true Christian, whether living or dead, participates in all the blessings of Christ and the church;

        --Martin Luther, Ninety-five Theses

    · What does Luther say about the forgiveness of sin?
    · What evidence do you see that Luther had not yet completely broken with Catholic teachings?
    · Do you see evidence that Luther is trying to be conciliatory toward the pope? Do you see anything likely to

        anger the pope?

Although Luther had probably merely wished to reform the practices of the church, such as ending the sale of
indulgences, and not to spark a rebellion against the church, his actions were not seen that way. In 1518, he
was summoned by church authorities to answer questions regarding the position he expressed in the Ninety-
five Theses. At a meeting in the German city of Augsburg, Luther denied that the church had the power to
distribute merits amassed by Jesus and the saints. His beliefs were officially condemned by Pope Leo X, and he
was ordered to recant, which he refused to do. In 1521, he was excommunicated (excluded from participating
in the life of the church).

The version of Christianity that developed from Luther's ideas, and that formed the basis for what became the
Protestant faith, differed from the official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church in important ways. The
Catholic Church taught that salvation was achieved through a combination of religious faith and good works.
Buying an indulgence was regarded as a good work because the money went to the church. Luther taught that
faith alone was sufficient for salvation and that humans were unable to work toward their own redemption,
which depended entirely upon God (Figure 5.4). Furthermore, adherence to centuries' worth of Catholic
tradition was not necessary to be a good Christian. Luther contended that scripture alone should be the source
of Christian belief and practice. His followers thus abandoned many traditional Catholic practices, including
clerical celibacy. Luther, a monk, married Katharina von Bora, a former nun, and began a family. Protestants
also called for the abolition of religious orders of monks and nuns. A life in the clergy, which the Catholic
Church had proclaimed the greatest of all callings, was considered no better than the pursuit of any other
vocation in life. The printing press with movable type, developed in Europe during the Renaissance, aided
Martin Luther in his efforts to spread his message, and thousands of copies of Luther's writings circulated
throughout Europe.

      Calvinists, Anabaptists, and Anglicans

       Efforts to silence Martin Luther were unsuccessful, and the new form of Christianity called Protestantism
       spread throughout the German-speaking lands. By the end of the sixteenth century, it had become entrenched
       throughout western and central Europe as well. Often the new religion was welcomed by rulers as a reason to
       reject the pope's authority, and Luther called upon the German princes to do so.
       The Catholic Holy Roman emperor Charles V (who was also Charles I of Spain) steadfastly opposed
       Protestantism. However, the 1555 Peace of Augsburg secured for rulers in the empire who were Lutheran (as
       Luther's followers were called) the right to establish Lutheranism as the official religion within their lands if
       they wished. A prince's subjects were obliged to support the church he chose. Many rulers in northern
       Germany became Lutheran, but in Austria and Bavaria, in the southern part of the German-speaking lands, the
       Roman Catholic Church retained its power. No other religions were accommodated.
       In Switzerland, the ideas of the reformation that Luther began were embraced by Ulrich (Huldrych) Zwingli in
       the city of Zurich. Zwingli, who had been a priest, called for radical changes, such as a rejection of the Catholic
       tenet of transubstantiation, which held that Jesus was physically present in the communion wine and wafer
       consecrated during every Mass. Even Martin Luther had not gone so far. Zwingli also preached against fasting
       in the period before major religious holidays and called for religious imagery to be removed from churches. He
       banned organs from churches, shut monasteries and convents, and had the Bible printed in German rather
       than Latin. Zwingli also called for an end to clerical celibacy and proclaimed that the Bible never referred to

purgatory. He was killed in 1531 in a conflict between the Catholic and Protestant areas of Switzerland.

Among those inspired by Zwingli's ideas was Konrad Grebel, a Swiss merchant. Grebel was especially moved
by Zwingli's claims that baptism, through which people were admitted into church membership, should be
delayed until adulthood when a person is capable of making the choice to renounce sin. Finding Zwingli too
slow in reforming the Christian community in Zurich, however, Grebel established his own religious
movement in 1524, the Swiss Brethren.

The Swiss Brethren was one of several Anabaptist churches--churches rejecting infant baptism in favor of
adult baptism--that were established in the sixteenth century, primarily in central Europe and the Low
Countries. Because baptism was believed to remove the taint of original sin (the transgression of Adam and
Eve), infant baptism was the norm among Catholics and most Protestants as well. Anabaptists, however,
believed that only adults could meaningfully renounce sin and make a declaration of faith. Thus, only adults
could make the conscious decision to become Christians. But since people could be baptized only once, anyone
rebaptized as an adult was violating a tenet of the Catholic faith.

Other Anabaptist movements included the Hutterites, the Mennonites, and the Amish, which broke from the
larger Mennonite movement in the seventeenth century. Besides believing in adult baptism, Anabaptist groups
advocated the separation of church and state and tended to be pacifists. Because of their refusal to hold public
office, serve in the army, or accept secular rulers' right to control religious affairs, Anabaptists were widely
feared by most European rulers and were often subject to violent attacks.

Another center of Protestant thought was the city of Geneva in what is now Switzerland. The city's religious
leader, John Calvin, had been raised a Catholic in France, but he became a Protestant either before or shortly
after fleeing to Switzerland to escape persecution for his beliefs. His ideas were similar to those of Martin
Luther, but they differed in one crucial respect. Calvin espoused a doctrine known as predestination, which
held that God had predetermined which souls would be granted salvation upon death and which were destined
for hell. No person could ever know for certain whether they were saved or damned, and there was nothing
they could do to ensure salvation. Calvinists embraced the doctrine, and despite its denial of human agency,
they strove to lead a rigidly moral lifestyle focused on hard work and piety, seeking, in their ability to live like
people destined for heaven, reassurance that they had in fact been saved. They rejected dancing, public
drunkenness, gambling, and obscene speech as ungodly and fit for punishment by a special tribunal called the
Consistory. Calvinism spread rapidly outside Geneva and found adherents in the Netherlands who established
the Dutch Reformed Church, in Scotland where the Presbyterian Church was formed, and in France where its
adherents were called Huguenots.

Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, John Calvin, and the Anabaptist leaders were true believers in the doctrines they
espoused. The English Reformation, however, was of a different character. In England, reform was initially
imposed from the top down, not by a committed convert but by a king looking for an expedient way to
exchange one queen for another.

Until the moment he decided to remove himself from under the pope's authority, Henry VIII of England had a
reputation as a devout Catholic and a critic of Luther. He was married to Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of
the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella who were famous for defeating the Muslim kingdom of Granada
and expelling Jewish and Muslim people from the Iberian Peninsula. Henry and Catherine's marriage had
produced only one living child--a daughter, Mary. Although English law did not exclude women from inheriting
the throne, Henry wanted to take no chances with the succession following his death and desired a son whose
rule would go unchallenged.

Accordingly, against Catherine's wishes, Henry sought an annulment of his marriage so he might marry Anne
Boleyn, who he believed would give him sons. Unlike a divorce, which the Catholic Church did not permit, an
annulment simply declared a marriage null and void on the grounds it had never been legitimate. Henry
argued that, because Catherine had first been married to his late elder brother Arthur, Catholic Church law
162 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       prohibiting the marriage of close relatives should never have allowed her and Henry to wed. When the pope
       refused to annul the marriage, Henry declared the English church no longer bound by the pope's authority. In
       1534, Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, establishing the Church of England with the English monarch
       as its head. The archbishop of Canterbury, the highest spiritual authority in the land, finally granted the
       annulment of Henry and Catherine's marriage. Henry had already quietly married Anne in time to see her give
       birth to a daughter, Elizabeth (later Elizabeth I).

       Under Henry's leadership, the Church of England (also known as the Anglican Church) remained largely
       Catholic in terms of both doctrine and ritual. Henry closed England's monasteries, but his failure to purge the
       English Church of all elements of Roman Catholicism did not sit well with many Protestants. Upon Henry's
       death, his son Edward VI, whose mother Jane Seymour had been Henry's third wife, became king. Because
       Edward was still a minor, England was governed by regents who took steps to make the Anglican Church more
       Protestant, a move with which the young Edward agreed. Priests were allowed to marry. The practice of using
       rosary beads in prayer was denounced. Church processions were prohibited, and statues and stained-glass
       windows were removed from churches. The mass service was reformed, eliminating many Roman Catholic
       rituals, and the English-language Book of Common Prayer, published in 1549, laid out the new church service.
       Ministers who refused to use the Book of Common Prayer risked being removed from their positions and
       imprisoned.

      The Catholic Reformation and the Wars of Religion

       The leaders of the Catholic Church did not sit idly by as its members deserted it for new faiths. The Catholic
       Reformation, also called the Counter-Reformation, was the Catholic Church's effort to address Luther's
       challenges as well as to effect other necessary reforms. One means to do so was the 1545 Council of Trent.
       There, Europe's bishops and other clerics affirmed that both good works and faith were required for salvation
       and that both scripture (as interpreted by the church) and tradition were acceptable sources of authority. The
       council also affirmed the doctrine of transubstantiation. Aware of very real problems within the church, the
       council undertook a series of reforms as well. Indulgences were retained, but their sale was forbidden. The
       council prohibited church officials from appointing relatives to church offices, limited bishops to holding office
       in only one bishopric, and took steps to improve the education of Catholic clergy and curb their luxurious
       habits.

       Another aspect of the Catholic Reformation was the creation of new religious orders. Founded by the Spanish
       noble Ignatius of Loyola, the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, assumed a number of tasks, chiefly the
       education of young Catholic men. They also undertook responsibility for the conversion of non-Christians to
       Roman Catholicism and for acting as advisers to the Catholic rulers of Europe. Unlike other religious orders,
       the Jesuits did not have a female branch. Instead, the Ursuline order of nuns, founded a few years before,
       undertook the education of young women.

       Although the Catholic Reformation undoubtedly prevented the defection of many Catholics to Protestant
       churches, the new churches continued to gain adherents in many parts of Europe. At times, this was a peaceful
       process. At other times, wars erupted as devout Catholics did battle with equally devout Protestants to protect
       what both sides believed was the only true expression of Christian faith.

       The transition from Catholicism to Protestantism in England was more peaceful than elsewhere. While Henry
       VIII's Catholic daughter Mary I, the child of Catherine of Aragon, occupied the throne following her brother
       Edward's death, Protestants were persecuted, and hundreds were executed as the queen tried to restore
       England to the Catholic Church. Mary died in 1558 before she could achieve this, however. Her younger half-
       sister, Elizabeth I, wished to govern an orderly, stable country, and while late in her reign she did persecute
       Catholics she felt posed a threat to her Protestant rule, she adopted a relatively moderate approach to religion
       during her early years on the throne (Figure 5.5).

Parliament's 1558 Act of Supremacy once again declared the Church of England separate from the Roman
Catholic Church. The following year, the Act of Uniformity of 1559 brought back the Book of Common Prayer as
the only legal form of worship in England. Some concessions were made, however, to those who did not wish to
abandon Catholic ritual. The condemnation of the pope contained in an earlier version of the book was
removed, and the communion ritual was described in a way that avoided making a clear statement about
transubstantiation. Clergy could continue to wear traditional Catholic robes and ornaments.
During Elizabeth's reign, English Calvinists, known as Puritans, attempted unsuccessfully to move the Church
of England even further from the doctrine and ritual of the Catholic Church. Many clergy in the English church
were Puritans, and they objected to wearing Catholic robes during church services and making the sign of the
cross during baptism. By the 1570s and 1580s, Puritans had also come to oppose the structure of the Church
of England, in which the monarch was the head of the church. They believed churches should be independent
and governed by groups of elected elders instead of a king or queen. Elizabeth was unwilling to change the
manner in which the Church of England was governed, however. During the reign of her successor James I,
Puritans who wished to separate from the Church of England (known as Separatists) began to depart England
for places, including mainland Europe and North America, where they believed they would be able to establish
ideal Christian communities. In the reign of Charles I, James's son, other Puritans also began to leave.

       English Puritans who immigrated to British colonies in North America used a book called The New England

       short rhymes to help children remember the letters: "A. In Adam's fall we sinned all."

       Outside England, the dispute over whether a kingdom should be Catholic or Protestant could be quite violent.
       In 1572 in France, warfare between Huguenots and Catholics culminated in the August 23 St. Bartholomew's
       Day massacre, assassinations targeting prominent Huguenots who had come to Paris for a royal wedding.
       Peace was restored only when the Huguenot Henry IV succeeded to the throne of France, converted to
       Catholicism (the religion of the majority of French people), and issued the Edict of Nantes in 1598. The edict
       established Catholicism as the official religion of France but also granted Huguenots the right to worship as
       they chose.

       In the Spanish Netherlands, Philip II of Spain, son and heir of Charles V, fought against Calvinist rebels. War
       raged from 1568 until a truce was signed in 1609. (After Philip's death in 1598, his son Philip III fought on after
       him.) Peace was restored, but the seven northern provinces established their independence from Spain as the
       United Provinces of the Netherlands. The Netherlands was not the only place in which Philip II, who regarded
       himself and Spain as defenders of Catholicism, fought to maintain the church's supremacy. In 1588, he
       launched a naval attack on England with the intent of restoring it to the Catholic Church and ending its support
       for Protestant rebels in the Spanish Netherlands. The invasion failed. The Spanish armada was famously
       outmaneuvered by the smaller, faster English ships, and as the remaining vessels started for home by sailing
       north around Scotland and Ireland, most were destroyed by a storm.

       The wars of religion continued into the seventeenth century. From 1618 to 1648, the Thirty Years' War
       between Catholic and Protestant states raged in the Holy Roman Empire. As German Catholics, Lutherans, and
       Calvinists fought one another, other European countries entered the fray. Sweden, a Lutheran land, supported
       the Protestant German rulers, as did the United Provinces of the Netherlands. Denmark also entered the war in
       the hopes of gaining German territory to offset its losses to Sweden in recent conflicts. France joined in on the
       side of the Protestants, primarily in an effort to become the preeminent power in Europe. Despite the
       multinational nature of the combatants, battles were fought almost entirely within the German lands, whose
       people suffered as armies of mercenaries destroyed farms and villages. In the end, the German Protestants
       were victorious, and France had become the dominant country in western Europe. The Peace of Westphalia,
       which ended the war in 1648, established the independence of each of the entities, numbering nearly one
       thousand, that had made up the Holy Roman Empire.

Christopher Columbus in the 1490s, underwritten by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain.

The Rise of Maritime Nations

Christopher Columbus's 1492 voyage did not represent the first contact between European explorers and
Indigenous peoples on the North American continent. Through archaeological and historical research,
historians can now date that contact to nearly five hundred years before Columbus reached his first stop in the
Caribbean.
In the early 1000s, Leif Erikson, a Viking explorer living in Greenland, heard from fellow explorer Bjarni
Herjólfsson that another land lay only a few hundred miles to the west. In a journey during which he was blown
off course, Erikson found a land to the west that he called Vinland, for the grapes that grew near its shores. He
stayed there only through the winter, never making direct contact with the Indigenous peoples and returning
to Greenland in the spring. His brother Thorvald was the first to make contact, which ended in violent conflict
and the deaths of several Native Americans and Thorvald himself. In a third exploration, men and women of
Erikson's family encountered the Indigenous people of Vinland again but maintained peace, creating a small
but steady relationship with them based on trade (Figure 5.6).

(medieval Scandinavian) place names, like Markland (Labrador Peninsula) and Helluland (Baffin Island). (credit:

The Viking explorers referred to these Indigenous peoples as Skraelings. Scholars are not sure which
Indigenous group they belonged to, but twentieth-century archaeological digs in Nova Scotia have verified
much of the information found in the Icelandic sagas of Vinland. In the 1960s, explorers Helge and Anne
Ingstad discovered in Newfoundland, Canada, the buried ruins of a Viking camp from around the time of
Erikson's explorations, in a place called L'Anse aux Meadows. This find definitively proved at last that the Norse
had traveled to the Americas before Columbus. Over the years, it has been suggested that other people besides
the Vikings also discovered the Americas before Columbus, including Irish monks, African sailors, and
Chinese members of Admiral Zheng He's treasure fleet. There is no widely accepted proof of any of these

       voyages, however.

       The settlements in Newfoundland never became permanent, likely because Indigenous groups developed an
       increasing hostility toward the often-violent Vikings. By the 1400s, the frontier colonies of Greenland
       populated by Norse peoples had also all but disappeared. But knowledge of a land farther west survived in the
       Norse sagas, and it is possible that it trickled across Europe into Italy and Spain and eventually into the mind
       of a young Christopher Columbus.
       In the meantime, with the collapse of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in
       1453, many Europeans felt a sense of doom. Not only had they lost a bastion of Christian power, but Muslims
       now controlled their tenuous overland connections to South and East Asia. As a result, they now had to go
       through Muslim intermediaries to purchase valuable spices such as cinnamon, pepper, cloves, and nutmeg
       that grew in only a few key locations. European nations, therefore, wanted to find an all-water passage to India
       and the chain of sparsely populated Indonesian islands known as the Spice Islands.
       In the fifteenth century, Europe experienced a timely navigational revolution as a result of adopting new non-
       Western maritime technologies. In the first millennium CE, Arab sailors in the Middle East had created the
       lateen sail, a triangular sail that allowed ships to travel against the wind. The square European sail gave ships
       power, but the lateen sail increased their ability to maneuver. When Europeans combined the two kinds of sail
       on three-masted ships, they could navigate confidently in any direction. The sternpost rudder, created in
       China in the thirteenth century, also allowed for steering against the currents. For directional guidance, the
       ancient Greek astrolabe, which used constellations as a guide and enabled mariners to find their north-south
       position on the earth's surface, came to Europe after being refined in the Middle East (Figure 5.7). The
       magnetic compass also came to Europe in the fifteenth century, making its way from China where it was
       guiding ships by 1100 CE. The adoption of these inventions allowed Europeans to abandon their long-standing
       practice of navigating by sailing along a coastline. Now they could venture into the open ocean, beyond sight of
       land.

However, technological advancements and a desire for expanded trade and territory could take explorers only
so far without financial backing. The commercial empire that funded European overseas exploration began in
the Italian city-states of the Middle Ages, but the investment system on which it was based did not originate
there. This system, called commenda, established a sort of financial patronage by which investors funded
merchants to expand their trading enterprises and earned a more extensive business network in the process.
Like many of the technologies that drove European ships, the commenda was first developed by Muslim
merchants.
By the late fifteenth century, Italian city-states were supporting a variety of small family-owned businesses and
large companies. Capital was concentrated in land and commerce rather than in industrial pursuits, but credit
was widely used. Across Europe, risk-sharing business ventures and joint investment schemes were already
commonplace among merchants. Spain, which Muslim rulers had conquered and settled, had connections
across the Mediterranean to Africa and the Middle East, while northern and central Europe wielded a
sprawling maritime exchange across the North and Baltic Seas.

       Portuguese Exploration
       In the late 1400s, both Portugal and Spain were emerging from centuries of rule by North African Muslim
       states. Portugal had become an independent country by the twelfth century (Figure 5.8). At the beginning of
       the fifteenth century, it was a small country with poor soil. However, it did have one advantage--a geographical
       location that lent itself to exploration, specifically down the African coastline and across the Atlantic. Portugal
       also had plenty of coves and natural harbors suited for shipping, and speedy crosswinds and currents that
       gave it a shipping superhighway of sorts between northern and southern Europe. Various nearby islands such
       as the Azores also teemed with untapped fishing potential.

       In the 1340s, King Afonso IV of Portugal raised public funds to build a commercial fleet that by the fifteenth
       century had transformed the nation into a maritime power. In 1341, the Portuguese sailed to the Canary
       Islands in the Atlantic. This was only the beginning of their exploration and conquest. In 1415, John I,
       grandson of Afonso IV, dispatched Portuguese forces to capture the city of Ceuta in Morocco. John hoped that
       control of a port on the North African coast would open that continent to both conquest and trade. To further
       cement his control of the region, he requested papal recognition of his efforts. In April 1418, Pope Martin V
       granted the Portuguese king the right to all African lands taken from Muslim rulers.
       Under John's son Prince Henry, dubbed "the Navigator" by historians, Portuguese explorers claimed the

Madeira Islands, the Azores, and the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa. They also sailed down the
western coast of Africa as far as today's Sierra Leone. Eventually, Portuguese expeditions reached the southern
tip of Africa, and in 1488, Bartolomeu Dias, who had participated in the Battle of Ceuta, sailed around the Cape
of Good Hope to reach the eastern side of the continent.
The Portuguese were driven by both religious fervor and a desire for wealth. Since the Middle Ages, they, like
other Europeans, had been intrigued by stories of a lost Christian kingdom somewhere in Africa or Asia, ruled
by a legendary king named Prester John (Figure 5.9). By the 1400s, they had come to believe his lands were
located in Africa, and their hope of forming an alliance with him to defeat the forces of Islam helped motivate
their exploration there.

the late 1550s by the Portuguese mapmaker Diogo Homem. (credit: "East Africa with Prester John enthroned" by

The Portuguese also hoped to gain access to the wealth of Africa. As they moved southward along the
continent's coast, they established citadels on land leased from local rulers, like the fortress of Elmina, located
on the coast of present-day Ghana. From there, they bartered for gold, ivory, and enslaved people. The first
shipment of enslaved Africans arrived in Portugal in 1441. To further its economic interests, Portugal also
established relations with the African kingdoms of Benin and Kongo. Its connection to Kongo, in what is now
Angola, was particularly close. Members of Kongo's ruling family and nobility converted to Roman Catholicism
and adopted Portuguese names. Kongo became an important source of enslaved laborers, and its kings readily
assisted the Portuguese in taking captives from enemy tribes. The Portuguese claim to the riches of African
trade was affirmed in 1455 in the Romanus Pontifex, a papal decree issued by Pope Nicholas V that granted
Portugal exclusive rights to trade in Africa south of Cape Bojador, on the coast of Morocco. The interests of the
Africans who controlled these lands were not considered.
Spanish Exploration
Despite the Romanus Pontifex, the Spanish monarchs Isabella I of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon were not
willing to allow Portugal to take the lead in establishing maritime trade with places outside Europe. By 1492,
the final Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula had been defeated, and, no longer worried about the
170 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       threat posed by the Muslim presence, Isabella and Ferdinand could turn to matters beyond the peninsula. In
       1486, the Genoese navigator Christopher Columbus approached them with a request for funds for exploration.
       Columbus proposed that he could reach Asia by sailing westward across the Atlantic Ocean. Eager to find an
       all-water route to Asia to compete with the Portuguese, Isabella and Ferdinand agreed to his request. Like the
       Portuguese monarchs, they were also dedicated to spreading Christianity and combating the spread of Islam.
       Indeed, they regarded themselves as Europe's foremost defenders of Roman Catholicism.
       On August 3, 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain with three ships. After stopping briefly in the Canary Islands,
       he set off again on September 6. Five weeks later, he reached the Bahamas, which he believed were a part of
       Southeast Asia called the Indies. From there, he sailed to Cuba and an island Columbus named Hispaniola
       (meaning "little Spain"), the island now divided between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Columbus made
       contact with the inhabitants of Hispaniola, whom he called "Indians." Some welcomed the Europeans, who
       attempted to learn whether the inhabitants had gold, but one group, perhaps mistrusting the newcomers,
       engaged them in battle.
       Leaving behind a handful of men to found a settlement on Hispaniola, Columbus and his crew departed for
       Europe, taking with them some Arawak people they had kidnapped. They arrived in Spain in 1493, with
       Columbus believing he had succeeded in reaching the Indies. He returned to the Americas three more times
       (Figure 5.10). On the third voyage, he explored the coast of Venezuela, which he was certain was part of the
       Asian mainland.

 Columbus Day vs. Indigenous Peoples' Day

  Local governments across the United States have recently begun replacing the federal holiday honoring
  Christopher Columbus with one honoring the role of Indigenous peoples in the nation's past and present. South
  Dakota began the trend as far back as 1989, but Columbus's place in history remains controversial. While some
  believe he should be honored, others, including many Native Americans, believe that as a known enslaver of
  Africans and Native Americans, he should not be glorified.

  The adoption of Columbus as the original "American son" who "discovered America" was once meant to
  humanize immigrants and minority populations, particularly Italian Catholics who had come to the northeastern
  United States in the late 1800s. (Columbus was Italian and Catholic.) But at the same time, the U.S. government
  continued to exile Indigenous peoples from their homelands and suppress their religion and culture. Many
  historians also argue that Columbus opened the door not just to European settlement but also to disease,
  oppression, and genocide. The debate about whether the holiday named for him is culturally insensitive
  continues.

    · How might the continued celebration of Columbus Day affect Indigenous communities?
    · How should U.S. citizens decide whether and how to change federal holidays? Who should or should not be

        honored by such holidays? Why?

Soon, however, Europeans came to realize that the lands Columbus had found were new continents, which
were then named the Americas after the Italian mapmaker Amerigo Vespucci, who accompanied later Spanish
and Portuguese voyages to South America. This was the beginning of European colonialism in the Americas.
Colonialism is a practice in which one group of people attempts to establish control over another, usually for
purposes of economic exploitation. The lands in the Americas to which the Spanish, Portuguese, and other
European nations laid claim in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were incorporated into the colonial
empires these countries were beginning to build.

Columbus's expeditions did not produce the riches the Spanish monarchs had hoped for. Nevertheless, Spain's
exploration of the new continents continued, led by conquistadors. Some of these explorers were nobles or
had military training and had fought against the Muslims in Spain; others were landless and wished to
improve their lot in life. One instrument by which the Spanish government compensated conquistadors was
the encomienda, a hereditary grant that entitled the holder, called an encomendero, to the labor of a specified
number of conquered people, or to a tribute of precious metals or agricultural produce. Although the Crown
forbade the enslavement of Indigenous peoples, the encomienda system enabled their abuse at the hands of
Spanish settlers who hoped to profit from their labor (Figure 5.11).

       workers against the encomenderos. (credit: "An indigenous Mexican complaint against an abusive encomendero" by

       The great prizes the Spanish hoped to find were soon discovered in Mexico. In 1519, the conquistador Hernán
       Cortés landed at Potonchan on the Yucatán Peninsula and marched north to the interior of Mexico, where he
       encountered the powerful Aztec Empire. The wealth of the Aztecs and the sophistication of their capital city of
       Tenochtitlán dazzled the Spanish. At first the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II welcomed them and presented
       them with gifts. Cortés, however, took Moctezuma prisoner and used him as a puppet to attempt to control his
       people. Conflict erupted in 1520 when the Spanish killed participants in an Aztec religious ritual, and the
       residents of Tenochtitlán attacked the conquistadors. In the chaos Moctezuma II was killed, possibly by his
       own people who felt he had betrayed them, and the Spanish, facing destruction, fled Tenochtitlán for the
       nearby city of Tlaxcala, a rival of Tenochtitlán (Figure 5.12).

 Massacre in the Temple

  The Aztecs rose against the Spanish following their attack on worshippers at an Aztec religious ritual at the Great
  Temple in Tenochtitlán. One of the gods to be honored there was Huitzilopochtli, a god of war. The uprising was
  briefly successful, and the Spanish were temporarily driven from the city. The following excerpt is an Aztec
  account of the Spanish attack.

        During this time, the people asked Motecuhzoma how they should celebrate their god's fiesta. He said:
        "Dress him in all his finery, in all his sacred ornaments."
        During this same time . . . . The Spaniards hanged a chief from Acolhuacan named Nezahualquentzin.
        They also murdered the king of Nauhtla, Cohualpopocatzin, by wounding him with arrows and then
        burning him alive.
        For this reason, our warriors were on guard at the Eagle Gate . . . . But messengers came to tell them to
        dress the figure of Huitzilopochtli. They left their posts and went to dress him in his sacred finery: his
174 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

               ornaments and his paper clothing.

               When this had been done, the celebrants began to sing their songs. That is how they celebrated the first
               day of the fiesta. On the second day they began to sing again, but without warning they were all put to
               death. The dancers and singers were completely unarmed. . . .

               The Spaniards attacked the musicians first, slashing at their hands and faces until they had killed all of
               them. The singers--and even the spectators--were also killed. This slaughter in the Sacred Patio went on
               for three hours. Then the Spaniards burst into the rooms of the temple to kill the others: those who were
               carrying water, or bringing fodder for the horses, or grinding meal, or sweeping, or standing watch over
               this work.

               The king Motecuhzoma, who was accompanied by . . . those who had brought food for the Spaniards,
               protested: "Our lords, that is enough! What are you doing? These people are not carrying shields. . . . Our
               lords, they are completely unarmed!"

               --Miguel Léon-Portilla, The Broken Spears: The Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico

           · What may have motivated this attack? Why might the Spanish have chosen to attack people at a religious
               festival?

           · Do the Aztecs seem to have had any idea of what was going to happen? Explain your answer.

       Cortés and his Tlaxcalan allies returned to Tenochtitlán in May 1521. By this time, the Aztecs were beginning
       to suffer from infectious diseases brought by the Spanish. Smallpox was a likely culprit, but other diseases may
       have been spreading as well. (For example, evidence exists that an outbreak of salmonella in 1540 also took
       many Aztec lives.) Badly weakened, the Aztecs could not defeat Cortés and his Indigenous allies. After a siege
       of three months, Tenochtitlán fell to the Spanish, who began converting the Aztecs to Christianity. Although
       some Aztecs converted voluntarily, many were forced. Aztec temples were destroyed, and Catholic Churches
       were built on top of them. The Spanish renamed Tenochtitlán Mexico City, and it became the capital of the
       colony of New Spain. The colony eventually provided Spanish monarchs with the wealth they craved in the
       form of rich silver deposits.

       Cortés's exploits in Mexico were soon matched by those of another Spanish adventurer, Francisco Pizarro, who
       conquered the Inca Empire in South America. In January 1530, Pizarro sailed from the Canary Islands on an
       expedition to conquer Peru, which he had heard was rich in precious metals. His conquest had been
       authorized in 1529 by Queen Isabella of Portugal, the wife of Holy Roman emperor Charles V, who was also
       king of Spain. The Inca ruler had recently died of smallpox, and rival heirs to the throne were at war. Pizarro
       took advantage of the chaos and the fact that the Inca forces had been depleted by years of fighting. In 1532, he
       captured Atahualpa, one of the parties in the civil war; the following year, the Spanish executed him, despite
       his promises to fill an entire room with gold and two with silver if Pizarro set him free. Pizarro then seized
       control of Cuzco, the Inca capital. Peru, which like Mexico had extensive silver deposits, was reduced to a
       Spanish colony.

       The Inca did not passively accept Spanish rule. Under the leader Manco Inca, about 100,000 Incas lay siege to
       Cuzco in 1536. They lacked the gunpowder weapons of the Spanish, however, and could not drive the
       Europeans out. The Spanish divided the Inca Empire into four regions, each with a Spanish governor, and
       Pizarro was given the territory that corresponds to the modern country of Peru.

       The Treaty of Tordesillas

       Word of Columbus's discoveries on behalf of the Spanish alarmed and angered the Portuguese. Under the
       terms of the 1479 Treaty of Alcáçovas, Portugal had renounced any claim to the Spanish throne and granted
       Spain control of the Canary Islands. In exchange, Portugal received the coast of Guinea in Africa, which was

rich in gold, and all islands in the Atlantic south of the Canaries. This included not only those territories
Portugal already controlled (Madeira, the Azores, and Cape Verde) but also any that might be discovered in the
future. In 1481, the pope also issued a decree that granted Portugal territories in the Atlantic.
Spain's claim to the Caribbean islands Columbus had explored thus seemed to violate both the treaty and the
pope's decree. The Portuguese king announced his intention to send an armed fleet to take control of them.
Unable to challenge Portugal's dominance at sea, Isabella and Ferdinand asked Pope Alexander VI to intercede.
The pope, who was Spanish, decreed that all lands belonged to Spain that fell west of a line drawn one hundred
leagues west of any of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands.
Portugal accordingly began negotiations with Spain, which consented to move the line dividing Spanish from
Portuguese possessions farther to the west. The new line cut across the eastern bulge of the South American
continent (now part of Brazil) but left the rest of the Americas to Spain. This agreement, the Treaty of
Tordesillas, was signed in 1494 and endorsed in 1506 by a decree of Pope Julius II (Figure 5.13). Thus, when
the explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on the eastern coast of South America in 1500, he was able to claim it
for Portugal.

the Treaty of Tordesillas. It cuts north to south through the Atlantic Ocean and across the eastern portion of Brazil.

Meridian Line set under the Treaty of Tordesillas" by Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
By the time Cabral made landfall in Brazil in 1500, Portuguese sailors had already rounded the Cape of Good
Hope at the tip of southern Africa and sailed up that continent's eastern coast and on to India. Hoping to lay
claim to the riches of Asia, Spain then argued that the line dividing the Atlantic continued to the other side of
the globe, bisecting the Pacific and giving the Spanish the right to territories in Asia as well. Portugal objected
and turned to the Vatican again for help. In 1514, Pope Leo X declared that the line described in the Treaty of
Tordesillas allocated territories in the Atlantic but not the Pacific. Spain had no claim to the lands of Asia.
176 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       Spain renewed its argument in 1522 when an expeditionary fleet that had been captained by Ferdinand
       Magellan returned to Europe after circumnavigating the globe. Magellan had been in the employ of Spain when
       he found a means of reaching Asia by sailing around the southern tip of South America. The expedition had
       reached the Maluku Islands (or the Moluccas, in modern Indonesia), the source of valuable spices, and Spain
       wished to claim this territory, which Portugal had already explored in 1512. To settle their claims to the
       islands, in 1529 Portugal and Spain signed the Treaty of Zaragoza, dividing the Pacific Ocean between them.
       The treaty awarded the Maluku Islands to Portugal with the understanding that should Spain wish to claim
       them it could, but it would have to compensate Portugal for its loss. Spain did not have the money to do so, and
       this fact, along with a convenient marriage of the Spanish and Portuguese kings to one another's sisters, led
       Spain to abandon its claim to the Malukus.

       In the treaties of Zaragoza and Tordesillas, two of the world's nations divided the globe between them, never
       questioning their right to do so and turning repeatedly to the pope to give God's sanction to their claims.
       Unsurprisingly, however, the world's other nations ignored both treaties. England and the Netherlands, which
       had become Protestant nations during the Reformation, felt no need to abide by papal decrees, nor did France,
       though it remained Roman Catholic. As the French king Francis I explained, "The sun shines for me as it does
       for others." As the fortunes of Spain and Portugal declined in the seventeenth century, England, France, and
       the Netherlands claimed territory in Asia and the Americas and established their own trading posts on the
       African coast. Spain and Portugal also failed to acknowledge the rights of the Indigenous peoples in the lands
       they claimed. Indeed, many Europeans believed that by conquering the inhabitants of the Americas and giving
       them no choice but to convert to Christianity, they were saving their souls.

      The Columbian Exchange

       The impact of Portuguese and Spanish exploration and settlement went far beyond the political and economic
       implications. The so-called Columbian Exchange began with the first contact between native peoples and
       Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean in 1492. This phrase refers to the back-and-forth flow of plants,
       animals, and diseases between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Far more than physical products were
       traded, however. Ideas, religious practices, enslaved peoples, and cultural traditions also crossed the Atlantic
       to reshape, blend, and sometimes destroy various civilizations in the process.

       The world into which Columbus stepped in 1492 was just as complex, diverse, and dangerous as the one he left
       behind. In the Americas, empires rose and fell, people married and raised families, individuals sought to
       better their lives by moving and innovating. But key differences shaped the collisions to come. One of the most
       fundamental was the perception of human nature and human origins. For Europeans, the world, its history,
       and its progression were linear. Just as the Christian Bible described, in the beginning there was darkness.
       Then God created light along with the world, and one day that world would come to an end. This belief
       influenced Europeans' perception that time progressed in a straight line along which humans were always
       moving forward. All things had a beginning, a point or climax, and an ending.

       But for many Indigenous peoples, the world was cyclical and infinite. The Aztecs, for example, believed that the
       world in which they lived was but the latest in a series of worlds that had been created and destroyed. Their
       world would continue to exist only so long as they fed the sun with the blood of sacrificial victims. In
       Indigenous concepts of the cosmos, no hard separations existed between humans and nature, or between
       spiritual and human realms. Many religious belief systems were animistic, meaning the spiritual world resided
       not just in humans but also in animals, plants, and even rocks. This belief was very different from
       monotheism, in which all spiritual power resided in one single divine being. Indigenous religions did not focus
       on sin or on the nature of good and evil. Instead, the spiritual world was a place full of power that humans
       could harness for either good or evil. Though their specific beliefs varied widely, all Indigenous groups in the
       Western Hemisphere held these basic views about their existence and their relationship to others and to the
       world.

       Like humans, animals, and plants, the earth possessed sacred power; therefore, it could not be owned. The

concept of owning land seemed nonsensical to many Indigenous groups, and their corresponding lack of
emphasis on private property was one reason Europeans sometimes found it easy to lay claim to lands
inhabited by native peoples.

Indigenous Americans also differed from Europeans of the 1400s in their approach to gender. While
Indigenous women did complete some of the same tasks as European women, such as cooking, making
clothing, and raising children, they also took part in activities that Europeans believed should be done by men
and that in Europe usually were. For example, in many Indigenous societies, women were the principal
farmers and built the family's dwelling. In many groups, women were revered as imbued with sacred powers to
heal and to create. This power also gave them a strong voice in the leadership of their communities, and in
some of these, women sat on tribal councils. Among the Iroquois of North America, for example, women often
attended tribal councils to advise male clan representatives, and women chose the tribe's male leaders. Among
the Wampanoag of southern New England, women could serve as tribal leaders.

In many tribes, individuals who did not accept the roles traditionally assigned to people of their sex had far
more freedom to live as they desired than did such people in Europe. Women who wished to live as men and
men who wished to live and dress as women did not necessarily face punishment or maltreatment as long as
they contributed to society in other ways. For example, in some societies, women became hunters and
warriors. In many societies, men who felt they had been born with the souls of women dressed as women,
pursued women's occupations, and became the second or third wives of other men. Such men were often
regarded as possessing great spiritual power and were treated with respect.

When Columbus arrived, the Indigenous population of the entire Western Hemisphere likely numbered
around seventy-five million (compared to Europe's population of probably around seventy million), although
historians' estimates vary greatly. Indigenous peoples made up more than six hundred groups or tribes in
North America alone. Some, such as the Inuit and the Dene, were mostly hunter-gatherers in cold climates
inhospitable to farming. Others farther south, such as the Puebloans and the Creek, farmed extensively,
growing maize as the staple of their food economies. These groups often adopted political organizations
practical for their environment. Hunter-gatherers such as the Apache lived as small bands of unified family
units with a designated leader. Among township societies such as the Iroquois, groups of towns joined to form
political confederacies. In the Aztec and Inca empires, large urban populations were ruled by monarchs.

As part of the Columbian Exchange, Europeans introduced to the Americas the crops they were familiar with at
home, including wheat; the Vitis vinifera species of grape; fruits such as pears, peaches, and many varieties of
apples; and vegetables such as onions and garlic. The first two were especially important for the Spanish and
Portuguese. Wheat was needed to make the communion wafers that were a necessary part of the Roman
Catholic mass, and European grapes were needed to make wine for the same ceremony. For the most part,
Native Americans had little interest in adopting European foods, but the arrival of nonedible resources created
an immediate impact. Metal cookware and metal weaponry gave great power to those who chose to adopt
them.

European, Asian, and African societies also changed as new plant life was brought eastward across the
Atlantic. Indigenous peoples in North America had relied on maize (corn) for thousands of years, and varieties
of potatoes, including sweet potatoes, had long been staples among Indigenous peoples in South America.
Along with these foods, tomatoes, chili peppers, vanilla, manioc, pineapples, and peanuts were introduced to
and became culinary staples of nations in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Chocolate, which had been consumed in
liquid form by the Aztec and the Maya, and tobacco, another product from the Americas, became especially
popular in Europe (Figure 5.14).

       Coffee and sugar cane, introduced to the Americas by Europeans, grew exceedingly well in the tropical
       climates of the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and the southernmost portions of North America.
       The widespread adoption of these foods in the rest of the world began a chain reaction of increased demand
       for them and for agricultural labor. This need for labor eventually led to the plantation-style slavery that took
       hold in parts of the United States, islands in the Caribbean, and areas of South America such as Brazil.
       Plant life was not the only item exchanged across the Atlantic; a variety of animals accompanied Europeans as
       they journeyed across the ocean and back. Horses, cows, goats, sheep, pigs, and chickens all made the Atlantic
       crossing to the Americas. These animals transformed the life of many Indigenous communities. In North
       America, tribes such as the Lakota moved onto the Great Plains and created a way of life based on hunting
       bison following their adoption of the horse. The Navajo became sheep herders and expert weavers of woolen
       textiles. Tribes in Mexico and Central and South America began to raise chickens and goats, which provided
       valuable sources of protein.
       Deadly pathogens also made the crossing to the Americas and caused one of the worst disease-based disasters
       in history. Given limited understanding of epidemic science, no one realized that native peoples had virtually
       none of the resistance and immunity Europeans had developed to infectious diseases, because the animals
       that originally spawned them (and from which they had jumped to humans) simply did not exist in the
       Americas (Figure 5.15). When these diseases were brought by Europeans and the enslaved Africans who often

accompanied them, native peoples without natural immunity who contracted them experienced a death rate
that some scholars estimate was as high as 95 percent.

Lack of exposure to European livestock or European diseases is not the sole reason the Indigenous peoples of
the Americas died in such large numbers, however. Smallpox, typhus, measles, bubonic plague, influenza,
salmonella, and other diseases took the lives of millions of people throughout the Americas because of the
destruction wrought by Europeans. European settlers often allowed their livestock to roam loose, and these
animals, especially hogs, wreaked havoc on the crops planted by Indigenous peoples. In places where the
Spanish conducted slave raids, Indigenous people often went into hiding, refusing to venture out to farm, fish,
or tend their fields for fear of being captured. The resulting malnutrition weakened their immune systems,
making it harder for them to fight off infectious diseases, even those with which their bodies were familiar. In
heavily settled, densely populated regions, infectious diseases spread rapidly. Bodies weakened by one disease
easily succumbed to subsequent infections.
Other factors also contributed to depopulation across the Western continents. Groups intent on colonizing,
such as the Spanish in New Spain, wanted to establish economies that exported wealth and materials to the
home country. To that end, the infrastructure they built intentionally depleted local environments and
deprived Indigenous peoples of the natural resources within their lands, including fertile soil, water, timber,
and precious metals. When Indigenous populations did not accept these economic conditions, they were met
with violence against themselves and their families.
Given violence, exile, enslavement, and a high death rate from disease, the original inhabitants of the Western
Hemisphere experienced a cataclysm during the sixteenth century. They still resisted European incursions,
however, beginning a centuries-long struggle with echoes in the present day. Within a few months of his
exploring the Caribbean region, for example, Native leaders began directing Columbus to other islands,
deflecting the negative consequences that followed the arrival of Europeans. Sometimes Indigenous groups
chose violence to resist European violence.
180 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       Not all Indigenous peoples reacted with violence, however. During the often-brutal colonization of the Western
       Hemisphere, many systems of gender, religious beliefs, and societal organization that existed in the Americas
       did collapse, while others merged or changed, creating new hybrid societies across the American continents
       and the Caribbean islands. But many Indigenous groups chose to incorporate facets of European material
       culture, such as tools and weapons, into their own in ways that allowed for their survival. For example, the
       Comanche, a largely hunter-gatherer group, adopted the Spanish horses brought by the conquistadors (Figure
       5.16). Within a few generations, the combination of horses and metal weaponry transformed the Comanche
       into an empire that negotiated as equals with the Spanish, the British, and the French.

       based entirely on the hunting of bison had not been possible. (credit: "Buffalo hunt" by Catlin's North American

       Finally, not all Atlantic commerce and settlement flowed from east to west. Indigenous people also took
       advantage of the Columbian Exchange and traveled to Europe seeking ways to help themselves and their
       people. By the seventeenth century, dozens of Indigenous negotiators had gone to Europe to appeal directly to
       the monarchs for aid and for military and economic benefits. Their efforts reveal the ways in which Indigenous
       groups all over the Atlantic World hoped to shape their future on their own terms.

       The success of Spain and Portugal in establishing settlements in the Americas, and more importantly, the
       profits they derived from those settlements, inspired other European nations to emulate them. The English,
       French, and Dutch all ventured across the Atlantic with the goal of founding colonies whose resources they
       could exploit in order to dominate rival powers.

      The Rise of Mercantilism

       Much European exploration was driven by an economic theory known as mercantilism, a name given to the

                                                                                                                                                 5.3 · The Mercantilist Economy 181

theory by later historians. According to this theory, a nation's power depended on the amount of gold and silver
it held. The wealthier the nation, the larger the armies and navies it could support in its conflicts with rival
powers. Amassing national wealth, in turn, depended on maintaining a favorable balance of trade, a situation
in which a country exports goods of greater value than it imports. Mercantilism also assumed that the world's
wealth as measured in gold and silver was finite, so a gain for one nation was a loss for another. To surpass
other nations in power, a country must possess more gold and silver than others. According to mercantilism,
there could be only one victor in economic competition.

When a nation sold goods abroad, it accumulated gold and silver, but when it imported foreign products, it had
to transfer gold and silver to other nations as payment. Thus, at the heart of mercantilism lay the need for a
nation to maximize its exports and minimize its imports. Indeed, the ideal was to import nothing and produce
everything in the home country, including agricultural produce. A nation that could not supply all its own
needs should import raw materials, transform them into finished products, and sell them abroad for more
money than it had cost to produce them. Any raw materials a nation possessed should be reserved for
domestic manufacturing.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, mercantilist theory was embraced by most European nations,
especially France and England. Perhaps as much as religious fervor and a thirst for knowledge, this premise
drove exploration and the establishment of colonies. Mercantilists believed a colonial empire was necessary
for economic domination. Colonies could supply raw materials for domestic consumption, so there was no
need to purchase these resources from others. Colonial populations, in turn, provided a ready market for
goods made in the home country. To ensure that colonies added to their national wealth, European countries
that established them usually required that they trade only with the home country. Thus, for example,
England's colonies in North America could sell what they produced only in England.

Most mercantilist theorists believed government regulation of the economy was necessary to maximize wealth.
Governments commonly prohibited certain imports to prevent them from competing with domestic industry.
In 1539, for example, to protect domestic textile manufacturing, France banned the import of goods made of
wool. Governments also imposed high tariffs, or taxes on imported goods. These made foreign products more
expensive and thus promoted development of a nation's own industries. Governments might also grant firms
monopolies over certain kinds of domestic production, establish and provide financial support for certain
industries to ensure domestic self-sufficiency, and pay for internal improvements, such as new roads, to
promote domestic manufacturing and commerce. They also maintained large navies to protect international
trade and defend foreign colonies.

France provides perhaps the preeminent example of the mercantilist theory in practice. France was an
absolute monarchy. Absolute monarchies appeared in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as
feudalism declined and new countries arose from medieval kingdoms. These new nation-states were
characterized by centralized administrations and codified laws. They were guarded by professional standing
armies, not noble vassals at the head of their own private armies.

At the head of the state stood a monarch (usually a king) who claimed a divine right to rule. The medieval
concept of monarchy had regarded kings as subservient to the pope, but absolute monarchs considered
themselves subordinate to no one. They could rule as they wished with no need to confer with or seek the
consent of others, or to share power with the noble class as medieval monarchs had done. Absolute monarchs
proclaimed their own laws, formulated foreign policy, administered justice (or appointed those who did so),
and imposed taxes as they wished. They were the sole source of authority in their lands and often took steps to
weaken the power of their nobles so they did not pose a threat to their rule.

The most powerful of the absolute monarchies was France, and Louis XIV, who became king of France in 1643,
was the epitome of a divine-right monarch. Unwilling to share power with the higher-ranked members of the
French nobility, who had been responsible for numerous revolts against the French monarchy in the decades
before he came to the throne, Louis deprived them of any role in governing or administering the state. He
182 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       required that they live with him at his magnificent palace in Versailles, where they were invited to spend their
       time and money (which might otherwise have been used to plot revolts) in putting on displays of ostentatious
       living and competing with one another for the king's favor--favor that might mean they were allowed to hold
       the king's shirt as he dressed in the morning. All state matters were rigorously scrutinized by Louis, and he
       spent hours planning troop movements, overseeing the building of roads and canals, and promulgating legal
       codes for France's colonies. "L'état, c'est moi" ("I am the state"), he once famously proclaimed.
       France's absolute monarchy made it possible for the nation to regulate economic life as countries with less
       powerful rulers and less centralized governments could not. France embraced mercantilism under the
       guidance of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who became Louis XIV's chief minister in 1661. As the controller-general of
       finances, Colbert sought to promote French manufacturing and foreign trade and decrease imports. Under his
       direction, the government increased tariffs on foreign-made goods and completely banned the importation of
       some such as lace. Colbert established royal manufacturing and glass works and granted private companies
       monopolies on lace manufacture (Figure 5.17). Reasoning that the higher the quality of a product, the more
       could be charged for it, Colbert enacted strict quality-control standards so French products would bring high
       prices overseas, and he punished those who tried to avoid these regulations. To increase the government's
       wealth, he also sought to tax the French nobility, though unsuccessfully.

       Baptiste Colbert, the Gobelins fine furnishings factory began operating on behalf of the Crown in 1662. This etching

       Gobelins" by Metropolitan Museum of Art, Harris Brisbane Dick Fund, 1953/Wikimedia Commons, CC0 1.0)
       Colbert established a merchant marine to carry French goods abroad for trade, reducing the nation's reliance
       on ships from other countries. By ensuring that the pay for transporting these goods went to the ships' French
       captains and owners, he helped to keep wealth within the nation. Because the merchant marine could be
       called upon in time of war, Colbert had thus also strengthened France's ability to engage in armed conflict with
       foreign powers.
       Mercantilist theory influenced England and the Netherlands too. Although England's Parliament did not exert

as much control over its economy as the monarchy exerted in France, it nevertheless took steps to promote
English trade and discourage the importation of foreign goods. Tariffs were placed on foreign products, and in
the second half of the seventeenth century, laws were passed requiring that all ships bringing goods to England
have English owners and a predominantly English crew. The Dutch adopted the mercantilist strategy of
exporting high-quality goods, especially cloth, iron tools, and guns, to make up for the money the resource-
poor country spent on raw materials supplied by other nations.

Like France, both England and the Netherlands granted monopolies on foreign trade to private companies--the
British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. The purpose was to prevent competition
among merchants that might drive up the prices they were willing to pay for foreign goods and drive down the
prices they charged for domestic goods sold abroad. To increase their access to raw materials and establish
new markets for their goods, the Dutch, English, and French, noting the success of Spain and Portugal, also set
out to establish colonies in the Americas. A colonial empire seemed essential to securing national wealth and
power.

Mercantilism and the Expansion of Empire

To compete with Spain and Portugal, their rivals England, France, and the Netherlands soon founded
communities in North America. England established colonies on the mainland of North America in the
sixteenth century, and by the middle of the eighteenth century, they stretched from Newfoundland to Georgia
(Figure 5.18). Besides tobacco, they supplied England with a variety of goods ranging from timber, furs, and
salted fish from the northern colonies to rice, indigo, and deer hides from the south. The colonies attracted
many landless, unemployed young European men and women, too, who traveled to North America as
indentured servants, bound by a contract to work for an agreed-upon number of years. After the landowner
who paid for their passage had been compensated by their years of labor, indentured servants received their
freedom and typically a grant of land as well.

       France and the Netherlands also founded colonies in North America. In 1535, Jacques Cartier claimed Canada,
       also called New France, in the name of King Francis I. Like England, France was unable to maintain a
       permanent settlement in North America until the seventeenth century, when Samuel de Champlain founded
       one at Quebec. The French established further settlements in what is now the state of Maine, on the southern
       coast of Newfoundland, and in Louisiana (named for King Louis XIV). Animal hides and furs were the main
       exports to France. A small Dutch colony also briefly flourished in what is now New York and New Jersey before
       it was ceded to England in 1664. Like the French, the Dutch colonists of New Netherlands were primarily
       engaged in the fur trade, although many Dutch farmers also settled in the Hudson Valley, in New Jersey, and on
       Long Island.

ones. At the Historic UK website, learn about the Darien scheme (https://openstax.org/l/77Darien) that was
Scotland's unsuccessful attempt to found a colony in Central America in 1698.

The European nations intended to extract the greatest possible wealth from their mainland colonies in the
form of raw materials such as hides, furs, and agricultural products. France controlled immigration to Canada
to ensure that its population remained limited to fur trappers and traders, a small number of farmers to
provide them with food, and soldiers to guard them. In 1627, the French government granted a monopoly over
the fur trade to the Company of New France. All fur trappers in Canada were to either work directly for the
company or sell their furs to it. Traders had to pay the government a 25 percent sales tax. In 1663, Louis XIV
placed the company under royal control.

Spain exercised the strictest control over colonial commerce. Trade was limited to only a few ports in the
Spanish colonies and the port of Seville in Spain, and two trading fleets departed from Seville bound for the
Americas each year. The Spanish government forbade trade at other times. In addition, those seeking to
engage in trade had to procure a license to do so, at considerable expense. The Spanish government also held a
number of monopolies, such as one on all silver produced in its colonies, as well as owning all the mercury
produced in the colony of Peru. Spanish colonies that needed mercury, which was used for processing the gold
and silver they mined, had to purchase it from Peru.

Although the mainland colonies yielded wealth for the European home countries, the chief prizes were the
islands of the Caribbean where sugar could be grown. Over the course of the seventeenth century, England,
France, and the Netherlands set up colonies throughout the Caribbean on islands either not claimed by Spain
or taken from it. The three attempted to found colonies in Central or South America as well, but Spanish and
Portuguese dominance there either made these efforts unsuccessful, like the Dutch attempts in Brazil, or they
kept the colonies small, such as French Guiana and Dutch Guiana, now Suriname.

Mercantilism and Its Critics

Although European merchants and government ministers enthusiastically relied on mercantilist theory in the
building of colonial empires, mercantilism also had many critics. Eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher
David Hume argued that as more gold circulated in a country's economy, prices would rise, eventually
becoming so high that no one would purchase goods. Furthermore, Hume maintained, if abundance reduced
the value of an item, then the more gold and silver a nation acquired, the less valuable it would be, an idea that
undercut the mercantilist emphasis on accumulating precious metals to build wealth.

The eighteenth-century philosopher and economist Adam Smith, also a Scot, criticized mercantilism as well.
Smith argued that economic gain for one nation did not mean economic loss for others. Rather, trade could be
mutually beneficial for all. One nation could prosper by supplying raw materials to another, which could then
convert these materials into finished goods to be sold at profitable prices. Smith also opposed government
regulation of the economy. In his view, competition among the producers of goods and the influence of the
market (that is, the desires of buyers and sellers) made for a healthy economy. If demand for an item were high,
its price would rise. If demand were low or quality poor, price would fall. Although Smith believed government
should assist business by, say, building roads and providing for national defense, it should not grant
monopolies or subsidize businesses. This would only harm consumers by keeping prices artificially high.
Without government assistance, business enterprises would have to learn to operate more efficiently, thus
reducing prices, or they would fail.

Smith also argued that it made little sense for a nation to produce everything it needed. If Spain could make a
particular product better than England could or could make it for less money, England should use the revenue
generated by selling those goods it excelled at making to buy the Spanish product. England could produce
textiles more efficiently than Spain, and Spain could make wine more cheaply than England. It was thus more
efficient, Smith explained, for England to buy wine from Spain and Spain to buy cloth from England than for
186 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       each country to produce both the wine and the cloth they required.

                                                                                                          DUELING VOICES

        For and Against Mercantilism: Two Perspectives

         Many Europeans argued that the assumptions underlying mercantilist theory were flawed, and that putting it into
         practice was often harmful. Following are excerpts from Thomas Mun's 1664 England's Treasure by Forraign
         Trade, and Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. Note the very different positions these
         economists take.

               The ordinary means therefore to increase our wealth and treasure is by Forraign Trade, wherein wee
               must ever observe this rule; to sell more to strangers yearly than wee consume of theirs in value. For
               suppose that when this Kingdom is plentifully served with the Cloth, Lead, Tin, Iron, Fish and other
               native commodities, we doe yearly export the overplus to forraign Countreys to the value of twenty-two
               hundred thousand pounds; by which means we are enabled beyond the Seas to buy and bring in forraign
               wares for our use and Consumptions, to the value of twenty hundred thousand pounds: By this order
               duly kept in our trading, we may rest assured that the kingdom shall be enriched yearly two hundred
               thousand pounds, . . .
               Behold then the true form and worth of forraign trade, which is The great Revenue of the King, The
               honour of the Kingdom, The Noble profession of the Merchant, The School of our Arts, The supply of our
               wants, The employment of our poor, . . .
               --Thomas Mun, England's Treasure by Forraign Trade
               A great empire has been established for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers who should
               be obliged to buy from the shops of our different producers, all the goods with which these could supply
               them. For the sake of that little enhancement of price which this monopoly might afford our producers,
               the home-consumers have been burdened with the whole expense of maintaining and defending that
               empire. For this purpose, and for this purpose only, in the two last wars, more than two hundred millions
               have been spent . . . . It cannot be very difficult to determine who have been the contrivers of this whole
               mercantile system; not the consumers, we may believe, whose interest has been entirely neglected; but
               the producers, whose interest has been so carefully attended to; and among this latter class our
               merchants and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects.
               --Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations

           · What does Mun believe are the benefits of mercantilism? Do you believe this is a realistic assessment? Why
               or why not?

           · What does Smith regard as one of the worst of mercantilist policies? How might he respond to Mun's claims?

       Because mercantilist theory saw economic gain for one nation as necessarily a loss for others, European
       nations engaged in trade wars as each tried to use tariffs to bar others from its markets. At times, real wars
       accompanied trade wars. England and the Netherlands fought four wars over the course of the seventeenth
       and eighteenth centuries, partially to gain control of transatlantic trade (Figure 5.19). England also fought
       France for access to the markets of India.

Mercantilism affected the relationship not only between countries but also between classes. For instance, it
elevated the interests of merchants and manufacturers over those of workers and consumers by arguing that
wages should be kept low. More money would thus remain in employers' hands, and people would be
discouraged (or prevented) from buying luxury goods that could instead be exported for profit. Mercantilists
also advocated high taxes to enrich governments. The perceived need to extract raw materials from colonies to
benefit the home country's interests often led governments to restrict colonies' economic growth and harshly
punish people who sought to evade trade restrictions. The desire to exploit the American colonies also led to
the abuse of Indigenous populations and enslaved Africans in efforts to extract as much wealth as possible.

To extract the greatest possible wealth from their American colonies, the nations of Europe planted them with
cash crops Europeans craved but could not produce at home. To maximize profit, they drove workers hard
without regard for their health or safety. When Indigenous peoples and European servants could not satisfy
their demands, they turned to enslaved labor taken from Africa. The latter decision affected the lives of
millions of people for centuries to come.

Slavery and the Triangular Trade

One of the largest migrations in history took place between the late fifteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as
Europeans forcefully transported approximately twelve million Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the
Americas to provide labor for Europe's economic enterprises. Some two million people died on the voyages
188 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       across the Atlantic. The survivors made possible the extraction of wealth from European colonies on which the
       system of mercantilism was based.

       The majority of Africans brought across the Atlantic were destined to labor on sugar plantations in the
       Caribbean and Brazil. Many enslaved Africans were also sent to the Spanish colonies in South America;
       relatively few went to the North American mainland, mostly Mexico. European colonists had originally
       considered using enslaved Indigenous peoples to perform the difficult and dangerous labor of harvesting
       sugar cane and other cash crops, but these efforts failed. Indigenous people died in large numbers from
       infectious diseases, leaving too few to labor in the fields. On the island of Hispaniola, for example, where both
       the Spanish and the French established sugar plantations, the native Taíno population was at least several
       hundred thousand strong when Columbus arrived in 1492. By 1514, however, only about thirty-two thousand
       Taíno remained. Some had been deliberately killed by the Spanish, and others had died from hard labor and
       poor living conditions after being enslaved. The vast majority, though, had died of disease.

       For Europeans, the ideal laborers would be people as unfamiliar with the terrain as they were, because unlike
       enslaved Indigenous people who knew the best places to hide, they could more easily be recaptured if they ran
       away. In addition, they would be less affected by many of the infectious diseases from which Europeans
       suffered. Although Europeans did not understand what caused immunity, they knew those who had previously
       contracted certain diseases like smallpox and survived would not contract that disease again. They also knew,
       from long contact with Africans, that they did not die from European diseases in the same numbers that
       Indigenous Americans did. In the European view, Africans satisfied both their key requirements.

       European indentured servants would also have fit the bill, but the hot Caribbean climate and diseases like
       malaria and yellow fever, brought from Africa with cargoes of enslaved people, led to high death rates among
       Europeans within the first year and discouraged most others from immigrating there. Indentured servitude
       did not satisfy the labor needs of tobacco planters in Virginia and Maryland either, where the death rate among
       Europeans was also high. Although some indentured servants were convicts sentenced to be transported to
       the colonies, the vast majority left Europe voluntarily, but they were not enough. In addition, a French law
       passed in 1664 that restricted planters' right to beat their indentured servants made servants a less desirable
       form of labor in the eyes of French colonists. Thus, Europeans eager to extract a profit looked to Africa as the
       solution, and to slavery instead of indentured servitude. They believed Africans were physically better suited
       to hard labor than Europeans were, and Africans could also be enslaved for a lifetime, ensuring a constant
       supply of field hands.

       The Portuguese, already using enslaved Africans to grow sugar on islands off the coast of Africa, were the first
       to bring them in large numbers to the Americas. The initial Portuguese voyage to do so transported two
       hundred Africans to the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo, on the island of Hispaniola, in 1525. Most were
       forced to grow sugar for Portuguese colonists in Brazil or were sold to the Spanish for this purpose. Captured
       Africans were also sold to the Spanish to work in mines in Mexico and Peru or to be employed as domestic
       servants. Soon the British, French, Spanish, Dutch, and Danes were also exporting captives from Africa to
       produce sugar, rice, indigo, tobacco, and, by the eighteenth century, coffee in the Americas.

       Although the economic system that relied on the labor of enslaved Africans to grow sugar and other crops for
       European colonists in the Americas was a complex one, for purposes of simplification, it is often characterized
       as the triangular trade because it linked three regions (the Americas, Europe, and West Africa) in a network of
       exchange (Figure 5.20). The shipment of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic was one leg of the triangular
       trade. In the first leg, Europeans exchanged manufactured goods with African traders for enslaved Africans.
       The enslaved people were then shipped across the Atlantic to European colonies in the Americas. This journey
       was called the Middle Passage because it was the middle (or second) leg of the three-legged exchange. The
       money earned from the sale of enslaved Africans in the colonies was used to purchase the products grown by
       existing enslaved laborers. In the third leg of the triangle, those goods were shipped to Europe or to a European
       country's other American colonies, where they were transformed into finished products.

FIGURE 5.20 The Triangular Trade. As its name suggests, the triangular trade consisted of three legs. Enslaved
Africans were sent along the so-called Middle Passage (the red arrow) and sold in Europe's American colonies, while
the agricultural products they produced were shipped to Europe. European manufactured goods were exchanged in
Africa for more enslaved people. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
For example, English slave traders exchanged rum for captives in African ports. The captives then traveled
across the Atlantic in chains to England's Caribbean colonies, where they were sold to the owners of
plantations who set them to work growing sugar cane. The plantation owners then shipped molasses, a by-
product of sugar production, to other English settlers in the colony of Massachusetts, who transformed it into
rum and shipped that to England. English ship captains in Africa then exchanged rum along with
manufactured products like cloth, guns, and ammunition for captives. African slave traders used the guns to
capture more people to send along the Middle Passage, and the cycle continued. Enslaved people were the base
on which the triangle rested. Without the sugar, tobacco, coffee, indigo, and rice produced through their labor,
the trade would have collapsed.
The human toll of the transatlantic slave trade was immense. Conditions on the Middle Passage were brutal,
and some ships held as many as five to six hundred people. Some captains, knowing that 10 to 20 percent
would die on the voyage, packed as many people as possible into the hold, hoping enough would survive to
earn them a good profit. In the hold, men were separated from women and children and were chained side by
side on their backs, sometimes with only a few inches of space above them (Figure 5.21). In 1713, the Royal
Africa Company, a British company, instructed captains that enslaved people should be allotted a space five
feet long, eleven inches wide, and twenty inches high. The implication was that captains usually packed people
into even smaller spaces.

       hold was with human beings. Captains stowed people in every possible space. (credit: modification of work "Slave
       ship diagram" by Lilly Library of Rare Books and Manuscripts, Indiana University/Wikimedia Commons, Public
       Domain)
       During the voyage, sailors gave the enslaved people food and water usually once a day. There were no facilities
       for bathing, and men and women alike relieved themselves in buckets or tubs that often overturned in rough
       seas. Ventilation was poor, the stench was horrible, and the heat excruciating. At times crews would bring the
       enslaved Africans onto the deck for fresh air and make them jump and dance to exercise their muscles, since
       buyers would not pay high prices for those who looked weak. Removing captives from the hold was always a
       risk for the crew, however, since this was the time when a revolt was most likely to take place. Slave ship
       captains harshly punished any attempt at rebellion. Taking enslaved people to the deck was also risky because
       many used the opportunity to commit suicide rather than endure the misery on board ship or the uncertain
       fate that awaited them. Some captains strung nets below the ships' rails to catch those who jumped overboard.
       Illness was the slave ship captains' constant fear. In the close quarters of the ship, infectious disease could
       sweep like wildfire, and every person who died reduced the captain's profit. The most feared of all diseases was
       trachoma, an infection of the eyes that did not kill but left its victims blind. Enslaved people who could not see
       would not be purchased. Even more frightening was the possibility that the infection would spread to the crew.
       If the sailors lost their sight, everyone on board faced a slow death from starvation as the ship sat adrift in the
       water, unable to reach any port.
       Slave voyages were often heavily insured against loss. The captain of the Zong took full advantage of this. When
       bad weather slowed his ship's voyage across the Atlantic in 1781, members of the crew and the enslaved cargo
       began to die of illness. Realizing that the ship owner's insurance policy would pay for captives lost at sea but
       not for those who died of sickness, the captain ordered 132 enslaved people thrown overboard to drown.

      African and North American Slavery

       The captives purchased by European ship captains were sold by other Africans. Europeans did not introduce
       slavery to Africa; it had existed there for centuries before the triangular trade began. It was different in
       important ways, however, from the slavery that awaited Africans on the other side of the Atlantic.

Slavery existed in numerous African societies, and there were many ways in which a person could become
enslaved. In some societies, slavery served as punishment for a crime. In others, people could be enslaved or
sell their children into slavery to pay a debt. In times of hardship like famine, parents might sell children to
more prosperous people to earn money to support themselves and ensure their children would be fed. In many
societies, enslaved people were taken as prisoners of war.

Africans enslaved people primarily to enlarge their households, the basic economic units of society. Families
suffered if they did not have enough able-bodied people to work in the fields or tend to herds, and slavery
provided a solution. Some enslaved Africans remained with the slaveholder their entire lives, but others
expected to regain their freedom. Those enslaved to pay a debt, for example, gained their freedom once the
debt had been settled. Even people enslaved for life could participate fully in the life of the household or
community. They could marry; their spouse might be free, and their children would be. They might own
property, including enslaved people of their own. They were often well respected in the community, especially
if they possessed important knowledge or skills. Africans regarded slavery as an unfortunate fate that might
befall anyone; being enslaved did not imply an inherent difference or inferiority. The life of an enslaved person
was not comfortable or easy, but it was not often what we think of when we consider Atlantic plantation slavery.

Slavery in the Americas was different. It was chattel slavery, in which one person is owned by another as a
piece of property like an inanimate object. The enslaved had no status or legal rights as persons. They could be
bought, sold, inherited, or given to another. They had no right to control their own bodies or their own labor,
and they could be compelled to do whatever the slaveholder wished. Their status could be passed on to their
children; in all the European colonies in the Americas, the child of an enslaved woman was born enslaved.
Although chattel slavery also existed in Africa, this was the only form of slavery that existed in the Americas.

For centuries, Africans had participated in the trans-Saharan slave trade, selling prisoners in North Africa and
on the Swahili Coast to be transported to destinations in the Mediterranean or the Middle East. The arrival of
Europeans willing to pay large sums changed the focus of the African slave trade, however. Africans now
captured and enslaved large numbers of other Africans with the intent of selling them to Europeans for
transportation across the Atlantic. Wars were launched against rival peoples solely for the purpose of taking
captives, and slave traders led expeditions into the interior of the continent to kidnap people who lived far
away. Africans were not safe in their own homes. In the eighteenth century, slave traders kidnapped young
Olaudah Equiano (later an abolitionist) and his sister as they played at home; while their parents were gone,
strangers climbed over a wall into the courtyard of their house and carried the children away. Some people
were tricked and sold to European slave traders by their own relatives.

Once captured, people were marched for days to one of the places on the coast where Europeans exchanged
goods for human beings. Many died on the way. Slave traders commonly chained their captives together on the
journey, and devices were sometimes fixed to captives' necks so that if they managed to escape, they would die
of thirst because they could not lower their heads into streams to drink. Once they reached the coast, the
traders stripped them naked and shaved their heads to keep them free of lice. The traders then greased their
bodies with palm oil to make them look fit and healthy when buyers came.

A number of slave trading ports flourished on the western coast of Africa from the fifteenth through the
eighteenth centuries. Among them were Ouidah (Whydah), Grand-Popo, Jaquim, and Porto-Novo in modern
Benin; Badagry in Nigeria; and Little Popo in Togo. In these ports, English, Dutch, French, Portuguese, Spanish,
Danish, and Swedish traders and sea captains bargained with African slave traders for their captives. Some
African city-states and kingdoms became wealthy from the slave trade, and their rulers protested only if their
own people were taken. King Afonso of Kongo told the king of Portugal that, out of a desire for European goods,
the people of his own kingdom were capturing their fellow Kongolese and selling them to Portuguese traders.
He did not denounce the slave trade but asked only that the Portuguese bring their captives to officials of
Kongo to be sure they were not free Kongolese wrongfully seized. According to King Gezo of Benin, "The slave
trade is the ruling principle of my people. It is the source and the glory of their wealth . . . the mother lulls the
192 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to slavery."
       The transatlantic slave trade harmed those who remained in Africa as well as those who were taken. Families
       endured the emotional trauma of losing loved ones. Fear of falling prey to slave traders pervaded villages
       throughout West and Central Africa. Olaudah Equiano recalled that when adults in his village left for the fields,
       children stationed someone in a tree to keep watch for kidnappers while the others played.
       The African economy suffered as well. Those most likely to be captured, men and women in the prime of life,
       had been contributing the greatest share of labor to their communities. When slave traders captured young
       adults, no one remained to care for children and the elderly, and fewer people were left to reproduce.
       According to one model, between 1750 and 1850 no population growth occurred south of the Sahara Desert
       and north of the Limpopo River as a result of the loss of people to the slave trade. To compensate for the
       disappearance of so many young men, who were the laborers most preferred by plantation owners, many
       African ethnic groups adopted polygyny, allowing men to take multiple wives. The loss of men also
       necessitated that women adopt traditionally male economic roles.
       Desire for the goods Europeans traded for enslaved people also had devastating consequences for Africa. The
       importation of European textiles, according to some historians, spurred the industrialization of the European
       textile industry while harming African cloth producers, who could not compete on quantity or price. Weavers
       continued to produce goods for local markets, but no continent-wide market for African textiles ever had an
       opportunity to develop because Europeans already dominated the field. There were similar consequences for
       the African metal industry.
       These effects have been long-lasting. One scholar has demonstrated that the areas from which the most
       enslaved people were taken are today the poorest in Africa, though at the time of the slave trade they were
       among the most developed. They are also more prone to civil conflict today than other areas of the continent.
       Other studies have shown that people from ethnic groups most likely to have been subject to the slave trade are
       less likely to trust others than are people from less affected groups. This may be due at least in part to the slave
       trade's breaking down of the social and political structures intended to protect people.

      The Economics of Slavery

       Those who reached their final destination faced an existence as hellish as they had experienced on the Middle
       Passage. The labor to which they were put was backbreaking and never ending. Most of the crops grown by
       enslaved Africans in the Americas were labor intensive. At that time, tobacco seeds had to be planted by hand
       and the seedlings transplanted in the fields. At harvest time, workers stripped tobacco leaves from the plant,
       hung them to dry, and packed them in large barrels that they then rolled to the coast or a riverbank to be taken
       on board ship and transported to Europe (Figure 5.22).

tobacco plantation. In the open shed on the left, tobacco leaves are being hung to dry. (credit: "Tobacco cultivation
(Virginia, ca. 1670)" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
Rice cultivation also required the transplanting of seedlings by hand. Enslaved people first cleared the
undergrowth from swampland, built earthen dikes, and then flooded the cleared land with water. As they
worked in the swampy waters, they were exposed to snakes and mosquitos carrying malaria and yellow fever.
Sugar, the most valuable crop grown by enslaved people, also required the most labor, and sugar plantations
often contained hundreds of workers. With the exception of the very youngest and the very oldest, all of them
toiled all day as part of large work gangs. The labor was grueling and dangerous. Sugar cane was densely
planted, and undergrowth in the fields could hide snakes that bit workers. After fertilizing and weeding the
cane, workers harvested it by cutting it close to the ground with machetes and then chopping it into smaller
pieces to make it easier to remove from the fields. Machetes wielded in tired workers' sweaty hands often
slashed legs and feet. Workers might bleed to death or die when wounds became infected. People who worked
too slowly were beaten.
Laborers then transported the cut cane to a mill to be crushed by heavy rollers that often caught and mangled
workers' hands. This had to be done very quickly, within twenty-four hours of cutting the cane, because the sap
evaporated quickly. The workers boiled the crushed cane to extract a liquid that was clarified and crystalized
into sugar, a process that required hours of standing next to roaring fires where workers were often scalded. To
maximize profits, planters rotated production, so while sugar cane was growing in one field, it was being
harvested in another. Because sugar cane rapidly depleted nutrients in the soil, laborers frequently also had to
clear land for new fields. In addition to growing and processing sugar cane, enslaved people had to tend to the
plantations' buildings and livestock and cut the wood needed to cook the cane sap.
Slaveholders spent little money on food for the enslaved people, so laborers spent additional time tending their
own gardens, fishing, and foraging for wild foods. To give them energy and dull their pain, slaveholders often
gave them shots of rum, a plentiful beverage on a sugar plantation.

         was born in Rome and lived on the Caribbean island of Dominica, were exceptions. The first painting that follows,
         by Brunias, shows women at the market (Figure 5.23). The women in the center wearing white may be free
         women of color, a favorite subject of this artist.

         the second time) in the French colonies (Figure 5.24).

Infectious disease, overwork, poor diet, and injuries claimed large numbers of lives. Because infant mortality
among enslaved people in the Caribbean was rampant, the enslaved population was not self-reproducing, and
slaveholders had to buy more people each year to maintain their labor force. Prices were high. A healthy young
adult might cost as much as an average European could earn in a year's worth of labor. In 1684, planters in
Santo Domingo (the Dominican Republic) paid six thousand pounds of sugar per enslaved African. Some 2,500
to 3,000 new captives were required each year. This differed substantially from the English North American
mainland colonies where, because the work of growing and processing tobacco was less physically grueling,
enslaved people did not die in such high numbers, and the population was able to grow through reproduction.
Despite the conditions in which they lived, enslaved people in the Americas managed to retain their dignity
and humanity. Couples married and produced children, some of whom survived. They formed new kin
networks, calling fellow laborers "brother" and "aunt" to replace the relatives from whom they had been taken.
They created new religions with elements of various African practices and Christian elements learned from
their enslavers. They combined foods brought from Africa with local ingredients to create new cuisines that
reminded them of home. The influence of Africa persisted in the music, dance, and stories they created.
Enslaved people also resisted the slaveholders' efforts to exploit them in numerous ways. They damaged tools,
196 5 · Foundations of the Atlantic World

       sabotaged machinery, and set fire to cane fields and barns full of sugar awaiting export to Europe. They ran
       away; in the mountains of Jamaica, runaways formed communities and lived in hiding. On several occasions,
       enslaved people rose up in armed rebellion, killing the slaveholders and overseers.
       Largely unmoved by the misery of enslaved Africans, Europeans possessed an insatiable appetite for sugar
       that only grew as time passed. In 1650, planters in Barbados alone shipped about five thousand tons of sugar
       to England. Fifty years later, that amount had doubled. As the demand for sugar grew, so did the demand for
       enslaved laborers. Between 1450 and 1600, approximately 2,500 enslaved Africans a year were purchased by
       Europeans; in the sixteenth century, most of these people were sent to Hispaniola, Cuba, Brazil, and
       Venezuela. Beginning in the seventeenth century, however, as England, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark
       established sugar plantations in the Caribbean, the number of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas rose
       to some 18,680 per year (Figure 5.25). In the eighteenth century, by which time thousands of sugar mills
       dotted the coast of Brazil and the Caribbean islands, 61,330 people traversed the Middle Passage each year.
       Forty-two percent were sent to labor in the Caribbean and 38 percent to Brazil. The British colonies of the
       North American mainland claimed only 4 to 5 percent of the total.

       FIGURE 5.25 Sugar and the Growth of the Atlantic Slave Trade. As the European demand for sugar increased, so too
       did the demand for enslaved laborers in Brazil and the Caribbean, which together would account for approximately
       80 percent of enslaved Africans brought to the Americas at the turn of the eighteenth century. (data source: Slave

       The trade in both sugar and enslaved people sustained numerous industries and employed thousands of
       people, creating great wealth for some. Shipbuilders, ship captains, and sailors found employment, as did dock
       workers, freight drivers, customs agents, and workers in sugar refineries. Bakers, pastry cooks, candy makers,
       and grocers all indirectly made money from sugar. People who made the barrels that held sugar and the other
       products produced by enslaved people--tobacco, rice, and indigo--profited, as did those who supplied
       inexpensive clothing, shoes, and foodstuffs like salted fish for enslaved people. Banks and insurance

companies earned enormous sums as well, and those who owned large sugar plantations often invested their
profits in other industries, built magnificent mansions, or bought luxury goods.
Such wealth was easily transformed into political power. Sugar planters in Britain successfully lobbied
Parliament to protect their interests, and many planters went into politics, holding seats in the House of
Commons and, by using their wealth to purchase titles and estates, the House of Lords. It was thanks to the
sugar lobby in Parliament that the British navy began to give its sailors a daily ration of grog, a mixture of rum,
sugar, and lime juice, increasing the profits of British sugar planters even more.

Section Summary

5.1 The Protestant Reformation

In the sixteenth century, many European Christians were critical of practices within the Catholic Church. Some
scholars in northern Europe had turned to Christian humanism as a means of making people more pious and
thus achieving religious reform. Martin Luther, a German monk, began the Protestant Reformation when he
publicly objected to the church's sale of indulgences. Luther was excommunicated, but the printing press
enabled his ideas to spread throughout Europe. Luther taught that faith alone was needed for salvation and
that scripture was the only source of Christian authority.

Luther's ideas became popular among many, including Ulrich Zwingli and John Calvin in Switzerland.
Followers of John Calvin, called Calvinists, spread his teachings to the Netherlands, Scotland, France, and
England. A variety of Anabaptist churches were also established that rejected infant baptism. In England,
Henry VIII rejected the pope's authority after the pope refused to grant him an annulment. As Protestantism
gained adherents, religious wars erupted throughout Europe. The Council of Trent, called by the Roman
Catholic Church in 1545, reaffirmed some aspects of church doctrine while also passing reforms that
attempted to eliminate some of the problems that led to the Reformation. Wars over religion continued for
many years.

5.2 Crossing the Atlantic

With the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, Europeans found themselves forced to deal with
Muslim middlemen to access the prized goods of South and East Asia. European countries thus began seeking
an all-water route to the eastern lands they called the Indies, aided by navigational technologies from the
Middle East and motivated by religious zeal and desire for profit. The Portuguese were the first to explore the
Atlantic, claiming islands off the coast of Africa and voyaging down its western shore. In 1488, the Portuguese

explorer Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa.

The Spanish monarchs Isabella I of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon financed the voyages of Christopher
Columbus, who landed in the Caribbean in 1492 believing it was part of the Indies. He did not find great wealth
there, but Spanish exploration continued. Hernán Cortés conquered the wealthy Aztec Empire in Mexico and
Francisco Pizarro the silver-rich Inca Empire in Peru.

To protect their respective interests, in 1494 Spain and Portugal negotiated the Treaty of Tordesillas, which
drew a line through the Atlantic awarding the Americas, with the exception of Brazil, to Spain. Animals, foods,
and other resources flowed in both directions along the Columbian Exchange, forever altering the culture and
economies of North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Diseases also traveled west with the
Europeans and wiped out as much as 95 percent of the Indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere. Both
Europeans and Indigenous peoples had developed rich, diverse, and vastly different cultures, societies, and
religions prior to contact.

5.3 The Mercantilist Economy

According to mercantilist theory, to achieve power, nations must maximize their store of precious metals by
importing as few goods as possible while profitably exporting products to other countries. In embracing the
theory, European governments imposed tariffs, granted monopolies, and subsidized industries. They also
sought to acquire colonies to supply natural resources and serve as markets for domestically manufactured
goods. England, France, and the Netherlands thus joined Spain and Portugal in establishing colonies in the
Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. From these, they extracted goods such as furs, hides,
tobacco, and most profitably sugar. Critics like David Hume and Adam Smith charged that mercantilism led to
inflation and harmed consumers. Smith argued that wealth was not finite, that all nations could prosper, and
that the economy should be regulated naturally by competition among producers rather than being managed
by governments.

5.4 The Atlantic Slave Trade

To extract wealth from their colonies, over the course of the late fifteenth through the early nineteenth
centuries, European nations shipped approximately twelve million enslaved African people across the Atlantic
Ocean on the Middle Passage. Some ten million arrived alive to satisfy the labor needs of European planters,
who grew cash crops like sugar, rice, and tobacco. These agricultural goods were shipped to Europe, and
finished products made from them were shipped to Africa to purchase more captives from other Africans. This
three-legged exchange made up the triangular trade. The slave trade brought some areas of Africa damaging
population losses, and the importation of European goods also harmed African industries.

The majority of enslaved people labored in the Caribbean and Brazil growing sugar. The work was hard and
dangerous, and many died. Nevertheless, enslaved people established ties with one another and found ways to
maintain their human dignity and aspects of their culture. Europeans profited immensely from their labor, and
many industries were enriched by either the slave trade or the sugar production that depended on it.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

6.1 European Colonization in the Americas
6.2 The Rise of a Global Economy
6.3 Capitalism and the First Industrial Revolution
INTRODUCTION In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the world's great oceans effectively became
highways as European explorers, merchants, and laborers proved willing to journey greater distances than
they had in the past and traveled to new destinations in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. New economic systems
propelled exploration, communication, interaction, exchange, and--in many tragic cases--exploitation.
Communities in Asia, Africa, and the Americas that had once had little or no contact with one another now
found themselves enmeshed in a variety of exchanges. Confronted with a changing world, every community
made hard decisions. Some, like the Native Americans seen here (Figure 6.1), embraced the newcomers as
trading partners or political allies, gaining access to new goods and sometimes profiting for a time. Others
resisted the newcomers, often at great cost to themselves.

     6.1 European Colonization in the Americas

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the encomienda system
         · Explain the motivations behind European settlements in North America
         · Explain how climate, economics, and geography affected the founding and growth of colonial

             settlements
         · Analyze Indigenous responses to European colonization in the Americas
       In the early 1500s, Europeans began founding new settlements in the Americas. Some came to get rich, others
       to win glory for their empires, a few to spread their faith. Some settlements withered and died, but others
       became profitable centers for international commerce as goods and people flowed across the Atlantic Ocean.
       Each community of Native Americans made unique choices and decided for themselves whether to embrace or
       resist the changing world. Regardless of their choices, however, most Indigenous people suffered severely from
       European colonization. They could slow the European advance into their world, but they could not stop it.

      Spain's Encomienda System

       The Spanish were the first to establish major colonies in North America after Christopher Columbus's arrival
       in 1492. They became the earliest Europeans to force the Indigenous population to labor for them, initially by

outright enslavement, a practice that slowly evolved into systems that were more complex. By 1502, they had
created the encomienda system as part of a broader search for "God, Gold, and Glory" in their vast empire. In
this context, God refers to attempts to spread the Catholic faith, gold to the search for wealth, and glory to
hopes of obtaining personal fame.
The term encomienda comes from the Spanish word encomendar, which means "to entrust." The encomienda
was a system of entrusting valuable territories and peoples to those who had proven to the crown that they
were worthy of that trust. The Spanish government gave each grantee, known as an encomendero, the right to
demand labor from Indigenous people living in a specific area. In exchange, the Spaniards were supposed to
provide guidance, education, and leadership to these Native Americans. While encomiendas did not
technically include the ownership of any land, encomenderos often took possession of lands where the people
under their control lived. Sometimes the system of forced labor even devolved into what was functionally, if not
legally, slavery.
Most recipients of encomiendas were conquistadors being rewarded for campaigns that had won glory for
Spain. However, a few Native Americans also received them. When the expedition led by conquistador Hernán
Cortés fought a war against the Aztec Empire (1519-1521), the Tlaxcalans of central Mexico allied with
Cortés's forces against the Aztecs, their traditional enemies. As a reward for their service, the Spanish
government gave some Tlaxcalans encomiendas, and the tribe enjoyed a far better position in the Spanish
Empire than many other Native American groups. Perhaps the most unusual encomendera was Malintzin, a
formerly enslaved Indigenous woman who served as Cortés's chief interpreter during the conquest of the Aztec
Empire (Figure 6.3). Malintzin received her encomienda as a reward for this service, without which Cortés's
campaign against the Aztecs might have failed.

century shows the Spanish army on the march, with Cortés and the translator named Malintzin at the far right.

Encomenderos typically abused their authority, overseeing an exploitive arrangement marked by horrific
working conditions and acts of extreme violence against anyone who failed to comply with their demands. The
208 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       encomienda system became the dominant source of labor in Spanish American colonies, which included areas
       now known as Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Mexico, and much of South America (Figure
       6.4).

       FIGURE 6.4 Spain's Colonies. This map shows the area controlled by Spain in its colonization of the Americas.
       Native American communities often retained effective control over territory that was "claimed" by European
       powers. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
       After a brief period as an encomendero, in 1514 the Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas became one of the
       system's greatest critics (Figure 6.5). He spent most of the next decade traveling across Latin America and
       Spain speaking out against its brutality. In his 1552 book, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, Las
       Casas argued that "the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon" Native Americans. He claimed the Spanish
       "tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress,
       tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly." Las Casas eventually convinced King Charles V to
       implement the New Laws of 1542 that sought to end the encomienda system, but Spanish settlers in the
       Americas violently opposed the reforms and the system remained.

 The Impact of Spanish Colonization

  For insights into Spanish colonization, consider the two following primary sources, the first written by Christopher
  Columbus in 1492, and the second by Bartolomé de las Casas, a Spanish priest, looking back in 1542 after
  approximately forty years of experience in Spanish America.

        Thursday, October 11
        All I saw were youths, none more than thirty years of age. They are very well made, with very handsome
        bodies, and very good countenances. Their hair is short and coarse, almost like the hairs of a horse's tail.
        . . . They neither carry nor know anything of arms, for I showed them swords, and they took them by the
        blade and cut themselves through ignorance. They have no iron, their darts being wands without iron,
        some of them having a fish's tooth at the end, and others being pointed in various ways. . . . They should
        be good servants and intelligent, for I observed that they quickly took in what was said to them, and I
        believe that they would easily be made Christians, as it appeared to me that they had no religion.
        Sunday, October 14
        These people are very simple as regards the use of arms, as your Highnesses will see from the seven
        that I caused to be taken, to bring home and learn our language and return; unless your Highnesses
        should order them all to be brought to Castile, or to be kept as captives on the same island; for with fifty
        men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them.

               It was upon these gentle lambs, imbued by the Creator with all the qualities we have mentioned, that
               from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or
               like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has
               remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds,
               murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and
               persecuting them mercilessly. . . . When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of
               the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. The island of Cuba,
               which extends for a distance almost as great as that separating Valladolid from Rome, is now to all
               intents and purposes uninhabited; and two other large, beautiful and fertile islands, Puerto Rico and
               Jamaica, have been similarly devastated. Not a living soul remains today on any of the islands of the
               Bahamas, which lie to the north of Hispaniola and Cuba, even though every single one of the sixty or so
               islands in the group, as well as those known as the Isles of Giants and others in the area, both large and
               small, is more fertile and more beautiful than the Royal Gardens in Seville.

       particularly cruel imperialists who abused their colonial subjects. Like many historical legends, the black
       legend is rooted in fact. The Spanish often mistreated Native Americans, but writers from Spain's colonial
       rivals, most notably the English, frequently exaggerated Spanish cruelty to justify their own colonial abuses.
       Despite their intense rivalries, both the English and the Spanish were guilty of abusing Native Americans. Even
       reformers like Las Casas, who opposed the worst abuses of Native Americans, were flawed. Las Casas's
       approach to Native Americans was often paternalistic, and he typically treated non-Europeans as children who
       would benefit from the benevolent guidance of Europeans rather than as equals.

      English Settlements in North America

       The English began their colonization efforts in the Americas nearly a century after the Spanish, motivated by
       both economic and ideological goals. In 1584, Queen Elizabeth gave Sir Walter Raleigh a charter, a royal
       document that authorized him to establish a colony in North America. The Protestant queen wanted colonies
       that would act as an ideological counterweight to Spanish Catholicism in the Americas and provide a base of
       operations for privateering expeditions that would raid Spanish shipping.

       Roanoke Island

       In July 1587, about 150 settlers led by explorer and artist John White established a colony on Roanoke Island,
       off the coast of modern North Carolina. The colonists baptized Manteo, a friendly member of the Croatoan
       tribe, and named him the Lord of Roanoke in an effort to build congenial relationships with the local Native
       Americans. In late August, White left for England with plans to gather additional investors to fund the colony.
       Once there, he convinced English merchants to invest in the colony in exchange for trading rights, but the

arrival of the Spanish Armada in 1588 delayed his departure. When White finally returned to Roanoke Island
in 1590, the colony was gone.
The only clue White found was the word "Croatoan" carved into a tree. There are clear signs the settlers
intermarried with the Native American population and joined their society, but Europeans of the era dismissed
this possibility (Figure 6.6), perhaps because they found it impossible to believe Europeans would willingly
join a non-White society. It is also possible the word had nothing to do with the colony's disappearance. John
White was forced to leave before completing a thorough investigation. Today, Roanoke Island is known as "the
lost colony," and its fate remains a mystery.

Jamestown
The creation of joint stock companies provided English colonial efforts after Roanoke Island with improved
funding that the English monarchy could not offer. A joint stock company, much like a modern corporation,
raised money for its ventures by selling shares to investors. The company then used the pooled funds to
conduct operations, including colonization efforts in the Americas. Shareholders were not legally liable for the
actions of the company and could not lose more than the amount of their investment, but they could earn large
profits if the joint stock company were successful. The combination of limited liability with the possibility of
rich returns made joint stock companies an appealing investment for members of England's growing
merchant class, and the companies raised huge sums of money beginning in the early 1600s. England
promoted colonization for religious and political reasons, but its reliance on private investors for funding often
steered the effort toward profitable activities.
In 1606, the Virginia Company, a joint stock company named for Queen Elizabeth (who was known as the
"virgin queen" because she never married), received a charter and sent 144 men and boys to North America.
In 1607, these colonists founded Jamestown, named for the new English king, James I, on the banks of the
Chesapeake Bay in what is now Virginia. Many of the settlers were the desperate younger sons of elite families
who would not inherit property claimed by their older brothers in England. Many others were artisans,
including goldsmiths and jewelers, unused to the hard physical labor that building a colony on a new continent
required.
The settlers of Jamestown, like many Europeans of the 1600s and 1700s, rooted their economic ideas in
212 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       mercantilism, an economic theory in which the world's wealth, as measured in gold and silver, is assumed to
       be finite, so a gain of wealth for one nation is a loss for another. Mercantilist nations expected their colonies to
       export raw materials, most importantly precious metals like gold and silver, back to the home country and to
       purchase goods from it in turn. The English government hoped the Virginia Company would find gold to
       improve the nation's trade balances and increase its wealth. Many in Jamestown also hoped to find gold and
       thereby get rich without having to work hard or suffer any hardships.

       The Jamestown settlers did not find gold because there was little mineral wealth in the region, but they did find
       suffering due to bad weather, starvation, disease, internal political disputes, and military conflicts with the
       Powhatan tribe (named after its chief). The Powhatans grew to loathe the newcomers for bringing disease and
       violence to their homeland. Many colonists died during the winter of 1609-1610, known as "the starving time."
       By May 1610, fewer than a hundred remained, and the colony, which had not produced a profit for the Virginia
       Company, almost failed.

       Early Virginia colonists did find wealth and success in tobacco cultivation, however. Despite the need for hard
       work in difficult conditions, by 1614 Jamestown began exporting tobacco to Europe and earning profits for the
       Virginia Company. Smoking the highly addictive dried leaves of the plant became a popular habit in Europe.

       Like their rivals the Spanish, English colonists struggled to produce agricultural goods using only their own
       labor. Instead, they relied heavily on indentured servants, European immigrants who typically agreed to work
       four to seven years in exchange for transportation to the colony and the hope of a new life there after
       completing their service. Up to 100,000 people, mostly poor men in their twenties, traveled to the English
       colonies as indentured servants in the 1600s. Many died of disease, exposure, and overwork, but those who
       survived their term of service often became reasonably comfortable and respected members of the growing
       settlements. A fortunate few even became wealthy planters.

       In 1619, the first Africans arrived in Virginia. Initially they enjoyed the same opportunities to earn their
       freedom and build wealth as immigrants from Europe, but their condition quickly deteriorated. They were part
       of a trend that began with the importation of the first Africans into the Americas by the Spanish and
       Portuguese a century earlier. By the middle of the 1600s, policies were beginning to develop in the Americas
       that bound Africans to servitude for life, unlike European indentured servants who regained their freedom
       once they had completed their term of service.

       European colonists in Virginia, like those in Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean, sought ways to
       maintain a permanent labor force, especially when it proved difficult to recruit sufficient indentured servants
       from Europe. Attempts to coerce the labor of fellow Europeans would have met with too much resistance.
       Faced with a growing underclass of embittered poor White former servants, who in 1676 sought to overthrow
       the colony's government, Virginia's elite sought to solve their problems by drawing legal distinctions between
       people of European and African ancestry. They extended privileges to Whites that were denied to Blacks and
       encouraged European settlers to perceive Africans as inferior people fit only for manual labor, while
       simultaneously depriving Africans of their freedom. In this way, slavery became associated with African
       ancestry and racial divisions were created that had not existed before. Racism became the basis on which the
       colonial labor system was built.

       In 1680, the Virginia legislature passed "an act for preventing Negroes Insurrections" that forbid enslaved
       Africans from carrying weapons, gathering in public, and traveling without permission. Enslaved Africans
       became the most important source of coerced labor in Virginia, as well as the other English colonies
       established in the southern part of what became the United States, stretching from Maryland, the colony
       founded as a haven for English Catholics just north of Virginia, to Georgia. This enslavement in the United
       States ended only in 1865, after a devastating civil war and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the
       U.S. Constitution. Slavery continued in other parts of the Western Hemisphere, with Brazil not abolishing it
       until 1888.

New England

In 1620, Puritan Separatists led by William Bradford left Plymouth, England, on the Mayflower and founded a
colony they called Plymouth near what is now Boston, Massachusetts. The Separatists wanted to leave England
to escape the Church of England, which they felt was corrupt, and whose interpretation of scripture the
Separatists considered lax. Before landing, their leaders signed the Mayflower Compact, a document that
emphasized their desire to found a colony for "the glory of God, and Advancement of the Christian Faith, and
the Honour of our King and Country." More than just a religious document, the Mayflower Compact also had a
major political impact with its support of direct democracy and of building governments that reflected the will
of the people.

Like the English settlers far to the south in Virginia, the Separatists struggled to survive in their new homes.
Roughly half died of starvation, disease, malnutrition, and cold during the difficult winter of 1620-1621. Many
of the survivors became too weak to work, and soon the entire colony was dependent on the seven who were
healthy enough to do so. Political disputes broke out, and the first English colony in New England almost died.
Just when Plymouth seemed doomed, Native Americans decided to help. They included Samoset, a member of
the Abenaki tribe who had been living with the Wampanoag tribe, and Tisquantum (Squanto) of the Pawtuxet
tribe, who had learned to speak some English from fishers who visited the coast before the Separatists arrived.
Tisquantum had been kidnapped by English explorer Thomas Hunt and sold into slavery in Spain but had
managed to escape to England. There, he joined the Newfoundland Company, another English joint stock
company, and had returned to North America in 1619. Samoset, Tisquantum, and other friendly Native
Americans helped the English negotiate treaties with nearby tribes and taught them to grow corn, which
became the colony's main food source. But a relationship that may have begun as a friendly attempt to help
starving strangers quickly shifted to conflict as the colonizers began seizing Indigenous lands.

A larger group of Puritans followed in 1630 and founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Their leader John
Winthrop gave a speech titled "A Model of Christian Charity," which expressed his hopes that the Puritan
community in the Americas would embrace the twin goals of building economic prosperity and founding a
"City upon a Hill" that would serve as a shining example of an ideal Christian community to the entire world.

The Puritan colonies were also scenes of religious conflict from which dissenters like Anne Hutchinson, who
questioned the all-male church leadership, and Roger Williams, who championed religious toleration, were
exiled. The Massachusetts Bay Colony's darkest moment may have come during the 1692 Salem witch trials,
when Puritan leaders executed nineteen people for witchcraft. Despite such conflicts, the Puritan colonies
eventually became self-sustaining communities that mostly achieved their twin objectives of promoting
Puritan religious ideology and building a strong economy.

Puritan settlers hoped a strong economy would allow their colony to flourish, attract new settlers, and provide
evidence of God's favor. Like many Europeans of the 1600s and 1700s, they rooted their economic ideas in
mercantilism. The desire to build economic wealth was the primary motive in many colonial ventures, such as
Jamestown in Virginia, and provided a secondary motivation in more ideologically driven communities like
those set up by the Puritans (Figure 6.7).

      French and Dutch Settlements

       In 1609, Dutch merchants hired Henry Hudson, an English sea captain, to lead an expedition into the Atlantic
       Ocean. The Dutch hoped Hudson would find the long-sought Northwest Passage, a mythical water route
       thought to allow ships from Europe to sail west through the North American continent, cross the Pacific Ocean,
       and arrive in Asia. Hudson discovered a deep-water port, now known as New York harbor, and a large river,
       now known as the Hudson, that led inland. For a moment it appeared he had found the Northwest Passage.
       However, the Hudson River became too shallow for ocean-going ships near present-day Albany, New York, and
       the expedition turned back. Hudson did not find the Northwest Passage, but he did find a valuable port and
       rich river valley that he claimed for the Dutch.
       After Hudson returned to Europe, the Dutch West India Company, a joint stock company much like the Virginia
       Company, made plans to set up a small colony in North America. In contrast to the settled agricultural model
       preferred by English colonists, the Dutch focused on trade. Company directors hoped their colony would
       improve their access to the North American fur trade, ensure their control of the valuable port eventually
       known as New York Harbor, and solidify their claim on the area, which they suspected might contain

additional sources of wealth they had not yet discovered. In 1624, thirty families aboard the ship Nieu
Nederlandt arrived in what is now New York and founded the Dutch colony of New Netherlands. They came for
many reasons, but many hoped to become rich by working in the fur trade.
The Dutch, like their Spanish and English colonial rivals, struggled to produce goods using paid labor and
sought to remedy the problem with the importation of enslaved Africans. They also encouraged immigration
from across Europe with promises of economic opportunities and some level of religious toleration that
extended even to Jewish people, who faced severe discrimination in most of Europe. New Netherlands soon
became a prosperous colony populated by people from across Europe and Africa. Colonists lived in a band of
farms and towns stretching along the Hudson River Valley from New Amsterdam, which is now New York City,
north to the village of Beverwijck, now Albany. They engaged in some farming, but they mostly relied on the fur
trade for their income.

                                                                                                BEYOND THE BOOK
 New Amsterdam

  New Amsterdam was founded by the Dutch in 1624, at the southern tip of the island now known as Manhattan.
  The city quickly became a thriving center of trade and commerce. In 1664, an English military expedition
  captured the city and renamed it New York (Figure 6.8).

216 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       New Netherlands became a scene of increasing conflict as the colony grew. Initially the Dutch enjoyed friendly
       relationships with Native Americans eager to trade their furs for European firearms, metal tools, and wool
       blankets. Serious disputes began, however, when the Dutch demanded payment for the benefits they believed
       they had brought, including knowledge of the Christian faith and connection to global markets. Native
       Americans refused to pay, and violence broke out. To protect New Amsterdam from attack, the Dutch forced
       enslaved Africans to build fortifications along what was then the city's northeast boundary. The street that ran
       along these fortifications was known as Wall Street; it later became a major economic center and the home of
       the New York Stock Exchange.
       Despite intense warfare, Native Americans were unable to expel the Dutch, who faced a far more dangerous
       threat from the English. In 1664, an English military expedition arrived in New Amsterdam as part of a
       broader conflict between England and the Netherlands. With little hope of defending themselves from the
       English warships, the Dutch surrendered. The English gave them generous peace terms and renamed New
       Amsterdam New York, in honor of the Duke of York who had organized the expedition (Figure 6.9).

       The French became aware of colonization opportunities in North America in 1534, when Jacques Cartier
       voyaged to the area now known as the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in Canada, but they did not rush to set up any

colonies. Several early colonization efforts in what is now Canada struggled, mostly due to the harsh northern
environment. In 1608, an expedition led by Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec, the first major French
settlement in North America. The Company of New France, a joint stock company much like the Virginia
Company and the Dutch West India Company, led the early French colonization efforts in North America and
helped fund settlements. New France was a collection of French settlements begun in 1534 in what is now
Newfoundland. It eventually included much of North America, including Canada and the Mississippi River
Valley all the way to southern Louisiana on the Gulf of Mexico.

Like the Dutch, French colonizers focused on trade rather than the settled agricultural model preferred by the
English. They earned most of their profits from the lucrative fur market and engaged in fishing off the coast of
what is now Canada. Among the French settlers were a small number of French Catholic priests who attempted
to convert Native Americans to Christianity, as the Spanish had done in their colonies. Most of these
missionaries were members of the Society of Jesus, better known as the Jesuits, a religious organization
dedicated to spreading Catholicism and opposing Protestantism. The Jesuits practiced cultural
accommodation, a method of integrating a culture into the dominant society without forcing it to fully
integrate and adopt all the dominant culture's components. They just wanted Native Americans to become
Catholics and did not care whether they adopted any other aspect of European culture. The Jesuits in Canada
also likely realized that they had neither sufficient numbers nor the support from France that would have been
necessary to force Indigenous peoples to submit to attempts to change their way of life.

The French probably enjoyed the friendliest relationships with Native Americans of any European colonizers.
Unlike their rivals, they usually attempted to solve the shortage of labor by allying themselves with Native
Americans. The French sought wealth in furs, and the assistance of Native American tribes, who knew the land
much better than did the European newcomers, was needed to best exploit this valuable resource. Also,
because few French women came to New France, many French colonists married Native American women,
leading to the creation of a multicultural and multiracial society.

In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister to King Louis XIII, provided a spiritual justification for Franco-
Indian partnerships in the Ordonnance of 1627. The Ordonnance read in part, "The descendants of the French
who are accustomed to this country [New France], together with all the Indians who will be brought to the
knowledge of the faith and will profess it, shall be deemed and renowned natural Frenchmen, and as such may
come to live in France when they want, and acquire, donate, and succeed and accept donations and legacies,
just as true French subjects, without being required to take letters of declaration of naturalization."

Not all Native Americans wanted to give up their traditional beliefs or become French, but the Ordonnance was
an important gesture that the French government was willing to accept them as equal members of society. It
helped the French build strong relationships with Native Americans, particularly the Algonquin-speaking
tribes that populated most of New France. The French further reinforced their alliance with the Algonquins by
providing them with weapons, which they used in their wars with rival Iroquoian-speaking tribes and with
Dutch and English settlers.

Even when Indigenous peoples profited from their relationship with European colonists, however, they might
still suffer negative consequences. The introduction of guns, for example, made Native American warfare more
deadly. As the Iroquois, who were armed by the Dutch, waged war with the French-allied Wendat nation, their
European trading partners profited from the trade in stolen pelts.

The use of guns and the incentives offered for killing as many animals as possible had environmental
implications as well, because it depleted beaver and deer populations in some areas. The hunger for European
manufactured goods encouraged some Native Americans to go into debt to European traders, while the
reduction of animal populations left some without the means to pay. Many Indigenous people also became
addicted to the alcohol sold or traded by Europeans.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how the Seven Years' War established a new balance of power in Europe
         · Discuss the causes and effects of Britain's colonization of India
         · Analyze the ways in which the Qing dynasty developed and maintained a favorable balance of trade

             with Europe
         · Describe how colonized societies responded to the expansion of European empires
       In the mid-1700s, the British Empire grew from a minor player on the world stage to a dominant superpower.
       Trade that flowed through and from the British North American colonies made many British business and
       political leaders rich. Victory in the Seven Years' War consolidated their power over European rivals. In hopes
       of further increasing their political and economic power, many supported further expansion of the empire into
       new areas. Britain therefore expanded its colonies in India and turned its eyes to China.

      The Seven Years' War

       The Seven Years' War (1756-1763) was a global conflict that began as a fight for dominance between European
       powers, primarily Great Britain and France, but it quickly involved groups from India, Africa, and the Americas
       (Figure 6.10). Conflicts that overlapped with the Seven Years' War were the French and Indian War in North
       America and the Third Carnatic War in India.

       In the late 1600s and early 1700s, New France grew steadily. In 1663, King Louis XIV canceled the royal
       charter with the Company of New France and transformed the settlement into a royal colony. French
       merchants and priests gradually expanded their reach from Quebec through the Great Lakes and down the
       Mississippi River, founding New Orleans near the Gulf of Mexico in 1718.
       The English proved a serious obstacle for the growth of New France, however. Wealthy farmers in the English
       colonies of North America wanted to expand into the Ohio River Valley, territory claimed by France and its
       Native American allies. In 1754, violence broke out between French soldiers and members of the Virginia

militia near what is now Uniontown, Pennsylvania. Initially the French and their Native American allies
performed well, launching skillful ambushes on English troops and forcing George Washington, a young officer
in the Virginia colonial militia, to surrender Britain's Fort Necessity.

                                                                                           IN THEIR OWN WORDS

 George Washington on the French and Indian War

  George Washington wrote to his mother on July 18, 1755, when he was twenty-three years old and fighting in the
  French and Indian War. His letter, excerpted here, describes the battle near Fort Duquesne, now Pittsburgh,
  Pennsylvania. British soldiers and members of the Virginia militia met a surprise attack by French and Indian
  fighters and were defeated.

        HONORED MADAM: As I doubt not but you have heard of our defeat, and perhaps have had it
        represented in a worse light (if possible) than it deserves; I have taken this earliest opportunity to give
        you some account of the engagement, as it happened within 7 miles of the French fort, on Wednesday
        the 9th instant.

        We marched onto that place, without any considerable loss, having only now and then a straggler picked
        up by the French scouting Indians. When we came there, we were attacked by a body of French and
        Indians, whose number (I am persuaded) did not exceed three hundred men; ours consisted of about
        1300 well-armed troops, chiefly regular soldiers, who were struck with such a panic that they behaved
        with more cowardice than it is possible to conceive. The officers behaved gallantly, in order to
        encourage their men, for which they suffered greatly; there being near sixty killed and wounded; a large
        proportion of the number we had. The Virginia troops showed a good deal of bravery, and were near all
        killed; for I believe, out of three companies that were there, there is scarce thirty men left alive. . . . In
        short, the dastardly behavior of those they call regulars exposed all others that were inclined to do their
        duty to almost certain death; and, at last, in despite of all the efforts of the officers to the contrary, they
        broke, and run as sheep pursued by dogs; and it was impossible to rally them. . . .

        I luckily escaped without a wound, though I had four bullets through my coat, and two horses shot
        under me. Captains Orme and Morris . . . were wounded early . . . I was the only person then left to
        distribute the General's orders, which I was scarcely able to do, as I was not half recovered from a
        violent illness that had confined me to my bed, and a wagon, for above ten days. I am still in a weak and
        feeble condition, which induces me to halt here two or three days in hopes of recovering a little strength,

However, the early success of the French in forcing the British to retreat did not last. In 1758, the Shawnee
tribe, the Delaware tribe, and the powerful Iroquoian Confederacy agreed to ally with the English in exchange
for their promise to respect Indigenous rights to contested lands on the frontier. The Iroquois Confederacy was
a collection of allied Native American tribes who called themselves Haudenosaunee, which means "people of
the longhouse." The name referred both to the rectangular homes in which they lived and their geographic
territory, which extended from what is now Vermont in the east all the way to Lake Erie in the west, an area
roughly the shape of a longhouse. The Iroquoian tribes had formed a military and economic alliance by 1600
220 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       that consisted of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca tribes. The Tuscarora tribe joined the
       confederacy in 1722. Other, non-Iroquoian Native Americans, including several Algonquin tribes, remained
       loyal to the French until the end of the war in 1763. With Native American help, the English launched
       successful offensives against New France. The British turned in the tide in 1759, with a series of victories
       culminating in their capture of French Quebec after the Battle on the Plains of Abraham (Figure 6.11).

       The French and Indian War ended with the victory of Great Britain and Prussia over France and Spain in the
       Seven Years' War and the signing of the Treaty of Paris in February 1763. Under the treaty, the French
       government surrendered all its territory in North America, as well as outposts in the Caribbean, India, and
       Africa. Britain became the undisputed controller of eastern North America, from Canada in the north to the
       Florida border in the south, and from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Mississippi River in the west.
       The Seven Years' War had begun in Europe in 1756 when Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Saxony and
       annexed the area as part of his broader plan to expand Prussian territory. In response, France, Spain, and
       Russia joined forces with Austria to oppose him. Great Britain allied itself with Prussia to maintain the balance
       of power in Europe, a situation in which competing nations have approximately equal military power.
       Maintaining this balance was a key feature of British foreign policy meant to prevent the domination of Europe

by any one nation. Military alliances thus transformed what could have been a small border dispute in Europe
into a major war that quickly spread around the world (Figure 6.12).

In 1758, a British expeditionary force captured the French outpost of Senegal in West Africa, and other French
outposts were taken during a series of subsequent offensives. The loss of valuable trading ports damaged the
French economy at the very moment France desperately needed money to fund the war effort. More
importantly, it deprived French military forces of strategic bases they could have used to raid British shipping
and resupply their warships.
In Asia, the British East India Company, a joint stock company founded in 1600 with the original goal of
trading in the Indian Ocean, was by now providing the British with a much stronger economic as well as
military and diplomatic foundation than their French rivals had. To thwart these British advantages and gain
control of valuable territory in India, the French formed an alliance with the Mughal Empire. At its height, this
powerful Muslim realm had once ruled more than 150 million people living across 1.5 million square miles in
what is now Afghanistan, India, and Bangladesh. The British defeated the French forces in 1761, however,
when they captured Pondicherry, the most important French outpost in India. The Mughals continued to resist
British domination even after the French had largely withdrawn from India.
In 1762, the British launched attacks on Spanish colonies in Asia and the Caribbean, capturing the port of
Manila in the Philippines and occupying it until the end of the war in 1763. They were less successful in
expanding their control over the islands, despite the assistance of Indigenous Filipinos who disliked Spanish
rule. In the Caribbean, however, Britain succeeded in capturing Havana, Cuba, one of the most important ports
in the Western Hemisphere, and held it until the end of the conflict.
Furthermore, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the French surrendered their imperial possessions in
North America and India to the British, while the Spanish surrendered Florida to the British and France gave
control of the Louisiana Territory to Spain. The subsequent Peace of Hubertusburg guaranteed Prussian
control of Silesia, an area in central Europe, and confirmed Prussia's status as a major force in Europe. The
222 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       British, for their part, emerged from the Seven Years' War as the world's leading economic, military, and
       political power.

      British Influence in India

       After their victory in the Seven Years' War, the British focused on expanding their control in India. In 1757, the
       forces of the British East India Company led by Robert Clive defeated the ruler of Bengal, a region in northeast
       India, who had favored the French. The British East India Company's victory left it in control of territory larger
       than the island of Britain itself. Four years later, the capture of Pondicherry by the British effectively removed
       the French from contention in the competition to dominate Indian trade. After 1761, the Indigenous peoples of
       India provided the only significant source of resistance.
       In 1764, British and Indian forces under the command of the British East India Company defeated a much
       larger army led by the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II at Buxar. After Buxar, the Mughals retained control of
       territory in northern and western India but effectively surrendered governance of much of southern and
       eastern India to the British East India Company. This included awarding the British East India Company the
       right to collect taxes in Bengal in 1765. The immense wealth gained from tax collection enabled the Company
       to further dominate India. Forces under the leadership of the Company defeated the Kingdom of Mysore in
       southern India by 1799 and the central Indian Maratha Empire by 1818 (Figure 6.13).

       FIGURE 6.13 Britain's Growing Control in India. These maps of India show (in blue) the area dominated by the

       Britain and the British East India Company both benefited economically from their colonial control of India.
       When investors founded the company in 1600, they initially focused on trading in spices. As spices decreased
       in price and profit, however, the Company turned its attention to textiles produced by highly skilled Indian
       artisans. Finally, when the value of hand-woven fabric began decreasing in the early nineteenth century, the
       company pivoted to trading Indian-produced opium for Chinese-grown tea, which became an increasingly
       valuable consumer good in the late eighteenth century.

The British East India Company typically engaged in indirect rule, a system in which colonial powers
cooperated with Indigenous elites and allowed local leaders to exercise some authority. In exchange for British
support of their power, Indian elites upheld the company's foreign and economic policies. Most importantly,
they ensured a steady flow of taxes and soldiers from the Indigenous people to the British East India Company.
Indian soldiers, called sepoys, who were often led by British officers, defended British territory in India and
enforced British laws (Figure 6.14).

FIGURE 6.14 A Sepoy and His Wife. A Hindu sepoy of the Madras Native Infantry and his wife, shown in a
watercolor painting made on paper by an unknown army artist in about 1810. (credit: "Sepoy of Madras Native
Infantry and his wife" by National Army Museum/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
The system of indirect rule often worked within existing power structures, providing British support for elites
that had already long ruled India. However, in areas where Indigenous rulers opposed colonization, the British
disrupted traditional practices, removed elites who refused to cooperate, and administered those areas
directly. British rule led to conflicts within Indian society, with many Indigenous communities divided between
people who wanted to cooperate with the British and those who supported a series of rebellions against foreign
domination. Indians who opposed the British were further divided between those who supported violent
resistance and those who believed peaceful resistance was more promising.
In 1813, as a result of pressure exerted by religious interests on the British Parliament, the British East India
Company allowed missionaries limited access to India. This was a reversal of the Company's longstanding
224 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       policy of banning Christian missionaries for fear their activities would lead to unrest that would disrupt trade.
       The new policy pleased nobody and led to an unlikely alliance among British Christians and Indian Muslims
       and Hindus, who agreed on very little other than that the British East India Company should not rule India.
       British Christians opposed the East India Company's rule because of its stance on missionary activity. Indian
       Muslims and Hindus opposed the Company's rule because they wished to govern themselves.

      China's Dominance in Trade

       China had long been a major world power and became even stronger with the rise of the Qing (1644-1912), the
       last imperial dynasty. After defeating their Ming predecessors and consolidating their power, Qing rulers
       turned to rebuilding the Chinese economy. With a stable frontier, they were able to reduce military spending
       and lower tax burdens, which freed money for people to invest in businesses and for the wealthier classes to
       purchase luxuries. The Qing seized land from wealthy families that supported their political rivals and
       distributed it to other families that set up small farms. To help these new farms, the government gave the
       owners draft animals, tools, and seeds. Most farmers focused on growing rice in the river valleys, but the
       introduction of potatoes from the Americas allowed them to grow food on hilly ground that had never been
       widely cultivated before. Some began growing tobacco, which also came from the Americas and became a key
       cash crop for Chinese farmers.
       To facilitate economic development, the Qing upgraded China's infrastructure, including rebuilding roads and
       improving the Grand Canal. Begun in the fifth century BCE and still in use today, this waterway stretches 1,100
       miles from Beijing in the north to Hangzhou in the south. It is the world's longest canal and connects several
       important waterways, including the Huang (Yellow), Huai, and Yangtze Rivers (Figure 6.15). In the Qing era, the
       Grand Canal transported luxuries, but most importantly it brought food from the rich agricultural river valleys
       of the south to the large cities of northern China such as Beijing, which became major centers of commerce
       and manufacturing during this time.

The Qing dynasty's leaders also focused on increasing China's international trade. They signed new treaties
with foreign nations, including the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727) with Russia, which opened China to new European
markets. They also improved trading relationships with Japan, the nations of Southeast Asia, and the
Philippines. The Qing government lifted most prohibitions on trade with the western nations. Under the
Canton system, in place from 1759 to 1842, western Europeans were permitted to trade with China if they
agreed to work through the Chinese guilds that enjoyed monopoly rights to the tea and silk trades. Under this
system, all trade was confined to the southern Chinese port of Canton (Guangzhou) in order to limit contact
with Europeans and foreign influence on China. Only members of the merchant guild authorized to transact
business with Westerners were allowed to have contact with Europeans. All Europeans trading in China were
subject to Chinese law, and they were required to live and do business in a small area outside the city walls.
Europeans were not allowed to bring firearms or warships into the port, and European women were also
226 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       prohibited from settling in Canton, which prevented a permanent European community from taking root
       there.

       The Canton system successfully increased China's trade with Europe and improved the Chinese economy. By
       1833, the Chinese were exporting twenty-eight times more tea and welcoming thirteen times more foreign
       ships than before. Tea was the most important export, but China also exported large quantities of silk and
       porcelain. It rejected most European trade goods and insisted on payment for its exports in silver. Desperate
       for Chinese goods, Europeans complied, and several million dollars' worth of silver flowed into China each
       year. As a result, China enjoyed a very favorable balance of trade with Europe. This encouraged European
       nations to find a way to chip away at China's trade advantages.

      Colonial Resistance and Revolution

       The colonies' role as generators of wealth for their home nations led to the exploitation of both their original
       inhabitants and their natural resources. As European states sought to expand their colonial dominions in
       order to play a greater role in the global economy, they encountered resistance from the people whose lands
       and labor they sought to use. Some of the earliest resistance took place in the Americas.

       Resistance in the Americas

       The Indigenous people of New Spain were the first to fight back. The first instance of resistance took place in
       1493 with the destruction of Columbus's early colony, called La Navidad, by the Indigenous inhabitants of
       Hispaniola. When Columbus returned to Hispaniola on his second voyage he discovered that all thirty-nine of
       the men he had left behind had been killed. Some acts of resistance nearly put an end to Spanish settlement in
       parts of North America. In 1680, a Tewa Pueblo religious leader named Popé (Po'pay) led his tribe along with
       other Pueblo people and the Apache tribe in an uprising against Spanish religious, economic, and cultural
       abuses in New Mexico. Four hundred Spanish died, and the rest fled the region. Twelve years passed before the
       Spanish returned to the region in significant numbers. The Pueblo Revolt ultimately failed to provide Native
       Americans with permanent independence, but it did shape Spain's colonial policies in the region. Although
       Spain regained control of the region in 1692, it subsequently granted land to the Pueblos and appointed
       officials to represent the tribes' rights in Spanish courts. The Pueblos adopted some elements of Spanish
       culture, including some Christian practices, but Spanish priests did not attempt to destroy the Pueblos'
       traditional religion as they had before. The Pueblo tribes were thus able to retain much of their way of life,
       preserving unique cultures that remain today.

crop. Tobacco cultivation quickly drained the soil of nutrients, leading English settlers to push further
westward in search of land for new fields. Even where colonists did not grow cash crops, the demand for
farmland placed pressure on Indigenous communities.

Colonists attempted to enslave Native Americans and use their labor to grow tobacco. Sometimes the English
captured Indigenous people in attacks on their villages, and sometimes Native American tribes sold war
captives to them. Before the arrival of Europeans, Native American tribes had often integrated captives from
other groups into their own. Now these people might be sold to the English as enslaved laborers. Although the
enslavement of Native Americans was most common in English colonies in the south, it occurred in northern
colonies as well.

The English found themselves in frequent conflict with Native American tribes. Between 1609 and 1646,
Virginia colonists fought a series of wars with the Powhatan Confederacy, an alliance of tribes that spoke
languages of the Algonquin family. In New England, longstanding complaints by Indigenous people about
English usurpation of land, dishonest traders who cheated them, attempts to convert them to Christianity, and
English officials' refusal to allow them to punish Europeans who had wronged them led to the outbreak of King
Philip's War.

United in the summer of 1675 by the Wampanoag leader Metacomet, called King Philip by the English, Native
American tribes throughout New England attacked English settlements, destroying several and threatening to
expel the English from their lands entirely. The English led a counterattack with the help of Native Americans
who had converted to Christianity and killed Metacomet's followers. The conflict ended in 1676 when
Metacomet too was killed (Figure 6.16).

       English colonial leaders displayed Metacomet's severed head in Plymouth as a grisly trophy of their success. To
       prevent future attacks, captured Wampanoags and others who had allied themselves with Metacomet were
       enslaved and sent to labor on English sugar plantations in the Caribbean. Between 1715 and 1717, provoked
       by many of the same issues that had led to conflict in New England, the Yamasee, a confederation of Native
       American tribes in the Carolinas, also waged war on British colonists. Like Metacomet's followers, the Yamasee
       were killed or enslaved. The survivors fled the region or joined other tribes.
       Resistance in Africa
       Africa was also subject to European incursions, beginning with the Portuguese in the fifteenth century. In the
       sixteenth century, other Europeans began to arrive. The coastal areas were most likely to be targeted and were
       particularly vulnerable to imperialist invaders because they were more accessible to advanced warships.
       As Native Americans had done, Africans resisted European encroachments on their lands and efforts to
       deprive them of their sovereignty. In the early 1500s, Europeans began enslaving Africans in large numbers as
       part of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which lasted until the mid-nineteenth century. European slave traders,
       like the Arab slave traders before them, typically worked within Africa's existing power structures and
       purchased enslaved people from rival groups of Africans, in a process that disrupted but did not initially

challenge Africans' control of the interior. Many Africans, particularly in the interior, actively resisted foreign
influence.

One of the longest acts of resistance was led by Queen Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba. Nzinga inherited the
position of ruler of the kingdom of Ndongo, in what is now Angola, in 1624 following the death of her brother.
She had served as emissary from her brother to the Portuguese and helped end the hostilities between them
and her brother's military forces. In 1621, she negotiated an agreement whereby the Portuguese were allowed
to engage in the slave trade within Ndongo territory but not to establish forts there. Nzinga was also adamant
that Ndongo would not pay tribute to the Portuguese king. To assure the Portuguese that she negotiated in
good faith, she agreed to convert to Roman Catholicism and had the Portuguese governor's wife serve as her
godmother.

Following Nzinga's ascension to the throne, however, Portugal began to renege on the terms of the treaty and to
insist that the nobles of Ndongo become vassals of the king of Portugal. This would mean sending the
Portuguese king the soldiers, enslaved people, and supplies they otherwise owed to Nzinga. In retaliation,
Nzinga encouraged enslaved people to escape from the Portuguese. In 1626, Portugal declared war on her.

The common people of Ndongo and some of the lesser members of the nobility supported Nzinga, while more
powerful nobles, who hoped to benefit from engaging in the slave trade with Portugal, supported the
Europeans. Nzinga found allies in the kingdom of Kongo. She was also assisted by Dutch slave traders, with
whom she did business. Following the conclusion of a peace treaty between the Dutch and the Portuguese,
Nzinga found herself unable to force the Portuguese out of Ndongo territory and dedicated her efforts to
preventing them from moving deeper into the African interior. Finally, in 1656, Nzinga concluded a peace
treaty with Portugal and hostilities ceased.

Other African tribes resisted the incursions of the Dutch. In 1652, the Dutch East India Company established a
settlement at the Cape of Good Hope and traded with the Indigenous people of the region, the Khoikhoi, who
were hunters and cattle herders. Although the Company prohibited the enslavement of the Indigenous peoples
of the Cape in order to maintain their willingness to participate in the cattle trade, conflict arose between the
settlers and the Khoisan (the name by which the Khoikhoi and another people, the San, are jointly known).
Dutch farmers took over Indigenous hunting and grazing lands to grow crops and herd their own cattle. The
Khoisan responded by burning Dutch farms and stealing their cattle. The Dutch then retaliated by attacking
Khoisan settlements. This conflict continued throughout the eighteenth century.

As the Khoisan lost control of their lands to the Dutch, who increasingly expanded inland from the Cape, many
found themselves becoming laborers on Dutch farmsteads, either because they could not support themselves
after losing their land and cattle or because they were captured by settlers during Dutch raids. In the second
half of the eighteenth century, the Dutch instituted a system of forcing Khoisan children to serve
"apprenticeships" until age twenty-five. Although technically the Khoisan were not enslaved, they had been
reduced to a situation very much like slavery. The Dutch also employed enslaved laborers brought from
elsewhere in Africa.

The movement of the Dutch inland brought them into conflict with the Xhosa people, who were farmers.
Although the Dutch possessed more firepower, the Xhosa greatly outnumbered them. The Dutch fought two
wars with the Xhosa and, from 1799 to 1803, also faced an armed uprising by Khoisan farm laborers, some of
whom allied themselves with the Xhosa.

As other European empires grew more powerful in the early nineteenth century, they also began to expand
beyond their coastal trading posts in Africa as the Dutch had done and became more active in events on the
continent (Figure 6.17). In 1806, the British supported the Fante Confederacy, their African trading partner on
what is now the coast of Ghana, in a series of conflicts with the Asante Empire and its Dutch allies. These
conflicts culminated in the Anglo-Asante Wars of 1823-1900. The Asante, who hoped to replace Britain as the
most powerful nation on the western coast, resisted the British slave trade and Britain's broader pattern of
230 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       economic imperialism, the practice of dominating a foreign country economically. They succeeded for many
       years and repeatedly forced the British to retreat to their coastal strongholds. Despite the Asante's initial
       successes, however, the British and their allies eventually proved more powerful and claimed victory in 1900.
       The British controlled much of the African west coast until the Indigenous people in the region used a
       combination of nonviolent resistance and political pressure to win independence for the nation now known as
       Ghana in 1957.

       Resistance in Asia
       Resistance to European colonialism took place in India as well. The Indian Mutiny of 1857, also known as the
       Sepoy Rebellion, was an attempt to overthrow British rule. The British East India Company's preference for
       indirect rule had changed as its successes in India convinced British leaders they were capable of governing it
       directly. As Indian elites saw their power slipping away, they became more interested in opposing British rule.
       Waves of European missionaries who sought to convert Indians to Christianity had also offended many who
       wanted to preserve their own traditions.
       The activities of Christian missionaries were only one cause of Indian resentment. Lord Dalhousie, the
       governor-general of India from 1848 to 1856, had devised a means of gaining direct control for the British over
       formerly independent Indian states. It was Hindu custom for a ruler who did not have a natural heir to adopt
       one and to pass his kingdom to him upon his death. Dalhousie, however, introduced the doctrine of the lapse,
       which gave Britain the right to approve any such adoptions and to annex states without heirs. Under this
       policy, adoptions were rejected and states annexed beginning in 1848. Even though the practice affected
       primarily states with Hindu rulers, British usurpation alarmed all members of India's aristocracy.
       Britain's confidence in the superiority of its own culture also led it to attempt changes in customary Hindu
       practices in ways that angered many Indians. The British attempted to end the Hindu practice of sati (suttee),
       in which Hindu widows were expected to burn themselves alive on their husbands' funeral pyres, and passed a

British for positions in business and government. Because British schools were more prevalent in Hindu-
majority areas, Hindus threatened to supplant Muslims in positions of authority that Muslims had held for
centuries.

Long-simmering anger against the British turned into violence in response to the introduction of the Enfield
Rifle, which used lubricated cartridges that soldiers had to bite open before loading. The lubricant had been
beef or pork fat, but pork is taboo for Muslims and Hindus believe cows are sacred. The British attempted to
correct the problem by using another lubricant, but Indian troops remained suspicious and some began to
believe the British were intentionally using lubricants made of offensive materials to emasculate the sepoys. In
March 1857, a sepoy named Mangal Pandey, a devout Hindu from the high-ranking Brahmin caste, attacked
two British officers. The British executed him, and India erupted into a mass revolt.

The rebelling Indians outnumbered the British during the mutiny, but the British were unified while the
Indians were unable to work together across religious, ethnic, and geographic divisions. After a series of fierce
battles and war crimes by both sides, the British declared victory on July 8, 1859. They celebrated with mass
executions of rebel leaders, a move some British officers criticized. The Indian Mutiny convinced the British
government that the owners of the British East India Company were unable to effectively govern India. The
government thus abolished the company, took control of British India in 1858, and directly ruled the territory
until it became independent in 1947. The period from 1858 to 1947 is therefore known as the British Raj (raj
means "rule" in Sanskrit), or the British Paramountcy, which meant rule of India by the British government
through the Viceroy of India.

Growing economic relationships also led to conflict when the British tried to end China's positive balance of
trade by importing opium into China from their territories in India. The Chinese had used chewed opium as a
medicine and mild recreational drug for thousands of years, but in the early nineteenth century, users began
smoking dried opium, a practice inspired by the smoking of tobacco imported from the Americas. Smoking
opium led to a far more intense high than chewing it, and opium addiction became a serious problem in China.
The Chinese government outlawed recreational opium in 1729, but the British traders refused to stop selling
it, and the price skyrocketed. Merchants from other nations including France and the United States also began
selling opium in China, but the British dominated the trade from their bases in India.

In 1839, the Chinese government seized opium in British warehouses in Canton. In response, the British sent
military forces to China with orders to impose penalties on the Chinese government and protect British
merchants in a conflict later named the First Opium War. The British used their superior military technology
and organization to defeat the outdated Chinese military in almost every engagement. They could not hope to
conquer the huge nation, but they made repeated raids against which the Chinese were unable to defend
themselves. In 1842, Great Britain and China signed the Treaty of Nanjing, which forced China to surrender
Hong Kong to Great Britain, opened five ports to European traders, and gave the British a favorable trading
status. The Chinese were also forced to pay a huge fine. The following year, a second treaty allowed British
citizens in China to be tried in British courts for violations of the law, making them immune from prosecution
by Chinese authorities.

After a brief period of relative peace, the Second Opium War broke out in 1856 after Chinese soldiers seized a
British ship in Chinese waters, crewed by Chinese sailors suspected of piracy. The British demanded the
immediate return of the ship and crew and an apology. The Qing government refused, and the British navy
bombarded the Chinese coast. The French supported the British in hopes of gaining greater access to Chinese
markets. The United States and Russia did not formally join the alliance, but they did provide limited support
for British and French combat operations. The Second Opium War, like the First, was marked by European
raids on the Chinese coast that damaged and humiliated China but did not threaten its existence.

The war ended in 1860 with the Convention of Beijing, which ceded select Chinese territories to Russia,
expanded the borders of British-controlled Hong Kong, prevented religious discrimination against Christians,
and eliminated almost all restrictions on foreign access to China. The treaty also led to a continuous series of
232 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       other treaties between the west and China--later referred to by the Chinese as "unequal treaties" because they
       were imposed rather than negotiated. Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997.

       North America: The Road to Revolution

       Europeans were occasionally victims of their own success, as when economic imperialism inadvertently
       created societies strong enough to form independent nations that declared independence from the home
       country. In at least one case, thirteen former colonies formed a nation that became wealthier and more
       powerful than the empire that preceded it.

       The British colonies in North America began as struggling trading outposts in the early 1600s, but by the
       middle of the 1700s they were home to more than two million people who largely governed themselves and
       enjoyed a thriving commercial economy. British mercantilist policies, however, threatened North American
       economic development. In the second half of the seventeenth century, England passed a series of Navigation
       Acts designed to maximize profit from its colonies while denying their resources to other European powers
       and clamping down on efforts to avoid trade restrictions through smuggling. The Navigation Act of 1660 listed
       goods produced in the colonies that could be sold only in England or to its colonial possessions. Thus, English
       merchants paid American colonists what the merchants thought their goods were worth; the colonists were
       forbidden to sell to Dutch, French, Spanish, or other merchants who might be willing to pay more.

       Among these products were furs, tobacco, and sugar, goods for which all of Europe yearned. Also included
       were rice, ginger, cotton, and indigo and other plants used to make dye. English textile manufacturers needed
       the cotton and dyestuffs, and to protect their interests further, the Exportation Act of 1660 also prohibited the
       export of English wool. In addition, naval stores for building and maintaining ships for trade and war could be
       sent only to England. These included masts, hemp (to make rope), pine tree pitch (which sealed ships and
       made them watertight), and pine tree sap (used in the manufacture of turpentine). Once they arrived in
       England, these colonial products were heavily taxed, and the revenue went to the English government, not to
       the colonies that had produced them.

       To generate yet more income for the government, the Navigation Act of 1663 mandated that all goods bound
       for the colonies from outside the British Empire had first to be shipped to England and taxed before they could
       continue to their final destination. This provision increased the price to the colonists of non-English goods
       because foreign shippers passed the cost of the English taxes on to them.

       At the end of the seventeenth century, Parliament also began to prohibit colonists from manufacturing certain
       goods that were also produced in England, to prevent them from underselling English merchants. Colonists
       could not sell goods made from wool or iron, either in England or to other English colonies, and by the mid-
       eighteenth century they could not export beaver hats. Beaver hats were a popular fashion in Europe, and the
       English colonies actively participated in the fur trade. By allowing the colonists to export only the unfinished
       furs instead of the finished hats, for which they could have charged higher prices, Parliament limited the
       amount of wealth the settlers in the English colonies could acquire.

       In the wake of the French and Indian War, British colonists in North America greeted with hostility other
       actions by Britain's Parliament that they believed unfairly restricted their economic opportunities. Many had
       longed to move west of the Appalachian Mountains to establish farms on the rich lands of the Ohio Valley, for
       instance. New England families were large, and with each generation, parents found it difficult to provide
       sufficient land for their children. In the southern colonies, the demands of tobacco farming meant that new,
       fertile land was always in demand. Many colonies claimed territories west of the Appalachians, but this land
       had been taken by the French and was inhabited by their numerous Native American allies. With the British
       victory over the French and their Indigenous allies, the colonists looked forward to finally claiming it. The
       British government, however, wishing to avoid antagonizing the tribes of the Ohio Valley and seeking to avoid
       costly new wars, promptly prohibited settlement west of the Appalachians, to the dismay and anger of many
       colonists who had fought alongside British troops in the recently ended conflict.

Furthermore, determined to keep the peace with Native Americans and repay war debts, the British kept
troops in North America who policed the frontier, regulated colonial trade, and collected taxes. The need to pay
for the army's maintenance led to attempts to impose new taxes on the colonists or to more vigorously enforce
the collection of already existing ones. Colonists' efforts to evade trade restrictions by smuggling were
countered with laws that required smugglers be tried in admiralty courts, which lacked a jury. Many colonists
felt this practice violated protections guaranteed by the English Bill of Rights. The 1774 decision by Parliament
to grant control of the Ohio Valley to the newly acquired French province of Quebec, to allow Quebec to
continue to be governed by French civil law, and to extend religious toleration to the province's Roman
Catholics outraged British colonists, most of whom were Protestant. This ruling, made at the same time as one
that interfered with the century-and-a-half-long tradition of colonial self-government, led many colonists
increasingly to regard Britain as hostile to their interests. Growing resentment of British rule erupted in
bloodshed in 1775 and a subsequent declaration of independence in 1776.

6.3 Capitalism and the First Industrial Revolution

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain the evolution of economic theories from mercantilism to capitalism
  · Analyze the ways in which mechanization challenged existing social, economic, and political
      structures
  · Discuss the ideological responses to capitalism, including Marxism

Just as colonial empires were the crucible of new political ideas and gave rise to new forms of resistance to
exploitation, they also inspired new economic ideas. Mercantilism, which advocated building a nation's power
by increasing trade through exports, had originally propelled colonization. But as people around the world
gained their political freedom, they also became interested in economic freedom, and mercantilism fell out of
favor. Capitalism, a system in which prices and costs, not government intervention, serve to regulate the
supply and demand of goods traded for individual profit, became popular. However, not everyone agreed with
this new economic order; Marxists critiqued it and proposed systems focused on equality rather than profit.

From Mercantilism to Capitalism

In 1681, the French finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert asked a group of French business owners led by a
man named Thomas Le Gendre how the government could help them. Le Gendre reportedly told Colbert,
"Laissez nous faire," meaning "let us do it." This gave rise to the concept of laissez-faire economics, which
argues that market forces alone should drive the economy and that governments should refrain from direct
intervention in or moderation of the economic system. The idea of laissez-faire economics was consistent with
the logistical realities of global empires. It was effectively impossible for leaders in Europe to micromanage
economic operations that were on the other side of an ocean. Therefore the evolution to a laissez-faire
economic model might have been as much a practical necessity as an ideological shift.

Adam Smith was a Scottish political economist and philosopher best known for writing the book An Inquiry
into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), often referred to by its shortened title The Wealth
of Nations (Figure 6.18). Earlier scholars had written about various aspects of economics, but with this book
Smith became the first person to produce a comprehensive philosophical examination of the way nations
should manage their economies.
234 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       FIGURE 6.18 Adam Smith. This nineteenth-century etching of the Scottish economist Adam Smith is based on a
       portrait created from life by James Tassie in 1787. (credit: "Profile of Adam Smith" by Adam Smith - Vanderblue
       Collection/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       In The Wealth of Nations, Smith argued that the "invisible hand" of the marketplace guided people when they
       made their own economic decisions. By doing the work that would bring them the greatest profit, he explained,
       people inadvertently tended to produce the goods and services most needed by society. To allow the invisible
       hand to work, Smith advocated the reduction of tariffs and most forms of governmental regulation. His work
       was based on rational choice theory, the idea that people understand their options and make rational choices
       that will help them achieve reasonable objectives. In Smith's view, this form of selfishness is often good for the
       individual and for society.
       Although Smith did not use the term, preferring to call his system commercial society, he and his supporters
       promoted the idea later known as capitalism, an economic system in which private individuals and companies
       typically own the means of production such as factories and farms, and free (unregulated) markets set the
       value of most goods and services based on supply and demand.
       Smith was a critic of slavery. He believed slavery was inefficient and suggested it was doomed to fail if markets
       were truly free. Because the cost of feeding, clothing, and housing enslaved people, however poorly, was
       passed on to consumers, Smith also noted that goods made using enslaved labor were more expensive. Free
       labor could produce goods more inexpensively because the employer did not have to pay for his laborers'
       upkeep. However, Smith also used rational choice theory to minimize slavery's horrors. In The Wealth of
       Nations, he acknowledged that the enslaved people living in the British Caribbean were "in a worse condition
       than the poorest people either in Scotland or Ireland," but he justified their suffering on the basis that "it is the
       interest of their master that they should be fed well and kept in good heart in the same manner as it is his
       interest that his working cattle should be so."
       Whether sugar plantations on which enslaved people labored were themselves capitalist enterprises has been
       a matter of debate among historians. One the one hand, capitalism presupposes freedom on the part of all
       actors engaged in an economic transaction. Merchants are free to sell what they wish at the prices they wish to
       charge, and consumers are free to pay the price that is set or to refuse to buy the product. Employers are free to
       set hours and wages for employees, and employees are supposedly free to accept the employer's terms or hold

out for better ones.

The workforce on sugar plantations, however, consisted of enslaved people who could legally be coerced to do
whatever labor their owners decided for whatever compensation they chose to give (usually the minimum of
food, clothing, and shelter required to keep the laborers alive). On the other hand, plantation owners behaved
in much the same way as owners of other industrial enterprises, by setting production goals, for example.
Many have pointed out that the highly regimented system of labor on sugar plantations was much like that in
capitalist enterprises like textile factories. The debate is ongoing. What no one disputes is that the profits
earned from the sale of sugar and other plantation products grown by enslaved people were often invested in
capitalist enterprises, including the factories that were coming into existence in the eighteenth century.

Adam Smith's ideas challenged the established mercantilist economic order and attracted critics. Some
governmental leaders were understandably hesitant to surrender their power to the free market. They
questioned the wisdom of reformers like Smith who disagreed with the favorable-balance emphasis of
mercantilism. Conservative critics pointed out that while mercantilism might not have been perfect, it had
delivered tremendous wealth to Europe, or at least to Europe's ruling classes.

Other world leaders, most notably in Great Britain, rejected conservative critics and embraced Smith's ideas,
which promised greater potential freedoms and profits for the nation's wealthiest citizens, and they became
the dominant force in British economic reforms. The wealthy House of Commons leader Charles James Fox
praised Smith's ideas in Parliament, although he later admitted he had not read The Wealth of Nations and
thought it far too long. In 1777, Prime Minister Fredrick North proposed a revised tax code based on Smith's
work. In 1792, Prime Minister William Pitt praised Smith's work as "the best solution to every question
connected with the history of commerce, or with the systems of political economy."

Smith's ideas spread across the Atlantic, and in 1807 President Thomas Jefferson wrote "Smith's Wealth of
Nations is the best book to be read." As Smith's ideas took root, governments reduced tariffs, cut back on
economic regulations, and led their nations' transition from the quest for favorable balances of trade to the
search for personal profit.

Smith's ideas remain influential, but modern scholars often criticize them. In contrast to his reliance on
rational choice theory, they argue that people do not always behave rationally or make the best decisions.
Others condemn the moral failings of the invisible hand, which sacrificed the lives and wellbeing of enslaved
people, poor workers, and colonial subjects to provide elites with profit.

 The Wealth of Nations

  An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations is better known by its shortened title The Wealth
  of Nations. Published by the Scottish scholar Adam Smith in 1776, it was probably the first comprehensive study
  of economic philosophy. Always controversial, it remains an influential work today. As you read this excerpt from
  it, look for Smith's definition of the "invisible hand."

        As every individual, therefore, endeavors as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of
        domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every
        individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He
        generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting
        it. He intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may
        be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an
        invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the
        society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society
        more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.

      Mechanization

       In the late 1700s, western European nations began to adopt mechanization, the use of machines to replace the
       labor of animals and humans. Mechanization set the stage for the Industrial Revolution, a transition away
       from societies focused on agriculture and handicraft production to socioeconomic systems dominated by the
       manufacture of goods, primarily with machines.

       People in many places, including China, Egypt, India, Greece, and Rome, had made limited use of machinery in
       the ancient past; however, most goods were produced by skilled artisans for local consumption. Beginning in
       the mid-1600s, the British enjoyed an agricultural revolution that allowed smaller numbers of farmers
       employing fewer farm laborers to produce a surplus of food, and that in turn led to a population increase.

       In the 1700s, entrepreneurs in England found a way to make use of unemployed or underemployed farm
       laborers and their families. These entrepreneurs provided farm families with raw materials and asked them to
       produce finished goods in their cottages, a system that became known as cottage labor. Rural women spun
       wool or flax into thread, and men then wove it into woolen cloth or linen. Some farm families made bonnets
       from straw. Other people made nails, knit hosiery, or made lace. The entrepreneur collected their finished
       products, paid them for their labor, and sold the finished goods in towns and cities. Because the farm laborers
       were not skilled artisans, they could not command high wages, and the entrepreneurs reaped great profits.

       In time, entrepreneurs began to gather laborers together in one location, a factory. This decision gave them
       greater control over production because they could hire managers to supervise the workers' labor. It was also
       easier to install machines in factories than in laborers' cottages (although laborers might be provided with or
       rent relatively small machines, such as knitting frames, for their cottages). Factories came to be concentrated
       in towns and cities. As work moved to urban areas, so too did men and women who could not find work on
       farms. By the late 1700s, British business owners, supported by government policies inspired by Adam Smith,
       were setting up factories and hiring many of these migrant workers.

       During the Industrial Revolution, factories increasingly relied on machine power, most importantly the steam
       engine. A steam engine uses heat to transform water into steam, which expands and drives a piston to perform
       work. Hero of Alexandria, in Egypt, produced the first steam engine when he created the aeolipile, a simple
       turbine that powered toys, around the year 70 CE. Steam engines remained little more than curiosities until
       1698 when the English inventor Thomas Savery used the world's first commercial steam engine to pump water
       out of mines and to supply water for industrial water wheels. By 1776, British factories were powering some of
       their operations with improved steam engines designed by the Scottish engineer James Watt.

       Locomotives and boats powered by steam engines soon delivered raw materials to the factories and
       transported finished goods to consumers. In 1807, American inventor Robert Fulton began operation of the
       first successful commercial steamboats. In 1812, Matthew Murray, an English industrialist, opened the world's
       first successful steam locomotive line. Several inventors produced steam-powered vehicles that could travel on
       roads, but the heavy weight of steam engines and the poor conditions of most roads doomed them to failure
       and kept steam engines in the factories, waterways, and railroads.

       Industrialization, motivated and enabled by capitalism, created tremendous wealth for business owners and
       middle-class professionals, but their profits often came at a high cost to workers. The production of goods

shifted from the handiwork of highly skilled middle-class artisans to mechanized production done by low-paid
unskilled laborers. Workers did enjoy access to new consumer goods made cheaper by industrialization, but to
afford those goods they had to work long hours, in difficult and often dangerous conditions. Perhaps most
importantly, workers lost control over their working conditions. Farmers and artisans, particularly those who
owned their land or shops, were free to decide how and when they worked, whereas factory owners carefully
regulated every aspect of their workers' professional and even personal lives. For example, the 1848 employee
handbook for the Hamilton Manufacturing Company stated that "the company will not employ any one who is
habitually absent from public worship on the Sabbath, or known to be guilty of immorality."
Some workers rebelled against industrialization, which threatened their status as skilled laborers. Beginning
in 1811, a secretive group of British textile workers calling themselves Luddites began destroying textile
machinery, rioting, and setting fires in response to the industrialization of their workplaces (Figure 6.19). They
took their name from the mythical Ned Ludd, a worker who supposedly destroyed a mechanized loom rather
than submit to industrialization. As the Luddite movement grew, so did the legend of Ned Ludd, until some
workers claimed that King Ludd lived in Sherwood Forest and fought corrupt industrialists, much as Robin
Hood had opposed corrupt authorities during the Middle Ages. The Luddites did not argue in favor of a specific
ideology or a grander purpose. They were simply angry that industrialization was destroying their traditional
way of life, and they fought back with every tool at their disposal.

FIGURE 6.19 Luddites Revolt. Luddites were workers who opposed mechanization, primarily in the British cloth-
making industry. This image depicting two Luddites breaking an industrial fabric-making frame was made in 1812.
(credit: "Frame-breakers, or Luddites, smashing a loom" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
British leaders reacted quickly to the Luddites, with some calling them a mob worthy of execution. In 1812, the
poet and peer Lord Byron responded by pointing out that these same people worked the fields, produced the
goods, and served in the armed forces of the British Empire. Byron argued that the mob "often speaks the
sentiments of the people" and warned "it is the mob" that "enabled you to defy all the world and can also defy
you when neglect and calamity have driven them to despair." He urged the British government to respond to
the protesting workers with "conciliation and firmness" rather than violence. Most British business and
political leaders disagreed with Byron and worked to suppress the rebellion. Parliament made industrial
238 6 · Colonization and Economic Expansion

       sabotage a capital offense. British authorities hanged many Luddites and exiled more to prison colonies. By
       1816, the industrialists had defeated the Luddites. Today, "Luddite" is often used as a generic description of
       anyone opposed to technological change.

         The Luddites were British factory workers who engaged in the destruction of machines, rioting, and vandalism to
         resist industrialization. Following are excerpts from two primary sources on the Luddites, describing separate
         incidents and written from different perspectives.

               --An account of machine-breaking at Linthwaite, Yorkshire, March 1812
               Sir
               We mentioned some frames to be removed today from 10 miles off. They came totally unmolested. The
               soldiers did not go near the village, and the constables had no interruption whatever.
               We have been concerned to see these instances of removing frames because it must leave some of the
               country people without the means of work, but it will at the same time open their eyes to the
               consequence of their own proceedings. For some time before these troubles broke out, in many places a
               fifth of the frame workers were out of employ, and this naturally induced some hosiers (not perhaps of
               the first reputation) to give them particular kinds of work at reduced prices; and the hosiers who were
               giving the higher prices found themselves undersold in certain articles at the London Market.
               This again brought about new arrangements, which soured the whole body of workmen . . . resentment
               against those hosiers who paid the under price has been the leading feature up to the present day. They
               have seldom made free with other property altho' opportunities at all times have presented themselves,
               and in one instance lately at Clifton, some cloths that one of the frame breakers brought away, were
               carefully sent back again the following day.

Marxism

Karl Marx was a highly controversial intellectual and revolutionary. Born in 1818 in Trier, in what is now
Germany, he grew up as the son of a successful lawyer and was baptized into the Evangelical Church when he
was six years old. As a young man, he studied law at the University of Berlin, where a professor introduced him
to the philosophy of Georg Hegel. Marx quickly embraced Hegel's idealistic universal history, which suggested
the world is progressing through conflicts toward greater freedom. After completing his education, he worked
as a journalist and writer.
In 1848, Marx published The Communist Manifesto with his co-author Friedrich Engels. In the book, the two
argued that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." Their idea, that
recognizing the class struggle between workers and the ruling class is central to understanding societies, is
also known as Marxism (Figure 6.20). In addition to laying out their vision of history, Marx and Engels
predicted that society would eventually replace current economic systems with socialism, a system in which
the public, not private companies or individuals, owns the means of production. In their view, socialism was
one phase of the transition from the private ownership characteristic of capitalism to the completely classless
society of communism. They called for the forcible overthrow of current societies, a statement many
communists around the world embraced as a declaration of war on capitalism. The ideals of communism were
inspired by the abuses of capitalism that often exploited workers.

           LINK TO LEARNING

       Karl Marx published The Communist Manifesto with his co-author Friedrich Engels in 1848. Many writers
       from across the political and ideological spectrum inaccurately portray the ideas in The Communist Manifesto
       to support their own ideas or to paint their opponents in a negative light. Consider reading The Communist
       Manifesto (https://openstax.org/l/77CommManifesto) for yourself and drawing your own conclusions about
       what the work says and what it might mean to you.

       Marx's book Das Kapital, published in 1867, is one of history's most often cited sources on economics and
       politics. In Das Kapital, Marx argued that the bourgeoisie, members of a social class that owned the means of
       production, were primarily motivated by the desire to exploit labor. In his view, employers paid wages to their
       workers, also known as the proletariat, that were far less than their labor was worth. They then kept the excess
       value produced by wage earners, in a process Marx argued was unfair to the workers. Employers used their
       profits to purchase additional resources and to buy political influence to ensure that the law would support the
       wealthy instead of the workers. The wealthy became unfit to rule as they increasingly leveraged their growing
       economic and political power until workers were left powerless and in poverty. Eventually the capitalist system
       would collapse, and the workers would reclaim control of society.

                                                                                 THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT

        Marx on Capitalism and Communism

         Karl Marx died almost 150 years ago, but his ideas remain widely debated. In 1867, Marx published the first
         volume of Das Kapital, and it quickly reached a wide audience among those interested in history, economics, and
         politics. After his death in 1883, Fredrich Engels, his co-author on The Communist Manifesto, published the
         second and third volumes of Das Kapital based on Marx's notes. In this quote from Das Kapital, Marx explained
         his view of the origins of capitalism.

               The economic structure of capitalist society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society.
               The dissolution of the latter set free the elements of the former . . . [T]he historical movement which
               changes the producers into wage-workers, appears, on the one hand, as their emancipation from
               serfdom and from the fetters of the guilds, and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians. But,
               on the other hand, these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed
               of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal
               arrangements. And the history of this, their expropriation, is written in the annals of mankind in letters
               of blood and fire.

               --Karl Marx, Das Kapital

         Long after Marx's death, his ideas continued to provide inspiration for people dissatisfied with inequality between
         social classes and angered by injustices. In 1917, revolutionaries in Russia, inspired by Marx's ideas, overthrew
         the government and established a new communist society that became the Soviet Union and existed until 1991.
         Subsequent communist revolutions gave rise to governments that still exist in China, Vietnam, North Korea,
         Cuba, and Laos. Even in capitalist countries, communist and socialist political parties exist and are often quite
         popular with voters. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proudly calls himself a socialist, although as many have
         pointed out, he does not seek to overthrow capitalism or advocate public ownership of the means of production.

Section Summary

6.1 European Colonization in the Americas

European settlers in North America were a diverse group with a wide array of motives. Many Spaniards came
as part of a broader search for "God, Gold, and Glory." French settlers also hoped to find wealth, although they
were more likely than other Europeans to cooperate with rather than exploit Indigenous peoples, whom they
saw as economic allies. The Virginia Company of England founded Jamestown in an effort to gain wealth, while
English Puritans founded communities they hoped would earn profits while also promoting their religious
ideology. Native peoples responded to European colonization in a variety of ways. In Mexico, the Aztecs fought
the Spanish and were destroyed, while the Tlaxcalans, who collaborated with the Spanish against the Aztecs,
enjoyed greater status and economic opportunities in the Spanish Empire as a result.

6.2 The Rise of a Global Economy

The Seven Years' War (1754-1763) established a new balance of power in Europe in which Britain emerged as
the dominant empire. The French surrendered their imperial possessions in North America and India to
Britain, while the Spanish surrendered Florida and the French gave control of the Louisiana Territory to Spain.
The Peace of Hubertusburg guaranteed Prussian control of Silesia and confirmed Prussia's status as a major
force in Europe.

The British East India Company provided the British with a strong basis of military and economic power in
south Asia; it and Britain both benefited economically from their colonial control of India. In China, the Qing

dynasty's leaders completed new trade treaties with foreign nations, including the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)
with Russia, and improved trading relationships with Japan, the nations of Southeast Asia, and the Philippines.
Under the Canton system, China increased its trade with Europe and improved its economy, while rejecting
most European trade goods and insisting on payment in silver, acquiring a very favorable balance of trade.

European colonialism did not go unopposed. In Africa, the Ndongo battled the Portuguese, the Khoisan and
Xhosa fought the Dutch, and the Asante opposed British expansion. In both India and China, people took up
arms against Britain. Ironically, some of the strongest opposition to the role of Great Britain came from its own
colonies in North America, where economic dissatisfaction led to a declaration of independence.

6.3 Capitalism and the First Industrial Revolution

Mechanization and industrialization, motivated and enabled by capitalism, created tremendous wealth for
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century business owners and middle-class professionals, but their profits often
came at a high cost to workers. The production of goods shifted from the handiwork of highly skilled middle-
class artisans to mechanized production done by low-paid unskilled laborers. Workers did enjoy access to new
consumer goods made cheaper by industrialization, but to afford those goods they had to work long hours, in
difficult and often dangerous conditions. Perhaps most importantly, workers lost control over their working
conditions.

Karl Marx and his followers responded to the worst excesses of capitalism by proposing a new theory that
became known as Marxism. Marx argued that the bourgeoisie, members of a social class that owned the means
of production, were primarily motivated by the desire to exploit labor and keep the excess value wage earners
produced in order to buy political influence. Eventually the capitalist system would collapse and workers
reclaim control of society. Marx argued that the struggle between classes was the root of all historical conflicts.
He predicted that society would eventually replace current economic systems with socialism, a system in
which the public, not private companies or individuals, owns the means of production.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

7.1 The Enlightenment
7.2 The Exchange of Ideas in the Public Sphere
7.3 Revolutions: America, France, and Haiti
7.4 Nationalism, Liberalism, Conservatism, and the Political Order
INTRODUCTION The eighteenth century was an era of radical political transformation, social upheaval, and
far-reaching change that reverberated across the Atlantic. As new ideas began to challenge traditional political
structures and hierarchies, people increasingly debated the rights of individuals and the proper limits of royal
and religious authority. Many, such as Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution (Figure 7.1),
were inspired by the philosophical movement known as the Enlightenment, which embraced the principles of
reason and intellectual optimism. Enlightenment ideals were only partially realized. But the growing spirit of
critical thinking ultimately inspired a series of revolutions that radically transformed political and economic
life.
248 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       In the American Revolution, colonists' rejection of arbitrary monarchical power and taxation expanded into a
       full-fledged demand for national independence. The French Revolution also represented a rejection of
       traditional royal privileges and the inauguration of a new political model. In neither case, however, did the
       demands for freedom and inclusion extend to Black people, Native Americans, women, or religious minorities.
       As the first sustained and successful challenge to the institution of slavery in the Atlantic world, the Haitian
       Revolution, more than any other conflict of the eighteenth century, resulted in the most widespread radical
       change. Rather than being universally supported, however, each of these three revolutions and their embrace
       of newfound freedoms met with a reactionary backlash, the effects of which reached into the modern world.

7.1 The Enlightenment

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the relationship between scientific developments and the Enlightenment
  · Discuss major theories of natural rights
  · Analyze Enlightenment ideas about the social contract and the consent of the governed
The key principles of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Scientific Revolution established the view that
the universe was orderly and rational. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, this idea had prompted
significant challenges to Christianity's traditional justification for social hierarchies and its view of the nature
of the cosmos. By defying long-standing notions of nature, the universe, and the limits of human intelligence,
the early modern revolution in scientific thought expanded the frontiers of knowledge and inspired
intellectual innovation. During the eighteenth century, thinkers in academia and beyond continued their
critical exploration, scrutinizing traditional structures from religion to the monarchy. This newfound critical
spirit and robust exchange of ideas ultimately became known as the Enlightenment.
Historians have typically located the birthplace of the Enlightenment in western Europe. Its inspirations were
truly global in nature, however, ranging from the cosmopolitanism of the ethnically, religiously, and culturally
diverse Ottoman Empire to the rich philosophical traditions of China. Ultimately, these ideas were more
influential in Europe than elsewhere, but the consequences of the Enlightenment were by no means limited to
Europe. Enlightenment thinkers in Europe created a new synthesis of knowledge that later spread to the rest of
the world, where colonial subjects added their own interpretations and put these ideas to their own uses.

The Authority of Reason

We cannot reduce the Enlightenment to a single unifying philosophy or body of thought. But Enlightenment
thinkers in intellectual circles in Asia, Europe, and the Americas were inspired by the seventeenth century's
emphasis on using reason to grapple with questions about human nature, the complexities of political power
250 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       and the social order, and the principles of logic and scientific thinking.
       Many of the components of Western science that, along with the ideas of the Italian Renaissance, inspired
       Enlightenment thought were built on scientific traditions developed in the Islamic world, which had absorbed
       ancient Greek and Indian systems of knowledge. In particular, Al-Andalus, the Muslim-ruled area of Spain and
       Portugal that rose to power in 711, began wielding significant influence on European intellectual activity in the
       eleventh and twelfth centuries. By preserving and translating the works of ancient Greek thinkers, such as
       Aristotle and Plato, that were not available in Europe at the time, Muslim scholars in Spain fueled both the
       European Renaissance of the twelfth century and the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth
       centuries. In addition to preserving seminal Greek texts, Muslim scholars in medieval Al-Andalus, such as the
       twelfth-century intellectual Averroes, also wrote and translated Arabic philosophical treatises that were widely
       read by scholars in Christian Europe.
       Elsewhere in the Muslim world, Arabic, Indian, and Persian treatises on mathematics, medicine, and
       astronomy had long wielded significant influence on European science and philosophy. The contributions of
       medieval Persian mathematicians such as Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi and Omar Khayyam to the
       study of algebra, and the pivotal role of sixth-century Indian philosopher Aryabhata in the field of
       trigonometry, for example, provided scholars of the Scientific Revolution with the intellectual tools to develop
       novel theories about the cosmos and the nature of planetary motion (Figure 7.4). These advances, however,
       could not have occurred without the development of the decimal number system in classical India and the
       innovation of fractions in the Arabic numeral systems of North Africa by the tenth century. Scientists' ability to
       calculate advanced mathematical formulas and describe the subtleties of planetary motion not only spurred
       the Scientific Revolution but also substituted concrete information for superstition and firmly held religious
       beliefs. The Enlightenment was thus a result of cross-cultural networks of scholarship and knowledge
       exchange that facilitated the growth of science.

Among the principles that influenced Enlightenment perceptions of knowledge were the twin concepts of
deductive and inductive reasoning. Inherited from the intellectual framework of the Scientific Revolution,
these approaches represent different methods of organizing information and developing hypotheses. While
inductive reasoning gathers specific examples and observations to arrive at a broad generalization, deductive
reasoning, in contrast, begins with a general statement or theory and applies it to specific conclusions.

Deductive reasoning had its origins in the fourth century BCE in the teachings of the Greek philosopher
Aristotle, but it became a vital component of the Scientific Revolution in the work of French philosopher René
Descartes. Descartes combined deductive reasoning with empiricism, the acquisition of knowledge from
sensory experiences, to establish the foundations of the scientific method. Inductive reasoning, on the other
hand, played an important role in the work of the English natural philosopher Francis Bacon. Bacon asserted
that whereas the deductive method began with a proposition and discarded evidence that did not support that
premise, inductive reasoning reached a conclusion only after the collection of evidence. According to Bacon,
only inductive reasoning enabled researchers to support observations with empirical data rather than
conjecture.

Ultimately, both inductive and deductive reasoning influenced the intellectual context of the Enlightenment by
providing two systematic means of drawing conclusions about the natural world from observations and
evidence. Whichever method they adopted, Enlightenment thinkers embraced the scientific method as a
means of applying reason and objectivity to the collection and analysis of information.

Natural Rights

The topic of natural rights, rights possessed by all human beings, such as the right to life and liberty, formed
the focus of many philosophical treatises and conversations in the eighteenth century. Based on the premise
that all people have fundamental and inalienable rights, rights that cannot be revoked or rescinded by human
laws, the concept of natural rights originated not in the Enlightenment but in far older traditions of justice and
natural law. In the ancient Persian tradition of Zoroastrianism, for example, the concept of asha, meaning
"God's will," connoted the unchangeable law that emanates from the divine and governs the universe. Although
many ancient religious and philosophical traditions developed interpretations of natural law, European
Enlightenment thinkers transformed such ideas into a political system, which was novel at the time. The
growing emphasis on reason and the desire to improve human life in the eighteenth century led
Enlightenment philosophers to envision political systems based on natural rights, rather than the divine right
of kings or traditional Christian social hierarchies.

One of the first Enlightenment thinkers to tackle the issue of natural rights was the English philosopher John
Locke, who argued that people have fundamental rights to life, liberty, and property. In his influential work of
political philosophy, Two Treatises of Government, he argued that all people are born in a state of freedom and
that government should exist only by their consent, a principle called popular sovereignty. Although Locke
and his European contemporaries asserted the inherent equality of all humans, their interpretation of equality
is somewhat paradoxical, since in practice they supported the unequal institutions of colonialism and the
Atlantic slave trade that deprived all but White men of their natural rights.

VIII, in particular, explain Locke's interpretations of the relationship between natural rights and civil society.

Like Locke and his contemporaries in England, key figures of the French Enlightenment also debated the
scope of natural rights. François-Marie d'Arouet, more commonly known by his pen name Voltaire, was an
252 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       especially vigorous advocate of intrinsic rights and freedoms. An outspoken critic of the Catholic Church, the
       aristocracy, and the French monarchy, he was particularly focused on defending religious toleration, freedom
       of speech, and the innate utility of reason, which he did in such works as Treatise on Tolerance and Republican
       Ideas. In his most famous work, the 1759 satire Candide, Voltaire mocked both established religion and
       secular government. His contemporary Montesquieu also wrote extensively about the relationship between
       laws and rights. Montesquieu was principally concerned with the concept of political liberty and enforcing the
       separation of a state's legislative, executive, and judicial powers as a means of keeping the government in
       check, which he discussed in his 1748 book The Spirit of the Laws.

       The tension between state authority and the right of individuals to make decisions for themselves likewise
       inspired the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose contributions to Enlightenment philosophy included his
       influential treatise The Social Contract. Dating to the era of Plato and Socrates in the fourth and fifth centuries
       BCE and to the second-century BCE Buddhist text The Mahvastu, the social contract is an idea centered on
       the belief that individuals surrender their natural rights to the state, which is then charged with the task of
       maintaining and protecting those rights. In his assessment of natural rights, Rousseau contends that the
       formation of human communities makes interdependence necessary and requires reconciling individual
       freedoms with the sovereignty of the state. Individuals must be free to do as they choose, but the government
       must also be able to restrict people's actions in order to protect the rights of all. He also discussed the theory of
       the general will, a concept by which a state can be legitimate only if it is guided by the will of the people as a
       whole, rather than the whims of an elite minority.

       Whereas Locke, Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Rousseau reinforced the distinction between inalienable rights and
       the authority of the state, some philosophers of the era, such as Jeremy Bentham and Edmund Burke, cast
       doubt on the very existence of natural rights. Bentham was an English lawyer known for his adoption of
       utilitarianism, a political philosophy that emphasized the goal of achieving the greatest good for the greatest
       number of people. He contended that rights came into being only as a creation of the state and did not exist
       outside the confines of civil society. Even if a government did not do what the general will wished or
       disregarded the supremacy of natural law, Bentham wrote, disputing its legitimacy could lead only to chaos
       and lawlessness.

       Like Bentham, the Irish philosopher Edmund Burke also rejected the concept of popular sovereignty. Although
       he did not dispute the existence of natural law, he argued that natural rights became irrelevant with the
       formation of civil society, since only people of virtue and good judgment should be permitted to exercise
       political power. They would serve in the best interests of the people, who, according to Burke, would naturally
       give up their selfish desires and individual will in the interests of the state.

       Although the Enlightenment produced a wide range of opinions about the origins and meaning of natural
       rights, it also enabled people to think more critically about their relationship with the state and the legitimacy
       of revolution. While some thinkers such as Burke and Bentham defended the supremacy of the state over
       individual rights, others such as Locke and Voltaire championed the integrity of natural rights and believed
       that political liberty could not be interfered with. As the argument continued during the Enlightenment period,
       it expanded into discussions of social contract theory that focused more specifically on the ethics and
       legitimacy of law and the political order.

  Revolution, English philosopher Jeremy Bentham asserts that such rights cannot exist without government and
  laws. As you read these two sources, consider the differing ways in which they each describe the existence of
  rights beyond the reach of the state.

        The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that
        law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to
        harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions: for men being all the workmanship of one
        omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker; all the servants of one sovereign master, sent into the world by
        his order, and about his business; they are his property, whose workmanship they are, made to last
        during his, not one another's pleasure: and being furnished with like faculties, sharing all in one
        community of nature, there cannot be supposed any such subordination among us, that may authorize
        us to destroy one another, as if we were made for one another's uses, as the inferior ranks of creatures
        are for ours. Every one, as he is bound to preserve himself, and not to quit his station willfully, so by the
        like reason, when his own preservation comes not in competition, ought he, as much as he can, to
        preserve the rest of mankind, and may not, unless it be to do justice on an offender, take away, or impair
        the life, or what tends to the preservation of the life, the liberty, health, limb, or goods of another.

        --John Locke, Two Treatises of Government

        How stands the truth of things? That there are no such things as natural rights--no such things as rights
        anterior to [existing before] the establishment of government--no such things as natural rights opposed
        to, in contradistinction to, legal: that the expression is merely figurative; that when used, in the moment
        you attempt to give it a literal meaning it leads to error, and to that sort of error that leads to
        mischief--to the extremity of mischief. . . . Natural rights is simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptible
        rights, rhetorical nonsense,--nonsense upon stilts. But this rhetorical nonsense ends in the old strain of
        mischievous nonsense for immediately a list of these pretended natural rights is given, and those are so
        expressed as to present to view legal rights. And of these rights, whatever they are, there is not, it
        seems, any one of which any government can, upon any occasion whatever, abrogate [do away with] the
        smallest particle.

Social Contract Theory

At the core of Enlightenment debate about the relationship between state authority and natural rights was the
fundamental character of the social contract. This implicit agreement, or "contract," compels those living in a
society to abide by its rules and regulations or suffer punishments for violating them. In essence, those who
enter into the social contract implicitly surrender their natural rights to the state, which is then charged with
the task of maintaining and protecting those rights. However, according to many social contract theorists like
Rousseau, when a state fails to maintain the general will or protect natural rights, citizens may in turn
withdraw their social and moral obligations to the state.

The ultimate goal of social contract theory was to demonstrate that the rules imposed by civil society could be
rationally justified, and that in its ideal form, government would effectively serve the interests of the people
and uphold the general will. As a result, stability and social order would prevail for all. The roles of justice and
liberty in civil society thus formed the focus of much debate among philosophers and European rulers
concerned with preserving the balance between individual rights and political authority.
254 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       The social contract is not the same thing as democracy. A democracy is a government in which the power to
       govern rests in the hands of the people. Under social contract theory, kings and queens could determine what
       was in the best interests of their people and take such actions as they believed best protected their subjects.
       The two parties to the contract were the people on the one hand and the monarch on the other. The people
       surrendered their rights to the monarch and allowed the monarch to govern them, and the king or queen
       protected the people's interests. As social contract theory and the concept of natural rights gained greater
       recognition in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, some absolute monarchs in Europe, such as Frederick
       the Great of Prussia and Catherine the Great of Russia, embraced the influence of the Enlightenment and
       became known as an enlightened despot (Figure 7.5). Although they maintained the absolute jurisdiction of
       their rule, enlightened despots differentiated themselves from other monarchs by claiming they received their
       power from the social contract to rule in the best interest of their subjects.

       FIGURE 7.5 Catherine the Great. Commonly known as Catherine the Great, Empress Catherine II of Russia was an
       "enlightened despot" whose rule remained authoritarian even as she claimed to derive her political power from the
       social contract. This oil painting of Catherine by an unknown artist was probably made during her lifetime. (credit:
       "Portrait of Catherine II of Russia" by Kunsthistorisches Museum/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Enlightened despots often invited renowned philosophers to their courts to help design laws and policies that
       would--at least in theory--protect the essence of the social contract. Frederick of Prussia, for example, invited
       the French philosopher Voltaire to live at his palace in Potsdam in 1750. Although the nature of authoritarian
       rule may seem at odds with the preservation of natural rights and the social contract, many philosophers
       developed political models that appealed to enlightened despots. Locke, Rousseau, and Thomas Hobbes are
       often lauded in traditional historical narratives for their defense of rights and freedoms. Hobbes maintained
       that an absolute government, characterized by unlimited centralized political authority, provided the best
       means of preserving rights and freedoms in what would otherwise be an anarchic state of nature, while
       Rousseau and Locke extolled the virtues of more democratic political models.

 A Vision of the Social Contract in Leviathan

  In his influential political treatise Leviathan, English philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued that a strong
  government in the form of an absolute monarchy was the best means of ensuring political order and social
  stability. He asserted that without the guidance of a powerful sovereign, people would naturally be inclined
  toward self-interest, which would ultimately lead to chaos and anarchy. This image of the frontispiece from
  Leviathan presents a striking visual representation of Hobbes's vision (Figure 7.6).

  Leviathan, named for the mythological sea creature. (credit: "Leviathan by Abraham Bosse/Thomas Hobbes" by

        would you describe it, and how does it reflect Hobbes's vision of the social contract?

    · What appear to be the obligations of the monarch and subjects in this relationship?
Despite their adoption of a seemingly progressive vision of universal rights, however, the societies in which
Enlightenment thinkers lived did not offer freedoms to all people, nor were their writings as inclusive as they
256 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       appear. The advance of Enlightenment ideals did result in increased liberties for many--predominantly White
       men of the upper and middle classes in western Europe and what later became the United States--but most
       women, men at the lower end of the social hierarchy, and people of color were generally excluded from
       participating in the Enlightenment or benefiting from its ideals of social and political equality.

       Some elite women, such as the French philosophers Émilie du Châtelet and Germaine de Staël, assumed
       leadership roles in the era's vibrant intellectual debates and gained recognition for their contributions. Some
       Enlightenment thinkers, however, did not consider women to be equal in status to their male counterparts.
       Rousseau, for example, described women as subordinate to men based on the assumption that they were
       weaker and less rational by nature. On this premise, Rousseau argued that women belonged in the domestic
       space of the home, while the public space of politics and business was the preserve of men. Other thinkers
       such as Locke supported women's increased access to education and participation in the public sphere, but
       they asserted that men should retain leadership roles within the household and in public life due to their
       greater strength and ability. Although a small number of women played important roles in the Enlightenment,
       most did not immediately benefit from its emphasis on ideals of equality and freedom.

       In what later became the United States and in some European countries, Enlightenment theories coexisted
       with the institution of slavery, the appropriation of lands from Indigenous people, and access to political
       participation and the protections afforded by the state that were generally limited to White men of property.
       Social contract theorists generally justified such contradictions by asserting that because Indigenous peoples
       resided in a nonpolitical state, and because they were believed to lack the capacity to reason, they were not
       entitled to the rights and protections afforded to other peoples. Enlightenment lawyers, moreover, used social
       contract theory to defend slavery, on the grounds that either it was a justifiable consequence of conquest or
       Black people were incapable of governing themselves without the protection of White owners. Although social
       contract theory ultimately formed the foundations of seminal documents such as the Declaration of
       Independence and the U.S. Constitution, the ideals of rights and freedoms it espoused coexisted with
       engrained racial injustices that formed the foundation of slavery and colonialism.

     7.2 The Exchange of Ideas in the Public Sphere

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:
         · Explain the role of the public sphere as a place for debate and dissent
         · Identify the role of public and private forms of expression in the Enlightenment
         · Discuss the role of universities in fostering public debate

       As the intellectual ferment of the Enlightenment continued over the course of the eighteenth century, new
       ideas about religion, political power, and the human condition proliferated alongside a growing revolutionary
       spirit. Helping to spread these ideas was the emergence of the public sphere, spaces beyond the home and
       under the control of neither the church nor the state, such as coffeehouses and taverns where people could
       engage in free and open intellectual exchange, without fear of retribution.

       Before the late seventeenth century, public forums had been relatively uncommon in Europe outside England.
       But in the urban centers of the Islamic world and the trade centers of East Asia, informal spaces for
       conversation and political discussion, such as the many Turkish coffeehouses and the Confucian academies in
       Korea, were prominent features of social life. As international trade and cultural exchange increased between
       Europe and its Eastern neighbors during the Enlightenment, these autonomous secular spaces had a profound
       influence on the development of the public sphere in Europe.

      Public Debate and Dissent

       In the medieval period in Europe, opportunities for social encounters and the exchange of ideas had generally
       been limited to the domestic sphere of private households, or to spaces in which monarchical or church

authority could quash dissent or criticism. Over the course of Europe's seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
public spaces became a pervasive feature of its intellectual culture for the first time.
Coffeehouses, which became a staple of European cities by the end of the eighteenth century, had long been
centers of intellectual exchange and informal socialization in cities of the Islamic world after the practice of
roasting coffee beans and making them into a drink began in Yemen in the 1400s. After its subsequent
adoption in Arabia, coffee drinking spread to Egypt, Persia, and the Ottoman Empire. By the mid-sixteenth
century, coffeehouses had become a fixture of social life in many communities of the Islamic world, where
people could participate in a wide variety of conversations. Istanbul's cosmopolitan district of Tahtakale, where
merchants, artisans, sailors, tradespeople, and travelers congregated, was an especially fitting site for the
development of such establishments. After the first cafés there gained a wide following, portable coffee stalls
and neighborhood coffeehouses became popular throughout the Ottoman Empire (Figure 7.7).

FIGURE 7.7 A Coffeehouse in Istanbul. Late eighteenth-century coffeehouses in the Islamic world, like the Istanbul
establishment in this image from architect Antoine Ignace Melling's classic 1819 visual record of the city, served as
inspiration for the cafés of Enlightenment Europe's new public sphere. (credit: "Depiction of an Ottoman
Coffeehouse" by Antoine-Ignace Melling in Routledge/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
In Europe, the first coffeehouse based on the Turkish model opened in the cosmopolitan port city of Venice in
1645. Coffee shops became especially popular in England after the first one appeared in London in 1652. By
1708, London had more than five hundred, and their appeal continued to soar. The first cafés opened in Paris
in the 1670s and in cities such as Vienna, Hamburg, and Frankfurt by the end of the century. Although some
monarchs, particularly Charles II of England, attempted to suppress coffeehouses on the grounds that they
promoted dissent and anti-royalist sentiment, such efforts generally faced so much opposition that they fell
flat. Because coffeehouses existed as public spaces under private ownership in the midst of a growing
commercial economy, in most cases, monarchs and other state authorities had little control over them.
Coffeehouses occasionally acquired a reputation as centers of dissent and subversion, but they were not
inherently anti-royalist in character. Rather, they became politicized spaces in which all manner of political
debates and opinions were discussed. For those living on subsistence levels or at the lower end of the
socioeconomic hierarchy, most days were consumed with work or labor, and finding leisure to visit
258 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       coffeehouses was virtually impossible. But although not everyone had this luxury, such establishments
       provided a means of informal education for many. For the price of a cup of coffee, patrons, who were
       predominantly male, could engage in the rapid circulation of ideas and information that also facilitated the
       flourishing print culture of the era. For those who could not read or buy books, coffeehouse conversations thus
       allowed active participation in the intellectual culture of the Enlightenment.
       Whereas coffeehouses were generally spaces in which people of all social backgrounds and statuses could
       mingle, salons in eighteenth-century France tended to cater to the intellectual endeavors of a more privileged
       sector of society. Situated in the homes of wealthy aristocrats, salons were informal gatherings of writers,
       philosophers, and in theory anyone else who wished to participate. In practice, however, only those with
       adequate wealth, leisure time, and social connections tended to do so, since attendance usually depended
       upon receiving an invitation from the salon's host.
       Salons met on designated days and were typically hosted and managed by women, offering an important
       opportunity for them to take leadership roles in the cultural sphere. Hosts such as Marie-Thérèse Geoffrin,
       Julie de Lespinasse, and Suzanne Necker not only decided who could attend their salons, but they also
       managed the inclusive and back-and-forth nature of the conversations (Figure 7.8). Despite the prevailing
       sentiment among male philosophers that women were not as rational as men, elite women were nevertheless
       instrumental as benefactors and patrons of the salons, which served as essential venues for the exchange of
       Enlightenment ideas. Salons eventually evolved into hubs of literary discussion that fostered a culture of polite
       sociability and cohesion among aristocrats and propertied elites.

The Republic of Letters

Conversation and debate in the public sphere were inseparable from the flourishing print culture of the
Enlightenment era. Literacy rates, which hovered around 30 percent for men and 14 percent for women in
late-seventeenth-century French cities, had increased to 48 percent for men and 27 percent for women by the
mid-eighteenth century. These rising rates led to an explosion of books, pamphlets, newspapers, and political
cartoons. The spread of printed materials not only standardized spelling and systems of knowledge, but it also
enabled news, opinion, poetry, political philosophy, scientific texts, and information of all kinds to reach a
much wider audience than the spoken word alone. The Republic of Letters was a long-distance community of
writers who corresponded with each other across Europe and the Atlantic in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, sending handwritten letters and published materials of every kind that provided a crucial
international exchange and transmission of ideas. The Republic of Letters was a society whose citizens, rather
than living in the same geographic area, like the citizens of a political republic, were united by ideas spread
through print. No matter where in Europe or the Atlantic world they lived, all literate people could belong to
the Republic of Letters. They engaged with one another on terms of intellectual equality and freely exchanged
ideas, just like citizens of a political republic who were, theoretically, free and equal.

Among the luminaries were prominent philosophers and political leaders, including Voltaire, Benjamin
Franklin, and Catherine the Great. Given that those who participated in the Republic of Letters hailed from
many different countries and spoke many different languages, much of their writing either was in Latin, then
the universal language of scholarship in multilingual Europe, or required access to proficient translators. This
obstacle made it difficult for the majority of people to participate directly in the print culture of the
Enlightenment.

 Spreading Ideas in the Past and Present

  The emergence of the public sphere in the Enlightenment has had a long-standing influence on the exchange of
  ideas in the modern world. In his influential 1962 treatise The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere,
  German philosopher Jürgen Habermas identified the development of the free and open exchange of ideas as a
  product of the eighteenth century. According to Habermas, this development was the result of the "feudal
  foundations of power" (that is, Europe's medieval legacy of centralized monarchical rule and the institutional
  power of Christianity) being supplanted by the development of a capitalist economy and the emergence of
  spaces for the free and open exchange of ideas beyond the control of the state or the church. Habermas asserted
  that between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, economic activities that had formerly been part of the
  domestic space of the household increasingly became associated with spaces of exchange, such as markets and
  coffeehouses that functioned independently of government authority.

260 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       Despite the pervasive influence of print culture, the direct impact of Enlightenment texts among the general
       public was limited by relatively low literacy rates among the artisans, peasants, and tradespeople of the era.
       Literacy rates were climbing rapidly among members of the urban elite, particularly wealthy merchants and
       aristocrats, but they remained well below 20 percent for those at the lower end of the socioeconomic hierarchy,
       especially in rural areas. Although the Enlightenment embraced, in theory, some democratic principles about
       the exchange of knowledge, in practice, participation in that exchange was limited to those with adequate
       wealth and leisure time. Books were prohibitively expensive and remained well out of the reach of all but the
       wealthiest members of society. Even cheaply printed pamphlets represented a significant expense for most
       eighteenth-century laborers and peasants. By the second half of the eighteenth century, lending libraries had
       emerged to expand the reading public's access to printed materials, but only select academics and government
       officials were permitted to borrow books. By the end of the century, however, reading clubs whose members
       paid an annual fee for access to books and periodicals began to expand the size of the reading public and
       increase levels of literacy among the middle class.

      Academies, Universities, and Intellectuals

       The salons, print shops, and coffeehouses of the public sphere existed alongside more formal educational
       institutions and academies that also contributed to the intellectual culture of the era. Universities and
       scientific societies played significant roles in advancing experimental science and philosophy, but they were
       far less accessible to the reading public than coffeehouses and even salons. Women, for example, attended
       salons, but they did not attend universities and generally did not belong to scientific societies. Likewise,
       working-class men, who could sometimes be found frequenting coffeehouses, had no access to universities or
       scientific societies. These institutions also tended to be somewhat conservative in outlook, given their
       religious foundations and traditional emphasis on a theologically based curriculum. Even as the curriculum of
       universities became less based on religion in the eighteenth century, they still largely fell under the wing of
       state and royal authorities rather than being autonomous.

       Unlike modern research universities, those in the early modern era existed to train students--exclusively male
       and economically privileged--for careers in the civil service or to practice one of three professions: medicine,
       law, or theology. The curriculum was generally designed to uphold tradition rather than innovate.
       Nevertheless, being affiliated with prestigious universities like Oxford, Bologna, and Paris carried power and
       prestige that enabled academics to make connections with wealthy patrons in court and aristocratic circles.
       These connections, in turn, could be exploited to finance more innovative research and scholarship in settings
       outside the universities.

       Scientific research thus generally took place in private laboratories with the assistance of a variety of
       academies and scientific societies. Their dependence on the economic support and protection of monarchs
       and princes meant that these institutions maintained ties to the state and lacked the full autonomy of the
       public sphere. One of the first was the Royal Society of London, which first met on November 28, 1660, and was
       formally chartered and recognized by King Charles II shortly thereafter (Figure 7.9). Francis Bacon's
       development of the scientific method was considered the inspiration for the society's founding. His emphasis
       on perfecting experimental techniques became a central focus of its principles and continued to influence
       scientists like Isaac Newton for many years after its founding. Newton was one of the group's most celebrated
       members. The machine-like view of the universe he developed, and the laws of planetary motion and gravity
       upholding it, were in turn a source of inspiration to French philosophers like Voltaire, who saw Newton's work
       as evidence of a rational universe.

Like the Royal Society of London, the Academy of Sciences in France operated with the support and protection
of royalty, in this case Louis XIV, who founded it in 1666. Unlike its English counterpart, however, the French
academy was well funded and tightly controlled by its royal patron, who sponsored scientists and their work
with monetary allowances and pensions.
Because of their connections to the court, members of scientific societies and academies were a small elite, but
they also participated in public forums and salons of the Enlightenment and represented the beginning of
scientific professionalization in the eighteenth century. Due to their connections with the salons, some
scientific societies provided opportunities for women to engage in the practice of science. Although they were
barred from university admission and formal membership in royal academies in England and France, some
noble and aristocratic women, such as Maria Winkelmann of Germany and Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of
Newcastle in England, not only served as patrons of science but also actively participated in scientific
research.

       The growing emphasis the Enlightenment placed on natural rights, the autonomy of the wealthy middle class,
       and the cross-cultural encounters of the burgeoning global economy generated many social and political
       transformations in the eighteenth century. In particular, the entrenched privileges of the nobility, the
       traditional dominance of the Catholic Church, and arbitrary royal entitlements were common targets of
       criticism among those who could participate in the public sphere of the era. As fiscal crises developed and
       tensions exploded between European kingdoms and their Atlantic colonies, the rhetoric of the Enlightenment
       fused with a series of popular uprisings and created revolutionary conditions on both sides of the Atlantic. By
       the end of the century, the American, French, and Haitian Revolutions were the results (Figure 7.10).

       FIGURE 7.10 Capturing the Bastille. In this image from about 1790, an unknown painter has depicted a pivotal

to a small group that largely excluded women and the poor. With the exception of the Haitian Revolution, they
did little to improve the conditions experienced by Black and Indigenous peoples.

The American Revolution

As colonial societies warmed to the idea that political power should be based on the consent of the people, a
growing dissatisfaction with the British Crown's arbitrary rules and taxes propelled the colonies in North
America toward revolution. Britain's Proclamation Line of 1763 declared the Appalachian Mountains the
western settlement boundary for the thirteen North American colonies (Figure 7.11). Its goals were to prevent
further conflict with the French and Native Americans there, and to avoid the costs of defending the frontier
when Britain was already struggling with debt from the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). The colonists, some of
whom had already received land grants west of the Appalachians, viewed the edict as equivalent to tyranny
and disregarded it.

FIGURE 7.11 Proclamation Line of 1763. This map depicts the boundary Britain imposed on westward settlement of
its North American colonies in 1763, to save costs and avoid conflict with Native Americans and the French. The
colonists viewed it as yet another instance of the tyranny of the king. (credit: modification of work "Eastern North

       Tensions were further heightened by the imposition of taxes and commercial regulations. In particular, the
       Stamp Act of 1765 taxed legal documents and printed materials as a means of generating revenue for Britain,
       which led to widespread protests. North American colonists had paid taxes imposed by Parliament before, but
       the intent of those taxes had been to repay debts held by the government. Although this was also the original
       purpose of the Stamp Act, to pay debts accrued during the Seven Years' War, the tax remained in place after
       the debt had been paid. This was the first time the colonists were expected to pay a tax intended solely to
       generate an ongoing source of revenue for the British government. Furthermore, colonists were unable to vote
       for members of Parliament and thus had no representatives to consent to this taxation on their behalf.

       The Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 but merely replaced it with a variety of other taxes and duties
       that led to general turmoil in the colonies, especially in Boston. Indeed, in the same year the Stamp Act was
       repealed, Parliament passed the Declaratory Act, which stated that it had absolute authority to impose taxes on
       the colonies and to regulate their affairs. After Parliament took the extreme step of dispatching soldiers to
       Massachusetts to restore order and threatened customary liberties in the process, support in the colonies for a
       complete break with Britain intensified.

       Parliament then granted the British East India Company a monopoly on the importation of tea, which angered
       colonial tea merchants and led to armed conflict, initiating the American Revolution in 1775. As the crisis
       escalated, revolutionary sentiment came to a head when the first and second Continental Congresses,
       assemblies of elected colonial representatives, met in Philadelphia in 1774 and 1775, respectively. The Second
       Continental Congress adopted the powers of government as a form of resistance to British tyranny and in 1776
       approved the Declaration of Independence.

           LINK TO LEARNING

       At Monticello, a virtual exhibit called Paradox of Liberty (https://openstax.org/l/77LibertyPara) explores the
       contradiction of the fight for liberty in the American Revolution taking place at a time when Thomas Jefferson
       and other founders owned enslaved people and supported the institution of slavery.

       The Declaration of Independence was modeled on Enlightenment principles of sovereignty and natural rights,
       particularly the social contract theory of the writer and philosopher John Locke. Although support for
       independence was not universal among the colonists, and a substantial minority remained neutral or actively
       supported the British, twelve of the thirteen colonies ultimately approved the Declaration of Independence, the
       only abstention being New York. In the military conflict that ensued, Britain initially won most of the battles,
       but the Continental Army led by General George Washington eventually prevailed, and the British surrendered
       at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781. Some fighting continued until the fall of 1783, but peace was formally declared
       when representatives of the new United States and King George III of Great Britain signed the Treaty of Paris in
       September that year, officially ending the war.

       Following the war's conclusion, the first written constitution, known as the Articles of Confederation, was
       drafted in 1776-1777 and ratified by the thirteen colonies in 1781. Although they named the new nation the
       United States of America and granted Congress the authority to coin money and make alliances, the Articles of
       Confederation did not enable the federal government to impose taxes or control foreign policy. These
       shortcomings led delegates at the Constitutional Convention to write the Constitution in 1787, which granted
       the federal government powers such as the authority to tax and to regulate interstate commerce. When the
       Constitution was officially adopted in 1789, it replaced the Articles of Confederation and significantly
       strengthened the country's central governmental authority.

       In theory, the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution reflected the democratic ideals of the
       Enlightenment, but in practice, the colonists' achievements were inherently contradictory, since many of the
       founders were slaveholders. Political liberty coexisted with the institution of slavery, and full constitutional

rights and freedoms extended only to White men of property, a minority of the population, and not to women,
African Americans, Native Americans, or many immigrants. Although women had participated in the war by
leading charitable organizations and refusing to buy goods on which the British imposed taxes, they were
excluded from political rights in the new republic. The institution of slavery, moreover, gained protection from
the Constitution when members of the Constitutional Convention adopted the Three-Fifths Clause, which
counted three-fifths of the enslaved population in the calculations on which the taxation and political
representation of slaveholding states were based. By effectively implying that enslaved people were less than
fully human and denying them voting rights, this clause enshrined racial prejudice in the Constitution's
foundations. Though the Three-Fifths Clause was eventually repealed in 1868, the political
disenfranchisement of Black citizens persisted until the civil rights era and beyond.

The American Revolutionary War was also an unmitigated catastrophe for Native Americans. Based on the fear
that a colonial victory would devastate their lands and betray their interests, Native American leaders such as
Mohawk chief Thayendanegea had formed alliances with the British and provided them with strategic military
support. Revolutionary armies then destroyed Native American towns and crops in western New York and
Pennsylvania. At the war's conclusion, Native American representatives were excluded from all negotiations,
which ultimately resulted in significant loss of their lands and autonomy.

It may be tempting to see the American Revolution as a full-fledged victory for Enlightenment ideals of popular
sovereignty and natural rights, but the actual application of these principles was spotty at best. Traditional
narratives typically cite the love of liberty as its guiding principle and celebrate its democratic achievements,
but its causes were far more complex. British efforts to consolidate control over the colonies in the years
leading up to the war incited resistance from colonists seeking to maintain their autonomy, but the war's roots
lay in a variety of economic, political, and ideological disputes. Colonial elites sought the same rights as their
counterparts in Britain, and their demands to levy taxes themselves and their resistance to the Crown heavily
influenced the initial desire for independence. Merchants, however, primarily sought economic freedoms that
would release them from British trade restrictions and taxes. Still others resisted British attempts to curb
westward expansion and appropriate Native American lands. Ultimately, these diverse motives converged with
growing popular protest and incited rebellions and violence, eventually leading to revolution.

The French Revolution

Inspired by the success of their North American counterparts, critics of absolute monarchical power and
entrenched aristocratic privilege in France began agitating for change. They found themselves in the midst of a
significant economic crisis brought on by a combination of the king's extravagant spending and (ironically)
France's support of the American Revolutionary War.

Like the battle for independence in the North American colonies, the revolutionary movement in France
reflected a complex web of causes and consequences. After a series of poor harvests and the near-bankruptcy
of the French Crown left many peasants and urban poor on the brink of starvation in the 1770s, resentment of
the regime's inability to provide relief led to extensive unrest and rioting. The Crown's subsequent attempt to
institute a land tax on aristocrats, who had previously been exempt from such assessments, resulted in broad
resistance from social elites reluctant to surrender their traditional privileges. Meanwhile, the growing middle
class, resentful of its exclusion from political power, agitated for change inspired by the Enlightenment
rhetoric of rights and liberties. Demands for the reform of an antiquated system of government and social
hierarchy reached a point of no return in the mid-1780s.

Whereas the American Revolutionary War resulted in the birth of an independent new nation, the French
Revolution radically restructured long-standing political systems and reshaped the balance of power in
Europe. Although the revolt's radical rejection of authoritarian rule, which enforced obedience to government
authority and limited individual freedom, ultimately faltered, the social and political reforms it inspired
heavily influenced the character of modern nations.
266 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       At the core of revolutionary fervor in France was the traditional division of French society into three
       estates--clergy, aristocracy, and commoners--that reinforced the wealth and political power of the aristocracy
       and the church. In this system, which had emerged in the Middle Ages, the First Estate consisted of the
       Catholic clergy, who made up less than 1 percent of the population but held roughly 10 percent of French
       lands. Virtually exempt from taxes, the church derived substantial wealth from tithes (taxes of one-tenth of
       annual income) and fees imposed on the general population. The nobility, who were the Second Estate,
       represented roughly 3-4 percent of the population but held upward of 30 percent of the country's lands. They
       also dominated the most prestigious administrative, military, and judicial positions in the royal bureaucracy
       by virtue of their aristocratic status and were exempt from taxes as well. The burden of paying taxes fell largely
       on the shoulders of the Third Estate, the remaining 95 percent of the French population consisting of peasants,
       the urban poor, the wealthy bourgeoisie or urban middle class who made a living largely through commerce
       and the professions, and everyone else who did not fall within the other two estates (Figure 7.12).

       Although persistent wealth inequality became a significant sore point for the French masses, particularly in
       the midst of a national economic crisis, exclusion from political power was another issue leading up to the

revolution. The Enlightenment's emphasis on public opinion, natural rights, and freedom from tyranny also
resonated with many educated commoners and aristocrats, who believed that political and economic reforms
were desperately needed in France. However, the Estates General, a general assembly made up of
representatives of the nobles, clergy, and commoners that was France's closest approximation to a
constitutional body, had not been convened by a French monarch since 1614. Equally problematic was the
voting structure of this body, which gave each estate one vote. Since the clergy and nobility generally shared
common interests, their votes typically defeated any initiatives the Third Estate might propose.

In 1789, in an act of desperation, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates General to propose a radical reform of
the economy and the creation of new taxes. But the Third Estate refused to participate until the king reformed
the voting system. After a period of stalemate, the Third Estate gained the support of many members of the
clergy and met separately as a National Assembly. This act of political rebellion reinforced the sovereignty of
the people, to which the king responded by amassing military forces with the goal of subduing the people by
force. His plan backfired, however, when a series of popular uprisings in Paris and throughout the country
resulted in the commoners' seizure of sites associated with royal authority, such as the Bastille, a fortress in
Paris, land redistribution, and refusal to pay taxes.

In a position of strength, the National Assembly then issued the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
Citizen, which upheld natural rights such as liberty and property, like the U.S. Declaration of Independence,
but also mandated the adoption of representative government, equality before the law, and freedom of
expression. As a means of reducing monarchical power and enforcing the mandates of the Declaration, the
National Assembly created a new constitution in 1791 and charged a newly formed Legislative Assembly with
governing France as a constitutional monarchy and developing legislative reform.

Despite its progressive reforms, the Declaration faced opposition from critics such as French playwright
Olympe de Gouges for failing to address women's rights. In 1791, Gouges published her Declaration of the
Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, which emphasized women's equality with men and asserted that
women should experience the same rights of citizenship as their male counterparts.

Meanwhile, France's economic situation continued to worsen, and a group of women struggling to feed their
families organized a crowd of thousands to confront the king and demand action. Also instrumental in
building revolutionary momentum against the king and the nation's profound wealth inequality were the sans-
culottes, radicals from the lower and working classes who could not afford the culottes, or fashionable short
pants, that were worn by the aristocracy and indicated one did not have to perform manual labor for a living
(sans is French for "without"). After the angry mob captured the royal family, the king lost all remaining
popular support when he and his wife, Queen Marie-Antoinette, attempted to escape.

The newly formed Legislative Assembly suspended the king and created a representative body known as the
National Convention, which convicted Louis of treason. The National Convention was composed of a number of
different groups of revolutionaries with conflicting opinions regarding what the government of France and
French society should be like. A variety of political clubs and organizations expressed a range of ideas about
the goals of the revolution and the best course of action to achieve them. Founded in 1789, the Jacobins
quickly became the most influential of these clubs. The Jacobins sought to end the reign of King Louis XVI and
establish a republic to replace the French monarchy. However, disagreements between their radical and
moderate factions made consensus difficult to achieve. Whereas the Girondins, a moderate faction of the
Jacobins, some of whom hailed from the Gironde region of southwestern France, opposed executing the king,
the radical Jacobin faction the Mountain, so named because its members sat on the highest benches of the
National Convention, supported sentencing him to death. After the Convention held a trial for the king, the
Mountain ultimately prevailed, and the king was executed in January 1793.

After declaring those who opposed the king's execution enemies of the revolution, in 1793 the Mountain and
their supporters initiated a period of violent repression known as the Reign of Terror. Maximilien de
Robespierre, a lawyer who championed the principles of equality, led the provisional government of France,
268 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       known as the Committee of Public Safety, from 1793 to 1794. Under the battle cry liberté, égalité, fraternité
       (liberty, equality, brotherhood), this radical phase of the revolution achieved many progressive reforms,
       including controlling the price of grain, legalizing divorce, and abolishing slavery. Despite such achievements,
       however, it was also inherently contradictory, since tens of thousands of people were arbitrarily imprisoned or
       executed as a means of silencing dissent.

       Disagreements between the Committee of Public Safety and the Convention over religious and economic
       policies hastened the end of the Reign of Terror as support for Robespierre's repressive policies dwindled. By
       1794, members of the opposition had removed Robespierre from power, and the Terror finally came to an end
       in July 1794 when its leaders, including Robespierre, were executed on the guillotine. The Convention then
       dismantled the executive powers of the Committee of Public Safety and sought to restore political stability by
       creating a constitution in 1795 that established a new executive council of five men known as the Directory.
       Despite the new government's efforts to prevent rebellions and dissent, it faced a variety of challenges from
       radical Jacobins who wanted to restore the Terror's revolutionary fervor and from conservative factions that
       sought to restore the monarchy. Growing conflict between moderates and radicals, sharpened by a period of
       famine and economic difficulty, ultimately led the Directory to invite Napoléon Bonaparte, a charismatic and
       ruthless general in the French army, to help them develop a more authoritative government in 1799 and quiet
       the voices of opposition.

       A pervasive symbol of the French Revolution, the guillotine was designed to mechanize executions and render

       Following the Terror's failure, the revolution took a more conservative turn, and the idealism of the French
       Revolution came to an end. The modern democratic tradition emerging in France then transformed into
       popular authoritarianism when Napoléon seized control. Although he safeguarded some revolutionary gains,
       Napoléon also reinstated slavery in France's colonies and declared himself emperor in 1804. At the height of
       his power, he ruled over a massive empire.

       Following a series of failed military campaigns stemming from his desire to dominate Europe, however,
       including a disastrous attempted invasion of Russia, Napoléon abdicated his throne in 1814. He then returned
       and led France again until his defeat by the British and Prussians at Waterloo (Belgium) in 1815. After this loss,
       Napoléon was ultimately banished from France and forced to spend the rest of his days in exile.

       The French Revolution now appeared to come full circle with the restoration of the French monarchy in
       1814-1815. However, Louis XVIII, the restored French king, could not rule as an absolute monarch and had to
       recognize his subjects' new constitutional rights to participate in government and regulate the king's power.
       Notwithstanding Napoléon's brief autocratic reign, the French Revolution successfully dismantled the
       nobility's and clergy's disproportionate share of power and defeated the strongest absolute monarchy in
       Europe.

       The French revolutionaries failed to fully establish the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity that had
       long inspired the movement. They sought to replace royal and aristocratic privilege with sweeping reforms
       rooted in ideals of natural rights and protection from tyrannical government. Yet in practice, and regardless of
       the instrumental roles they played in the revolution, women in France did not receive many of the rights
       extended to their male counterparts. In fact, France was the last of the major Western powers to extend voting
       rights to women, in 1944.

       Perhaps even more paradoxical was the contradiction between Enlightenment ideals of liberty that fueled the

revolution on one hand and France's ongoing colonialism, exploitation of slave labor, and discrimination
against free people of color on the other. Except for a brief period during the Reign of Terror, France continued
to uphold the institution of slavery in its colonies. In particular, in the colony of Saint-Domingue, now known as
Haiti, few if any rights were extended to enslaved or free people of color in the wake of the French Revolution.
Ultimately, then, the legacy of revolution in France was mixed.

The Haitian Revolution

Like the leaders of revolution in the North American colonies and France, the leaders of Haiti's Revolution
sought to reject tyranny and dismantle long-standing inequities. Unlike the British colonists, however, the
Haitian revolutionaries made addressing racial discrimination and injustice their primary aim. The Haitian
Revolution was the first uprising of enslaved people in history that not only toppled a colonial regime but also
established national independence (Figure 7.13). Independence came at a tremendous cost, however, since
France forced the new republic to pay steep indemnities to compensate French citizens for their property
losses for many years, impoverishing the new nation. Nevertheless, the revolution represented one of the most
significant challenges to colonialism raised in the Western Hemisphere.

As France's wealthiest colony, Saint-Domingue on the island of Hispaniola yielded roughly 40 percent of the
sugar and nearly half the coffee imported to Europe in the eighteenth century. Producing these labor-intensive
commodities depended on maintaining a ruthless regime that enslaved the majority of the colony's
population. At the beginning of the Haitian Revolution, roughly 500,000 enslaved people lived in Saint-
Domingue, mostly of sub-Saharan African descent. A population of about forty thousand Whites was a mix of
wealthy planters, middle-class professionals, and poor laborers. A third group of about thirty thousand were
270 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       gens de couleur libres (a French term meaning free people of color), many of mixed-race heritage and some
       holding enslaved people themselves. Given sharp social divisions and the exploitation of the colony's enslaved
       people, Saint-Domingue was poised for turmoil.

       After news of the revolution in France reached the colony, its White planters and gens de couleur libres sent
       delegates to Paris in 1789 in hopes of securing greater economic and political freedoms from the French.
       Largely driven by self-interest, each group interpreted the principles and goals of the revolution differently.
       Whereas wealthy White planters sought political autonomy and greater freedom from trade restrictions, poor
       Whites were primarily interested in securing equal citizenship for themselves. Neither wealthy nor poor
       Whites were concerned with gaining equal political or legal rights for people of color. The gens de couleur
       libres, on the other hand, interpreted the revolutionary rhetoric of liberty to mean the extension of equal rights
       to all free people regardless of race. Given that some of them owned enslaved people, however, they did not call
       for an end to slavery. The incompatible goals of each group intensified hostilities among the free sectors of
       Saint-Domingue's population. The conflict between Whites and gens de couleur libres exploded in 1791, after
       Haiti's White population refused to acknowledge the citizenship rights that France had extended to wealthy
       people of color. The resulting turmoil and instability provided the perfect opportunity for rebellion, which
       expanded into a full-fledged revolution.

       Although it may seem at first that the French Revolution and Enlightenment ideals provided the motivation for
       revolution in Haiti, much of the inspiration actually came from rumors that France had outlawed slavery, the
       existence of enslaved leaders poised to rebel against White plantation owners, and the influence of beliefs
       based on Vodou (Voodoo), a mix of Roman Catholic and indigenous West African religious practices. In August
       1791, a group of enslaved people planning a rebellion met in a heavily wooded area known as Bois Caïman to
       formalize their pact in a Vodou ritual overseen by Dutty Boukman, a Vodou priest from Jamaica. It is difficult to
       know the precise nature of the ceremony. Because France had outlawed the practice of Vodou in its colonies,
       such gatherings were generally shrouded in secrecy. Nevertheless, it is clear that Vodou was a vital spiritual
       tradition for enslaved Africans, and one of the few areas in which they could achieve a sense of psychological
       independence. Due to its widespread appeal among Saint-Domingue's enslaved population, Vodou thus united
       different rebel groups and played a significant role in propelling the revolution.

       Within a few days of the Bois Caïman meeting, some gens de couleur libres joined forces with rebelling
       enslaved people in an uprising against White colonists. After initiating the rebellion in the north of Saint-
       Domingue and destroying numerous plantations, they continued to escalate the movement. By September
       1791, revolt had spread to Port-au-Prince, the colony's capital.

       Other countries soon became involved in the rebellion in Haiti. In 1792, France, in an effort to stop the
       uprising in Haiti, sent troops to the island and extended the rights of citizenship to all free men of color in
       order to end their support for the rebellious enslaved people. By 1793, France found itself at war with most of
       the nations of Europe, including Britain and Spain. European rulers did not wish the French revolutionary
       sentiment that had led to the overthrow of Louis XVI to spread to their states, and France went to war to ensure
       that hostile monarchs did not bring an end to the revolution. In 1793, Britain and Spain landed troops in Haiti,
       where they supported the White colonists in their attempt to put down the slave rebellion. Both Spain and
       Britain hoped to weaken France by depriving it of revenues from the sale of Haitian sugar and to prevent the
       slave rebellion from spreading to their own Caribbean colonies. Military intervention did not end the rebellion,
       however. France officially abolished slavery in 1794, during the most radical phase of the revolution, and
       colonial officials in Saint-Domingue issued an emancipation decree.

       With François-Dominique Toussaint Louverture, a military leader and formerly enslaved man, at the helm,
       many reforms were brought to the island of Hispaniola, which included Saint-Domingue and the Dominican
       Republic (Figure 7.14). Louverture freed the enslaved people in both colonies in 1801. He then promoted a
       constitution for the new nation of Haiti, which he nevertheless maintained was still part of the French Empire.
       The constitution was based on principles of natural rights and social contract theory similar to those that had

guided the French and American Revolutions, but it also made Louverture governor-general of Haiti for life,
gave him extensive powers, and allowed him to select his successor in office. Louverture also forced the
formerly enslaved Haitian peasants to work in the sugarcane fields. Despite Louverture's forced labor policy,
Haiti, unlike the United States or France, directly addressed the issue of racial inequality, granted rights to all
citizens regardless of race or social class, and extended citizenship to all Black, Indigenous, and mixed-raced
people who had resided in the nation for at least one year. However, although political rights were extended to
all male citizens, Haitian women had to wait until the twentieth century before receiving the right to vote, as
did women in France and the United States.

As the leader of the Haitian Revolution, Louverture was a target of French antagonism. Despite a brief
cessation of hostilities, he was arrested in 1802 when Napoléon attempted to reclaim control of Saint-
Domingue. After being deported to France, Louverture spent the brief remainder of his life in a French prison,
writing his memoirs to defend himself against charges of treason.

        Toussaint Louverture

         After Toussaint Louverture, leader of the Haitian Revolution, was arrested by French troops and subsequently
         imprisoned in France in 1802, he began writing his memoirs to defend himself against accusations of treason. In
         the excerpt that follows, he details his commitment to the Haitian people, his vision for Haiti, and the integrity
         with which he led the fledgling country to independence.

               If I did oblige my fellow-countrymen to work; it was to teach them the value of true liberty without
               license; it was to prevent corruption of morals; it was for the general happiness of the island, for the
               interest of the Republic. And I had effectually succeeded in my undertaking, since there could not be
               found in all the colony a single man unemployed, and the number of beggars had diminished to such a
               degree that, apart from a few in the towns, not a single one was to be found in the country . . .

               It was my influence upon the people which was feared, and that these violent means were employed to
               destroy it. This caused me new reflections. Considering all the misfortunes which the colony had already
               suffered, the dwellings destroyed, assassinations committed, the violence exercised even upon women,
               I forgot all the wrongs which had been done me, to think only of the happiness of the island and the
               interest of the Government. . . . means have been employed against me which are only used against the
               greatest criminals. Doubtless, I owe this treatment to my color; but my color,--my color,--has it hindered
               me from serving my country with zeal and fidelity? Does the color of my skin impair my honor and my
               bravery?

               Since I entered the service of the Republic, I have not claimed a penny of my salary . . . no one has been
               more prudent, more disinterested than I. I have only now and then received the extra pay allowed me;
               very often I have not asked even this. . . . I will sum up, in a few words, my conduct and the results of my
               administration. . . . I did not serve my country from interested motives; but, on the contrary, I served it
               with honor, fidelity, and integrity, sustained by the hope of receiving, at some future day, flattering
               acknowledgments from the Government; all who know me will do me this justice.

       Although Napoléon attempted to reinstate slavery and reclaim French control of Saint-Domingue in 1802, his
       army was overpowered by the rebel army and Louverture's successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Dessalines and
       his victorious forces thereafter renamed their country Haiti, a term meaning mountainous that derived from
       the Taíno language of the precolonial people. After Dessalines declared Haiti's sovereign independence on
       January 1, 1804, White plantation owners either fled or were killed, and lands were redistributed among
       Haiti's former enslaved and free Black people. Despite the promise of Haiti's fledgling nationhood, however, in

1825, France imposed an exorbitant independence debt that devastated the new country's economy for many
years thereafter. Principles of social equality, moreover, remained incomplete when former gens de couleur
libres adopted the roles of the former plantation owners at the top of the social hierarchy. Thus, the Haitian
Revolution did not bring lasting equality for all, but it did remove racial inequalities even though the gens de
couleur libres brought an element of race into their views.

Despite economic instability and the complexities of race relations in Haiti after the revolution, its
independence stood as a remarkable challenge to colonialism and the institution of slavery. Haiti also
successfully resolved the incompatibility between revolutionary principles of liberty and the practice of
slavery. The success of its revolution gave hope to other slave societies and sent shockwaves through
slaveholding societies across the Atlantic. Ultimately, fear generated by the Haitian Revolution led to a
conservative backlash among elites and a temporary expansion of slavery in neighboring countries such as
Cuba. The United States did not officially recognize Haiti as an independent nation until 1862. However, the
long-term legacy of Haitian independence later inspired slave revolts elsewhere in the Atlantic, such as the
German Coast Uprising in Louisiana in 1811, and ultimately posed a significant challenge to the European
colonial order.

7.4 Nationalism, Liberalism, Conservatism, and the Political Order

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain the causes, main ideologies, and values of nationalism, liberalism, and conservativism
  · Discuss the unification of Germany and Italy in terms of nationalism
  · Describe the impact of the Congress of Vienna and the career of Metternich on the balance of power
      in Europe

In the early nineteenth century, the upheaval of revolution gave way to political philosophies and ideologies
intended to restore order and prevent the types of violent clashes that had defined much of the previous
century. As belief in popular sovereignty and principles of liberty and equality spread, particularly in Europe
and North America, emerging nations came to hold different ideas about the best way to safeguard these
revolutionary gains. In particular, nationalism, liberalism, and conservatism became entrenched forces that,
while unique, all temporarily subdued the unrest of the revolutionary period. In a radically transformed
political landscape, however, revolts and revolutions eventually emerged that challenged the last remnants of
the prerevolutionary status quo.

Nationalism

The turbulence of the revolutionary era started to wane, and a sense of shared goals and values grew to shape
people's perceptions of national identity. As a consequence of the French Revolution and the revolutionaries'
subsequent wars against neighboring monarchies they saw as hostile to their new republic, the novel idea of a
nation began to provide a sense of belonging and community. It replaced the older ideas of dynasty and city-
state and became the primary focus of individuals' political allegiance. By using fear of foreign attacks as a
means to gather support for the government and raise an army that represented the interests of the people
rather than the monarch, French revolutionaries had inspired loyalty to the state, which also represented the
people. In some cases, Great Britain, for example, the nation coexisted with a traditional monarchy. In others,
like Haiti, France, and the United States, the old order was completely replaced, and a brand-new political
system and cultural landscape emerged in its stead.

A radical political ideology that promotes the interests of the nation over international concerns, nationalism
advocates the uniqueness and inherent superiority of an individual's own country and the right to self-
determination and political autonomy. While this ideology can foster domestic stability by generating unity
and loyalty from within, it can also generate hostility toward outsiders and marginalize minority communities.
Although nationalism was a powerful force in Europe throughout the nineteenth century, it was by no means
274 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       limited to the continent and came to play a powerful role in the modern development of countries such as
       Egypt and Japan.

       As fledgling nations began to materialize in the nineteenth century, many used language, ethnicity, religion, a
       sense of shared origin, or some combination of these as a foundation of national identity. Often, a group of
       people who share a national identity based on ethnicity, language, or religion also live in the same state, a
       political unit that occupies a given territory with defined borders and imposes laws on its residents, and
       govern themselves. This was the goal for which nationalists strive.

       At times, though, people who share a national identity (or "nationality") may be scattered across a variety of
       different states. For example, in Europe in the nineteenth century, people who were ethnically German and
       spoke the German language lived in many different kingdoms, principalities, and other political units. In such
       a case, nationalists seek to unify all those with the same national identity in the same state, so that all live
       under the same government, which members of that nationality control, within the same territorial borders.

       At other times, people who share a national identity may live in a state governed by people of a different
       nationality. Jews, for example, share a Jewish identity but, except for those who live in Israel (a state that was
       founded only in 1948), Jews live in states dominated by people of other nationalities. In such cases,
       nationalists may advocate that a separate state be formed by members of the minority nationality, so that they
       may live and govern themselves without the interference of other, sometimes hostile, groups. In the nineteenth
       century, a Jewish movement called Zionism formed to advocate for the establishment of a separate state for
       Jews.

       By the end of the nineteenth century, Italy and Germany were among the nations that most fully embraced
       these means of reinforcing their political sovereignty and bolstering resistance to the threat of tyranny.
       Narratives of national dominance and righteousness were perpetuated in schools, the military, and the
       bureaucracy. This sense of shared identity and heritage laid the groundwork for the nationalism that
       ultimately led to the unification of Italy and of Germany over the course of the nineteenth century.

       In the first half of the nineteenth century, Italy was a loose coalition of states under the control of the Austrian
       Empire and the Catholic Church. Although the states all had different cultural traditions, political systems, and
       dialects, the growing influence of nationalism and a desire for greater freedom and relief from authoritarian
       rule led to many uprisings and rebellions against traditional monarchies and foreign powers across the Italian
       peninsula. The ideals of equality and patriotism that spread across Europe in the nineteenth century fostered
       a growing sense of common goals and collective aspirations in the Italian states.

       After founding an organization known as Young Italy in 1831, Giuseppe Mazzini began promoting a sense of
       shared Italian identity and encouraged his supporters to dedicate their lives to their nation. Mazzini hoped a
       new republic would be the means of throwing off the tyranny of foreign monarchs and the authority of the
       pope. Nationalist ideology was considered so radical at the time, however, that he was eventually arrested and
       exiled for political subversion.

       After Mazzini's arrest, the soldier and patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi continued to build momentum for a unified
       Italian state. However, after participating in a failed insurrection in Piedmont, he fled the country. Garibaldi's
       military experience and training in guerrilla warfare during his self-imposed exile in Latin America enabled
       him to lead his troops to victory in revolutionary campaigns in 1848-1849. Initiated by these Italian
       nationalists who sought to eliminate Austrian control, the unification cause received powerful support from
       King Victor Emmanuel II of Piedmont-Sardinia and his prime minister Count Camillo di Cavour. Revolutionary
       struggles culminated in Garibaldi's declaring Victor Emmanuel II king of the unified kingdom of Italy in 1861.
       The unification, also known as the Risorgimento, thus occurred under a monarchical system of government. It
       was completed when Rome was annexed in 1870 (Figure 7.15).

Through the art of the Risorgimento (https://openstax.org/l/77Risorgimento) at Fondazione Cariplo, a rich
record of Italian unification is seen through the eyes of the era's artists. Detailed images and rich commentary
are presented that draw connections between shifting political contexts and genres of painting in nineteenth-
century Italy.
In predominantly German-speaking lands, an alliance of thirty-nine sovereign states known as the Germanic
Confederation emerged as a replacement for the former Holy Roman Empire in 1815. Because each of the
member states retained political autonomy, the Germanic Confederation lacked executive power or
centralized authority. The main goal of the Confederation, however, was not to replace the governmental
powers of its member states but rather to create a unified defense against France and Russia. Although it
eventually succumbed to the Austrian Empire in 1866, the Confederation laid the groundwork for the
nationalism that inspired German unification in 1871 and the creation of the modern nation-state of Germany.
As Germany moved toward political unification in the middle of the nineteenth century, it sought to remove
foreign political influence and solidify the cultural and linguistic unity that expanded the momentum of the
276 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       Germanic Confederation. In 1848, the Frankfurt Assembly, the first freely elected German parliament,
       attempted to draft a constitution to unite Germany as an empire headed by a centralized emperor. The attempt
       failed, however, when it was rejected by the aristocracy, the military, and King Frederick William IV of Prussia,
       who refused to accept that a monarch's divine authority could be granted by an elected assembly. After the
       failure of the Frankfurt Assembly, momentum for German unification resumed with the mounting success of
       the Zollverein, a customs union formed by Prussia in 1834. By 1854, nearly all German states had joined the
       union, which continued to build the wealth and prosperity of its member states. However, the pace of
       unification stalled when the new king, William I of Prussia, sought to double the size of his army, and middle-
       class liberals opposed compulsory military service. Frustrated by this stalemate, William appointed a highly
       conservative prime minister, Count Otto von Bismarck, in 1862.
       Whereas Mazzini's initial movement in Italy had emphasized national unity as a means of promoting popular
       sovereignty, Bismarck's ambitions focused primarily on fortifying the strength and interests of Protestant
       Prussia. Despite opposition from middle-class liberals and Parliament, Bismarck prioritized military spending
       and focused on building a powerful state. After initiating a series of decisive wars with Austria, Denmark, and
       France to expand German power, he excluded Catholic Austria from German affairs and acquired the duchies
       of Schleswig and Holstein from Denmark, as well as the German-speaking territories of Alsace and Lorraine
       from France. This series of victories reinvigorated the cause of unification through the triumph of militarism
       and authoritarianism. Bismarck's efforts culminated in the formation of a unified Germany, and on January
       18, 1871, he was appointed Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire (Figure 7.16).

       As the ideology of nationalism continued to gain momentum in the nineteenth century, patriotism also
       garnered increased support across the European continent. Although the two share some commonalities, they
       represent differing ideological perspectives. Rooted in ancient Greek and Roman conceptions of loyalty to a
       city or community, patriotism implies a sense of civic spirit. In the Enlightenment, especially in the work of the
       philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, it eventually evolved into the idea of love for the nation. Unlike
       nationalism, patriotism does not entail asserting the superiority of one nation over others.

      Liberalism

       Like nationalism, the political philosophy of liberalism is rooted in Enlightenment principles and born of the

revolutionary struggles of the eighteenth century. Its underlying goal is freedom from restraint, more
specifically freedom of expression, popular sovereignty, representative government, and the protection of
private property and civil rights. The liberalism of the nineteenth century is different from the liberalism of the
late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however. The meaning of the term has changed over time, and,
although people who are regarded as liberals in the twenty-first century United States generally advocate for
government assistance for the poor and government intervention to ensure equality, nineteenth-century
liberals opposed government intervention. Liberalism and nationalism are not mutually exclusive; nationalist
leaders like Mazzini, for instance, also adopted many liberal principles. Nevertheless, a distinction between
political and economic liberalism evolved from the work of Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke and Adam
Smith.

Based on Locke's emphasis on the consent of the governed and the natural rights of life, liberty, and property,
political liberalism promotes limited government and the right to oppose any political authority that does not
carry the consent of the people. These goals can be ensured by imposing limits on government authority and
guaranteeing rights to all citizens in a written constitution. Religious toleration and the separation of church
and state also became fundamental principles of liberalism in the eighteenth century. All played a significant
role in shaping revolutionary movements in Britain's North American colonies, Haiti, and France, all of which
issued written constitutions asserting the sovereignty of the people. Enlightenment ideas of natural
rights--tested through a series of revolutions--developed into a lasting commitment to consent of the governed
and equality before the law in the liberal political philosophies of the nineteenth century.

One of the most celebrated proponents of liberalism in the nineteenth century was the English philosopher
John Stuart Mill, who argued for the protection of individual rights from censorship and tyranny. On Liberty,
his classic treatise published in 1859, emphasized the importance of toleration and stressed that multiple
ethical codes could coexist peacefully in a given society. Mill asserted that people should be free to make
ethical choices governing their own lives without government intrusion or obstruction. As an advocate of
equality, moreover, he was an important supporter of women's rights, and his essay On the Subjection of
Women played an influential role in the nineteenth-century women's rights movement.

Whereas Mill and Locke focused liberalism on principles of natural rights and equality, economic liberalism
derived from the Enlightenment theories of Scottish economist Adam Smith. Smith, whose theories shaped the
burgeoning capitalism of the era, argued for the principle of laissez-faire, the idea that economic affairs should
be free of government interference. In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, written in 1759, he asserted that self-
interested participation in a free market would be regulated by unseen forces--an "invisible hand"--that any
sort of government interference would only disrupt. If individuals were permitted to seek financial success
free of government restraint, according to Smith, everyone else would benefit from the greater prosperity that
would ensue. Although Smith's laissez-faire theory focused primarily on economic concerns, like Mill and
Locke, he was a proponent of freedom from government restraint and protection of natural rights as
underlying principles of successful government.

Conservatism

While liberalism and nationalism represented the continuation of Enlightenment ideals of natural rights and
liberty, the rise of conservatism was a reaction against the ideological changes and increased freedoms
associated with the revolutions of the eighteenth century. Realizing they could not return to the
prerevolutionary era, proponents of conservatism instead sought to suppress the forces of nationalism and
liberalism as a means of reining in newfound principles of democracy and republicanism. Based on the belief
that sudden change in the form of revolution was illegitimate, conservatism advocated submitting to
government authority and allowing religious doctrine to play a central role in maintaining social order and
stability. Conservative theorists like Edmund Burke, moreover, asserted that individual rights were secondary
to the rights of the community, and that the only acceptable way to generate political change was slowly and
gradually rather than through revolution.
278 7 · Revolutions in Europe and North America

       The central goal of conservative leaders in early nineteenth-century Europe, like the Austrian foreign minister
       Klemens von Metternich, was to prevent future revolutions and maintain a favorable balance of power, an
       equilibrium that prevents one nation from dominating others. In response to the Napoleonic Wars, during
       which Napoléon sought to create a Grand Empire that expanded French power over much of the European
       continent at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Metternich and his allies sought to contain France and
       restore order by establishing conservative political regimes.
       In the wake of Napoléon's defeat, Metternich and diplomats from Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain agreed to
       form a united front to maintain European peace and stability. To solidify their peace agreement, members of
       this Quadruple Alliance met at the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815. Although it was in theory a collective
       effort, Metternich dominated the proceedings. He asserted that the only way to maintain stability in Europe
       was to restore the legitimacy of overthrown monarchs, who would reinforce traditional beliefs and institutions.
       By exercising a firm hand, moreover, monarchs would demand loyalty from their subjects and reverse the
       democratic principles of the social contract and individual liberty.
       The powers at Vienna also hoped that restoring monarchy would maintain Europe's political equilibrium and
       balance of power (Figure 7.17). To ensure that no single country could conquer others, they agreed to divide
       military and political power more equitably among themselves. For example, Russia, Prussia, and Austria all
       had claims to Polish territory. To ensure an equitable distribution of power, Prussia and Austria were
       permitted to keep some of their Polish lands, but others, such as the Duchy of Warsaw, were ceded to Russian
       control. Austria and Prussia were then compensated for the loss of their Polish lands with control of additional
       territories in the German and Italian states. France, moreover, was required to return lands it had acquired
       under Napoléon before the restoration of the French monarchy in 1814.

       Although Vienna's peace settlement of 1815 was intended to restrain the liberalism and nationalism of the
       revolutionary era, conservative leaders like Metternich underestimated the extent of popular support for these
       ideologies, which had become irreversible in places like the United States and France. Greek supporters of
       national sovereignty, for example, were guided by revolutionary principles to seek independence from the

favor among those who supported the leadership and privilege of hereditary monarchs, organized religion,
and the aristocracy.

 Metternich on Revolution and Radical Change

  In this excerpt from Klemens von Metternich's political creed, taken from a collection of writings published after
  his death, he outlines the dangers of revolutionary upheaval and the influence of those who advocate radical
  change and revolution. As you read, consider the ways in which Metternich's critique demonstrates his allegiance
  to a conservative political philosophy.

        We consider it a fundamental truth that for every evil there is a remedy and that a knowledge of the true
        nature of the one must lead to the discovery of the other. . . . There is hardly anyone who is not subject
        to the influence of passions or constrained by prejudices and there are many whom evil leads astray in
        an even more dangerous way because of its flattering and often brilliant exterior . . . .

        It is principally the middle classes of society who have been infected by this moral gangrene and it is
        only amongst them that are found the true, prime movers of this theory.

        There is no way that it can ever take hold amongst the great mass of the people, who would not be able
        to accept it. This class, the genuine people, has of necessity to devote itself to labour which is too
        continual and too positive to allow it to throw its weight behind a vague cause born of abstract theories
        and ambition. The people know that the best thing for them is to be able to count on tomorrow, for it is
        not until tomorrow that they will be paid for the toil and the cares of the previous day. The laws which
        guarantee a reasonable protection for the prime asset which is the safety of individuals and their
        families and of property are in their essence simple. The people fear change, which harms industry and
        brings in its wake a constant stream of new burdens for them . . .

        Men from the upper classes of society who throw themselves into the tide of revolution are either those
        who disguise their ambition or perverse, lost souls in the widest meaning of these words. This being so,
        their revolutionary career is normally short! They are the first victims of political reform and the role of
        the small number of them who survive is generally that of sycophants despised by their inferiors,
        upstarts to the great offices of state.

Section Summary

7.1 The Enlightenment

The eighteenth century marked the beginning of a new spirit of intellectual exchange in Europe known as the
Enlightenment. Inspired by the Scientific Revolution's spirit of critical thinking, the ideas of the Italian
Renaissance, and the legacy of Muslim, Greek, and Indian scientific foundations, the Enlightenment centered
on the role of reason and generated a newfound optimism in philosophical principles such as liberty, rights,
and the rejection of tyranny. Such ideals inspired many members of the upper and middle classes in western
Europe to question the legitimacy of traditional laws, political systems, and religious teachings.

Although the Enlightenment established important foundations for the defense of human rights, its reach was
limited to a relatively small elite. Despite its emphasis on ideals of freedom and liberty, it coexisted with the
oppressive institutions of slavery and colonialism.

7.2 The Exchange of Ideas in the Public Sphere

Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the public sphere became an increasingly
important component in the spread and development of Enlightenment ideas. As networks of informal
socialization and intellectual exchange, coffeehouses provided a setting in which people from all social
backgrounds who had the luxury of leisure could share ideas and opinions without fear of punishment from
the state or church. Salons likewise served as important centers of philosophical discussion. They also enabled
the small number of women from the upper and middle classes who hosted them to play leadership roles in
the Enlightenment, though guests from less privileged backgrounds were generally excluded. Along with the
emergence of academies, print shops and a flourishing long-distance community of writers, salons and
coffeehouses ensured the development of a public sphere that stimulated the free and open exchange of
Enlightenment ideas.

7.3 Revolutions: America, France, and Haiti

Over the course of the eighteenth century, a series of famines and economic crises deepened wealth inequality
and narrowed access to political power on both sides of the Atlantic. As the growing influence of the public
sphere and Enlightenment ideas of equality and liberty shaped opposition to colonial and monarchical
privilege, the century concluded with a series of revolutionary movements and the adoption of novel
democratic systems.

The American Revolution, which initiated the revolutionary era, launched the foundation of the newly formed
United States of America but established a paradoxical model of political liberty that coexisted with the
institution of slavery. Inspired by the colonists' victory over the British monarchy, those who led the French
Revolution established a political model based on principles of democratic rights and equality, but they faced
significant challenges due to political factionalism and ongoing economic crises. The Haitian Revolution
resulted in the most radical break from the past by toppling the French colonial government, successfully
challenging the institution of slavery, and creating the new nation of Haiti. However, Haiti faced long-term
economic challenges after France imposed an independence debt on the fledgling nation in 1825.

Although these revolutions reflected a variety of political aims and consequences, each radically reshaped the
political landscape of the Atlantic world by challenging traditional models of monarchical privilege and calling
into question long-standing disparities in wealth and access to political power.

7.4 Nationalism, Liberalism, Conservatism, and the Political Order

As the revolutionary fervor of the eighteenth century faded, a desire to restore order and stability permeated
the political and intellectual atmosphere of Europe. In particular, the ideologies of conservatism, nationalism,
282 7 · Assessments

and liberalism represented different approaches to protecting the revolutionary gains of the eighteenth
century and temporarily quieting the turbulence of the revolutionary era. These gains were relatively short-
lived, however, as political upheaval once again irrevocably transformed Europe by the middle of the
nineteenth century. In the case of Italy and Germany, the desire for unification prevailed over the desire for
freedom, resulting in the birth of new states. Although the forces of nationalism and conservatism reversed
some democratic gains rooted in notions of the social contract and individual liberty, liberal principles such as
religious toleration and equality before the law continued to exert a powerful influence on the rise of the
modern nation-state.

INTRODUCTION In the late eighteenth century, new ideas of freedom spread throughout the Americas, raised
by the Declaration of Independence in the former British American colonies in 1776 and by the French
Revolution of 1789. These principles, combined with poor conditions for a majority of people in French,
Spanish, and Portuguese America and a growing distrust of monarchy, soon led to revolutions against colonial
authorities. In the first three decades of the nineteenth century, most European American colonies gained
their independence. While each revolution was unique, all were connected to the broader trend of using
nationalism to oppose unequal power dynamics. During these rebellions, the majestic horse, a vital part of the
history and mythology of power (consider Pegasus and centaurs, for example), was associated with liberators,
who were admiringly depicted on their mounts to convey independence, courage, triumph, and heroism
(Figure 8.1).

The hundred years after 1750 marked a profound restructuring of world power and a host of political and
economic changes in the Atlantic world. The French American, Spanish American, and Portuguese American
colonists encountered different historical circumstances than those met by their neighbors, the former British
colonists who declared their independence in 1776. Nevertheless, they too launched successful bids for
independence. The Revolutionary War (1776-1783), the French Revolution (1789-1799), and the Peninsular
War (1808-1814) were watershed events that reverberated across South America on inspiring waves of
revolutionary upheavals. The diversity of the European American colonial societies meant, however, that
revolution promised different things to different people in this vast region.

Social Hierarchy and Bourbon Reforms in Spanish America

By the end of the eighteenth century, Latin American societies had become rigidly stratified. Status was
dependent on a number of social markers including education, family and professional ties, race, religion, and
wealth. Color was the most obvious and most complicated noneconomic factor that affected social position.
Whiteness was more than a mark of economic superiority. It indicated European ancestry, which in turn
denoted status as a Christian and thus a degree of presumed social and moral superiority. Furthermore,
European males born in the Iberian Peninsula (the peninsula on which Spain and Portugal are located), called
peninsulares in Spanish America and reinóis in Portuguese America, considered themselves superior to
males of European descent born in the Americas, who were called creoles in Spanish America. In the first
centuries of colonization, those born in Europe tended to monopolize the highest positions in church and state
as well as the means of production, whereas most of the landed elite (miners, plantation owners) were creoles.

In the decades leading to the movement toward independence, however, Europeans and their descendants in
the Americas were struggling to maintain their position at the top of the social pyramid. They had to face the
reality that they had imposed an unequal system in which a small group of Europeans and their descendants
held power over a much larger group of American Indians and enslaved Africans, as well as a vast contingent
of mixed-race people or castas consisting of mestizos (literally "mixed" in Spanish and used mainly for people
of White European and Indian descent) and pardos ("brown" in Spanish for someone of part-African descent).
This ethnically mixed population dominated urban areas, often working as shoemakers, tailors, and other
types of artisans; some mestizo and pardo men served in the lower ranks of the colonial militias.

 Eighteenth-Century Casta Paintings

  The three eighteenth-century images shown here are known as casta paintings and reflect the tremendous
  ethnic diversity of Spanish America. This diversity was the result of enslaved Africans and their descendants
  marrying American Indians, and White European men, who faced a shortage of eligible European women,
  marrying both American Indians and Africans. The Spanish colonists attempted to understand and control this
  racially diverse society by creating social categories based on skin color, such as mestizos, pardos, and others.

  Casta paintings were made to depict these various categories (Figure 8.4), and thus they offer us insight into
  historical views of the relationship between a person's skin color and socioeconomic position. As you look at
  these images, consider the ways in which they depict racial intermarriage, mixed-race families, and life in

At the end of the eighteenth century, the Kingdom of Spain, which had been led by the House of Bourbon since
1700, reorganized its American colonies into four large parts. These were New Spain (in existence since 1521),
Peru (in existence since 1542), New Granada (created in 1717 and roughly equivalent to the countries of
Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela today), and Río de la Plata (created in 1776 with territory
corresponding to modern-day Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay) (Figure 8.6). As before, the ruler of
each of these viceroyalty units represented the Spanish king. Now, however, local governments within each of
the viceroyalties were in the hands of governors, or intendants.
292 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

       FIGURE 8.6 Spanish Possessions in the Americas. The map shows the four viceroyalties that made up Spain's
       possessions in the Americas in 1790. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
       These governors were peninsulares who were appointed by and reported directly to the king, in an attempt to
       reduce corruption and enforce centralization. They were assisted by other peninsulares, many recently
       arrived from Spain and far below the creole elite they governed in terms of education, wealth, and culture. This
       centralization of administration under the intendancy system brought with it industrial and economic
       development, and new material prosperity for peninsulares and creole landowners and merchants. However,
       only those born in Spain, the peninsulares, could hold the most important offices in the government. Although
       creoles could become wealthy under the system, wealth did not translate to social status. The sharp division
       between them and the peninsular Spaniards fueled creoles' desire for self-government.
       It was during this Bourbon Era that Enlightenment ideas spread across the Atlantic world, including to the
       Spanish colonies in North and South America. These ideas were rooted in the principle that all people were
       entitled to take part in their government, and they influenced creoles in Latin America to demand the right to
       participate more fully in politics and the economy, which was largely controlled by Spain. The aims were
       revolutionary, but they stopped short of radically changing the social order. The colonial creole elite originally
       petitioned only that authority be extended to White males of Spanish descent. Native populations and African
       and mixed-race populations were excluded. The White male creole elites pointed to the hypocrisy of the
       egalitarian rhetoric of Europeans and questioned the universal ideals linked to the new rights of citizens, but
       they did so with only themselves in mind.
       An important contributing factor in the desire of creoles and other groups for more participation in politics
       and the economy was the increased availability of books and other printed material. Traditionally, the Spanish
       American White elite had been literate and educated, unlike the lower social groups of color, which largely
       relied on oral tradition for transmitting knowledge. By the end of the eighteenth century, however, the
       circulation of books and manuscripts had greatly increased among the huge mixed-race population, even if
       these groups did not share in the other benefits accorded to White people. Still, the "dangerous" notions of the
       Enlightenment were able to spread not only among educated creoles in the colonies but among mixed-race
       people as well. Those ideas, combined with resentment of the peninsulares, were fuel for late eighteenth-
       century rebellions.

Their desire for participation added to the creoles' anger over the creation of the intendancy system. The
Bourbon monarchy had also instituted other reforms to strengthen its American empire and its control over it.
The colonial militia was expanded, and newly created army units were staffed by men born in Spanish
America. This reduced the cost of defending the empire because Spanish troops no longer had to be
transported across the ocean. However, like political offices, the highest military positions were reserved for
peninsulares, another cause of creole discontent.

Along with changing the political and military life in its colonies, in 1767 Spain followed the example of
Portugal and expelled the Jesuit missionaries from its American empire, angering people at both ends of the
social ladder. Not only did the Jesuits have a reputation as the most humane managers of American Indian
forced laborers, but they had also educated many of the creole elite, and many young creole men had joined
the Jesuit order.

Finally, the Bourbons imposed economic reforms, and these were often unpopular as well. The purpose of
colonies was to enrich and strengthen the parent country, so the Spanish monarchs wished to make their
American possessions as profitable as possible by, for example, more efficiently collecting taxes from the
residents and improving "free" trade. Essentially, this meant Spanish manufacturers were free to sell their
goods in the colonies, where they competed with local producers and merchants and often drove them out of
business. At the same time, colonial producers were still not free to sell their goods to either French or British
buyers. A number of monopolies remained in force. For example, the Crown controlled all tobacco production
and sale.

Unlike the political reforms that affected primarily the creoles, the economic changes affected people at all
levels of Spanish American society, who sometimes reacted violently. Two such insurrections, sparked by an
increase in the colonial sales tax, were the massive 1780-1781 Inca rebellion near Cuzco in the Viceroyalty of
Peru, and the 1781 Comunero ("commoner") Revolt in New Granada (Colombia). In both these viceroyalties,
the basis of Spanish economic activity had evolved from the payment of tribute to the enforcement of
systematic forms of labor such as debt servitude. The Great Inca Rebellion was led by José Gabriel
Condorcanqui Noguera, a respected local mixed-race leader. Noguera opposed the forced labor the Spanish
demanded from American Indians, and to move Indigenous people to rebel, he claimed descent from the last
Inca ruler, Túpac Amaru, and called himself Túpac Amaru II (Figure 8.7). Threatened by his mobilization of
some forty thousand people from among the Viceroyalty of Peru's Indian majority, outnumbered creoles joined
the Spanish and brutally crushed the revolt, which had threatened to become a rebellion against White, not
simply Spanish, rule. Túpac Amaru II and tens of thousands of others were killed.

       who invoked the legacy of the Inca Empire to inspire people in Peru to rise up against the Spanish. (credit: "Portrait
       of Túpac Amaru II" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       In addition to resisting colonial taxes, the Comunero Rebellion of 1781 rose up against laws that granted the
       Spanish Crown a monopoly over the production of tobacco and liquor. Calling for the restoration of traditional
       forms of governance, this revolt spread throughout the mountains, and armed protesters descended on
       Bogotá. First, the Spanish authorities there decided to negotiate. They agreed to repeal the taxes and end the
       monopolies as well as give creoles preference over peninsulares in government positions. However, once the
       comuneros dispersed and the viceroy learned of Bogotá's concessions, he ordered the rebellion's leaders to be
       arrested and executed. These two revolts were warning signs of an ever-growing discontented mixed-race
       population, and they were followed by immediate legal responses.
       In 1795, tensions flared between the creole city council of Caracas in the Viceroyalty of New Granada and the
       king of Spain, Carlos IV. The Crown had passed a new ordinance that allowed people of mixed Spanish and
       African ancestry to purchase, at some expense, a royal identification card called a cédula real. This card
       classified the holder as legally "White," giving mixed-race people citizenship and the legal status of creoles and
       allowing them greater participation in public life and increased social mobility, such as pursuing political
       office or formal education.
       Both groups of elites, the Spanish-born peninsulares and the American-born Spanish creoles, reacted
       negatively to the possibility of upward social mobility for those of mixed race. White people saw themselves as
       educated, productive members of society devoted to mining, ranching, and plantation activities. They
       regarded mixed-race people as inferior and ignorant, lost in idleness, unable to prosper, and dishonorable in
       every way. The city council of Caracas argued that granting upward mobility to mixed-race people would lead
       to the destruction of society as they knew it.
       Peninsulares and creoles worried that mixed-race people were going to take what were then perceived as the
       "good" jobs away from the upper classes. Many were so wary of mixed-race groups that they avoided working

in jobs or occupations associated with them. They also feared the growing military influence and power of
mixed-race people after the insurrections in the 1780s, which had paved the way for the current situation. The
rebellion by enslaved people in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) that had begun in 1791 also served as a warning to
White Spanish Americans of what might happen if people of African ancestry were not tightly controlled. Elites
in Caracas contended that the cédula real would make it even more difficult to maintain this control and could
very well lead to more insurrections. They believed that keeping the castas subordinated was the key to
colonial security and safety. This is the social context in which people were immersed at the beginning of the
independence movement in Latin America.

The Napoleonic Era

The U.S. Declaration of Independence of 1776 and France's 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
Citizen stressed that all men were created equal. However, both these documents were intended to apply
primarily to White males of European descent, and in both Europe and the United States, women and the
enslaved were generally excluded from consideration. The rights that "all men" were said to possess were
those of interest to free White men--property rights, freedom of expression, and the right to participate in
government. Only the most radical of people in the United States and France interpreted these documents to
mean that women should have the same rights as men, or that people of different races should be considered
the equal of White people in terms of rights and social status. Nevertheless, these documents partially inspired
a slave revolt in Saint-Domingue that proved to be one of the French Revolution's most significant effects in the
Americas.

The French colony of Saint-Domingue, located on the western side of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, was
founded in the mid-1600s and was soon the most profitable colony in the Americas, mostly due to the labor of
enslaved Africans who were brought to the island to work on sugar, coffee, and indigo plantations. In 1791,
freed and enslaved Africans and other islanders of African descent rebelled under the leadership of Toussaint
Louverture and Jean-Jacques Dessalines, both of whom had been born enslaved on local plantations. This
revolt evolved into a full-fledged revolution that led to the colony's independence and the declaration of the
free republic of Haiti in 1804. The Haitian Revolution is therefore unique in that it was carried out not by White
colonists of European descent seeking political representation and greater economic freedom, as had been the
case in the British colonies of North America; instead, the struggle for independence in Saint-Domingue was
fought by those at the lowest levels of the social hierarchy.

The rebellion in Haiti had two goals and sought two forms of liberation. For free Blacks and mixed-race elites,
freedom meant an end to colonialism and independence from French rule. For enslaved Blacks, liberation was
much more fundamental: it meant freedom from the abuse they experienced on the plantation and an end to
slavery. By January 1804, through successful guerrilla tactics, Black revolutionaries had decimated the French
army, already suffering an outbreak of yellow fever, to create the Haitian nation. Haiti became the second
liberated territory and republican system in the Western hemisphere.

After the uprising in Haiti, political elites in the Americas feared its success would inspire other slave
rebellions. The idea that American Indians, free and enslaved Africans, and people of mixed-racial ancestry
might launch their own violent bids for independence made the creole aristocracy hesitant to imitate the
liberty-seeking Anglo-American colonists and dampened rather than aroused their support for independence
from their parent countries. Instead, it was upheavals on the Iberian Peninsula itself that would lead to the
breaking of ties between Spain and Portugal and their respective colonies.
296 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

       During the Napoleonic Era (1803-1814), Portugal and Spain supported different sides in the war between
       France and the other European nations that had united in opposition to Napoléon Bonaparte, emperor of the
       French. Whereas Portugal kept its long-standing ties to Great Britain, an enemy of Napoléon, Spain was a
       French ally. Since the War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714), the House of Bourbon had ruled in Spain, and
       its king at the time, Carlos IV, developed a disastrous policy of war with England. British naval blockades not
       only interrupted trade between Spain and its colonies, but in 1806 British soldiers struck Buenos Aires, in the
       Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata (present-day Argentina). Although local forces defeated the British, the attack
       made clear to the Spanish American colonists the vulnerability of their own metropolis and the inability of
       Spain to protect them.
       In 1807, Napoléon implemented his Continental System, or Continental Blockade, that required that all
       European ports be closed to English shipping. Portugal, however, continued to trade with Britain, one of its
       oldest allies. Britain could not be defeated so long as it had access to European trade through Portugal. To force
       Portugal into compliance, though, France would need to invade it, and it could accomplish this only by
       marching through Spain. By this time, Spain had become a vulnerable French satellite and Napoléon easily
       obtained the Spanish Crown's permission to invade Portugal by land. In so doing, Spanish subjects endured
       the heavy burden of taxation, war, and occupation.
       Confronted with rising popular resentment of the pro-French policies, Carlos IV felt pressured to abdicate in
       favor of his son Fernando. Napoléon quickly intervened in the succession process, detained the two men,
       forced both to surrender their claims to the Spanish throne and installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as king
       of Spain.
       But Napoléon's plan did not fully succeed. In early 1808, rather than accepting Joseph Bonaparte, most people
       in Spain, as well as creole royalists and some republicans in the colonies, rebelled. The rebellion began in
       Madrid but quickly spread to other cities across the Iberian Peninsula. Eventually, the Peninsular War
       (1808-1814) would involve British, Spanish, and Portuguese forces, all fighting against the French.

         Commissioned by the Spanish provisional government after the final expulsion of the French from Spain in 1814,
         Spanish artist Francisco de Goya's painting The Third of May 1808 (1814) dramatically portrays a key event in the
         Peninsular War: French reprisals against Spanish rebels involved in the Second of May Uprising (Figure 8.8). The
         uprising, a response to the planned removal of the remaining members of the Spanish royal family to Bayonne,
         France, had taken place in the center of Madrid. The execution by Napoleonic soldiers depicted in the work
         represents one of many that took place across the city in the early hours of the morning following the uprising.

The Peninsular War and the American Question

When Napoléon occupied Spain in 1807 and made its ruling royalty captive, he inadvertently sparked a crisis
in Spain's American empire. As insurgents in Spain established regional governing and deliberative councils
called juntas to deal with the crisis, so too did creole elites. In key economic and political centers such as
Mexico City, Caracas, Buenos Aires, Santiago, and Bogotá, the Spanish authorities surrendered control to these
local juntas. For the first time in Spanish America, local government bodies enjoyed self-rule, and each of the
juntas considered how it might turn this dramatic turn of events to its own advantage. That is, the solution to
the political crisis in Spain breathed new life into a desire for independence throughout the main four colonial
divisions.
The idea of self-rule animated both those who were waiting for the Spanish king to return--the royalists--and
those who craved total independence--the patriots. The royalists justified their actions by following the
298 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

       example of the Spanish regional juntas, but for the patriots, the formation of juntas turned the idea of complete
       independence into a viable goal. They organized popular demonstrations and called the loyalty of royal
       officials into question. From this point on, the conflict between patriots and royalists grew quickly.
       In Spain, the central revolutionary junta yielded its power to a national parliament, the Cortes, which met in
       the city of Cádiz. In 1812, the Cádiz Cortes approved a liberal charter known as the Cádiz Constitution or the
       Constitution of 1812, which provided for limited monarchy, promised freedom of speech and assembly, and
       abolished the Inquisition (Figure 8.9). The writing of the document also provoked heated debates about
       Spanish American autonomy. It gave the franchise to American Indian and mestizo men but excluded men of
       African ancestry from the political process. In terms of political rights, the document legally grouped all
       Spanish Americans of African ancestry with felons, debtors, and domestic servants, as people denied the right
       to govern themselves. Such categorization reinforced the link between African ancestry and slavery.

       FIGURE 8.9 Monument to the Constitution of 1812. This monument in Cádiz, Spain, was commissioned in 1912 to
       commemorate the Cortes and the centennial of the Constitution of 1812. (credit: "Cortes von Cadiz Monument" by
       Hajotthu/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0)
       Though creole delegates joined in the constituent deliberations, the Spanish delegates to the Cortes ensured
       that they retained control of the body. Denying automatic Spanish citizenship and voting rights to men born in
       the Americas and refusing to count them for purposes of determining the number of delegates to the Cortes
       guaranteed that power remained in the hands of the European Spaniards and not the Spanish American
       colonists. Furthermore, the European Spaniards who dominated the Cortes refused to grant colonial demands
       to abolish the Spanish sales tax and eliminate monopolies, because the income earned from these measures
       was needed to fight the French.
       White European Spaniards thus retained their political and commercial control over the colonies. However, the
       experience of forming juntas and sending delegates to the Cortes had broken the colonists' obedience to Spain,
       and the refusal to accede to colonial demands could not be enforced. By then, the colonists had already
       realized that they were completely able to govern themselves. Spain's politico-economic grip on its colonies
       continued to weaken as its militarized response proved ineffective.
       With the fall of Napoléon in 1814, Fernando VII was finally restored to the Spanish throne. Rather than

negotiating once he returned to power, however, he made it clear that the six-year interlude of self-rule in the
Americas was over. Fernando dissolved the Cortes, rejected the Constitution of 1812, persecuted liberals, and
dispatched Spanish troops to the colonies to enforce his absolutist policies. This return to colonial order was a
relief to royalists, but it enraged the patriots. The creole juntas in Spanish America simply could not accept the
high costs of returning to the previous colonial administration. Now more than ever, they wanted an equal
voice in government and consent to the free trade policy already in place.

The disruption of Spanish sovereignty had brought all colonial grievances to the forefront and sparked
immediate reactions in the colonies. The creole elites' resentment over the reinstatement of pre-Napoleonic
policy allowed the search for independence to spark.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Identify events and factors leading to the Mexican War of Independence
  · Describe Agustín de Iturbide's Plan de Iguala and the achievement of Mexican independence

The struggle for liberty in Spanish America started in North America and rippled throughout the
administrative divisions of the Spanish Empire. It began in Mexico with demonstrations of discontent with the
colonial regime. This first wave was socially revolutionary in nature and mobilized the Indigenous and mestizo
masses by emphasizing land reform and the abolition of tributary labor. Later, this movement evolved into a
provisional creole government and a plan for Mexico's first constitutional monarchy.

The Mexican War of Independence

Napoléon's assault on the Bourbons in the Napoleonic Wars immediately transformed European politics, but it
had a delayed effect on the Spanish colonies. Spanish American colonial elites took their time weighing the
risks, and the majority of their junta members, both in Spain and in the Americas, first swore their loyalty to
the absent Spanish king. In 1808, initial meetings with the viceroy of New Spain led to the establishment of an
autonomous conservative junta in Mexico City, formed by creoles and peninsulares, who favored maintaining
their loyalty to Spain at all costs. Representatives of New Spain, by far the richest Spanish colony, seemed to
adapt to the junta system. However, in 1810, when peninsular judges deposed the viceroy and installed their
own leader in the position, creole royalists were inspired to take full control of the government.

Between 1808 and 1810, a cycle of bad harvests and famine in Mexico had harmed Indigenous peasants and
creole farmers. An economic recession that occurred at the same time led to high unemployment among
mestizo silver miners. The effects of these downturns were worsened by the Act of Consolidation, passed by
the Spanish government in 1804, demanding that the Catholic Church deposit its wealth with the government.
Because the Catholic Church had loaned money to people who bought land or started businesses, in order to
comply, it now had to ask that the loans be repaid in full. This hurt many creole merchants and landowners.
Perhaps not surprisingly, then, the first insurrection for independence in New Spain took the form of a violent
multiethnic uprising, coming from the bottom layers of the social hierarchy and led by parish priests in mostly
mestizo regions. Creole shopkeepers, professionals, minor political officials, and priests blamed the
viceroyalty's government for their problems.

Concerned with recent political changes and the plight of the poor and exploited, a well-educated creole priest
named Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla took the initiative to start a movement for independence (Figure 8.10).
Although Hidalgo intended to deliver a blow to the status quo and called for radical action, he proclaimed the
most conservative of motives. The revolution was to be fought in the name of Fernando VII and the Virgin of
Guadalupe--the ultimate symbol of Mexican Catholic piety.

       Hidalgo" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       When conservative political authorities in Mexico City learned of his plans, Hidalgo issued a declaration in the
       town of Dolores on September 16, 1810. In this Grito de Dolores (grito means "cry"), he called upon peasants
       and unemployed miners to overthrow the viceroyalty's government. He demanded the abolition of slavery and
       tribute, the redistribution of wealth, and the return of land to the Indigenous people. Another key demand was
       respect for the Virgin of Guadalupe, who would later become the patron saint of Mexico. The Grito de Dolores
       proclaimed independence as its goal, but it was unclear about the means. Hidalgo's plan envisioned a more
       tolerable form of government that provided benefits for the poor by seeking an end to abuses by the elite, but it
       lacked a program and effective leadership.
       The tale of the Virgin of Guadalupe (Figure 8.11) is an expressive example of a symbol of Christian devotion,
       the Virgin Mary, transformed and adapted into a Mexican national emblem. According to the story of the
       Virgin, in 1531 she appeared to the Aztec peasant Juan Diego and spoke to him in his native language. Many
       Spanish clergy refused to believe Diego's claims, and the Virgin of Guadalupe's early worshippers seem to have
       been largely Indigenous people. Hidalgo proclaimed the Virgin to be the rebellion's guardian and protector.
       Her image encouraged lower-class casta peasants to join the movement and fight under her banner. She was
       also later appropriated by creole nationalists as a uniquely Mexican saint in order to advance their nineteenth-
       century struggle for autonomy.

Word of Hidalgo's rebellion quickly spread among the desperate and dispossessed castas in the region, who
could now vent their grievances against the colonial administration. Within a few days, the priest had enlisted
thousands of recruits in his army, which at its height totaled around sixty thousand people, 55 percent
Indigenous people and 20 percent of mixed race. Hidalgo's forces thus totaled more than one-third of the
population of the capital of New Spain. (Mexico City, the largest city on the North American continent in 1811,
had a total population of almost 170,000 people.)
Hidalgo's followers sacked several towns and committed other destructive actions, including carrying out a
mob attack that killed the city elite of Guanajuato, who had barricaded themselves in the public granary for
safety. In the face of this violent turn of events, creole and Spanish elites, even those who had originally
supported Hidalgo, set aside their differences to protect their privileged positions--and their lives. In doing so,
they resembled the creoles and peninsulares of Peru who had banded together to confront Túpac Amaru's
rebellion in the 1780s. In March 1811, royalist forces captured and executed Hidalgo. Yet his army marched
on, and today he is remembered as the father of independence and one of Mexico's greatest national heroes.
September 16, the day of the Grito de Dolores, is Mexico's Independence Day.
In 1812, another rural priest, José María Morelos y Pavón, from a poor mestizo family in southern Mexico, took
302 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

       charge of the independence movement (Figure 8.12). His army was organized, and he galvanized an
       insurrection of artisans and peasants. Closer to Indigenous people than even Hidalgo was, Morelos outlined
       clear sociopolitical objectives: an end to slavery and the casta system, abolition of Indigenous tribute, and
       institution of land reform. In 1813, at the apex of his military career, Morelos convened a wartime congress in
       the town of Chilpancingo that declared Mexico's independence from Spain. The congress was also charged
       with producing a constitution, and to guide its efforts Morelos composed Sentiments of the Nation, a document
       outlining plans for social reforms (as well as the introduction of an income tax).

       señor don José María Morelos" by Museo Nacional de Historia/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Although the congress produced a constitution for the nation its members officially named Mexico, Morelos's
       efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. He brought some order to a committed but largely undisciplined
       insurrection force, but he was not able to broaden his support base. He failed to persuade moderate creoles to
       join the cause, and mestizos continued to make up the majority of his supporters. In December 1815, royalist
       forces caught and executed him, bringing the first phase of the war for Mexican independence to an end.
       It was the viceroyalty's government, not the Spanish Crown, that fought both Hidalgo's and Morelos's rebellions
       in New Spain. That is, the royalist armies that met the revolutionary forces were 95 percent Mexican, mostly
       creole and mixed-race. The rebellions thus represented struggles in which the people's loyalties were divided
       and the final outcome was not inevitable; Mexico was experiencing a revolutionary civil war. After Morelos's
       death, his follower, the casta Vicente Ramón Guerrero Saldaña, whose father supported the Spanish Crown and
       whose uncle served in the Spanish militia, continued guerrilla operations against Spanish authorities for
       several more years (Figure 8.13). While the patriots had not yet succeeded in getting enough people on their
       side, Spain's hold on its colony was weakened even more. By 1820, the Viceroyalty of New Spain was relatively
       calm. Rebellion was about to break out again, however, as a result of events in Spain.

 Sentiments of the Nation

  In 1813, José María Morelos y Pavón composed Sentiments of the Nation to guide the congress he had charged
  with writing a constitution for the new nation of Mexico. In this treatise, Morelos listed twenty-three points he
  believed would create a strong nation capable of protecting and meeting the needs of all its citizens. Some of
  these were familiar from revolutions in the United States and France. Many, though, specifically reflected the
  concerns of people living in Spanish America, such as protecting the Catholic Church. Here are some of Morelos's
  points:

        1. America is free and independent of Spain and all other nations, governments, or monarchies.
        2. The Catholic faith is the sole religion, and no others will be tolerated.
        4. Dogma is established by church hierarchy: the pope, bishops, and priests.
        5. Sovereignty emanates from the people and is placed in a Supreme National American Congress,
        made up of representatives from the provinces in equal numbers.
        6. Power is divided among appropriate executive, legislative, and judicial branches.
        11. Liberal government is to replace tyranny with the expulsion of the Spaniards.
        12. Laws should promote patriotism and industry, moderate opulence and idleness, and improve the lot
304 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

               and the education of the poor.

               13. Laws should apply to all, with no privileges.

               15. Slavery is prohibited forever, as are the distinctions of caste, with all being equal and only vice and
               virtue distinguishing one American from the other.

               19. 12 December is to be dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe and celebrated.

               22. The payment of tributes is ended; a tax of 5% or similar light amount will be levied.

      Iturbide and the Plan de Iguala

       In 1820, Spanish liberals succeeded in forcing Fernando VII to reinstate the liberal Cádiz Constitution of 1812.
       In New Spain, liberal creoles welcomed the implementation of this constitution because it reopened
       possibilities for their participation in government. However, the conservative creole elite could not accept the
       measures attacking the privileges of the Catholic Church and the military, in which many of them held
       positions. The Spanish king again proved his inefficiency in controlling the Spanish colonies, laying the
       ground for a second independence movement. This one was led by creoles with the goal of improving their
       status and power. Rather than making colonial society egalitarian, which had been the goal of Hidalgo and
       Morelos, the creole elite simply wanted to rule Mexico for themselves.

       The creole elite--major landowners, military officers, and church officials--decided to declare independence
       from Spain and forged a very pragmatic partnership with the mestizo and Indigenous followers of Vicente
       Guerrero. The winning strategy was to be nationalism in the form of an intense pride in Mexican (as opposed
       to Spanish) identity, an identity defined by birthplace that creoles shared with Indigenous and mixed-blood
       people as well as the children of enslaved Africans. This mostly anti-Spanish nationalism allowed creoles to
       fight for independence but keep the social hierarchy more or less intact.

       Agustín de Iturbide, a royalist creole officer who had distinguished himself in the campaigns against Hidalgo
       and Morelos, offered such a strategy. He formed an agreement with Guerrero, the man whose revolutionary
       movement it had been his duty to crush. Iturbide had the military force needed to win independence, while
       Guerrero had the support of Indigenous and mixed-race Mexicans, the majority of the population. Both shared
       the goal of independence from Spain.

       On February 24, 1821, Iturbide announced the Plan de Iguala. This plan combined both conservative and
       radical views and was based on principles known as the Three Guarantees: independence, religion, and
       equality. Mexico was to be independent of Spain. Roman Catholicism was the official religion. Social equality
       and protection were to be provided for all residents of Mexico--whether born in the Americas or in Spain. The
       plan also called for a new imperial Mexican Crown, to be offered to a willing European royal, and the
       establishment of a regency during the waiting period before the new royal leader was named. To uphold the
       movement's grounding principles, a new Army of the Three Guarantees (Ejército de las tres garantías) was
       formed under Iturbide's command.

On September 27, 1821, a date marking the three-hundredth anniversary of the fall of the Aztec Empire and
the end of an eleven-year rebellious period, Iturbide made a triumphant entrance into Mexico City (Figure
8.14). With the support of the conservative creole elite and two powerful liberal insurgent leaders, Vicente
Guerrero and Guadalupe Victoria, he proclaimed Mexican independence. Mexico became a constitutional
monarchy, which, according to the Plan de Iguala, protected the interests of both Spanish-born peninsulares
and the church. At the town of Córdoba, Iturbide and the Spanish representative Viceroy Juan de O'Donojú y
O'Ryan signed a treaty accepting the terms of the Plan de Iguala, with one adjustment. According to a new
clause, in the absence of a European monarch, a local emperor could be chosen. Under this arrangement, eight
months later in 1822, the newly elected congress confirmed Iturbide as Agustín I, constitutional emperor of
Mexico.

creole crowd. (credit: "Agustin de Iturbide entrance to Mexico City on 27 September 1821" by Instituto Nacional de
Estudios Históricos de las Revoluciones de México/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
However, Iturbide's reign was brief. His monarchy did not have popular support, and the royal requirements
clashed with the fiscal realities of the new nation. In 1822, Iturbide dissolved the congress, a move that
sparked uprisings on many fronts. In 1823, he abdicated in response to growing opposition and left for exile in
England. Mexico became a republic, and a new constitution was drafted.
The Constitution of 1824 marked a compromise between liberal and conservative interests, with liberals
favoring social reforms such as those championed by Hidalgo and Morelos, and conservatives concerned with
protecting the status of elites and the church. Social equality was written into the constitution, with the
exception of special judicial privileges given to the military and the clergy. The power to pass laws and to tax
was given to the government of the Mexican states. Following the adoption of the new constitution, the liberal
general Guadalupe Victoria became Mexico's first president. When Iturbide changed his mind and decided to
return from exile, he was captured as soon as he arrived at the port and was shot by the new republican troops.

         · Describe the consequences of South American liberation
       From revolutionary Mexico in the northern hemisphere, rebellion rippled south. Spanish American
       nationalists in Mexico had gained momentum for their cause when they united against the peninsulares. The
       southern parts of the Spanish American empire underwent a similar experience because the patriot creole
       group also coveted the potential benefits of independence: free trade, control over tax revenue, and local
       governance. There were two initial focuses: one in northern South America led by Simón Bolívar from Caracas,
       and another in the far south of the continent led by José de San Martín from Buenos Aires. Under the
       leadership of Bolívar and San Martín--the libertadores (liberators)--military operations began that aimed at
       controlling the royalist stronghold in Peru to achieve and spread independence throughout South America
       (Figure 8.15).

      The Northern Liberation Movement

       Between 1807 and 1810 in the judicial district of Caracas, Venezuela (in the Viceroyalty of New Granada),
       royalists and patriot creoles from the upper-class elite struggled to create a self-governing body. Then, on April
       19, 1810, the creoles of Caracas deposed the Spanish administrative officers and created a junta to govern in

the name of Fernando VII. The junta, whose authority was recognized by other cities in the Viceroyalty of New
Granada, then called for the creation of a congress, which met for the first time in March 1811.
Not all in the congress favored governing in the name of the still-imprisoned king of Spain. On July 5, 1811,
patriot members who believed the body should instead govern on behalf of the people of New Granada
officially declared the independence of Venezuela, making it the first South American republic. Royalists
struck back. They received support among Venezuela's large African and pardo population, whose interests
had been advanced when the Spanish government gave them the opportunity to purchase White status with
the cédula real. White creoles, like the patriots in the Venezuelan congress, had opposed greater rights for
people who were not of European ancestry. Cities in the western part of New Granada had not recognized the
authority of the Caracas junta or sent representatives to the Venezuelan congress, and they also proclaimed
their loyalty to the king.
The royalists received unexpected additional support for their cause when, on the Thursday before Easter in
1812, a massive earthquake hit Caracas, killing thousands. The Catholic clergy, who supported the royalist
cause, convinced the lower social classes that God had punished Caracas because of its disregard for the king's
authority, which had been granted by God. The royalist members of the government reinstituted the district's
previous political links to Spain, and a bitter civil war between royalists and patriots ensued.
Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palácios, part of the creole elite and impassioned about
the new ideas of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, entered the fight in 1811 as an appointed
colonel of the rebel patriot army. After his first defeat, he took refuge on the island of Curaçao and then fled to
the city of Cartagena (in modern-day Colombia). From this new base, he was able to launch a successful
campaign to invade Caracas in 1813 and reestablish the republic (Figure 8.16).

Bolívar's success in battle was based on his commitment to fighting to the last soldier, in what became known
as "war to the death" (guerra a muerte). This strategy aimed at radicalizing the conflict and reducing support
for the royalist cause. For example, all Spaniards who did not actively support the movement for independence
were sentenced to death. Bolívar's dramatic military plan left entire provinces depopulated and kept his army
308 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

       almost constantly in battle. His success was short-lived, however. In 1814, defeated in Venezuela, Bolívar
       returned to Cartagena.

       In 1815 after Napoléon Bonaparte's fall, the newly restored Spanish king Fernando VII sent military forces to
       South America to shore up his absolute authority. These Spanish forces were able to restore colonial power and
       defeat Bolívar and his patriot troops. Once again ousted, Bolívar sought shelter in the British colony of Jamaica,
       where he penned his "Letter from Jamaica" to a newspaper. In this candid document, he outlined his vision of
       a unified Spanish America and reiterated his defense of independence and conviction that it would triumph.

       The most prescient part of the document was Bolívar's extended analysis of the past, present, and future of
       Spanish America. The letter reveals his creole bias in its argument that the lower social classes were not equal
       to the task of gaining independence. Bolívar stressed that the mixed-race people of the Americas were
       condemned to civic ignorance, oppression, and vice because the Spanish colonial system had acted as a
       tyrannical father and deprived them of liberty, equality, property, and security. They were forced onto the
       lowest social rungs, where they were unable to participate in the sociopolitical and economic affairs of their
       country.

       Bolívar's emphasis on his country's lack of preparation for self-government was used to reinforce his claim
       that Spanish Americans in general needed firm guidance and a powerful executive in their newly independent
       nations. Unlike many others who simply advocated for independence from Spain, Bolívar focused on the need
       for a strong central government rather than the federal system adopted by Mexico in its Constitution of 1824,
       in which power rested primarily with local authorities. Bolívar was also a promoter of Spanish American unity,
       and he expressed hope for a league of American nations whose representatives would regularly meet and
       assist each other.

       Read Simón Bolívar's "Letter from Jamaica" (https://openstax.org/l/77BolivarLetter) from 1815, in which he
       analyzes his Spanish American heritage. As you read, pay attention to his discussion of the types of
       government he believes will work best in Spanish America and which will not.

       From Jamaica, Bolívar went to Haiti, where he received asylum and economic assistance from President
       Alexandre Pétion. Though there was a clear bond of sympathy between them, their relationship had its
       problems. Pétion's regime was genuinely liberal, but there were schisms within its ranks, and the international
       situation was shaky--neither France nor the United States had yet recognized Haiti as a nation. Pétion's
       assistance was therefore discreet. Bolívar received hard cash, armaments, and a recruited Black military force
       under one condition: Put an end to slavery in the newly independent nations.

       With the help of those forces, Bolívar sailed back to the Orinoco River delta in Venezuela and turned the tide in
       favor of the patriot army. He was able to do so, however, only after gaining the support of the mixed-race
       cowboys, the llaneros, who dominated much of the region, and of their chieftain José Antonio Páez. Thousands
       of llaneros joined Bolívar's army at this critical juncture. A key reason for his success was likely his ability to
       enlist both the marginalized mixed-race and Black populations and the creole elites in his cause. It was only
       after he allowed the common people to join his army that he was able to consistently win the wars of
       independence, whose decisive victory came at Boyacá, Colombia, in August 1819. After liberating Venezuela,
       Bolívar took the rest of New Granada. Bogotá fell only after he had led an army of twenty-five hundred men up
       to the Orinoco River, climbed over the Andes Mountains, crossed flooded rivers and plains in the midst of the
       rainy season, with Bolívar carrying soldiers who had become too weak to stand, and descended on the enemy.

       In 1819, Bolívar established the Congress of Angostura (in modern-day Ciudad Bolívar in Venezuela), which
       approved the creation of the nation of Colombia (encompassing modern Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador).
       The congress vested Bolívar with dictatorial powers. He rejected monarchy, with its potential to lead to
       dictatorship, but he also warned against federalism and popular democracy, for which he felt Spanish

Americans were unprepared. He advocated a republican form of government anchored in a powerful
hereditary senate. The senate--formed by educated and suitable individuals--was to be a sound intermediary
between the people and the government. In his Angostura Address, Bolívar outlined his ideas about how to
balance freedom and order as well as how to navigate sensitive race relations. Military brilliance does not
necessarily signal political skill, however, and neither Bolívar's fledgling dream of a representative republican
system nor his ideal of pan-American unity were shared by others in the region. With time, it became clear
those ideas were not to succeed.

In an 1821 gathering in the city of Cúcuta (in present-day Colombia), patriot representatives from Venezuela
and New Granada (also present-day Colombia) decided on the unification of the former territories of the
Viceroyalty of New Granada (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama) into one federative nation called
Gran Colombia. Bolívar put Francisco de Paula Santander in charge of New Granada's regional administration.
The revolutionary Cúcuta Congress outlined a liberal program of reforms and adopted a centralized
constitution and the gradual granting of citizenship rights to all.

The most pressing Issue was slavery. Enslaved and mixed-race people demanded emancipation, which had
been promised in the rhetoric of national liberation and which Bolívar had assured Pétion he would
accomplish. In 1820, he ordered Santander to promise emancipation and recruit an army of five thousand
willing enslaved people. Afraid of alienating the region's mine and landowners, who depended on slave labor,
Santander limited the recruitment to three thousand and instructed the rest to return to their masters.

Bolívar's position--already presented in his Jamaica letter's critique of Spanish colonial control--was clearly
reflected in the constitution. Accordingly, the republic of New Granada, the first to grant its citizens the
responsibilities of self-government, limited voting rights to male property owners. Minorities (women, poor
White people, and people of African descent) still yearned for freedom and equality. The Abolition of Slavery
Law, enacted by the Cúcuta Congress, delegated a gradual and complicated process to committees of local
notables, which simply prolonged the institution of slavery.

The Southern Liberation Movement

Like the port town of Caracas in the north, the port of Buenos Aires in the south reaped significant benefits
from the eighteenth-century reforms aimed at developing the Spanish Empire's outskirts. Formerly subject to
the authority of the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru, in 1776 Buenos Aires became the seat of the newly created
Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata (modern-day Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay). The port was the
principal outlet from which silver from Bolivia and animal hides and tallow from the vast plains of Argentina
and Uruguay reached markets abroad. The town's residents, known as Porteños, also enjoyed abundant
opportunities for trading in contraband with the British and Portuguese.

The population of Buenos Aires quadrupled in the last half of the eighteenth century (it was almost forty
thousand by 1800), and merchants and civic leaders took pride in their growing prosperity. Accordingly, rising
fortunes in Río de la Plata created a newly favorable environment for those who preferred rupture to reform.
There was a ripe international market for South American products like sugar, hides, cacao, tobacco, and silver,
and the creole elite were eager to open their ports to British, Dutch, and French merchants. And with their easy
access to Atlantic foreign merchants, Argentine elites in Buenos Aires also had much to gain from greater
autonomy.

Following Napoléon's invasion of Spain in 1808, the creole militia officers in Argentina formed a new
governing junta that proclaimed support for Fernando VII. However, after almost two years, radical changes
310 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

       within the patriot majority of the junta led them to repudiate Spanish authority, silence local opposition, and
       proclaim Argentina's revolutionary patriot movement on May 25, 1810. Not all regions of Río de la Plata,
       however, recognized the authority of the junta, which was based in Buenos Aires. Successful military
       campaigns in the central part of Argentina soon brought this area under the control of the junta, but its troops
       were not able to secure Uruguay and Paraguay, which rejected control by Buenos Aires.

       In March 1816, Argentina's conservative local leaders invoked a congress in Tucumán. The congress declared
       the independence of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata on July 9, 1816 (now Independence Day in
       Argentina), less as a sign of revolutionary militancy than as a practical recognition of their political situation.
       Resistance came not from faraway Spain but from the neighboring royalist provinces, Uruguay and Paraguay,
       when Argentina attempted once again to extend its authority there.

       Paraguayans had already declared their independence from both Spain and the Argentine government in
       1811. The new country quickly devolved into a dictatorship under José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, a lawyer
       who had briefly taught theology at a seminary in Paraguay. He was chosen one of Paraguay's ruling consuls by
       the country's Congress on October 1, 1813. (In imitation of the Roman Republic, Paraguay had two consuls,
       chief executives who each also controlled one-half of the country's army.)

       In March 1814, Francia, who was an advocate for the common man, passed a law requiring racial
       intermarriage; White Europeans could marry only people of African, Indigenous, or mestizo ancestry. A few
       months later, Paraguay's congress made Francia the country's only consul and gave him absolute power for
       three years. In 1816, congress made him dictator of Paraguay for life. Intent on realizing the ideals of the
       French Revolution and influenced by the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Francia, while continuing to support
       the Catholic Church by building new churches and funding religious festivals, attempted to improve the lives of
       the poor by abolishing tithes and giving the Paraguayan government control over institutions such as hospitals
       and orphanages that had been run by the Church. He instituted measures to modernize agriculture and
       established national industries. Focused solely on reforming society and determined to make Paraguay self-
       sufficient, Francia ended foreign trade, prevented river traffic between Argentina and Paraguay, and adopted a
       position of neutrality in foreign policy. Paraguay was thus isolated from the revolutionary turmoil that gripped
       the rest of South America.

       Just as the people of Paraguay charted their own path to independence, the inhabitants of the eastern province
       of Montevideo (modern-day Uruguay) resisted threats from La Plata and Brazil and built their own movement,
       under José Gervasio Artigas. Montevideo remained in Spanish hands until 1814 when it fell to the Argentines,
       who ignored Artigas's demands for autonomy. Creole patriots had the upper hand all over Spanish South
       America. The only exception was the Viceroyalty of Peru, the most solid bulwark of Spanish power in South
       America, where royalist armies were stationed and most creoles remained steadfastly royalist. Peru was a
       constant threat to patriots, and its liberation was vital.

       By 1817, the Argentine general José Francisco de San Martín y Matorras, who had fought against Napoléon in
       Spain in 1812, had set up a plan to isolate and attack royalists in Peru, the Spanish stronghold. He organized
       an army camp at the base of the Andes, and under his command, Argentine forces scored great successes. In
       January 1817, after careful preparation, he led his five thousand soldiers through the Andean mountains,
       where altitudes approached more than ten thousand feet above sea level, and over six different passes into
       Chile.

       Chile had already broken from the Viceroyalty of Peru when creole Spanish Americans there had established
       their own junta in 1810; however, the region had been plagued by fighting between royalists and various pro-
       independence factions who supported differing degrees of autonomy. When royalists gained the upper hand,
       the leader of one of those factions, Bernardo O'Higgins, found himself exiled to Argentina. There he met San
       Martín, and together they planned an assault on Spanish royalist forces in Chile (Figure 8.17). San Martín's
       assistance secured a decisive victory, and O'Higgins declared Chile's independence in 1818.

The Guayaquil Conference

The northern and southern forces of the South American independence movements converged in the firmly
royalist Viceroyalty of Peru and made Lima, the capital city, their target. From the north, one stream of
revolutionary armies led by Bolívar flowed from the Viceroyalty of New Granada, and from the south, another
led by San Martín swept up from the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata and the newly independent Republic of Chile.
San Martín departed Chile in 1820 with both land forces and sailors on ships. He had the assistance of Scottish
former naval officer and mercenary Thomas Cochrane, one of the foreigners who on their own initiative had
joined the South American patriots in their struggle for independence. San Martín launched a naval assault on
royalist Peru in Lima and landed on its shores in September 1820. Though the highlands remained in royalist
hands, his arrival started an uprising along the coast, and he gradually expanded his foothold until he
occupied Lima itself. On July 28, 1821, Peruvian creoles in the city were forced to declare independence and
accept San Martín as Protector of Peru.
Lima was now under San Martín's military and civil rule, but royalist troops continued to control the vast
312 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

       Peruvian hinterland, and the inhabitants of the capital saw him and his forces as foreign invaders. Following
       his liberation of Bogotá in 1819, Bolívar and his armies had moved on to Ecuador. Making little progress
       against the remaining royalists, San Martín and Bolívar--rivals for control of the independence
       movement--decided to meet in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In 1821, Guayaquil's valuable port and naval base had
       fallen under Bolívar's control, and in 1822, he had entered the city of Quito and declared Ecuador's
       independence. In July 1822, San Martín set sail for Guayaquil with hopes of convincing the port city's
       merchants to unite with Lima. However, Bolívar had arrived earlier and pressed his Guayaquil supporters for
       union with Colombia. When San Martín landed in the city, the possession of the city no longer figured in their
       discussion. Probably disillusioned, San Martín conferred with Bolívar behind closed doors. The talks were
       secret, but by their end, San Martín had decided to leave the completion of the liberation of South America to
       Bolívar. Shortly thereafter, San Martín withdrew from the independence struggle and went into a self-imposed
       exile in Europe, never again to return.

       Bolívar occupied Lima in 1823, and in February 1824, a Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru. He
       won a significant victory against Spanish forces in August 1824 at the Battle of Junín, and in December 1824,
       his skilled chief of staff Antonio José de Sucre defeated a much larger Spanish force at the Battle of Ayacucho.
       In 1825, following their defeat by Sucre, royalist troops in Upper Peru (renamed Bolivia in honor of El
       Libertador) accepted a general amnesty.

       In regard to the place of South American nations in the larger geopolitical sphere, both Bolívar and San Martín
       demonstrated a continent-wide outlook and support for close alliances among the newly independent nations.
       San Martín shared with the Mexican conservatives an admiration for the British constitutional monarchy, but
       Bolívar rejected the mystical figure of the king and believed the republican system was the best guarantee of
       stability. In 1822, Gran Colombia became the first Spanish American nation to receive diplomatic recognition
       from the United States.

       The United States was anxious that European countries not use the Latin American wars of independence as
       an excuse to intervene in the Western Hemisphere. Such an action would threaten not only the young nation's
       security but also its commerce. In 1815, in the wake of Napoléon's defeat at Waterloo, Austria, Prussia, and
       Russia had formed the Holy Alliance. Its purpose was to protect European empires by discouraging revolution,
       such as the one that had engulfed France. At conferences in 1820 and 1821, the Holy Alliance declared their
       right to intervene in rebellions that threatened to unseat European monarchs. And, in 1820-1821, a rebellion
       in Naples was crushed by invading Austrian troops. Although the Holy Alliance had not intervened in 1820 to
       help Fernando VII when Spanish liberals had forced him to reinstitute the Constitution of 1812, in 1822, they
       agreed to support an invasion of Spain by France's Louis XVIII for the purposes of bringing an end to the
       Spanish revolutionary movement and restoring the imprisoned Fernando to the throne.

       The members of the Holy Alliance intended also to Assert Fernando VII's control over his rebellious American
       colonies. The United States opposed such intervention as did Britain, which carried on extensive trade with
       Latin America. Britain's foreign minister proposed that the United States join Britain in issuing a joint
       statement warning France and the Holy Alliance against imposing their will on the former Spanish colonies.
       U.S. secretary of state John Quincy Adams, however, considered it "more candid as well as more dignified" for
       the new country "to avow our principles explicitly" than to allow the British to take the lead. Accordingly, with
       the reluctant agreement of President James Monroe, in 1823, Adams set forth the Monroe Doctrine, a
       principle of U.S. foreign policy that warned European nations to refrain from interfering with independent
       countries in the Western Hemisphere. Although gratified by U.S. support, Bolívar trusted more in British
       influence to block Spain's attempts to regain its American colonies and did not give much importance to the
       Monroe Doctrine. In 1824, Great Britain joined the United States in officially recognizing Gran Colombia,
       whose representatives obtained a significant loan from the London financial market.

       In 1826, Bolívar convened the Congress of Panama to strengthen fraternal ties among the newly independent
       nations in former Spanish America, adopt programs of mutual cooperation, and create a permanent alliance.

Conspicuously absent were the United States, Haiti, and Brazil. However, the main difficulty was the internal
fragility of the new nations. The legacy of the Spanish American revolutions was contradictory. Although the
new nations had broken free of Spain, colonial social hierarchies persisted. These then escalated into a social
struggle among the enslaved Africans, Indigenous groups, mestizos, pardos, and White people. Provinces
fought each other, and after defeating royalist forces, the popular armies faced civil wars over a new
postcolonial order. Creole leaders like Bolívar and San Martín were not the only heirs of independence. The
main postcolonial leaders were the local military chieftains, who often forged alliances with wealthy creole
landowners and perpetuated their power.

 Justification for Revolution

  Simón Bolívar and other Spanish American patriots believed they were justified in proclaiming independence
  from Spain. In his "Letter from Jamaica," Bolívar deplored Spain's mistreatment of its American colonies and the
  brutality of its attempts to defeat their fight for liberty. The Spanish government, however, believed the people in
  its American colonies had received the benefits of its protection and were now behaving ungratefully. In a letter
  to U.S. secretary of state John Quincy Adams, a Spanish official named Don Joaquín de Anduaga protested U.S.
  recognition of the revolutionary governments, reiterated Spain's lack of responsibility for the rebels' anger, and
  took pains to differentiate Bolívar's revolution from the U.S. War of Independence. Compare Bolívar's position
  (immediately following) with that of Anduaga, which follows Bolívar's.

        The hatred that the Peninsula has inspired in us is greater than the ocean between us. It would be
        easier to have the two continents meet than to reconcile the spirits of the two countries. The habit of
        obedience; a community of interest, of understanding, of religion; mutual goodwill; a tender regard for
        the birthplace and good name of our forefathers; in short, all that gave rise to our hopes, came to us
        from Spain. As a result there was born principle of affinity that seemed eternal, notwithstanding the
        misbehavior of our rulers, which weakened that sympathy, or, rather, that bond enforced by the
        domination of their rule.

        At present the contrary attitude persists: we are threatened with the fear of death, dishonor, and every
        harm; there is nothing we have not suffered at the hands of that unnatural stepmother-Spain. The veil
        has been torn asunder. We have already seen the light, and it is not our desire to be thrust back into
        darkness. The chains have been broken; we have been freed, and now our enemies seek to enslave us
        anew. For this reason America fights desperately, and seldom has desperation failed to achieve victory .
        . . .

        We have been harassed by a conduct which has not only deprived us of our rights but has kept us in a
        sort of permanent infancy with regard to public affairs. If we could at least have managed our domestic
        affairs and our internal administration, we could have acquainted ourselves with the processes and
        mechanics of public affairs. We should also have enjoyed a personal consideration, thereby
        commanding a certain unconscious respect from the people, which is so necessary to preserve amidst
        revolutions.

        --Simón Bolívar, "Letter from Jamaica," 1819

        I have seen the Message sent by the President to the House of Representatives, in which he proposes
        the recognition, by the United States, of the insurgent governments of Spanish America. How great my
        surprise was, may be easily judged by anyone acquainted with the conduct of Spain towards [the United
        States] . . . . And, moreover, will not his astonishment be augmented to see that [the U.S.] is desirous to
        give the destructive example of sanctioning the rebellion of provinces which have received no offence
        from the mother-country,--to whom she has granted a participation in a free constitution,--and to whom
314 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

               she extended all the rights and prerogatives of Spanish citizens? In vain will a parallel be attempted to
               be drawn between the emancipation of this Republic [the U.S.] and that which the Spanish rebels
               attempt; and history is sufficient to prove, that if a harassed and persecuted province has a right to
               break its chains, others, loaded with benefits, elevated to the high rank of freedom, ought only to bless
               and embrace more closely the protecting country which has bestowed such favours upon them.

       Imagine transporting the U.S. president and all the members of Congress and their families across the ocean
       in forty vessels on a trip that lasted months. This is what the Portuguese royal House of Braganza did in 1807,
       and for more than a decade after that, Portugal ruled its empire from the Americas rather than from Europe.
       This unprecedented move set the tone for the independence of Portuguese America, which was pursued
       relatively peacefully compared to the liberation movements in Spanish America. Furthermore, whereas
       Spanish America fragmented into many countries, Portuguese America remained one nation, Brazil. In
       September 1822, Brazil became independent under a Portuguese-born king and adopted a constitutional
       monarchical system. The monarchy brought political stability to the region but did not challenge colonial
       hierarchies.

      The Establishment of the Kingdom of Brazil

       In 1807, when Napoléon instituted his Continental System aimed at isolating Britain and economically
       destroying it, Portugal, notable for its long-standing alliance with Britain, was not able to comply. To punish
       Portugal's breaking of his naval blockade, Napoléon obtained the Spanish Crown's permission to invade
       Portugal by land (since the French navy was not capable of facing the British at sea). French troops
       commanded by General Jean-Andoche Junot swept across the Iberian Peninsula to storm into Lisbon.
       In view of these events, Lord Strangford, Great Britain's diplomatic envoy to Portugal, counseled the
       Portuguese royal family to move the court to Portuguese America. Queen Maria wore the Portuguese Crown,
       but because she had been declared mentally incapacitated, her son the Prince Regent João was left with the
       decision. The imminent arrival of French forces in November 1807 finally convinced João that fleeing to Brazil
       was the only solution. As the troops approached, the Portuguese royal family and its entourage of about ten
       thousand people escaped to Brazil in a fleet under British convoy (Figure 8.18). In return for their assistance,
       the British received generous commercial privileges in Brazil.

In 1808, after a short stop in Salvador, Bahia, the royal family and their courtiers were welcomed by Brazilian
colonists and departed to settle in Rio de Janeiro on the southeastern coast. For the first time in modern
history, a European monarch, heir, and court had set foot in their American domain. On April 1, 1808,
Brazilian ports were opened to all friendly nations, which really meant Great Britain; all previous
manufacturing prohibitions intended to protect Portuguese industry were revoked; and the Bank of Brazil was
established. As a result, Brazil's total population jumped from almost three million in 1798 to almost four
million in 1818.
The Portuguese Crown's willingness to share power with the local planter aristocracy led to the expansion of
institutions such as hospitals, libraries, and schools and universities. Vital reforms in administration,
agriculture, and manufacturing were instituted. Though the cultural initiatives were welcome, the new tax
burden imposed to pay for the needs of the royal court, the expanded bureaucracy, and the war against France,
as well as Brazil's great dependence on Great Britain, were not. The presence of the Portuguese Crown
centralized control of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro to a great degree, however, and this centralization became a
powerful force for the unification of Brazil as one nation.
Even after the fall of Napoléon in 1814 and the restoration of Bourbon kings in both France and Spain, the
Portuguese Crown resolutely stayed on in Brazil. On December 16, 1815, Brazil was officially given the status of
a kingdom. When Queen Maria I died there in 1816, her son became João VI, king of the United Kingdoms of
316 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

       Portugal, Brazil, and Algarve (the southern edge of Portugal).
       Brazil also opened its ports to Bonapartist immigrants, including republican-minded scientists, architects,
       artisans, freemasons, engineers, painters, and officers who crossed the Atlantic with their liberal books and
       ideas intending to settle permanently in the new land. Under the sponsorship of King Joao VI, a group of
       Bonapartist artists and artisans, knowns as the French Artistic Mission, were invited to Brazil in March 1816 to
       establish an Arts and Crafts lyceum in Rio de Janeiro. The Lyceum later became the Academia Imperial de
       Belas-Artes under Emperor Pedro I. French painter Jean-Baptiste Debret, who had studied at France's
       prestigious Academie des beaux-arts, was part of the group. Debret developed in interest in the enslaved and
       Indigenous peoples and produced many lithographs and paintings depicting people and everyday life in
       Brazil. He also painted many portraits of the imperial court (Figure 8.19). After returning to France in 1831,
       Debret joined the Académie des beaux-arts. By the end of the decade, he had published three volumes of
       engravings: A Picturesque and Historic Voyage to Brazil, or the Sojourn of a French Artist in Brazil (Voyage
       pittoresque et historique au Brésil ou Séjour d'un artiste français au Brésil).

America. Nevertheless, rebellions within Brazil were suppressed with force. For instance, in 1817, Brazilians
from Pernambuco--a sugar-planting province on the northeastern coast--reacted to the arrest of a liberal
military officer by declaring the province an autonomous republic. King João VI quickly put a brutal end to
their experiment. He finally returned to Portugal in 1821, six years after Napoléon's fall, when the Cortes, the
Portuguese parliament, demanded his return.

Pedro I and Brazilian Independence

João left his son and heir Pedro I as prince regent in Rio de Janeiro, with instructions to preserve the family's
lineage and power. The talented twenty-three-year-old prince enthusiastically took to his duties. The Cortes
wanted to reduce Brazil to its former colonial status and ordered the dismantling of Rio's central government
structure. In January 1822, it commanded the prince to return, but Pedro sided with the Brazilians when they
asked him to stay. (This event became known as O Fico, from the Portuguese ficar, to remain.)
The intentions of the Cortes could now no longer be ignored, however, because they generated conflicts among
conservative and liberal factions in the Brazilian provinces. When the Brazilian elites rejected rule by Portugal,
Pedro took the final step. He broke with Portugal and on September 7, 1822, declared Brazilian independence
on the banks of the Ipiranga River in the province of São Paulo (Figure 8.20). This event became known as the
Grito do Ipiranga (Ipiranga Cry). Pedro I was acclaimed Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of
Brazil, and he was crowned in Rio de Janeiro with much pomp and ceremony.

At first, the Portuguese Cortes refused to recognize Brazil's independence, though away from the cities of Rio
de Janeiro and São Paulo and their adjoining provinces, few local juntas declared themselves in favor of
Portuguese rule. Determined to beat the Portuguese, Pedro I invited Thomas Cochrane, a former British naval
officer, to serve Brazil as first admiral and commander in chief (Figure 8.21).

       Commons, Public Domain)
       Cochrane was one of the most daring and successful naval captains of his day; the French called him "the Sea
       Wolf." After being struck off Britain's Navy List because of a financial scandal in 1814, he began a new career
       as a mercenary. In 1818, he organized the Chilean navy, and with José de San Martín he played a crucial role in
       securing Chile's independence and liberating coastal areas in Peru. He was living in semiretirement on his
       estate in Chile when Pedro I asked him to serve Brazil. Cochrane organized a small Brazilian naval squadron to
       block Portugal's access to Brazil's ports. His first success came with his blockade of Salvador, the main port of
       the province of Bahia. By preventing resupply of coastal cities and garrisons, Cochrane forced Portuguese
       fighting forces to abandon the northern provinces of Brazil by 1823. In 1825, the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro
       recognized Brazil's independence from Portugal.
       The presence of the Braganzas in Rio for thirteen years before independence had unified the nation, and
       Brazilians still looked to the royal court as a source of power and authority. Most educated citizens accepted
       the monarchy, with which they identified themselves, and nothing served better to end regional divisions than
       the external threat from Portugal. In May 1823, Pedro I summoned elected representatives from all provinces
       to come to Rio and draft the new empire's constitution. Most were Brazilian sons of the old landed aristocracy,
       and some had represented Brazil in the Portuguese Cortes, including the liberal José Bonifácio de Andrade e
       Silva, educated at Portugal's Coimbra University. The assembly drafted a document that sought balance among
       the executive, judiciary, and legislative branches of government but disagreed over slavery, the scope of
       citizenship, and civil rights. Although Pedro I favored the gradual abolition of slavery, Brazilians whose wealth
       came from sugar plantations were especially concerned that the institution not be interfered with.

                                                                                 THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT
        Women and the Fight for Independence

         Valued primarily for their sexual purity, domestic virtue, and Christian charity, women found their claims to
         political equality in Spanish and Portuguese America seriously limited. As a result, they responded in different
         ways to the struggle for independence, which pervaded every aspect of their lives. Poor women suffered
         disproportionately, and many made significant contributions to the cause, including taking up arms and even

commanding troops. The women depicted here are just some examples of those who fought for independence
and political power in the revolutionary period (Figure 8.22).

Born in Quito, Ecuador, in 1797, Manuela Sáenz de Vergara y Aizpuru was the illegitimate child of an Ecuadorian
mother and a Spanish aristocrat. In 1817 she married British citizen James Thorne, and in 1822 she met and fell
in love with Simón Bolívar. As a result, she left her husband and joined the fight for independence, becoming a
close collaborator of Bolívar and a fierce proponent of the revolutionary cause and women's rights. After she
prevented his assassination in 1828, Bolívar called her "libertadora del libertador" ("the woman who liberated
the Liberator"). After Bolívar's death in 1830, Sáenz ended her days running a tobacco shop in a fishing village on
the coast of Peru, where she died of diphtheria in 1856 and was buried in a common grave. However, with the
rise of feminism in the 1980s, she became a symbol and rallying point for a variety of liberation movements,
especially upon publication of The General in His Labyrinth by the award-winning Colombian novelist Gabriel
García Márquez.
Under the strict casta system of Spanish colonial rule, Juana Azurduy de Padilla, born in 1780 in what is today
the city of Sucre, Bolivia, was a mestiza. As a child, she had a close relationship with her White Spanish father,
who taught her to ride, shoot, and work the land alongside the Indigenous people who lived there. After
becoming orphaned as a teen, she went to a convent school to be educated, but she eventually returned to her
family's estate and married her neighbor Manuel Padilla, an influential politician with progressive views. Azurduy
and her husband became patriot guerrilla military leaders in 1809, joining the Army of the North in Upper Peru.
Azurduy was known for her ability to recruit and lead Indigenous people and eventually rose to the rank of
lieutenant colonel in 1816. At the time of her death, she was relatively unknown; however, today the Azurduy
province in the Chuquisaca Department is named for her.
The life of Maria Leopoldina of Austria was one of royal patronage and political influence. She married Dom
Pedro, later Emperor Pedro I, in 1817 and dedicated her energies to supporting the cultural and scientific
development of her adopted nation, Brazil, bringing the Austrian painter Thomas Ender and many others there. It
was after Pedro had read one of Leopoldina's letters that he enacted the Grito do Ipiranga. In her letter, she
urged him to defy Portugal and break away from it, saying, "Brazil under your guidance will be a great country.
320 8 · Revolutions in Latin America

         Brazil wants you as a monarch . . . Pedro, this is the most important of your life . . . . You have the support of all
         Brazil." Although Pedro I's autocratic methods of government and scandalous private affairs made her life
         difficult, Leopoldina was very popular among her Brazilian subjects and remained so even after her death in
         1826.

         One of those subjects was Maria Quitéria, born in 1792 in the province of Bahia. During the Brazilian War of
         Independence, Quitéria disguised herself as a man to serve in the Brazilian revolutionary army. Her superiors
         acknowledged her skills with weapons and military discipline, and even after her identity as a woman was
         discovered, she was allowed to continue fighting. She was "a lady as brave as honest," and in 1823, she was
         decorated by Dom Pedro I for her service. Maria Graham's Journal of a Voyage to Brazil mentions her as an
         "illiterate, but lively [person, who] has clear intelligence and acute perception. I think that if they educated her,
         she would become a notable personality. One observes nothing masculine in her conduct, rather she is of gentle
         and friendly manners." After serving in the war, Quitéria married Gabriel Brito and had one daughter, Luisa.
         Although she died forgotten and in poverty, today she is seen as a national heroine.

         In the aftermath of independence, some women wondered what the consequences of their participation in the
         cause would be: After all, if women had fought and died for independence, why did they not have the right to vote
         or run for office? But another century passed before they realized such gains.

           · Consider the role each of these women played in the fight for independence. How do you think their distinct
               backgrounds influenced the actions they took?

           · Why do you think several of these women died in relative obscurity? What can the later rediscovery of their
               legacies teach us?

       Pedro I's talents did not include the ability to deal with the legislature. When it attempted to limit the power of
       the emperor in the first constitution, he dissolved the assembly and finished writing the constitution himself,
       with the help of a small and select council. Acting as an autocrat, Pedro I issued a liberal constitution in 1824
       that ignored slavery and added a fourth branch of government, the moderator (moderador), to the executive,
       legislative, and judiciary. The moderator branch, which consisted of the emperor, empowered Brazil's ruler to
       oversee the three other branches and to "balance" them by resolving disagreements among them.

       Resentment of Pedro's autocratic tendencies persisted as he took no notice of slavery and made unpopular
       foreign-trade and financial decisions. When news of the July Revolution of 1830 in France, which toppled an
       autocratic king, reached Brazil, popular demonstrations broke out calling for the expulsion of the emperor. In
       April 1831, Pedro I abdicated in favor of his only son, the six-year-old Brazilian-born Pedro II, and sailed for
       Portugal to secure the throne for his daughter Maria. He never returned. His departure eliminated the
       dominant influence of Portuguese-born courtiers and traders in Brazilian society, completing the transition to
       full Brazilian independence.

      Nineteenth-Century Eyes on Latin America

       Latin American movements for independence sought to throw off the rule of mercantilist parent countries and
       an economic model that hindered the development of rapidly growing colonial states. The successful
       movements, led by well-educated elites, many times faced resistance from a majority race-mixed population
       that sided with the homeland. The lack of popular support forced the exploitive White creole minority, who
       feared the oppressed mixed-race majorities, to negotiate their successes at each step. Liberators like Bolívar,
       San Martín, Pedro I, and Iturbide received no significant assistance from outside sources and many times
       lacked a unified direction or strategy. They encountered problems of vast geographic distances and natural
       obstacles, as well as the economic and cultural isolation of the various regions they were trying to unite.

       Brazil's path to independence shows more continuity with its colonial legacy than that of any other Latin
       American country because, although it was free of Portuguese rule after 1822, it became not a republic but an

independent empire. The first emperor, Pedro I, was a prince of the Portuguese royal house and still an heir to
its throne. Moreover, Portuguese-born men continued to control trade and to hold positions of power in the
bureaucracy, the army, and the church. The conservative-liberal division dominated political life in imperial
Brazil and marked the conflicting interests and ideals of various economic groups. Independence did not
provoke major changes in the area's colonial socioeconomic structures. The new Brazilian constitutional
monarchy simply regularized the status quo.

The movement for Latin American independence sparked great outside interest in the region, and this
curiosity fostered both foreign travel and writing. It was often through such accounts that people in the United
States and Europe learned about South America. Ordinarily, nineteenth-century European women did not
travel for pleasure; tourism is a twentieth-century invention. When Maria Dundas Graham Calcott came to
South America with her navy officer husband in the 1820s, she was governess to Pedro I's daughter, the future
queen of Portugal Princess Maria da Glória. Graham's diaries from 1821 to 1823 therefore shed a unique light
on the Brazilian court during the independence process. Her accounts also reveal her wide-ranging interest in
people's lives in both Brazil (Salvador and Rio de Janeiro) and Chile (Santiago). In Chile, Graham studied
science and botany with her family's friend, the former British navy officer Thomas Cochrane.

Though her reports were produced for the enlightenment and entertainment of her contemporaries, today
they yield insights into gender relations in the newly independent South American nations as well as into
Graham's own elite circles in the early nineteenth century. Her interest was in "suitable" subjects like fashion
and motherhood that related to the lives of Brazilian women. Public areas of activity were largely male, and her
diaries show that female foreign observers like herself remained outsiders. Graham was an urban elite woman
with a Protestant background whose discourse stressed civilized English customs and behaviors as a model for
the world. But despite that bias, or perhaps even because of it, through her perception of private aspects of
Brazilian women's lives, her accounts reveal much about public events in South American society as well as
her own models of femininity. Her travel narrative is a window into how she saw nineteenth-century Brazilian
women shape their lives and their environment.

Section Summary

8.1 Revolution for Whom?

The revolutionary examples of the United States and France encouraged creole elites in the Spanish American
colonies to dream of independence. These educated people of European ancestry had been born in the
Americas and resented both the political power held by the peninsulares and Spain's economic restrictions.
The overthrow of the Spanish monarchy by the French gave creoles the opportunity to participate in local self-
governing bodies called juntas, and some were delegates to meetings of the Spanish Cortes, a national
parliament that produced a short-lived constitution. This not only reawakened their desire for independence
and self-government, but it also showed them that it was possible.

8.2 Spanish North America

In the first few decades of the nineteenth century, two waves of revolutionary fervor swept New Spain. In 1816,
Miguel Hidalgo proclaimed Mexico's independence from Spain with the Grito de Dolores and led a largely
Indigenous and mestizo army to overthrow the colony's government. However, Hidalgo's call for widespread
social reforms and the violence of his followers led creoles to desert both his movement and the calls of his
successor José Maria Morelos for social equality.

The second wave was more successful. Following the adoption of liberal reforms by the Spanish government,
Mexican creoles sought independence in order to retain the privileges their status granted them. In 1821,
Agustín de Iturbide proclaimed the Plan de Iguala, which declared Mexico's independence and transformed
the country into a constitutional monarchy with protections for the Catholic Church and guarantees of social
equality. Iturbide allied himself with Vicente Guerrero, the leader of Indigenous and mixed-race rebels, to form
the victorious Army of the Three Guarantees. Iturbide became Mexico's first emperor in 1822, but in 1823 he
abdicated, and Mexico became a republic.

8.3 Spanish South America

Venezuela's junta declared its independence from Spain in 1811. In 1812, however, resistant conservative
White Venezuelans were aided by mixed-race people who resented liberal creole privileges and remained loyal

to the Spanish Crown. Following Fernando VII's return to the Spanish throne, Spanish troops joined local
royalist forces to fight the Venezuelan patriots being led by Simón Bolívar. By promising to abolish slavery,
Bolívar won the help of Haiti's president Alexandre Pétion. He also relied heavily on the mixed-race llaneros.
Bolívar's troops liberated the territories that became Gran Colombia (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador). The
Congress of Cúcuta that formed to govern Gran Colombia provided for the gradual abolition of slavery and
granted voting rights to property-owning men.

In the south, the Viceroyalty of Río de la Plata (modern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay) proclaimed
independence from Spain in 1816. The Argentine general José de San Martín then led troops through the
Andes to assist Bernardo O'Higgins of Chile. Both San Martín and Bolívar led forces into Peru, the last royalist
stronghold, where royalist troops were forced to accept amnesty.

8.4 Portuguese South America

In 1807, when French forces attempted to invade Portugal, the Portuguese royal family and their court fled to
Brazil. João VI, the former prince regent, ruled from Rio de Janeiro as head of the government in exile. In 1821,
he returned to Portugal, leaving his son Pedro I to rule Brazil. When the Portuguese Cortes ordered Pedro I to
return to Europe, he refused, and on September 7, 1822, he declared Brazil independent of Portugal. With the
assistance of Thomas Cochrane, he defeated Portugal's military forces.

Pedro I wrote a constitution for Brazil that while providing for independent legislative and judiciary branches,
preserved the bulk of political power for the emperor in his role as "moderator" between the other branches of
government. Following the July Revolution in France in 1830, Brazilians called for the autocratic Pedro I to
abdicate his throne, which he did in favor of his son Pedro II in April 1831.

of energy and churned out ever-larger numbers of manufactured goods. In their quest for profit and power, the
industrialized nations sought access to new markets and inexpensive sources of raw materials. Their desire for
resources led them to seize territory in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, ignoring the rights of the people there and
costing the lives of millions. Even as large and established a nation as China was not inviolable, and the
European nations carved spheres of influence from it just as they did in other regions of the world (Figure 9.1).

9.1 The Second Industrial Revolution

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the technological innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution
  · Describe the spread of industrialization beyond western and central Europe and the United States
  · Explain the obstacles to industrialization facing countries in Asia, North Africa, and Latin America

      in the nineteenth century
Great Britain was the first nation to enter the Industrial Revolution, beginning to mechanize the production of
goods in the eighteenth century. It was followed by the United States, France, Belgium, and, in the first half of
the nineteenth century, by Germany. These nations harnessed the power first of water and then of steam and
began the mass production of goods such as textiles, iron, and steel. Perhaps most significantly, they also
manufactured machines that produced parts for other machines, such as spinning jennies and flying shuttles.
Developments in transportation and communications technology, especially the locomotive, steamboat, and
telegraph, transformed the way their citizens lived, traveled, and worked.
Between the middle of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, these nations embarked on a
new phase of industrialization. European and U.S. industry was transformed again by new sources of power,
technological innovations, new forms of transportation, and growing communications networks. This process
is often called the Second Industrial Revolution. At the same time, industrialization began outside the United
States and western and central Europe, especially in Russia and Japan.

The Expansion and Transformation of Technology

Many developments of the Second Industrial Revolution built on or improved earlier technology. Mass
production of steel, for example, had begun with the development of the Bessemer process in the 1850s. This
innovation removed impurities from molten pig iron, producing stronger steel better suited to building rail
lines and machines. Later engineers further improved the process. The open-hearth Siemens-Martin process,
330 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       first developed in Germany in the 1860s, was slower than the Bessemer process, but it produced higher-quality
       steel that was less brittle. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the Siemens-Martin process had become
       the most common way of manufacturing steel. The mass production of steel made possible the great
       engineering feats of the Second Industrial Revolution, such as the first skyscrapers and the expansion of
       railroads (Figure 9.4).

       FIGURE 9.4 A British Steelworks. The Second Industrial Revolution was built on steel. Shown here in a British
       image made before 1877, the Barrow Hematite Steelworks in Lancashire, England, was then the world's largest
       producer of steel. (credit: "Steelworks at Barrow-in-Furness, 1877" by Unknown/University of Strathclyde project/
       Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Improvements in steel manufacturing enabled other innovations. As rust-resistant steel became less
       expensive, more could be used to manufacture rail lines, making them heavier, stronger, and able to support
       heavier locomotives pulling heavier loads. Railroads expanded across the United States and Europe, carrying
       more freight and passengers.
       Other inventions also made railroads more efficient. The air brake, invented by George Westinghouse in 1869,
       sent compressed air through a line to enable the train's engineer to apply brakes from the locomotive. Before
       this, trains had been braked by workers who jumped from one moving car to the next and applied the brakes
       manually. The method was obviously very dangerous, and if a train car broke free, there was no way of
       stopping it. Because trains could now be stopped more safely, they could also travel at higher speeds.
       By the end of the nineteenth century, railroads had become a common way of transporting people and
       products over land across distances long and short. Two new modes of transportation vied with railroads for
       popularity. The first modern bicycle, the safety bicycle, was developed by John Kemp Starley of England in
       1885 and sported two wheels of equal size, unlike earlier bicycles with oversized front wheels that required
       riders to perch far above the ground. The safety bicycle could be ridden by anyone, including women and
       children. Developments in rubber-production technology also improved the bicycle. The process of

vulcanizing rubber, discovered by American inventor Charles Goodyear in 1839, made it stronger and better
able hold its shape under extremes of temperature. (Non-vulcanized rubber melts in the heat and shatters in
the cold.) In 1887, Scottish-born inventor John Boyd Dunlop made a pressurized air-filled pneumatic tire from
vulcanized rubber, just in time for use by bicycle and automobile manufacturers. Although pneumatic tires
had been invented earlier, Dunlop's was the first practical tire to be mass produced, and he patented his
invention in 1888. By the 1890s, bicycling had become popular in Europe and the United States, and tens of
thousands of people rode daily.
Eventually eclipsing both the train and the bicycle in popularity in the United States and western and central
Europe was the gasoline-fueled automobile, patented by the German Karl Benz in 1886 and marketed
beginning in 1888 (Figure 9.5). Within a few decades, the automobile had transformed the world as few other
inventions have. Cities and suburbs could expand beyond the reach of rail lines, leading city and national
governments to raise taxes to pay for new roads. New businesses that sold and repaired cars replaced
blacksmiths and stables. City traffic grew noisier and more dangerous, and autos added their exhaust to the
emissions of factory smokestacks. The automobile industry also increased the demand for rubber and
petroleum, which most industrialized nations needed to import. Even though the United States was initially
able to satisfy its petroleum demands with domestic oil, it had to look elsewhere for rubber.

FIGURE 9.5 The First Automobile. This 1885 photo shows the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, the first automobile sold
to consumers. It was a few more decades before automobiles came to resemble the cars we drive today. (credit:

The automobile's arrival depended on another crucial invention--the internal combustion engine. This engine
generates power by burning fuel, often some form of petroleum, in the presence of oxygen in a chamber, to
produce a gas whose high pressure exerts force on another component such as a piston, rotor, or turbine blade,
causing it to move. Internal combustion engines powered automobiles as well as machinery in small
workshops, offering an alternative where steam engines, which were large, could not easily fit.
Internal combustion did not become the sole source of energy that powered the Second Industrial Revolution,
however. It did not completely replace steam or the horse. Indeed, the steam turbine, invented by Sir Charles
Parsons in 1884, provided efficient power for river- and ocean-going vessels. Steam was also used to generate
electricity, one of the great developments of the Second Industrial Revolution. Burning coal turned water to
steam that moved the blades of turbines, which generated electric current. Parsons's steam turbine served this
332 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       purpose in Britain and the United States. Water power also generated electricity; in 1882, the first world's
       hydroelectric plant opened in Appleton, Wisconsin. Wind turbines also generated electricity, and in 1911 Italy
       built a plant to produce electricity from geothermal power. By the end of the century, electricity was the
       dominant force powering the factories of industrialized nations.
       Electricity ran machines in factories and lit streets, workplaces, and homes following the invention of the
       incandescent light bulb, by Joseph Swan in Britain in 1878 and Thomas Edison in the United States in 1879.
       The incandescent bulb's bright light replaced the dim and often odorous illumination of oil and gas lamps that
       brought the risk of fire and, in the case of gas, of suffocation and explosions. Electric lighting made it possible
       for factories to operate far into the night.
       Communications technology improved when the first transatlantic telegraph line between Great Britain and
       North America was completed in 1858, and by the end of the century all the world's continents were connected
       except Antarctica. The telephone, patented by American inventor Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, spread
       throughout Europe and North America during the same time, greatly easing business communications. In
       1901, the Italian engineer Guglielmo Marconi successfully transmitted a wireless signal across the Atlantic
       Ocean from Wales to Newfoundland, Canada. He then founded broadcasting stations in Europe and North
       America and used them to send communications to ships at sea. In the 1920s, once the vacuum tube and the
       triode had been developed, commercial radio that broadcast news, music, and radio plays became available as
       well.
       Other discoveries transformed the factory and the home. Chemical experimentation produced synthetic
       aniline dyes yielding textile colors more intense and vibrant than those from plant dyes, transforming
       fashions. Along with combine harvesters, mechanical seeders, and horse-drawn machines that reaped,
       gathered, and winnowed grain in one operation, chemical fertilizers enabled farmers to grow ever-larger
       crops. Another invention, barbed wire, helped cattle ranchers protect their herds. Refrigerated rail cars were
       perfected in the 1870s by engineers working for U.S. meat packer Gustavus Swift. The meat and other foods
       being produced in increasing quantities could now be shipped great distances without spoiling.

       Industrial Revolution in Britain.

       Other inventions made office workers more productive. Typewriters and adding machines were common by
       the 1880s, and New York jeweler Willard Legrand Bundy patented the time clock in 1888. Upon arriving at or
       leaving work, employees inserted a card in the machine, which stamped it with the exact time and led to the
       expression "punching the clock."
       New technology also changed leisure activities. In 1877, Edison patented the phonograph, a machine that
       could record sound by tracing soundwaves with a stylus on a rotating disc or cylinder and then play it back.
       Although it had business applications, the phonograph was soon used for entertainment. Phonograph
       recordings were often combined with the projection of still photographic images to create audiovisual
       presentations, the forerunners of motion pictures (Figure 9.6).

Photographic technology advanced in the first half of the nineteenth century, enabling people to permanently
record images with a camera. In the late nineteenth century, a number of people began taking multiple
photographs of objects or people in motion and replaying them quickly to give the impression of movement. A
patent for a machine to do this was filed by English inventor Wordsworth Donisthorpe in 1876, and a variety of
photographers and inventors tried to perfect the process in the following years. The most famous experiment
was made in 1878 by English photographer Eadweard Muybridge, who photographed running horses and
replayed the images on a machine he called the Zoopraxiscope. Following the invention of photographic film
by New York native George Eastman in 1884, light-sensitive cameras captured images on strips of paper
coated with gelatin. In 1887, French inventor Louis Le Prince patented a motion-picture camera that relied on
photographic film and used it to record the first movie still in existence: a scene, only a few seconds long, of
people walking in a garden in England. The age of cinema had been born, but it was some time before recorded
sound and moving images were synchronized.

         public screening by the Cinématographe Lumière, an apparatus developed by brothers Auguste and Louis
         Lumière that both recorded and projected moving pictures. At this event, held on December 28, 1895, at the
         Grand Café in central Paris, ten one-minute films were shown, including La Sortie de l'usine Lumière à Lyon
         (Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory), Le Repas de bébé (Baby's Breakfast), and L'Arroseur arrosé (The
         Sprinkler Sprinkled), a comedy about a gardener watering his garden. One of their most successful early films
         was L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat (The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat). Only fifty seconds long, it shows a
         train pulling into the station of a small French town near Marseille.

         In attendance at the early demonstrations of the Cinématographe were engineer and inventor Léon Gaumont and
         his secretary Alice Guy, who became the world's first female filmmaker, producing more than four hundred films
         at the Gaumont studio. Georges Méliès also attended; his short film Le Voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon)
         (1902) is considered the first science fiction movie. At the start of the twentieth century, the French company
         Pathé Frères produced more films than any other company in the world.

         Thomas Edison was a pioneer in the U.S. film industry, and his studios turned out many silent short films in the
         early twentieth century. One of them was an action picture called The Great Train Robbery (https://openstax.org/
         l/77GreatTrain) that was made by Edwin S. Porter in 1903. Just over eleven minutes long, it was based on a stage
         play and is one of many early films featuring trains.

      Industrial Frontiers

       Until the mid-nineteenth century, industrialization had taken place only in Britain, the United States, France,
       Germany, and Belgium. By the middle of the century, other countries like Canada, Italy, and Russia had also
       begun to industrialize.
       Canada

       Industrialization in Canada, then under British rule, began in the 1850s in the population centers of Toronto
       and Montreal. As in the United States and Britain, early factories produced textiles and metal goods. Brewing
       and the milling of flour were also industrialized. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Canadian
       entrepreneurs began the mass production of steel, established meat-packing companies, and invested in the
       extraction of natural resources such as timber, coal, and oil.

       In 1867, to facilitate national defense and build a transcontinental railroad, the British Parliament passed the
       British North American Act, joining its colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada
       (which included Ontario and Quebec) in the Dominion of Canada. The Dominion had the right to govern itself,
       but it remained within the British Empire with Queen Victoria as its head of state.

       Two years later, the Dominion purchased the territory of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company for
       the railroad. Rupert's Land was inhabited largely by Métis, people of mixed First Nations and French ancestry

who were largely French-speaking and Roman Catholic. Fearing the loss of their land and culture under the
Dominion's English-speaking Protestant majority, many Métis united under the leadership of Louis Riel to
oppose the Canadian government's attempts to survey Rupert's Land. Riel formed a provisional government to
negotiate with Canada, demanding protection for Métis rights, especially the right to establish French-
language schools for children. After a brief outbreak of violence, Canada's Parliament granted the Métis
200,000 hectares of land, incorporated into the Dominion as the new province of Manitoba in 1870 (Figure
9.7).

The Dominion of Canada reached the Pacific in 1871, when British Columbia agreed to join it if a railroad
connecting eastern and western Canada were built within ten years. The Canadian Pacific Railroad,
constructed largely by European and Chinese immigrants, was completed in 1885. It enabled the settling of the
prairie provinces in the middle of the country and aided Canada's industrialization.
Industrialization was also assisted by the National Policy, begun in 1878 under Prime Minister John A.
Macdonald and lasting until World War II. It imposed taxes on imports, some as high as 20 percent, to shield
Canadian industry from competition by U.S. companies. While the policy did help Canadian businesses grow,
residents of the west argued that the tariffs generated wealth for industrialized eastern provinces like Quebec
and Ontario while maintaining artificially high prices for domestic goods in the prairie provinces.
336 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       Italy
       Italy industrialized after other western and central European nations such as France and Germany. The
       fragmented political system of the Italian peninsula before its unification as a single nation (which began in
       1861) delayed general industrial development. After unification (completed in 1871 with the incorporation of
       Rome and Veneto), the government was dominated by northern Italians and invested in northern industries.
       From the 1890s to the 1910s, steelworks, shipyards, rubber plants, and factories producing canned food,
       machine tools, chemicals, cement, and automobiles were established north of Rome. Agricultural production
       in northern provinces such as Emilia-Romagna was also modernized and mechanized, freeing peasants from
       the land to work in the new factories. The Italian government imposed high tariffs on imported goods to
       protect northern industry.
       South of Rome, with the exception of Naples, little industrial development took place. Southern Italy and the
       island of Sicily remained rural and agricultural. As the north grew wealthier and more urbanized, the south
       grew poorer and more depopulated as peasants left to seek opportunities abroad.
       Russia
       Russia had begun industrializing in the early nineteenth century, as Russian entrepreneurs imported textile
       manufacturing equipment from Britain to create cotton cloth. The tsars were eager to use new technology to
       unite their empire and offered cash incentives to European and American business leaders willing to assist.
       With their help, Russia established steamship lines, and as early as 1820 steamships were regularly traveling
       the Volga River, Russia's main waterway. By 1851, Moscow was joined by rail with St. Petersburg, the nation's
       capital and home of the tsar (Figure 9.8).

       FIGURE 9.8 The Russian Railroad. A lithograph from the 1840s shows the first train arriving in Tsarkoye Selo, a

       Nevertheless, Russia remained relatively unindustrialized compared to the United States and much of western

                                                                                                                                      9.1 · The Second Industrial Revolution 337

and central Europe. This became apparent when Russia lost the Crimean War in 1856, despite having a
population larger than that of its opponents Britain and France and despite fighting the war in its own
backyard while the enemy traveled more than a thousand miles by sea. Britain's and France's steamships
provided better transportation than Russia's few roads and railroads did, and their factories produced more
and better weapons.

Despite its size and the support of its tsars, Russia lacked many advantages for industrializing that other
countries possessed. It did not have many artisans, and mechanization of production means little in a country
without crafts to be mechanized. So long as peasant families were available to plant and harvest crops, there
was no pressing need to mechanize agriculture either. Russia's population also consisted of many serfs who,
unlike American and British farmers, were bound to the land and could not seek opportunities elsewhere such
as in factories. Many Russians found it easier to profit by shipping raw materials such as grain, timber, and
hemp to the industrializing nations of western Europe than to build a manufacturing sector of their own.

Finally, Russia's sheer size made industrialization difficult. Its rich natural resources were widely separated
and far from the cities in which factories were located. To allow access, thousands of miles of roads and
railroad lines needed to be constructed through the dense tracts of uninhabited forests, over raging rivers, and
across the frozen tundra that covered much of the country. The United States, which industrialized relatively
early, is also large, but not as large as Russia. The workers who laid railroad lines to connect its Atlantic and
Pacific coasts worked across easy terrain of largely flat, treeless prairie and plains. In Russia, the few railroad
and steamship lines and the few thousand miles of roads constructed before the end of the nineteenth century
were not enough to bring natural resources to factories or manufactured goods to the countryside.

Following its defeat in the Crimean War, Russia increased its efforts to industrialize. In 1861, it abolished
serfdom, providing potential workers for factories. In the 1890s, Minister of Finance Sergei Witte successfully
lobbied for improvements in Russia's railway system, which at the end of the Crimean War had had fewer than
one thousand miles of track. In 1891, the construction of a rail line across Siberia was begun. By 1900, the
country had approximately thirty-six thousand miles of track. Soon it became easier to exploit the interior's
vast reserves of iron, wood, and coal. However, Russia's late start meant it did not reach the same level of
industrialization as western and central Europe and the United States until the twentieth century.

Industrialization conveyed a great advantage. Once a country had begun the process, it was capable of
generating even more wealth and building larger, more technologically advanced military forces, which
enabled it to gain an advantage over non-industrialized countries. It became nearly impossible for non-
industrialized countries to compete with industrialized ones or even to protect themselves from aggression by
their industrialized rivals. Japan proved an exception.

Japan

In July 1853, U.S. commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Edo (Tokyo) Bay at the head of a fleet of four gunships,
charged with negotiating diplomatic relations and trade agreements with Japan. Japan had largely closed itself
off in the 1600s to avoid colonization and domination by western countries. The Japanese also wished to
protect their cultural integrity, and warding off foreign influences was part of this strategy. Intent upon
securing entry, Perry ordered his ship's guns to turn toward the shore and fire. The guns fired blanks, but the
Japanese military did not know this. Talks between Perry and the Japanese government ensued, and on March
31, 1854, Japan signed the Convention of Kanagawa, which opened the ports of Shimoda and Hakotate to
American ships, promised assistance for American ships and sailors shipwrecked on Japanese coasts, granted
American merchants permission to purchase provisions in Japan, and promised peaceful and friendly
relations between the United States and Japan. Lacking the military power to resist Perry's demands, the
Japanese government had no choice but to agree.

Japan was then governed by the Tokugawa shogunate, a system in which a military leader, the shogun, ruled
in place of the emperor, whose role had largely been that of a figurehead for hundreds of years. Under the
338 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       shogunate, aristocratic lords who were subordinate to the shogun, called daimyo, and their retainers,
       members of a warrior elite called the samurai, governed the country. After Perry's arrival, modernizers in
       Japan, remembering the American gunboats and China's humbling by Britain's navy in the first of the Opium
       Wars (1839-1842), believed the best way to protect their country was to adopt the technology and institutions
       of the west. They saw the shogunate as a barrier to modernization, so they called for the emperor to resume
       rule. Many samurai were not convinced by these arguments. Not only would industrialization elevate "inferior"
       craftspeople and merchants, who were far below them in the social hierarchy, but the shogunate's end would
       deprive them of power and influence.
       In January 1867, Emperor Meiji (Figure 9.9) ascended the throne following the death of his father. In
       November, the reigning shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu resigned and relinquished his power, and in January
       1868 the emperor officially proclaimed the end of the shogunate. The period called the Meiji Restoration was
       underway. In 1869, the daimyo surrendered their titles and their land to the emperor. Although the daimyo
       were allowed to remain governors of their former lands, the samurai were no longer their retainers. Instead,
       they worked for the state. In 1871, the daimyo were removed as governors, and they and the samurai were
       given yearly stipends.

       Even further indignities awaited those who had once held power in Japan, however. The government stipends
       given to daimyo and samurai were made subject to taxation in 1873, and beginning in 1876 they were
       distributed in the form of government bonds. The Meiji government officially abolished class distinctions,
       which for the samurai meant the loss of privileges such as the right to wear swords. Although some rebelled,
       rising up against government forces several times in the 1870s, they were defeated by Japan's new national

army, equipped with modern weapons and trained in western methods of fighting.

Industrialization was a major goal of Japan's Meiji government, and the state played a greater role in it than in
most western countries in the nineteenth century. The first goal was to build railroads to unite the regions of
the country and assist in further industrial development. Construction began in 1870; by 1872, a rail line
linked the capital of Tokyo with the port of Yokohama. Perhaps remembering that Perry's demands had been
dictated from the deck of a gunboat, the government also invested heavily in shipbuilding.

The Mitsubishi Corporation, a private company founded by samurai Iwasaki Yatori, competed directly with the
government and, with its modern ships and efficient management, replaced it as the country's leading
shipbuilder and shipper. Seeking independence from western shipping lines, the government then turned
eleven ships over to Mitsubishi with the provision that it establish regular trade with China. In 1887, the
company purchased the government-owned shipyard in Nagasaki. Mitsubishi became one of Japan's first
zaibatsu, family-owned business conglomerates with financial and industrial branches influential in Japanese
politics.

Mitsubishi also invested heavily in coal mining. The Japanese government did so too and invested in lead, iron,
and copper mines, as well as in factories that manufactured weapons and cement. The government's
willingness to fund industries not crucial to military defense or industrial development was variable. The
textile industry, for example, relied less heavily on government support. Thus as Japan strove to build
battleships and railways and to modernize its army, textile companies continued to purchase mechanized
equipment from abroad.

The Japanese government abolished feudalism and gave peasant farmers title to their land, freeing them to
sell it and travel to cities for work in factories and shipyards if they wished. Those who remained on the land
were helped to increase Japan's food production by the government's importation of fertilizers and farm
equipment. The abolition of samurai status freed the warrior elite to use their skills as managers of factories.
As the samurai built private wealth, they invested in economic sectors that received less government support.
Textile production benefited greatly from this trend, as did brewing and the manufacture of glass and
chemicals.

Japan established a public school system in 1872. By 1900, attendance was nearly universal for boys, and girls
were not far behind. The new system stressed the study of both science and the Confucian classics. Japan also
sent students abroad to study technology and institutions in the United States and Europe.

By the end of the nineteenth century, Japan had become capable of competing with larger countries and was
eager to do so. It soon got the chance. In 1895, it successfully defeated non-industrialized China in the Sino-
Japanese War. In 1905, it defeated Russia and sent a clear message to the United States and Europe that it
intended to become a world power.

Obstacles to Industrialization

As the United States and European nations industrialized, African, Latin American, and Asian nations, with the
exception of Japan, did not. This left them at an economic, technological, and military disadvantage compared
to the countries of the industrialized world. Historians disagree about the reasons for this Great Divergence.
Some point to the fact that these nations lacked natural resources, such as abundant coal, that European
nations possessed. Many note that establishing colonies in the Americas and Asia helped nations like Britain
and France acquire capital, resources, and markets that assisted their industrial development. Thus Africa,
Asia, and Latin America became parties to unequal treaties forced on them by Europeans bearing deadlier
weapons.

A contrasting argument is that countries such as Egypt and the Latin American nations realized their strengths
lay in producing raw materials for the industrializing nations. Factors such as history, geography, climate, and
the nature of their labor forces better suited them to producing agricultural goods or other types of raw
340 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       materials than to pursuing widespread industrialization. In each nation, a unique set of circumstances
       influenced the path taken.
       India
       India's industrial endeavors were greatly affected by its relationship with Britain, which had begun trading in
       India in the 1600s. The Seven Years' War and the subsequent Treaty of Paris, signed in 1763, effectively
       brought French power in India to an end, paving the way for Britain's eventual control of the subcontinent. At
       this time, India possessed characteristics that seemed to make it an ideal candidate for industrialization. It had
       large merchant and artisan classes, which produced beautiful textiles highly valued in sixteenth- and
       seventeenth-century England. India was, in fact, the largest exporter of cotton cloth in the world by the middle
       of the eighteenth century. It was also wealthy, and the country's Mughal rulers had maintained ports, roads,
       and bridges that helped manufacturers and merchants bring goods to market.
       Britain, however, had no intention of allowing its colony to become its economic rival. Like all colonies, India
       was meant to enrich Britain, not compete with it. Thus began a process often referred to as
       deindustrialization, a reduction in a nation's or region's industrial activity. In the early eighteenth century,
       even before Britain had forced the French from India, the British Parliament passed the Calico Acts,
       prohibiting the importation of finished cotton textiles that could compete with the products of English
       weavers. India thus lost an important market for its goods and a source of revenue. Many weavers lost their
       jobs, reducing the number of workshops that could be mechanized later in the century. The destruction of the
       Indian textile industry only accelerated once British textile production became mechanized. Inexpensive
       mass-produced British cloth flooded Indian markets, underpricing local weavers and driving them out of
       business.
       India's economy was not completely destroyed by the British presence, however, and Indian entrepreneurs
       invested in industrial development. For example, Dwarkanath Tagore, a member of a wealthy Hindu family,
       founded a bank and purchased hand-manufacturing operations (Figure 9.10). Eager to work with the British,
       he pooled his money with that of British investors to open India's first coal mine in 1834 and to build sugar
       refineries and textile factories. Other Indians also invested in such ventures, especially cloth production.
       Indeed, at the time Britain entered the Second Industrial Revolution, Indian textile factories were successfully
       competing with British ones selling cloth in China.

FIGURE 9.10 Dwarkanath Tagore. Indian industrialist Dwarkanath Tagore invested in coal mines and textile
factories. He was also a partner in a company that traded opium to China. (credit: "Dwarkanath Tagore" by

Ultimately, though, Indian textiles could not compete with British products on price. One part of the Indian
economy that Britain did encourage was cash-crop agriculture. Small farmers unable to pay British taxes were
evicted from their lands, which were combined with others and transformed into cotton plantations. The loss
of food-producing land in the late eighteenth century led to devastating famines that killed some thirty million
people. Thus India was transformed from a manufacturing nation into an export economy, producing
primarily raw materials such as cotton but also tea and sugar for use by the British and opium for the British to
sell in China.
Egypt
A similar process of deindustrialization took place in Egypt, but there British influence was only one of the
reasons. In 1805, Muhammad Ali, an Albanian army commander in the service of the Ottoman Empire, gained
control of Egypt with the assistance of Egyptian political and religious leaders and replaced the viceroy who
had governed on behalf of the Ottoman sultan Selim III. In 1811, Muhammad Ali won Egypt's effective
(although not formal) independence from the Ottoman Empire by defeating the Mamluks, the ruling dynasty of
formerly enslaved soldiers who had guarded the country for the Ottomans. To reinforce his authority, he
adopted the title khedive of Egypt, a designation above a viceroy and only one step below the reigning sultan.
As Egypt's new ruler, Muhammad Ali set out to modernize it. He encouraged the peasantry to grow cotton
during the winter months, when they were not growing food crops, and sold the cotton to Britain. He used the
profits to modernize Egypt's army, purchase ships for a modern navy, build irrigation systems to grow more
cotton, and establish a weapons foundry. He reformed Egypt's educational system, built a military college, and
founded a medical college for women. He built paper mills, sugar refineries, and textile factories using
imported European machinery and technicians. Under Muhammad Ali's rule, Egyptian landowners prospered.
Peasants, however, resented both the forced labor system employed in many construction projects and
conscription into the army. Many ran away or deliberately crippled themselves to avoid them.
342 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       Muhammad Ali also used his army to expand his domains. He seized the western part of the Arabian Peninsula
       and most of Sudan as well as Crete and Syria (Figure 9.11). Alarmed by his military success, the Ottoman
       sultan called upon the European powers for assistance. Faced with a blockade of the Nile by the British and
       Austrians, Muhammad Ali was forced at the Convention of London in 1840 to reduce his army, dissolve his
       navy, and give up all the territory he had claimed except Egypt and Sudan. In exchange he won the right to
       establish hereditary rule for his family in Egypt.

       FIGURE 9.11 Egypt Under the Rule of Muhammad Ali's Family. Under the rule of Muhammad Ali's family, Egypt
       temporarily extended its power into the Sudan and what are now Saudi Arabia and Syria. (credit: modification of
       work "Map of Egypt under Muhammad Ali Dynasty in English" by Don-kun, Eric Gaba/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY
       3.0)
       The European powers also interfered with Muhammad Ali's efforts to industrialize. In the 1838 Treaty of Balta
       Liman with Britain, the Ottoman Empire agreed to abolish monopolies and reduce import taxes on British-
       and French-made goods, making them cheaper than those produced in Egypt. Lacking coal to power steam
       engines, Egypt's factories also could not rapidly produce enough goods to satisfy Egyptian demand. Although
       Egypt's manufacturing sector faltered, agriculture boomed, with ready buyers for its sugar and cotton.
       Needing tax revenues to pay for its military and for foreign imports, the government promoted the growing of

cash crops for sale to Europe, and Egypt found itself locked into the role of an export economy.

Latin America

The nations of Latin America also became export economies. Now freed from Spanish and Portuguese control,
they were eager to industrialize but faced a variety of obstacles. At the beginning of the nineteenth century,
Brazil had imported steam engines and developed facilities for sugar refining, coffee processing, and textile
production. Paraguay built an iron foundry and established a steamship line. Chile opened coal mines and
built sawmills and flour mills. Many countries also built rail lines. However, they did not become heavily
industrialized; consequently, their development took another path.

Ironically, independence was part of the problem. When Spain and Portugal regulated their economies, Latin
American merchants had chafed at restrictions, but these regulations had also heavily taxed foreign-made
goods, which protected local handicraft industries. Now that merchants could trade with any countries they
wished, however, goods made in Europe and the United States flooded in. Like India and Egypt, Latin American
countries quickly found their own manufactured goods could not be made or sold as cheaply as imports. They
also could not make enough to supply internal demand. As Brazilians and Chileans watched, their silver flowed
overseas instead of being spent at home.

Latin Americans quickly realized that they would be more successful at continuing to grow sugar and coffee,
products that had been the bases of the colonial economy and were still in high demand, than they would be at
attempting to compete with foreign manufacturers. Later in the nineteenth century, Brazil produced rubber
for the same reasons, using its abundant land and large agricultural workforce to supply raw materials for
industrialized nations. Although these decisions made sense to planters and politicians, they nevertheless
locked Spain's and Portugal's former colonies into providing raw materials that did not command as high a
price as the finished products made from them.

Thus, though Latin Americans sold large amounts of cash crops to the United States and Europe, enriching the
planter class, their earnings never exceeded (or even equaled) what they paid for imports. This disparity had a
negative effect on Latin American society. Wealthy plantation owners and urban professionals could afford the
factory-made products of other continents, but agricultural laborers could not, accentuating the class divide.
Furthermore, many of the industrial improvements that Latin American countries did make, like the
construction of mines and railroads, were funded by European and U.S. banks, and much necessary
equipment, like steam engines and other machinery, was imported from Europe, leaving little money at home
for domestic projects like building roads and telegraph lines. Regional wars in the nineteenth century also
destabilized South America and interfered with industrialization. For example, from 1864 to 1870, Paraguay
battled the united forces of Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina in the War of the Triple Alliance. By the time the war
ended, it and infectious diseases had killed much of Paraguay's population.

Thus a variety of forces combined to make Latin America's attempts to industrialize largely unsuccessful, and
the region remained primarily an exporter of cash crops. Although railroads were built, they tended to be short
lines linking the interior to the coast, enabling the export of raw materials. No national rail networks developed
like they did in the United States and Europe, and electrification took place only in major cities.

China

China also did not become an industrial power in the nineteenth century, despite its population, wealth,
natural resources, and tradition of innovation and invention. Historians have offered a variety of reasons.

First, no challengers in East Asia could match China in size, wealth, and military strength, so it had no need to
compete with anyone. Second, because China's population was large and often poor, labor was abundant and
employers did not have to offer high wages to attract employees or replace workers with labor-saving
machinery. Also, unlike in Europe, most coal deposits in China were located far from population and
manufacturing centers. Coal provided the most efficient means of powering steam engines in factories and
344 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       was crucial to the development of railroads.
       China had also been weakened by military defeats and internal rebellion. Britain won the First Opium War
       (1839-1842), gaining control over Hong Kong and five other ports: Guangzhou, Shanghai, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and
       Xiamen. In 1844, China also signed treaties with France and the United States, giving them the right to trade in
       the five open ports and build Christian churches in and send missionaries to China. China's loss to Britain in
       the Second Opium War (1856-1860) led to the signing of the Treaty of Tianjin, which gave Britain, France, the
       United States, and Russia further rights to trade and establish diplomatic posts in the capital of Beijing. China
       refused to honor the treaty, however, and British and French troops invaded Beijing in 1860, looting and
       burning the imperial Old Summer Palace (Figure 9.12). The subsequent Convention of Beijing affirmed the
       Treaty of Tianjin.

       FIGURE 9.12 A Casualty of the Opium Wars. Most of the Old Summer Palace, the residence of the Qing emperors,
       was looted and destroyed by British and French soldiers in October 1860. Treasures they carried off are now in
       museums around the world. (credit: "Old summer palace ruin" by "Clee7903"/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       China's defeat in the Opium Wars began what the Chinese have called "the century of humiliation." In accord
       with the Treaty of Tianjin, six million taels (a unit of currency) of Chinese silver that might otherwise have
       been invested in business enterprises flowed to the victorious foreigners as compensation for damages
       sustained. This demonstration of the Qing 's military weakness plus other grievances such as high
       unemployment and failure to maintain the crucially important Grand Canal, which transported food stuffs
       from south to north, led to numerous uprisings and outbreaks of violence directed at the reigning dynasty.
       Internal rebellion also weakened China. In December 1850, the Taiping Rebellion began when Qing troops
       tried to force the followers of a man named Hong Xiuquan from their stronghold in Guangxi province in the
       south. Hong, a village schoolteacher, had come to believe he was the son of the Christian God and the brother
       of Jesus. Rejecting both Qing authority and Confucian tradition, he spread his religious teachings throughout
       southern China and gained a sizable following. In early 1851, after defeating some Qing forces, Hong Xiuquan
       proclaimed the Taiping Tianguo (Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace) with himself as king. He urged his
       followers to give up alcohol and opium and called for the overthrow of the Qing government. His promises of
       land and wealth for all attracted impoverished peasants, tribal minority groups, bandit gangs, and members of
       Chinese secret societies, some originally formed to restore the Ming dynasty.
       Hong Xiuquan's forces raged through southern China, seizing towns and cities and confiscating food, money,

and weapons. (Figure 9.13). In 1853, the populous southern city of Nanjing fell to the Taiping army and
became Hong Xiuquan's capital. Many died in the fighting, and the confiscation of foodstuffs led to famine. By
the time the Taiping Rebellion ended after Hong's death in 1864, an estimated twenty to thirty million Chinese
had died, and the south, China's most populous region, had been devastated.

9.2 Motives and Means of Imperialism

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the main reasons imperialism grew during the Second Industrial Revolution
  · Contrast late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century imperialism with that of earlier periods
  · Explain how industrial development helped some countries conquer and control others in the

      second half of the nineteenth century
Like a chain of falling dominoes, industrial development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
had many consequences, short and long term. To generate profits for themselves and their investors,
346 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       businesses needed to operate inexpensively and sell as many goods as possible. To keep costs and therefore
       prices low, they sought inexpensive raw materials. They also wanted markets in which to sell their finished
       goods, preferably without competing with others. The ships that transported raw materials and finished
       products required ports where they could refuel and resupply, as did the navies that kept them safe.
       To the industrial powers, these needs justified their practice of imperialism, that is, the policy of gaining direct
       or indirect control over parts of the world with low-cost resources and no competing mass-produced goods.
       Improved forms of transportation, communication, weaponry, and medicine made this control possible. As the
       industrialized nations came to dominate states in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, taking natural resources and
       money from them, they sent not only soldiers and administrators but also missionaries to introduce the
       inhabitants to Christianity and other aspects of western culture, often against their will.

      Raw Materials and Markets

       By the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution, new inventions and industrial processes demanded new
       raw materials, such as petroleum to fuel engines, natural rubber for valves and tires, palm oil for lubricating
       machinery, copper to conduct heat and electricity, silver for medicine and photography, and lead for pipes.
       Coal was in demand to transform iron into steel, to produce the gas that heated homes, and to generate the
       electricity that powered machines and lit streets and buildings. Not all the industrialized nations could
       produce enough to supply their increased needs.
       New fashions and tastes also created demand for foreign imports. Middle-class families in Europe and the
       United States wanted their daughters to play the piano and drove a market in ivory (from which piano keys
       were once made). The need for quick sources of energy for industrial workers fueled an increased demand for
       coffee, tea, and sugar. Elites and aspiring members of the middle class filled their homes with furniture of
       mahogany, rosewood, and ebony. Cotton textiles remained fashionable, but following the abolition of slavery in
       the United States, cloth manufacturers could no longer depend on an inexpensive supply of raw cotton.

                                                                                 THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT

        The Demand for Elephant Ivory

         In the nineteenth century, the demand in industrialized nations for pianos (and thus piano keys), hair combs and
         hairpins, handles for silverware, false teeth, letter openers, billiard balls, and other objects made of ivory
         employed thousands of people in the United States, especially in the lower Connecticut River Valley. Between
         1863 and 1929, one firm alone processed 100,000 elephant tusks (Figure 9.14). But the demand for ivory
         declined at the beginning of the twentieth century. Among other changes, radios and phonographs replaced
         pianos as the chief source of music in the home, and the call for instruments fell.

  they sold to European buyers. (credit: "Ivory trade, East Africa, 1880s/1890s" by Bassenge/Wikimedia

  There is still a demand for elephant ivory today. Although many governments have made the sale of ivory
  products illegal, people in Asia and the United States continue to purchase them, considering them fashionable
  or status symbols. Many believe that governments will take steps to prevent the extinction of elephant herds
  hunted for their tusks, and that purchasing a few small items will not cause serious harm. Demand for ivory has
  decreased in recent years, but elephant herds in some parts of Africa are still declining, and evidence suggests
  the animals are evolving to grow smaller tusks.
  The desire for elephant ivory is not the only consumer demand that threatens to harm the environment.
  Rainforests are cut to clear more land to raise cattle. The demand for gasoline has also led oil companies to drill
  beneath the ocean and seek access to protected wilderness areas.

    · Are you aware of other current consumer demands that could have similar effects on the natural
        environment? What are they?

    · Should we be held more responsible for the harm caused by our demands than the people of the nineteenth
        century, given that we are more aware of the consequences for the natural world? Why or why not?

The industrializing powers could satisfy their needs for raw materials and markets only by reaching outside
their borders to places in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Ocean. To amass large profits, however, they needed to
extract raw materials at such low prices that it was unlikely Africans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders would
consent to them. In addition, and also unlikely, these nations would have to agree to purchase manufactured
goods from their industrialized partners even though they might be able to produce such things for
348 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       themselves. Business owners and politicians in industrialized nations thus believed they needed to gain
       control over these distant countries and rule them as part of an empire. Quite often, military conquest was the
       means by which they did so. Once these foreign territories were secured, markets established, and funds
       invested, the imperial powers then needed to prevent encroachment on their possessions by other industrial
       powers. This led to them to exercise even greater control over their colonies and often to attempt to conquer
       neighboring regions. Great Britain, for example, competed with Russia for control of Afghanistan largely to
       limit Russian access to Britain's prize colony of India.

       The new colonies were quite different from those that European powers had established in the sixteenth and
       seventeenth centuries. It was not generally expected that large numbers of Europeans would relocate to Africa
       or Asia and make permanent homes there, and the colonies were not intended to have quite the same
       relationship to the home country that earlier "settler colonies" had had. The U.S. treatment of the Philippines
       and Filipinos was fundamentally different from what North American colonists had experienced from Great
       Britain, for example. The industrial nations intended to exploit the resources and people of the colonies they
       established, not settle them.

       There were some exceptions. The North African colony of Algeria, which France had taken control of in 1830,
       was incorporated as part of France in 1848. Many French people and other Europeans immigrated to the
       coastal regions of Algeria and Tunisia with government encouragement in the nineteenth century. Many
       Europeans also settled in the British and Dutch colonies in southern Africa. However, this was not the imperial
       norm.

      The Civilizing Mission

       On the heels of the soldiers who first opened countries in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific to agents of businesses
       came others seeking to bring what industrializing countries thought was valuable. Many from the United States
       and Europe considered it the duty of citizens from the industrialized--or as they phrased it, the
       "civilized"--world to bring the benefits of western culture to the conquered. According to social Darwinism, a
       theory then popular in Europe and the United States, some groups of people become stronger and more
       powerful because they are naturally superior. In this view, those of European ancestry could impose their will
       on others because they were innately "better" and their societies more advanced. Jules Ferry, the prime
       minister of France in the early 1880s, stressed that such domination was not only the duty of "superior"
       peoples but also their right. The "benefits" brought to the colonized typically consisted of religion, education,
       western clothing, and "character-building" sports like soccer. The British also introduced cricket to colonies in
       Africa and Asia, and baseball came to the Caribbean from the United States. The introduction of these sports
       was thought to teach people supposedly western values like fair play, teamwork, and competitiveness. The
       French called this aspect of imperialism "the civilizing mission." Colonizers also typically erected an
       infrastructure in the lands they controlled, building roads and railroads and establishing secure water systems
       and telegraph lines.

       As the thinking went, people had been conquered not to deprive them of their wealth but to introduce them to
       the benefits of civilization through the generosity of the industrialized country. This view no doubt served
       many as merely a cover for baser motives. Others, however, truly believed that African, Asian, and Pacific
       Islander societies were being improved by the adoption of the hallmarks of western civilization, such as
       Christianity, monogamous marriage, and fashions that covered the entire body. This was the attitude taken by
       English writer Rudyard Kipling in his pro-imperialist poem "The White Man's Burden." In the first stanza of the
       poem, written in 1899 in response to the U.S. acquisition of the Philippines, Kipling expresses his belief that it
       was the White conquerors who suffered at the expense of the conquered people of color, who are portrayed as
       uncivilized and in need of guidance by people of a biologically and culturally superior race:

             Take up the White Man's burden--
             Send forth the best ye breed--
             Go, bind your sons to exile

      To serve your captives' need;
      To wait, in heavy harness,
      On fluttered folk and wild--
      Your new-caught sullen peoples,
      Half devil and half child.

As Kipling's reference to the "half devil" nature of people of color suggests, missionaries played a prominent
role in the civilizing mission. They were often the chief means by which the "gifts" of civilization were brought
to people. All the imperial powers except Japan sent missionaries to their new colonies. Roman Catholic clergy
had already been converting people in European colonies for hundreds of years. Now Protestant clergy and
avid lay volunteers established churches and schools to convert the peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific to
Christianity and teach them the language of the conquering nation. They also took in orphaned or abandoned
children and attempted to assimilate them to the home country's culture.

Although some missionary activities, like the building of hospitals, may have benefited the Indigenous
inhabitants, most others were undoubtedly harmful. Shocked by the practice of polygamy, missionaries often
demanded that men with multiple wives choose one and divorce the others, who then had to return to their
families in shame or, if they had no family, live without means of support. In China, missionaries' insistence
that Christian converts abandon the practice of ancestor veneration often caused the new Christians to be
rejected by their families.

Many aspects of the "civilizing mission," whether carried out by missionaries or government functionaries,
were believed to benefit the conquering nation and its citizens as much as to help the "savage" inhabitants of
foreign lands. Telegraph lines enabled communications, and water systems protected city dwellers from
diseases like typhoid and cholera. Literate Indigenous people trained in European values and customs were
employed in colonial bureaucracies and police forces. Although such changes may have eventually benefitted
the people of the colonized country, they also changed the nature of societies, for example by eliminating
traditional jobs, and it was always the case that the colonizing nations benefited the most. Instead of
connecting population centers as European railroads did, for instance, railroad lines in places like Africa led
only from the interior to the coast, the better to move to waiting ships the raw materials destined for European
and U.S. factories.

The Means of Imperialism

Before either the economic or the cultural goals of the imperialists could be achieved, the desired regions had
first to be conquered. One of the first hurdles was the physical difficulty of penetrating the interiors of Africa
and Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa was a hot and humid home to microbes unknown to Europeans that sickened
both them and their draft animals. Malaria laid low many Europeans who attempted to explore the continent's
interior.

Malaria was also a significant problem in Britain's colony of India. It was exacerbated by schemes to dig
irrigation canals and clear land for railroads, creating more areas for water to collect in breeding grounds for
the mosquitoes that carried the disease. Quinine, which comes from the bark of the cinchona tree, had been
used to treat malaria for years, and in the 1840s the British discovered that taking it before exposure could
prevent people from ever contracting the disease. Cinchona trees grew only in the Andes, however, and there
were not enough to meet the European demand. Attempts to plant cinchona trees elsewhere often failed, but
350 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       by the 1870s the Dutch were successfully growing them in their colony of Indonesia and producing additional
       quinine, a development that assisted Europeans in their exploitation of the African interior.
       Besides disease, difficult terrain and dense brush also made European exploratory and military missions
       difficult. Following rivers inland was the easiest means of travel. However, most rivers were too shallow for
       sailing ships, so exploration beyond the coast depended on the development of steamboats. In the 1810s,
       American explorers began to use steamboats to venture into the interior of North America, exploring the
       upper reaches of the Mississippi River in 1825, for example, and the British sent steamboats up the Irrawaddy
       River to conquer Burma (also currently known as Myanmar).
       Steamboats were also of great use in Africa. The interior of the continent is a high plateau from which rivers
       pour down and rush to the seacoast. All have waterfalls, making it impossible for large sailing ships to follow
       them for their full length. By the second half of the nineteenth century, however, Europeans were regularly
       plying African waters in steamships much improved over the earliest ones. Besides sturdy iron hulls, the boats
       had propellers instead of the paddle wheels the original boats had and steel boilers that were less likely to
       burst than iron ones. When the boats reached a waterfall, they were disassembled, carried around the falls by
       African porters, and reassembled to continue down the river (Figure 9.15).

       FIGURE 9.15 Steamboats for Exploration. Steamships carried people and supplies up the rivers of Africa and Asia,
       opening these continents to explorers, missionaries, and soldiers. The hospital ship in this early photograph traveled
       the Tigris River in Iraq. (credit: "British hospital ship on the Tigris river carrying wounded in 1916" by E. E. Jones/
       Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Steamships carried not only soldiers, explorers, and traders into the interiors of continents but also guns.
       Weapons had improved rapidly in the industrialized world in the nineteenth century, and guns were another
       type of technology that gave Europeans a significant advantage. European and U.S. soldiers were armed with
       breech-loading, repeating rifles and handguns that could be loaded quickly and fired with greater accuracy.
       Smokeless powder increased the velocity of bullets--and thus the severity of gunshot wounds--and bullets had
       been rendered more lethal. Dum dum bullets (named for Dumdum, the arsenal town in India where they were
       first used) were flat or hollow bullets that expanded upon impact, increasing the size of the holes they made.
       Machine guns were also used extensively in colonial warfare. The Gatling gun from the United States could fire
       three thousand bullets per minute. Another U.S. invention, the Maxim gun, was a single-barreled weapon
       (unlike the Gatling gun) that could fire eleven bullets per second.

Such weapons could be produced in large numbers only in industrialized nations. Thus the only way the
people of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific could acquire guns was to purchase them, and they were inordinately
expensive. A native of the Sudan who wanted to purchase a European- or U.S.-made rifle at the end of the
nineteenth century would have to pay at least five camels or, if a European were willing to make the trade,
thirty-six enslaved people. Firearms were less common in Central and South Africa, and people fought with
swords and spears into the nineteenth century.

9.3 Colonial Empires

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Identify the places in which the industrialized nations built empires in the late nineteenth and early
      twentieth centuries
  · Describe how the industrialized nations built their empires
  · Explain where and why the world's industrialized nations came into conflict while building their
      empires

In the later nineteenth century, the industrialized nations regarded their colonies as necessary sources of
wealth and strength. Some, like Britain and France, had already established colonies a century or more before.
Now they focused on tightening their control over these and acquiring more. The United States, Germany, and
Japan lacked overseas colonies and now sought to acquire them.

Africa

The industrialized nations of Europe saw Africa, with its rich natural resources, as the great prize, and they
moved quickly to seize it. At the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution, Europeans controlled about 10
percent of the African continent. By the end of the century, after the "Scramble for Africa"--the competition
among European countries to establish African colonies--they controlled 90 percent, with the largest portions
ruled by Britain, France, Belgium, and Germany. Portugal and Spain still claimed colonies acquired in the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (Figure 9.16).
352 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution. The 1913 map shows Africa approximately thirty years later.

       European nations aimed to colonize the continent to get access to raw materials and new markets for their
       goods, to boost international prestige and national pride, and to achieve military dominance over rivals. The
       "Scramble for Africa" reached its height during the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 when, without input from
       Africans, European nations simply allotted different parts of the continent to one another. Some agreements
       were formal recognitions of existing colonies and territories, while others recognized new claims. Colonization
       continued throughout the 1880s-1910s.
       France
       France had been reluctant to claim colonies in Africa. It controlled the island of Gorée off the coast of Senegal
       and had a few trading posts in the interior. Beyond expanding into the interior of Senegal in the 1850s,
       however, it did little until the end of the nineteenth century, when the European powers met at the 1878
       Congress of Berlin to decide the fate of the defeated Ottoman Empire's possessions in North Africa. France
       received Tunisia.
       Tunisia had borrowed heavily from European powers to fund development and modernize its army. When it
       declared bankruptcy in 1869, Britain, France, and Italy established a commission to manage its finances and
       ensure repayment. At the Congress of Berlin, Italy hoped to gain Tunisia since a number of its citizens now
       lived there. Britain, however, did not wish Italy to control both sides of the Strait of Sicily, endangering British
       access to the eastern Mediterranean, but it did want French support for its claims to the Mediterranean island
       of Cyprus. Germany wished France to focus on North Africa rather than continental Europe, where Germany
       hoped to increase its own influence. Thus, France was given Tunisia, and Italy received the city of Tripoli in
       Libya instead.

Britain and Germany were content to allow France to claim Tunisia, but the Tunisians refused to acknowledge
this grant of power. A Tunisian attack on the French colony of Algeria in 1881 gave France an excuse to invade
Tunisia and establish a protectorate over it, a form of control that allowed the Tunisian government under
Muhammad III as-Sadiq to manage domestic affairs while France oversaw its defense and its relations with
other nations.

After realizing Belgium desired neighboring regions in Central Africa, France moved speedily to acquire more
colonial holdings. As a result, from 1880 to 1900 many parts of West Africa came under French control as the
Italian-born French naval officer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza traveled the region, negotiating with local rulers
and signing treaties on behalf of France. Areas that are now nations (or parts of nations) quickly became
French possessions: the Côte d'Ivoire, Benin, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Cameroon, the Central African Republic,
the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Burkina Faso, and Chad. Besides
providing markets for manufactured goods, these colonies also produced abundant palm oil, used for
lubricating industrial machinery. France also took control of French Somaliland (Djibouti) in East Africa and
the island of Madagascar off the East African coast.

The French takeover of its African colonies was sometimes peaceful, as when Brazza signed a treaty with the
Bateke ruler King Illoh Makoko in today's Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo. At
other times it consisted of brutal conquest. For example, Captain Paul Voulet earned a reputation for cruelty as
he marched through French Sudan (modern Niger) on his way to Lake Chad. Voulet's troops looted villages
already under French control and raped and killed their inhabitants.

Great Britain

South Africa was Britain's first toehold on the continent. In 1806, Britain took formal control over the Dutch
Cape Colony, established by Dutch traders in the seventeenth century. South Africa was intended as a settler
colony, and as British immigrants arrived, the Dutch who lived there, called Afrikaners or Boers, were forced
ever further inland, north and east, in the Great Trek of 1836. They established two independent republics, the
Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State, and left the Cape Colony to the British.

Britain's second area of interest in Africa was Egypt, an excellent source of cotton for its textile mills. The
possibility of building a canal across the Isthmus of Suez, which divided Asia from Africa, had intrigued
Europeans since the fifteenth century. Linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas would allow ships to reach the
Indian and Pacific Oceans without sailing around the tip of Africa, greatly easing trade with South and East
Asia. Now seemed the time to make this dream a reality. In 1854, the French diplomat and business owner
Ferdinand de Lesseps approached Sa'id Pasha, the son of Muhammad Ali, who became ruler of Egypt and
Sudan in 1854, for permission to build a canal through Egyptian territory. Lesseps received it, and in 1858 he
organized a team from seven countries to engineer a canal that ships of any nations could use. Construction
began in 1859, and the Suez Canal opened to shipping in 1869 (Figure 9.17).
354 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       FIGURE 9.17 Suez Canal. This 1881 illustration from the Young Persons' Cyclopedia of Persons and Places shows
       the route of the Suez Canal from Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. (credit: modification of work
       "Suez Canal in the year 1881" by Young Persons' Cyclopedia of Persons and Places/Wikimedia Commons, Public
       Domain)
       Britain had initially opposed the canal. It threatened British domination over the main water route to Asia,
       which passed the British Cape Colony, and it made its prized colony of India more accessible--and more
       vulnerable. Britain's attitude changed, however, when Ismail Pasha, who became khedive or viceroy of Egypt
       and Sudan following the death of his uncle Sa'id Pasha in 1863, found himself deeply in debt to European
       creditors, which made it possible for European interests to manipulate him. For example, he was forced to
       establish a dual court system in which accused Europeans were tried by European judges, not Egyptian ones.
       In 1875, unable to pay his debts, Ismail Pasha sold Egypt's shares in the Suez Canal to Britain. He was also
       forced to allow British and French officials to manage Egypt's financial affairs.
       In 1879, an anti-European uprising began in Egypt under the leadership of Colonel Ahmed Urabi. When Ismail
       Pasha gave in to Urabi's demands to remove the British and French from governmental positions, Britain and
       France requested that the Ottoman sultan remove Pasha from power, which the sultan did, replacing him with
       his more agreeable son, Tawfiq Pasha. Equally unwilling to accept Tawfiq as their ruler, however, Urabi's forces
       continued to fight until 1882, when they were defeated by the British (Figure 9.18). With the conclusion of this
       Anglo-Egyptian War, Britain assumed control of Egypt and Sudan to protect its financial interests in the region,
       and Urabi was sent into exile.

Illustrated London News, fought to rid their country of European domination and unseat rulers who acceded to
European demands. (credit: "Anglo-Egyptian War" by The Illustrated London News/Wikimedia Commons, Public
Domain)
As hostilities between Britain and Urabi's forces were coming to a close, a new threat arose in Sudan, where
British control had been weak. In 1881, a religious leader named Muhammad Ahmad called upon the
Sudanese to free themselves from Ottoman rule, which meant, in effect, freeing themselves of British-guided
Egyptian rule. Muhammad Ahmad began to refer to himself as the Mahdi, a messiah or savior who will appear
on earth to revive the practice of "true" Islam and usher in a period of justice that will last for a few years
before the end of the world. Muhammad Ahmad proclaimed a religious crusade against the ruler of Egypt and
gathered followers. British efforts to maintain control over Sudan failed, and the Mahdi's followers continued
to enforce their control over the region, even after his death in 1885.
Belgium
Belgium was one of the smallest industrialized nations, and its legislators did not believe it had the money or
force to acquire and maintain colonial possessions. However, Belgium's second king, the constitutional
monarch Leopold II, dreamed of establishing an empire in the Congo Basin of Central Africa and was not to be
dissuaded. The region was relatively unexplored by Europeans and rich in resources like ivory and rubber, and
no other European powers claimed it. In 1876, Leopold established the International African Association. Its
goal, he claimed, was to "civilize" the natives of Africa and dispense humanitarian aid.
Leopold's noble-sounding statements were lies, however. Although Britain and France were leery of his
interest in the Congo, at the Berlin Conference in 1884 he promised he would impose no tariffs on the colony's
imports and had in mind only the benefit of the Congolese natives. Control of the Congo thus was given to him.
He named it the Congo Free State and ruled it entirely as his own private colony; it did not belong to the nation
of Belgium. Although Leopold kept his promise to make it a free-trade zone, Europeans there were free to
exploit and abuse African laborers in the pursuit of profit.
Germany
Germany came late to the scramble for colonies, delayed by a number of factors. Until 1871, it consisted of a
variety of German-speaking states and kingdoms in northern and central Europe, none wealthy or powerful
enough to establish colonies. Once unified as a country in 1871, it still did not possess the ocean-going navy
needed to trade with and defend colonies, and its first chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in office from 1871 until
356 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       1890, initially had no interest in an overseas empire.
       Bismarck originally believed empire building was a foolish venture that cost more than it returned. But by the
       1880s he had changed his mind, perhaps influenced by German merchants who sought trade and investment
       opportunities overseas, or by public clamor to increase German prestige through the claiming of colonies. In
       Africa, Germany staked its claim to regions scattered across the continent that had not already been colonized
       by France and England, from Togoland (today Togo and part of Ghana) and German Cameroon (now parts of
       Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic, and Gabon) in the west to German South-West Africa (now
       Namibia) and German East Africa (today Rwanda, Burundi, and parts of Tanzania).
       Italy
       Italy was the last European power to establish colonies in Africa. In 1884, an Italian shipping company bought
       Assab Bay, a port city on the Red Sea, from a local sultan. In 1886, Italy took control of the Egyptian Red Sea
       port of Massawa at Britain's urging to prevent France from acquiring more territory in the region.
       In 1889, Italy claimed Eritrea as a colony. It also signed the Treaty of Wuchale with Menelik II, who became
       emperor of Ethiopia that same year. In the Italian-language version of the treaty, Menelik was promised
       military and financial aid in exchange for control over Eritrea and its foreign affairs. In the Ethiopian-language
       version, the emperor had the choice of accepting or rejecting Italian control. When, in 1895, Italy insisted on
       enforcing the terms of the Italian-language treaty, war began.
       The conflict ended ignominiously for Italy at the 1896 Battle of Adwa, when its troops encountered a much
       larger Ethiopian force. Six thousand Italians were killed, three thousand were captured, and others fled the
       battlefield, leaving eleven thousand rifles that the Ethiopians seized. As night fell, Ethiopian peasants fell upon
       stragglers in the retreat and killed them. Riots broke out in Rome and Naples at the news, and Italians
       demanded the return of all soldiers and tried to block the troop trains. Adwa largely marked the end of Italy's
       expansion in Africa. Menelik II allowed Italy to retain control of Eritrea, but the treaty ending the war
       reaffirmed Ethiopia's independence (Figure 9.19).

European Powers in Conflict

Although Italy's expansion in Africa was halted, the other great powers continued to extend their influence,
sometimes through their private citizens. Entering South Africa's diamond trade as a young man, for example,
Cecil Rhodes of Britain established a company called De Beers in 1888 that soon monopolized the diamond
market. In 1890, Rhodes became prime minister of the Cape Colony.
It was Rhodes's goal to expand the British Empire in South Africa. In 1889, the British government gave him a
charter that enabled a company he had formed, the British South Africa Company, to sign treaties with local
rulers, gain mineral concessions from them, and essentially rule their lands. Rhodes and his agents thus
extended British influence northward from the Limpopo River in South Africa across the Zambezi River to
Central Africa, calling the land Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) in 1895.
Rhodes's motives were not only to gain personal wealth and power but also to expand the British presence in
358 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       Africa and provide room for Anglo-Saxons, whom he considered a superior race, to grow in number. Rhodes
       was a racist with no respect for Africans. To strengthen British control over Central Africa, where Germany,
       Belgium, and Portugal also claimed land, he proposed a "Cape to Cairo" railway connecting Britain's East
       African colonies (Figure 9.20). This link, he believed, would make it easier to govern the British Empire in
       Africa and attract more settlers, and the British government agreed.

       FIGURE 9.20 Cecil Rhodes. In his caricature of Cecil Rhodes (a), which appeared in the British humor magazine
       Punch in 1892, artist Edward Linley Sambourne shows him bestriding Africa. Rhodes proposed a railroad connecting
       Britain's Cape Colony to Egypt in the 1890s (b). Some lines were not completed until the twentieth century, and
       some were never built. (credit a: modification of work "The Rhodes Colossus" by Punch/Wikimedia Commons,
       Public Domain; attribution b: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
       Several hurdles stood in the way, however. First, in 1891 Germany had established the colony of German East
       Africa (today's Burundi, Tanzania, and Rwanda), effectively blocking the proposed railway's path. In addition,
       Portugal objected that it controlled the land between its colonies of Angola and Mozambique, encompassing
       much of what Rhodes claimed as part of Rhodesia. Britain rejected Portugal's claims, but another obstacle was
       that Britain did not control Sudan; the Mahdist army did.
       n 1896, fearing that Sudan might be seized by a competing foreign power, Britain appointed Sir Herbert
       Kitchener to reclaim it. There was also concern that the Mahdist ruler, Abdullah Ibn-Muhammed Al-Khalifa,
       might ally with Menelik II to drive Europeans out. That same year, France also dispatched expeditions from
       both French Somaliland (Djibouti) in East Africa and Senegal in the west to gain control of Sudan. France
       hoped to lay claim to Sudan in order to build an east-west railway linking its colony of French Somaliland with
       its West and Central African possessions.
       As the French marched steadily across the Sahara, Kitchener, with an Egyptian and Sudanese army, moved
       south along the Nile, establishing railroad lines and reclaiming towns from Mahdist control as he went. Finally,
       in September 1898, Kitchener and his forces, augmented by British troops, met the Mahdist ruler Al-Khalifa at
       Omdurman and defeated him. Before he could reclaim the rest of Sudan, however, Kitchener was dispatched to

had arrived from Senegal some months earlier and claimed the town. As the two armies waited through
September and October for instructions from their governments, civilians in both countries loudly proclaimed
their nation to be in the right. The British Royal Navy prepared for war. The Fashoda Incident, as it is called,
ended when France withdrew its claims, realizing it was outgunned, and the two nations agreed upon a
boundary line between their spheres in Africa.

Britain's final effort to exert control over territory in Africa was the Boer War. Tensions between the British
Cape Colony and the Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic had increased. In
1877, following Britain's announcement that it was annexing the Transvaal Republic, fighting broke out
between British and Boer forces in the First Boer War. The British were soundly defeated and forced to
recognize the independence of the South African Republic (the new name of the Transvaal Republic).
In 1900, following an abortive British raid into the South African Republic, the Boers laid siege to British Cape
Colony settlements. In response to Boer guerrilla tactics, the British adopted a scorched-earth policy,
destroying Boer homes, farms, and livestock to deny them food and shelter. Boer women and children were

       forced into concentration camps, where nearly thirty thousand died from disease or starvation. The war ended
       in 1902, and the Cape Colony annexed the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. In 1910, the two
       former Boer republics, the Cape Colony, and the British-controlled Natal Colony came together to form the
       Union of South Africa.

      Asia

       Despite Britain's expansion into Africa, India remained its most important overseas territory. India had been a
       possession of the British East India Company, which directly ruled approximately half of India. In 1857,
       however, Muslim and Hindu soldiers in the company's employ, known as sepoys, rose in revolt. In 1858,
       following the British army's suppression of the revolt, Parliament disbanded the British East India Company
       and took control of the territory it had ruled. Local rulers whose authority the East India Company
       acknowledged and who had remained loyal were left in nominal control of their kingdoms, but in reality, they
       became subservient to Britain. Queen Victoria was officially proclaimed empress of India in 1876, and the last
       Mughal emperor, who had not been active in the revolt, was sent into exile. This transfer of power began the
       period of direct British rule called the British Raj.

       India supplied Britain's lifeblood, without which it likely could not have maintained the wealth and power that
       enabled it to assume supremacy over the rest of the world for most of the nineteenth century. Refusing to
       impose high tariffs as many industrialized nations did, England was flooded with foreign-made goods that
       dominated the market. Having converted its economy largely to manufacturing by the mid-nineteenth century,
       England also depended on trade with other countries for its food supply. As a result, it maintained a negative
       balance of trade with most of the world; that is, it purchased more from other nations than they purchased
       from it. This imbalance threatened Britain with economic ruin.

       India saved Britain from this fate, though at great cost to the Indian people. To reduce Britain's trade
       imbalances, Indian farmers were forced to grow cash crops such as cotton and tea to maintain British factories
       and households. High excise taxes were imposed on Indian textiles, making English fabrics cheaper for Indian
       consumers to buy than those made in their own country. British officials imposed high taxes on the Indian
       people to pay the British soldiers and officials stationed in India. The tax revenue also went to purchase rails,
       locomotives, and wire from Britain for railroads and telegraph lines in India. Built primarily to transport
       British manufactured goods into the interior for sale and Indian cash crops to the coast for transport to the
       British Isles, the new infrastructure benefited the colonizers far more than the colonized.

       British attempts to gain control over regions of Asia beyond India and Hong Kong were often frustrated by
       Russia, which also sought to expand its influence there. The ongoing struggle between the two was called The
       Great Game. From the 1850s through the 1870s, Russia gained control of kingdoms occupied by Turkic-
       speaking peoples in central Asia and incorporated them into its empire as a region called Turkestan (Figure
       9.22). Russia argued that its actions were necessary to "civilize" the region's inhabitants and protect important
       trade routes. Britain feared Russia would try to absorb India as well. To protect its prized possession, Britain
       sought to use the Emirate of Afghanistan as a buffer zone. When its diplomats were refused admission to
       Afghanistan in 1878, the British army invaded. Britain emerged victorious, gaining the right to act as a go-
       between for Afghanistan and Russia. When Russia gained control of much of what is now Turkmenistan in
       1881, the two European nations jointly established the boundary line between an independent Afghanistan
       and Russian territory, ending a serious conflict between the two powers.

Russia also desired to expand control over the far eastern end of its empire, on the Pacific coast. Here, however,
it found itself in conflict with a new imperial power--Japan. Lacking many of the raw materials necessary for
industrialization, Japan, like other industrialized nations, began to seek them abroad. It first took control of the
Ryukyu Islands and also claimed the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin Island (Figure 9.23). Russia, however, also
laid claim to these territories, and for a while the two nations shared Sakhalin Island. In 1875, Japan
relinquished its claims to the island in exchange for complete control over the Kurile Islands.

       Japan's most desired prize was Korea, then a largely isolated tributary state of China. Japan traded with Korea
       but in a limited way. In 1873, however, Korea's King Gojong began to consider opening the nation to the outside
       world. Anxious to gain an advantage, in 1876 Japan sent a gunboat to force Korea to sign the Japan-Korea
       Treaty of Amity (Ganghwa Treaty) before it could make commercial treaties with other nations. Among other
       provisions, the treaty allowed the Japanese to establish trading ports in addition to the one to which they
       already had access. It also let Japanese merchants live and work in Korea while subject only to Japanese law. In
       addition, Korea was declared to no longer be a tributary state of China (Figure 9.24).

China did not wish to relinquish its control so easily, and a series of uprisings and mutinies in Korea in the
1880s gave it the opportunity to reassert its authority. In 1885, however, both Japan and China agreed to
withdraw military forces from the peninsula in 1885. Although this temporarily prevented armed conflict
between Japan and China, hostilities between the two soon commenced. In 1894, the pro-Japanese Korean
leader Kim Ok-Kyun was murdered in Shanghai, and an outraged Japan awaited an opportunity to confront the
Chinese. That same year, the Donghak Rebellion swept Korea as disgruntled peasants demanded social
reforms, giving China an excuse to dispatch a military force to Korea in violation of its agreement with Japan.
Japan in turn sent troops to confront the Chinese, and the First Sino-Japanese War began.
Although China had the larger military force by far, Japan's navy was much more modern and defeated the
Chinese handily. Humiliated, China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which recognized Korea's
independence and conceded to Japan territory on the Liaodong Peninsula in Manchuria as well as Taiwan and
the Penghu Islands. Japan had now acquired an empire. Japan quickly realized, however, that it would have to
defend its gains from its old rival Russia. In 1896, Koreans, angered by the assassination of their pro-Chinese
queen by Japanese agents, overthrew the pro-Japanese government then in power. As Japanese influence
waned, Russian influence grew, and Russia soon acquired mineral and timber rights in the northern Korean
peninsula.
Russia also began to encroach upon Japanese territory in Manchuria. Russia's one Pacific port, Vladivostok,
was often frozen over. Seeking a harbor that was ice-free year-round, Russia leased land from China on the
Liaodong Peninsula in 1897 and built a new port, Port Arthur. A wary Japan offered Russia free rein on the
Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for Japan's retaining control over Korea. When Russia refused to compromise,
Japan attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur in the winter of 1904, beginning the Russo-Japanese War. Once
again, Japan emerged victorious over a much larger nation. The Treaty of Portsmouth, signed in September
1905, acknowledged Japan's right to Korea and awarded Japan control of southern Manchuria. Japan formally
annexed Korea in 1910.
As Japan, Russia, and Britain competed for control of Asia, France largely refrained. Its principal interest on
the continent of Asia was Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). In 1858, the emperor of Vietnam
ordered French missionaries in the country to leave. In response, Napoleon III sent gunboats to protect the
missionaries and their Christian converts and forced the emperor to grant France control over three southern
provinces. When the Vietnamese ruler proved unwilling to abide by the terms, troops returned in 1862, forcing
him to concede yet more territory. By 1887, France had established protectorates over the remaining
provinces of Vietnam and over Cambodia, a vassal state of the emperor of Siam (now Thailand). Laos, also
Siamese territory, became part of French Indochina after a brief military conflict between Siam and France in
1893.
China could do little as Asia was devoured. By the second half of the nineteenth century, China was a shadow of
its former self. Defeat in the Opium Wars of 1839 and 1856 had weakened it, and the peace treaties concluding
364 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       the Second Opium War had forced it to open additional ports and allow British, French, Russian, and U.S.
       citizens to travel freely and enjoy the right of extraterritoriality, meaning that while in China they were subject
       only to the laws of their own countries. China was also forced to allow the practice of Christianity.
       Alarmed by their nation's inability to defend itself against foreign threats, many Chinese in the 1860s began to
       call for reform. Among them was Feng Guifen, a scholar and government official who advocated the adoption
       of western military technology and the study of western science. Military leaders such as Zeng Guofan and Li
       Hongzhang also supported these reforms. The reformist Self-Strengthening Movement was championed by
       Prince Gong, who had negotiated with the British and French invaders in 1860. Arsenals to build and house
       modern weapons and shipyards to construct modern warships were established (Figure 9.25). Efforts were
       made to build railroad and telegraph lines and to open iron and coal mines. Although they still clung to
       traditional Confucian values, the leaders of the movement also advocated educational reform with a new
       emphasis on mathematics, science, and foreign languages (so foreign books could be translated) instead of the
       Confucian classics. They regarded the Self-Strengthening Movement as a way of saving the Qing dynasty, not
       undermining it.

       Movement. This photograph was taken in about 1880. (credit: "Foochow arsenal in Mawei" by Unknown/Wikimedia
       Commons, Public Domain)
       Efforts to modernize did not go unopposed. Government officials steeped in Confucian learning regarded the
       new emphasis on science and technology as a threat to their power. Many Chinese were also reluctant to allow
       foreigners to invest in or own railways or factories. The Self-Strengthening Movement received a serious blow
       in 1895 with China's defeat by Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War. Critics of the movement questioned why
       China was trying to change when the changes did not bring the military power reformers had promised.
       Following China's defeat in 1895, European nations and the United States pushed for even more advantages.

along the Yangtze River Valley. Germany was given control of the Yellow River Valley to the north as well as the
Shandong Peninsula and Jiaozhou Bay. Soon nearly all the industrialized nations had been granted
concessions, enclaves within port cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai, where they exercised the rights of
extraterritoriality.

In 1900, several of these nations signed a treaty with the Chinese government at the urging of John Hay, the
U.S. secretary of state. The treaty established an Open Door policy in which China agreed to trade with all
countries on the same terms. In this way, none of the industrialized powers could gain an advantage over the
others. In exchange, they promised not to annex any of China's territory.

The Pacific

Colonization of the Pacific by Europeans had begun as early as the sixteenth century when Spain claimed the
Philippines. Over the course of the eighteenth through the early nineteenth centuries, France and Britain had
also laid claim to the islands of the Pacific. Britain established a colony in Australia in 1788 and colonized New
Zealand in 1840. France made Tahiti a protectorate in 1842. In the second half of the nineteenth century, those
islands that did not already belong to a great power were quickly absorbed into larger colonial empires.

In some cases, competing powers agreed to share possession of large islands or island chains. For example, in
1899, Germany, Britain, and the United States formally agreed to divide the Samoan islands between Germany,
which took control of those now known as Samoa, and the United States, which received those now called
American Samoa. In exchange for Britain's forfeiting any claim to the islands, Germany gave it control of some
of the territory it had settled in the North Solomon Islands and made concessions regarding its holdings in
Africa. The foreign powers took the additional step of abolishing the Samoan monarchy.

The United States was particularly active in the Pacific. Unlike the other industrial powers, it had not
attempted to claim any parts of Africa or Asia beyond some trading concessions in China. Throughout the later
nineteenth century, it was developing the land and exploiting the resources within its North American borders.
It pushed steadily westward from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, acquiring territory by purchase, treaty, or
conquest from France, Britain, and Mexico on the way. To clear the land for use by farmers, ranchers, miners,
and timber companies, by the end of the century the federal government had confined the Indigenous peoples
to reservations. In 1867, it purchased the Russian colony of Alaska. By the 1890s, it had settled all its vast
territory and began to look abroad. The United States wanted access to the wealth of China as well as land to
grow sugarcane, one of the food commodities it could not produce in a quantity to suit its needs.

The United States' first significant move to acquire territory for an empire beyond the North American
mainland was to take control of Hawaii. Although it had annexed a number of minor islands in the Pacific,
including Baker Island, Howland Island, and Midway Atoll, it had done so only with the intent of collecting
guano for fertilizer and did not develop or settle them.

People from the United States had visited and lived in the Kingdom of Hawaii since the mid-nineteenth
century, and a substantial American community owned land there. Many grew sugar for export to the United
States. In 1887, the Hawaiian Patriotic League was founded. Consisting primarily of American members, the
League forced Hawaii's King Kalakaua to adopt a new constitution that disenfranchised many Indigenous
Hawaiians while giving property-owning U.S. citizens the right to vote and hold public office. In 1890, a new
tariff passed by the U.S. Congress increased taxes on foreign sugar, which raised the price of Hawaiian sugar
and threatened the profits of American plantation owners. However, if Hawaii were to be annexed by the
United States, its sugar would no longer be taxed as a foreign import, giving an advantage to the planters.

When Kalakaua died in 1891, his sister Liliuokalani inherited the throne (Figure 9.26). Resenting U.S.
interference in Hawaii's government, she proposed a new constitution to restore voting rights to many Native
Hawaiians while denying them to American and European residents. Fearful of losing political power in Hawaii
and the hope of annexation, in 1893 a group of primarily American conspirators forced Liliuokalani to
abdicate. In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii.

       FIGURE 9.26 Crown Princess Liliuokalani. While still a princess, Liliuokalani of Hawaii attended the courts of other

       celebrate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. (credit: modification of work "Liliuokalani in London" by Hawaii State
       Archives/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       The annexation of Hawaii was not the only imperial conquest of the United States in 1898. In 1895, the
       inhabitants of Cuba, one of Spain's few remaining colonies, had risen to demand independence. U.S.
       businesses had invested heavily in Cuba, and many traded with the Spanish colony. The Cuban revolutionaries
       appealed for help in winning independence, but U.S. president Grover Cleveland was intent on neutrality.
       When riots in Havana threatened U.S. lives and property in December 1897, however, President William
       McKinley dispatched the battleship USS Maine to protect them. In February 1898, an explosion on the ship was
       blamed on a Spanish mine. With newspapers and the public calling for the U.S. government to "remember the
       Maine" and avenge the loss of U.S. lives, Congress declared war on Spain on April 25, 1898.
       Two days later, U.S. commodore George Dewey sailed from Hong Kong to the Philippines, another Spanish
       colony. Entering Manila Bay, Dewey quickly destroyed the Spanish fleet. The war in Cuba also proceeded
       swiftly--and in favor of the United States. Spain's last two island colonies, Guam and Puerto Rico, surrendered
       with little fighting. In December 1898, Spain recognized Cuba's independence, ceded Guam and Puerto Rico to
       the United States, and allowed the United States to purchase the Philippines. Spain was finished as a colonial
       power, but the United States was just beginning.
       Not all in the United States favored making the Philippines a U.S. territory, but many did. The Philippines'
       proximity to China attracted those who sought to trade with the latter. Many feared Japan or a European power
       like Germany would seize control of the islands if the United States did not stake its claim to them. Indeed,
       Germany attempted to establish a base in the Philippines only a few weeks after the Spanish forces
       surrendered.

The Future of the Philippines

While Filipinos fought U.S. troops for their country's independence, those at home debated the islands' fate.
Senator Albert Beveridge (R-IN) argued in 1901 that the United States must retain control of the islands. The
preceding year, members of the Negro National Democratic League had spoken out against annexation. As you
read the following excerpts, ask yourself why Beveridge was so eager for the United States to own the
Philippines, and why members of the Negro National Democratic League opposed annexation so strongly.

      MR. PRESIDENT, the times call for candor. The Philippines are ours forever, `territory belonging to the
      United States,' as the Constitution calls them. And just beyond the Philippines are China's illimitable
      markets. We will not retreat from either. We will not repudiate our duty in the archipelago. We will not
      abandon our opportunity in the Orient. We will not renounce our part in the mission of our race, trustee,
      under God, of the civilization of the world. And we will move forward to our work, not howling out
      regrets like slaves whipped to their burdens but with gratitude for a task worthy of our strength and
      thanksgiving to Almighty God that He has marked us as His chosen people, henceforth to lead in the
      regeneration of the world.

      This island empire is the last land left in all the oceans. If it should prove a mistake to abandon it, the
      blunder once made would be irretrievable. . . .

      Our largest trade henceforth must be with Asia. The Pacific is our ocean. More and more Europe will
      manufacture the most it needs, secure from its colonies the most it consumes. Where shall we turn for
      consumers of our surplus? Geography answers the question. China is our natural customer. . . . The
      Philippines give us a base at the door of all the East.

      --Sen. Albert Beveridge, a speech to the 56th Congress, January 1900

      We hold that the policy known as imperialism is hostile to liberty and leans toward the destruction of
      government by the people themselves. We insist that the subjugation of any people is `criminal
      aggression' and is a pronounced departure from the first principles taught and declared by Washington,
      Lincoln, Jefferson, and all the great statesmen who have guided the country through as many dangers of
      the past. Whether the people who will be affected by such policy be or consider themselves Negroes,
      nor yet because the majority of them are black, is of but little moment. They are by nature entitled to
      liberty and freedom. We being an oppressed people, to use the words of Daniel O'Connell, should be
      `the loudest in our protestations against the oppression of others.' It may be that our government can
      and will govern the people of the Philippines and Puerto Rico better than they can govern themselves;
      but with equal force can it be said that the white men of the south can govern the localities in which the
      Negro is a majority better than they can govern themselves, and if we are prepared to support an
      administration that is engaged in suppressing liberty and freedom in our so-called possessions, why not
      be consistent and cease to complain of the same thing being done in any part of our own land? A nation
      cannot oppress a people without the borders of the country without sooner or later introducing some
      such oppression within its borders.

     9.4 Exploitation and Resistance

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the imperial powers' treatment of their colonies
         · Explain how colonized people were harmed by imperialism
         · Explain how colonized people resisted control by the imperial powers
       The primary motivation of the imperial powers in acquiring colonies was economic, and in the name of profit
       they frequently brutalized and exploited native populations. Even when they believed their intentions were
       benevolent and would improve the lives of Africans, Asians, and Pacific Islanders, their means were often
       cruel. As colonial powers stripped wealth from the lands they exploited, often causing significant
       environmental damage and destroying countless lives, the residents did not peacefully accept the loss of their
       independence.

      Brutality and Exploitation

       While all the great powers were capable of brutality and people were exploited in all the colonies, King Leopold
       II's subjects in the Congo Free State suffered in ways that have become infamous. Despite his claims that his
       interest in Africa lay solely in a desire to improve people's lives, in reality, Leopold was a cruel master. The
       Congo Free State was considered his personal possession and thus immune from intervention by the Belgian
       government. Leopold extracted wealth from it by leasing portions to private companies and individuals.
       Without adopting even a veneer of benevolence, these intermediaries brutalized the peoples of the Congo from
       the moment they arrived.
       Disembarking from steamboats that brought them up the Congo River, Europeans seized Africans and forced
       them to carry their numerous possessions inland. At times, several hundred would be conscripted to carry a
       boat's cargo, marching single-file with iron collars around their necks, attached to chains to ensure they did
       not run away.
       Europeans used Africans in the Congo Free State for all forms of labor, but primarily to gather ivory and
       harvest rubber from wild rubber tree vines. The amount of rubber they were required to collect each day was
       so large that, instead of tapping the rubber-bearing vines and letting the liquid flow into pails, they chopped
       through the vines and allowed the liquid latex to cover their bodies. At the end of the day, the hardened rubber
       had to be scraped from their skin. For this work, they received low pay if any, often only the food they were
       given.
       Entire villages could be emptied of men forced into service, their wives and children held hostage to ensure
       their compliance. The ill and injured were left to die, and those who were uncooperative or slow were whipped,
       sometimes to unconsciousness or even death. Discipline was maintained by the Force Publique, an
       Indigenous army commanded by European officers. This army killed those who resisted forced labor or tried
       to run away and then cut a hand from each victim to maintain a tally of the dead. If the quota set by officers was
       not met, hands were chopped from the living to make up the number. People who failed to gather enough
       rubber could also lose their hands (Figure 9.27).

In 1899, Joseph Conrad published his novella Heart of Darkness, based on what he had seen in the Congo Free
State. The book elicited cries for intervention among the British, and following a British official's detailed
report, the Congo Reform Association (CRA) was founded. Many prominent British and American thinkers
were members, and they pressured governments to end the suffering of the Congolese people. In 1908, the
Belgian Parliament took the Congo from Leopold II, renamed it the Belgian Congo, and assumed authority over
it.
Although the Congo Free State became notorious for the brutal treatment its people suffered, it differed from
most other colonies largely in degree, not in kind. Forced laborers toiled in Egypt to build portions of the Suez
Canal. In Portugal's African colonies, people were made to grow rice and cotton and sell it to government

       agents at prices the government set. Where Europeans ruled through local leaders, such as in France's West
       African colonies, forced labor might be disguised as a form of traditional communal labor ordered by a village
       head or chief.

       Imperialism harmed the people of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands in other ways as well. European and U.S.
       visitors in the late nineteenth century often brought infectious diseases. The introduction of measles to Fiji in
       1875 resulted in the death of approximately one-quarter of the population. Modern methods of travel further
       spread disease. Railroads built to move goods and raw materials in India helped spark outbreaks of cholera,
       smallpox, and bubonic plague. The demand of textile producers for cotton resulted in the digging of irrigation
       canals in places like Egypt, which provided ideal breeding environments for malaria-bearing mosquitoes.

       Colonizers also brought the cattle disease rinderpest with them wherever they went. Rinderpest came to the
       Philippines from the United States, for example, swiftly killing the draft animals of Filipino farmers and
       making it harder for them to grow adequate amounts of food. Once the domestic cattle had died, the
       mosquitoes turned to biting humans and sickening them with malaria. The introduction of rinderpest-infected
       cattle to the Horn of Africa by Italians afflicted herds throughout the eastern and southern part of the
       continent. With herds diminished, thornbush shrubs flourished, providing a perfect home for the tsetse flies
       that carried sleeping sickness.

       Farmers often devoted so much land to cash crops that they were unable to raise enough food to feed
       themselves. People who mined ore or gathered ivory or rubber for Europeans also did not have time to grow
       crops to feed themselves. Thus people became dependent on food sold by European and American overseers
       that was often highly processed and lacked nutrients, such as white flour and white rice, leading many to suffer
       from dietary deficiency diseases.

       Exploitation also occurred in other ways. In the United States, "Wild West" shows hired Native Americans to
       re-enact battle scenes for crowds of paying White customers. Carnival barkers often placed Native Americans,
       Inuit, and Filipino Islanders on display for others to look at. The 1904 St. Louis World's Fair featured Filipino
       tribespeople living in recreations of their native villages. Such "human zoos" of tribal peoples from Africa,
       Asia, the Arctic, and the Pacific were not uncommon in European cities and in other world's fairs.

           LINK TO LEARNING

       The 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri, included exhibits of tribal peoples. You can watch a 55-minute
       documentary called "Human Zoos" (https://openstax.org/l/77HumanZoos) to learn more about this imperialist
       phenomenon.

       Given the harm colonization caused, it is worth asking why native peoples ever cooperated with foreign
       imperialists. Of course, some did so for fear of the consequences of refusing. Some, however, worked with the
       imperial powers to gain advantages for themselves and their families. For those who learned to speak the
       language of the imperial power and acquired a certain level of education, jobs were available at the lower levels
       of government bureaucracies. People could also serve as soldiers and police, a benefit for members of minority
       tribal groups that had been dominated by more powerful ones. Others could secure jobs as interpreters or
       guides, and wealthier ones might enter into business with the imperial power, as did some Indians, Chinese,
       and Vietnamese. Imperial powers like Britain and France often provided education for the children of those
       who assisted them, preparing them for a possible job in the colonial bureaucracy and even a university
       education in London or Paris. Finally, many converts to Christianity were sincere in their beliefs and may have
       felt they had more in common with European fellow Christians than with non-Christian peers.

      Resistance and Revolution

       Resistance movements and outright revolts sprang up wherever colonizers went. The revolt by Egyptians
       unwilling to submit to European control, the war waged by the Mahdi's army, and Ethiopia's war with Italy were

and Matabele (Ndebele) tribes' resistance of British or Dutch control in the south.

 An African King Fights the Boers

  King Moshoeshoe I of the Basuto kingdom of southern Africa hoped to avert violence between his subjects and
  European settlers (Figure 9.28). However, when Boers attacked Basuto settlements, Moshoeshoe went to war. In
  1858, his soldiers defeated the Boers, but in two subsequent wars Moshoeshoe lost territory to the Boers.
  Finally, in 1868 the kingdom of Basuto was made the British protectorate of Basutoland (today's Lesotho), and
  the Boer attacks ended. Following, in a letter to Sir George Grey, governor of Britain's Cape Colony, Moshoeshoe
  describes his reasons for going to war in 1858.

  government ministers and advisors in this undated nineteenth-century photograph. (credit: "King Moshoeshoe of
  the Basotho with his ministers" by Bensusan Museum, Johannesburg/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

        I had given orders that no farms should be burnt, and my orders were obeyed till my people saw village
        after village burnt off, and the corn destroyed, they then carried destruction among the enemy's homes.
        On coming to my mountain, the Boers found I was prepared to check their progress, and they
        consequently retired. My intention was then to have followed them up, and to have shown them that my
        people could also carry on offensive operations, believing that having once experienced the horrors of
        war in their midst, I should not soon be troubled by them again. My bands were getting ready to make a
        descent upon them, when the Boers thought proper to make request for a cessation of hostilities. I
        knew what misery I should bring upon the country by leaving the Basutos to ravage the Boer places, and
        therefore I have agreed to the proposal of Mr. J. P. Hoffman. I cannot say that I do so with the consent of
        my people, for many of those who suffered by the enemy were anxious to recover their losses. If they
        have remained quiet, it has been owing to my persuasions and my promises that they might have good
        hope of justice--Your Excellency having consented to act as arbitrator between the Boers and Basutos.

       Resistance to foreign rule also took place in Asia and the Pacific. By the end of the nineteenth century, Chinese
       people's resentment against foreigners in their land was high. The sale of foreign manufactured goods had
       hurt many Chinese artisans. The imperialists' building of railroads and bridges had put many porters, cart
       drivers, and ferriers out of work. Foreigners were not subject to Chinese law. Protestant and Catholic
       missionaries in the country were especially resented. They interfered with rituals for venerating ancestors,
       and families were sometimes split when some members became Christians and others did not. Rumors
       abounded concerning the missionaries' orphanages. One story, no doubt influenced by foreigners' interest in
       taking photographs, said missionaries took children in only to kill them and use their eyeballs to make the
       substance that captured images on photographic plates.
       In northern China, anti-foreign sentiments led to the formation of a secret society known as the Society of the
       Righteous and Harmonious Fists. Foreigners who witnessed the ritual exercises that members believed made
       them invulnerable to bullets called them Boxers. In 1899, the Boxers began their campaign to drive foreigners
       from China by killing two German priests. Violence swept through northern China as the Boxer Uprising flared.
       Boxers murdered foreigners and Chinese Christians and destroyed foreign property, sometimes disrupting
       railroads by pulling the steel rails from the ground.
       At first the Chinese army tried to stop the Boxers. However, in January 1900, believing foreign forces had
       invaded China to stop the uprising, the dowager empress Cixi proclaimed the Boxers should not be treated like
       criminals (Figure 9.29). Terrified foreigners streamed into Beijing seeking protection, but Cixi encouraged
       them to leave. Fearing for their lives, they barricaded themselves inside the embassies in the foreign quarter of
       Beijing. Cixi then proclaimed her allegiance to the Boxers and declared war on foreigners within China.

Swiftly Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Japan, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Italy formed the
Eight-Nation Alliance, and their troops raced to Beijing. Waiting for help, the foreigners rationed their food and
huddled in fear. One woman recalled hearing frenzied Boxers trying to dig through the building's wall to reach
the people inside. After a siege of fifty-five days, the international force arrived and the Boxers were dispersed,
killed, or captured. In September 1901, the Boxer Protocol was signed, officially ending the incident. China was
forbidden to import weapons for two years, and foreign legations were given the right to keep troops of their
own nation for their defense. China also awarded $330 million to the members of the Eight-Nation Alliance.
U.S. attempts to rule the Philippines after purchasing it from Spain were hindered by the resistance of many
Filipino tribes. Middle-class Filipinos had sought independence from Spanish control just as the Cubans had.
Following Spain's defeat, leaders of the independence movement like Emilio Aguinaldo had expected the
United States to allow them to rule themselves. When President William McKinley announced in 1898 that the
United States intended to govern the islands until the Filipinos were judged capable of ruling themselves,
Aguinaldo objected: "My relations with the United States did not bring me . . . to make war on the Spaniards for
their benefit, but for the purpose of our own liberty and independence."
The United States did not intend to relinquish control of its newly claimed territory, however, and war broke
out. Attempts by the Filipinos to defeat U.S. forces in conventional warfare failed, so they adopted guerrilla
tactics. Both sides tortured captives. U.S. soldiers burned villages to weaken civilians and guerrilla fighters
alike and built concentration camps to hold resisting Filipinos. Many starved or died from infectious disease.
In 1900, the United States began a "policy of attraction" by promising economic development along with a
degree of self-government. The policy drew the support of wealthy and middle-class Filipinos and others who
374 9 · Expansion in the Industrial Age

       did not support Aguinaldo's tactics. In 1901, Aguinaldo was captured, and the United States declared the war
       over in 1903. It was several decades before the Philippines gained independence.
       India's response to British imperialism was somewhat different. Violence had failed in the Sepoy Mutiny of
       1857, and middle-class Indians, especially those with a British-style education, now turned to political change.
       They were disappointed, however, because many British elites considered Indians unfit for self-government,
       and they feared losing control of their most valuable colony. In 1885, moderate nationalists founded the Indian
       National Congress (INC), aimed at enacting political reform. The INC especially wished to end unfair taxation
       and remove all British-imposed barriers to industrialization in India.

                                                                                                  IN THEIR OWN WORDS
        The Detriments of British Rule

         A moderate member of the Parsi religious minority and sometimes called the "Grand Old Man of India," Dadabhai
         Naoroji (Figure 9.30) was a merchant, political leader, and language professor at University College London. A
         founder of the Indian National Congress, he expressed the opinions of many middle-class Indians in 1871 when
         he wrote on the subject of the benefits and detriments of British rule of India. The following excerpt outlines the
         detriments.

        administration of their own country, which has much shaken confidence in the good faith of the British
        word. Political aspirations and the legitimate claim to have a reasonable voice in the legislation and the
        imposition and disbursement of taxes, met to a very slight degree, thus treating the natives of India not
        as British subjects, in whom representation is a birthright. Consequent on the above, an utter disregard
        of the feelings and views of the natives. The great moral evil of the drain of wisdom and practical
        administration, leaving none to guide the rising generation.

        Financially: All attention is engrossed in devising new modes of taxation, without any adequate effort to
        increase the means of the people to pay; and the consequent vexation and oppressiveness of the taxes
        imposed, imperial and local. Inequitable financial relations between England and India, i.e., the political
        debt [. . .] clapped on India's shoulders, and all home charges also. . . .

        To sum up the whole, the British rule has been: morally, a great blessing; politically, peace and order on
        one hand, blunders on the other; materially, impoverishment, relieved as far as the railway and other
        loans go. The natives call the British system Sakar ki Churi, the knife of sugar. That is to say, there is no
        oppression, it is all smooth and sweet, but it is the knife, notwithstanding. I mention this that you should
        know these feelings. Our great misfortune is that you do not know our wants. When you will know our
        real wishes, I have not the least doubt that you would do justice. The genius and spirit of the British
        people is fair play and justice.

The moderate approach did not suit all Indian nationalists, however. Bal Gangadhar Tilak called for immediate
independence from Britain, and in his newspaper he stated that Indians were justified in killing the British.
"Swaraj (self-rule) is my birthright and I shall have it," he proclaimed. When the British partitioned the
province of Bengal in 1905, making Bengali Hindus a minority group within the new divisions, the INC
supported a boycott of British-made goods and government schools, and acts of anti-British terrorism
occurred.

Fearing a radical turn would harm their cause, INC president Gopal Krishna Gokhale and other moderate
members called for the boycott to end when a new secretary of state for India was appointed whom they
believed was sympathetic. The Swadeshi movement calling upon Indians to purchase only Indian-made goods
continued, however, led by the Indian lawyer and political activist Mohandas Gandhi. Tilak supported the
Swadeshi movement, and in 1907 the INC split in two, with radicals aligning themselves with Tilak, Bipin
Chandra Pal, and Lala Lajput Rai (Figure 9.31).

Section Summary

9.1 The Second Industrial Revolution

In the second half of the nineteenth century, the world's industrialized nations--Britain, France, Belgium,
Germany, and the United States--entered the Second Industrial Revolution. They manufactured machines as
well as other items to be used for industry, such as steel, rubber, and chemicals. The Second Industrial
Revolution was indebted to new sources of power such as electricity and the internal combustion engine; new
methods of travel and communication were also developed. As the industrialized nations grew wealthier and
more powerful, other nations such as Canada, Italy, Russia, and Japan began to industrialize as well. Some
areas that also possessed industrial potential did not, however. India, Egypt, the countries of Latin America,
and China instead became export economies that provided raw materials and markets for the industrialized
world.

9.2 Motives and Means of Imperialism

The desire of industrialized nations for inexpensive raw materials led them to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific,
where they took control of lands and established colonies that existed solely to provide resources, markets, and
harbors for fleets of commercial steamships. Many tried to justify their overseas empires by claiming they
benefited the people in conquered lands, despite clear evidence that harm was done. The quest for colonies
was greatly aided by developments in medicine, transportation, and weapons technology.

9.3 Colonial Empires

In the second half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, the world's industrialized
nations claimed colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The "Scramble for Africa" resulted in nearly the entire
continent falling under European control. France built an empire in Indochina while Japan did so in Korea. At
times, the contest for colonies led the industrial powers to fight one another, as Japan and Russia did, and
Britain and Russia nearly came to blows over central Asia. These nations also claimed spheres of influence in
China, as did the United States. The islands of the Pacific were also quickly seized as imperial possessions, and
it was there that the United States acquired the bulk of its empire by taking possession of Hawaii, Guam, and
the Philippines.

9.4 Exploitation and Resistance

Colonization had a devastating effect on residents of African, Asian, and Pacific lands seized by imperial
powers. People were exploited for their labor, made to grow cash crops, collect rubber and ivory, and transport
European goods through difficult terrain. They received low wages if any, and failure to meet quotas was met
with harsh punishment. Colonizers brought infectious diseases with them, causing people and livestock to
sicken and die. People in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands fought back in ways that cost the lives of many. In
India, resistance took the form of political organization.

INTRODUCTION The Second Industrial Revolution, which began in the second half of the nineteenth century
and lasted until the start of World War I, brought about more than the economic developments that you
learned about in Expansion in the Industrial Age. In addition to radically changing national economies and
international trade, it also transformed the ways in which individuals lived and worked. Workplaces, homes,
cities, and the experiences of entertainment, art, and literature were completely reshaped. Even the family
underwent significant changes. This chapter focuses on the social and cultural transformations that
accompanied the technological innovations of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the effects on everyday life of the major innovations of the late nineteenth and early
             twentieth centuries

         · Analyze the ways in which technology and mechanization affected the industrial work experience
         · Explain how the working-class family changed because of industrialization
       Before the nineteenth century, life changed little from one era to the next. Generations of people worked on
       farms, rising when the sun did and going to sleep when it set. They had relatively little in the way of material
       possessions: clothing, furniture, tools. If they did not live on isolated farms, they inhabited small villages and
       usually did not venture far from the place where they were born. They raised enough food to feed themselves
       and sold any surplus in market towns, using their earnings to buy only the handcrafted goods they could not
       make for themselves. They had just a few years of schooling, if that. When they fell ill, they prayed because
       they knew there was little doctors could do. In the world's few large cities like London and Paris, scientific
       discoveries were made, but they had little effect on the majority of the population. Beautiful works of art were
       sculpted or painted, music composed, and poems written, but before the Industrial Revolution, most ordinary
       people never saw, heard, or read them. All that changed in the nineteenth century, as new forms of technology
       and new sources of power transformed the way people in industrialized nations lived.

The Industrial Workplace

Some of the most profound changes brought by industrialization were those that affected the workplace,
bringing new challenges while also transforming the nature of labor. During the Second Industrial Revolution,
new forms of energy were harnessed, transportation and communication became faster, and industrialized
nations mass-produced not only steel and industrial machinery, which had been the focus of prior industrial
efforts, but also consumer goods such as clothing, furniture, shoes, and packaged foods.

Perhaps the greatest change was the development of a new source of energy--electricity. Water power had
earlier replaced animal power, and steam engines fueled by burning coal had driven the machinery of the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. So too did electricity supplant steam by the end of the nineteenth
century. Electricity ran machinery on the factory floors, as did internal combustion engines powered by
petroleum. Electricity also turned night into day. When first oil lamps and then gas lights had illuminated the
workplace, workdays in the winter were often short. Dependent on daylight to see what they were doing,
workers were commonly allowed to go home after dark. With electric lights, though, the factory floor could be
lit twenty-four hours a day, and workers could labor long into the night in all seasons.

Electricity also powered factories' moving assembly lines. As conveyor belts brought interchangeable parts
from station to station, working-class employees added parts or made other adjustments until the product was
finished. The adoption of moving assembly lines made the close supervision of workers necessary. If anyone
slowed down or was missing, the entire production process could suffer. It was therefore vital that everyone be
present at the time the process began and maintain the same pace of work all day. While in earlier factories a
laborer might command a work gang composed of family members, in late nineteenth-century factories, these
male heads of family were replaced by paid foremen who were sometimes promoted from among the ranks of
the laborers.

Assembly lines and the mechanization of each step of the manufacturing process meant that, for the most
part, factory work was unskilled in nature. Laborers lived with the knowledge that should they give their
wealthy employer reason to be displeased with their performance, they could be replaced at any moment.
Some work, like the repairing of machines, was skilled, and workers who possessed such knowledge received
higher wages. Most, though, performed repetitive tasks that anyone could master with a bit of instruction. The
assembly line reduced employees' sense of contribution to the finished process and rendered work boring and
repetitive, almost transforming workers into machines themselves.

In addition to feeling alienated from the product of their labor, industrial employees worked long hours and
earned low wages. As industrialization spread throughout North America, Europe, and Japan, business
owners, driven by their hunger for profit, responded to increased competition by forcing their employees to
produce more, tending more machines for lower pay.

Nineteenth-century workers commonly toiled ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week. In 1897 in Russia,
reform laws reduced the workday from fourteen hours (and sometimes as many as eighteen) to only eleven
and a half. During night shifts and on Saturdays and the days before feast days, workers could stop after ten
hours. Luckily for the subjects of the tsar, the majority of Russian factory workers could look forward to nearly
one hundred holidays per year. They would have been envied by Japan's cotton spinners, teenaged women who
often worked for seventeen-hour stretches punctuated only by short breaks.

Adult men were the most highly paid workers. Adult women earned about half as much, and children less than
adults, often only a quarter of an adult male's pay. Work was not always steady; workplaces sometimes shut
down unexpectedly when raw materials or work orders fell short. This meant that low pay was often
accompanied by periodic unemployment, for which workers had no safety net. Most governments did not
provide unemployment insurance, and government-subsidized housing for the poor did not exist. When
workers lost their jobs, they were forced to turn to religious institutions or private charities for money for food
and rent.
384 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       In addition to periodic shutdowns, international economic crises sometimes jeopardized the livelihoods of
       workers across the globe. In 1873, for example, a fall in the value of silver set off a worldwide financial panic,
       beginning a period known as the Long Depression. Banks failed, and more than one hundred railroads went
       out of business in the United States in the first year alone. The economies--and the workers--of Germany,
       France, Austria-Hungary, Britain, and Russia suffered as well. In May 1873, the Vienna Stock Exchange
       collapsed (Figure 10.3). Railroads failed in Germany. Unemployment rates in Britain's coal, iron, steel, and
       shipbuilding industries soared. Between 1873 and the end of the century, periodic recessions and depressions
       alternated with boom periods, rocking economies around the world.

       FIGURE 10.3 Black Friday. On May 9, 1873, dubbed "Black Friday," the Vienna stock market collapsed, causing
       widespread panic as illustrated by this wood engraving made that year. (credit: "Black Friday on May 9, 1873" by Die
       Presse Edition/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Despite such economic swings, industrial production increased overall, and factory owners faced a growing
       number of competitors. They responded by increasing the pace of work. Employees often tended several
       machines at a time, which kept them constantly on their feet. In the late nineteenth century, new methods
       were introduced to speed work even more. The principles of scientific management, introduced by Frederick
       Winslow Taylor in 1911 and often referred to as Taylorism, sought to improve productivity by reducing
       wasteful movements. One scientific management proponent, Harrington Emerson, claimed that U.S. railroads
       could save $1 million per day (about $13 million today) if they adopted these principles.
       Discovering how workers could perform more efficiently often meant timing their movements with
       stopwatches to make sure they did not attach parts or move levers inefficiently. Even in workplaces that had
       not been Taylorized, the emphasis was on paying strict attention to work and speeding up the production
       process. Some factories forbade workers to talk to one another or to sit at their machines, even if they could.
       Workers greatly resented such controls.
       The pace and long hours of mechanized labor took a toll on workers' health and safety. Injuries were common.
       Fingers and hands were often lost to moving machine parts. Constant standing resulted in back problems,
       swollen feet, and miscarriages. In textile factories, inhaled fibers caused breathing problems that left workers
       permanently disabled. The constant noise of machinery led to hearing loss. Summer temperatures combined
       with the heat generated by machinery and moving bodies left workers on the brink of heat exhaustion.
       Laborers in Japan's silk industry were often scalded while boiling silkworm cocoons. Toxic chemicals used in
       largely unregulated production processes also played havoc with workers' health and safety. In some places,
       workers, especially women, were beaten by their supervisors; young women sent to work in the Japanese
       cotton industry by their impoverished parents were often caned or whipped.

"Phossy Jaw"

In 1943, Dr. Alice Hamilton was reflecting on her earlier career investigating the causes of illness and injury
among industrial workers. As Hamilton relates, American physicians had told her repeatedly that the seriously
disabling conditions that afflicted many European workers, such as "phossy jaw" (Figure 10.4), a condition
caused by accidentally ingesting the phosphorous used to coat the heads of matches, did not exist in the United
States.

FIGURE 10.4 Phossy Jaw. (a, b) This set of undated photographs depicts a Dutch woman whose lower jaw has
been eaten away by phosphorus, a condition commonly known as "phossy jaw." The use of phosphorus for match
production in the Netherlands was banned in 1901. (credit a and b: modification of work "Occupational Disease:
Phosphorus Necrosis, front and side views" by Nationaal Archief (Dutch National Archives)/Wikimedia Commons,
CC0 1.0)
Hamilton quickly discovered, however, that her colleagues were incorrect:

      Living in a working-class quarter, coming in contact with laborers and their wives, I could not fail to hear
      tales of the dangers that workingmen faced, of cases of carbon-monoxide gassing in the great steel
      mills, of painters disabled by lead palsy, of pneumonia and rheumatism among the men in the
      stockyards. Illinois then had no legislation providing compensation for accident or disease caused by
      occupation. . . . There was a striking occurrence about this time in Chicago which brought vividly before
      me the unprotected, helpless state of workingmen who were held responsible for their own safety. [. . .]
      Phossy jaw is a very distressing form of industrial disease. It comes from breathing the fumes of white
      or yellow phosphorus, which gives off fumes at room temperature, or from putting into the mouth food
      or gum or fingers smeared with phosphorus. Even drinking from a glass which has stood on the
      workbench is dangerous. The phosphorus penetrates into a defective tooth and down through the roots
      to the jawbone, killing the tissue cells which then become the prey of suppurative germs from the
      mouth, and abscesses form. The jaw swells and the pain is intense. . . . Sometimes the abscess forms in
      the upper jaw and works up into the orbit, causing the loss of an eye. In severe cases one lower jawbone
      may have to be removed, or an upper jawbone--perhaps both. [. . .]
      All this I had learned, but I had been assured by medical men, who claimed to know, that there was no
      phossy jaw in the United States because American match factories were so scrupulously clean. Then in
      1908 John Andrews . . . showed me the report of his investigation of American match factories and his
386 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

               discovery of more than 150 cases of phossy jaw. . . . Some of the cases he discovered were quite as
               severe as the worst reported in European literature--the loss of jawbones, of an eye, sometimes death
               from blood poisoning.

               --Alice Hamilton, "The Poisonous Occupations in Illinois"

           · What conditions within industrial workplaces likely exposed workers to phosphorous? What steps could
               employers have taken to prevent this problem? Why might employers not have provided safer working
               conditions for employees?

           · Why might American doctors have been reluctant to admit that industrial poisoning was a problem for
               American workers?

       Despite low pay, long hours, and difficult conditions of factory work, many working-class people preferred it to
       other types of available labor. Jobs like driving wagons and unloading ships were also low-paying jobs but
       required working outside in all kinds of weather. Railroad workers were vulnerable to incapacitating injuries
       from being caught between railcars or falling under their wheels. Miners toiled in dark, cramped
       environments, where temperatures sometimes rose so high they had to work naked to keep from passing out.
       Cave-ins were a constant threat. Industrial labor, regardless of the type, was also more highly paid than
       agricultural labor. For example, in London in the 1860s, a male common laborer who possessed no particular
       skills could earn about twenty shillings a week. In industries not yet mechanized, skilled crafts workers, all
       men, earned thirty shillings a week. A male English farmhand at the time would have earned approximately
       fourteen shillings a week.

       Factory work was especially desirable to unmarried women, whose most common alternative was domestic
       service. Living in their employers' homes, domestic workers were expected to be available at all times of the
       day and night, were constantly watched, and made very little money. Factory workers put in fewer hours, and
       after work their time was their own. Their freedom was sometimes dearly bought, however. On the factory
       floor, unmarried young women might be sexually harassed by male employers, supervisors, or coworkers.

       Because women were paid less than men, unmarried women did not earn enough to live independently. They
       tended to live at home, where they were expected to give their wages to their parents and accept a small
       allowance in return. Even if they rented living quarters with other female workers and shared expenses, they
       might grant sexual favors to young men in exchange for meals or clothes, a form of casual prostitution known
       as "treating." Nevertheless, many young female factory workers enjoyed relative independence before
       marriage, free evenings and Sundays when the factories were closed, and the inexpensive entertainment
       found in industrial cities.

       new pair of shoes.

      The Industrial Home

       Industrialization brought profound changes to countries like Britain, France, Germany, and the United States.
       In the latter nineteenth century, western nations like these, already skilled in the production of textiles and
       iron rails, applied machine technology to the mass-production of consumer goods, the new availability of
       which changed people's lives.

       The wealthy and the middle class consisted of professionals such as doctors and lawyers as well as factory
       managers, bank employees, salespeople, engineers, and scientists. They had always been able to afford the

handmade products of skilled dressmakers, tailors, shoemakers, jewelers, and cabinetmakers that were
beyond the reach of simple laborers. Now, however, factories produced clothing, shoes, cookware, furniture,
soap, toys, books, musical instruments, and costume jewelry in such quantities that they could be sold at
prices the working class could afford. Working families could buy bedsteads, tables, and chairs that imitated in
style those of the middle class. They could decorate their homes with inexpensive prints of famous works of
art. Soap, not easily made by city dwellers because the required animal fat was not always available, was now
mass-produced and simple to buy. City dwellers could readily keep themselves and their clothes clean, which
in turn improved personal health and comfort. By the end of the nineteenth century in industrialized
countries, workers' real wages, wages measured in terms of the amount of goods and services they can
purchase, had risen so that most people could buy the consumer goods turned out by European and American
factories.
An abundance of food was produced on farms and ranches that employed mass-produced agricultural
machinery (Figure 10.5). This food was then transported to cities in refrigerated railcars and processed in
urban factories, slaughterhouses, and canneries, giving people access to canned meat, fish, fruits, and
vegetables all year round. Sugar obtained from colonial possessions was inexpensive and plentiful, and sweet
treats were widely available.

FIGURE 10.5 Mechanical Reaper. An advertisement from 1875 promotes the use of the mechanical reaper to
harvest grain. (credit: "Champion Trade Card, 1875" by Wisconsin Historical Society/Wikimedia Commons, Public
Domain)
This food was sometimes a mixed blessing. The slaughterhouses in which meat was processed were often
filthy, and canned meat was sometimes found to contain maggots. To keep vegetables bright and colorful in the
can, dyes were added; green dye was made with arsenic and was notoriously poisonous. Mass-produced bread
from an urban bakery might contain chalk dust or alum for bulk. Undoubtedly, fresh and unadulterated food
would have been healthier and tastier, but packaged and processed foods at least provided the calories
necessary for survival, and many workers did not have to settle for the bare necessities. A study of American
laborers in 1874 revealed that they ate fresh meat every day. Just before the start of World War I in 1914,
members of the German working class protested the increase of food prices in Berlin because it threatened
their regular consumption of meat and wheat bread, which was considered superior to bread made with other
grains.
Advances in science and technology contributed to survival. New medical instruments and processes, such as
the ophthalmoscope and the x-ray, improved the diagnosis of injury and disease. Pharmaceuticals and
anesthetics arrived, such as aspirin to relieve pain and fever and mass-produced quinine to treat malaria. The
discovery by Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur of the first disease-causing pathogens, or "germs," led to new
vaccines that protected animals against anthrax and rabies, and humans against cholera and diphtheria.
388 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       Pasteur's discoveries also led to the pasteurization of milk beginning in the 1860s, making it safer to drink by
       heating it to destroy pathogens. The development of the antiseptic method by Joseph Lister in the 1860s and
       the identification of human blood types in 1901, which made safe blood transfusions possible, transformed the
       practice of surgery.
       Changes in sanitation also improved the cleanliness, comfort, and health of people of all classes. Water pipes
       brought fresh water to cities from the surrounding countryside and into the homes of the wealthy and middle
       class. This access to clean water dramatically reduced the incidence of diseases such as cholera and typhoid
       fever. Mass-produced bathroom fixtures made it easier for the wealthy and the middle class to stay clean, and
       the development of flush toilets and the laying of sewer pipe made homes, streets, and cities more sanitary.
       The Second Industrial Revolution introduced new methods of illumination. At the beginning of the century,
       candles and kerosene lamps lit homes and workplaces, and gas lighting was still new. London installed its first
       gas streetlights in 1807, and by midcentury, more cities had adopted them; in 1860 Berlin had 250. Many
       wealthy and middle-class homes, as well as some working-class homes, had indoor gas fixtures as well. By the
       1880s, most British families could rely on gas both to illuminate and heat their homes and to cook their food.
       Gas had a number of drawbacks, however. It produced a relatively dim light, and it smelled. Gas lines had a
       dangerous tendency to explode, and if people blew out the flames of gas lights without remembering to also
       stop the flow of gas from the line, entire households could be suffocated as they slept.
       Electricity transformed everything (Figure 10.6). Electric light was clear, bright, and relatively safe. People
       could stay up in the evenings to read or study. Night life became possible. Paris installed electric streetlights in
       1875, Berlin in 1882, and Mexico City in 1897. Brightly lit amusement parks and urban pleasure gardens were
       magical places for city dwellers to enjoy.

the standard of living for many people. A new cult of cleanliness developed among the middle class because
indoor plumbing and improved heating made bathing easier. By the beginning of the twentieth century, more
middle-class homes had rooms set aside for bathing.

New and improved appliances also changed life at home. Cookstoves with ovens and surfaces that could be
heated to different temperatures made it possible to prepare multiple dishes at the same time. Built-in
reservoirs in stoves kept water hot, and improved washing machines (e.g., mangles that used rollers to squeeze
out water) made it easier to launder clothes. In the early twentieth century, motor-powered vacuum cleaners
made it easier to clean floors. These developments undoubtedly contributed to the comfort of the middle class,
but they also raised expectations for middle-class women, whose chief job was to care for the home. Now that
elaborate meals could be prepared every day, they became the expectation. Now that it was easier to clean the
family's clothes and home, it was unacceptable for them to be dirty.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the stresses caused by infectious disease and poor
diets--the results of low wages and unsanitary living conditions--reduced life expectancy and increased infant
mortality rates. However, in the second half of the nineteenth century, life expectancies increased, and infant
mortality decreased. For example, in Germany, which began to industrialize in the middle of the nineteenth
century, infant mortality rates first increased as the country began to industrialize but then started to decline
in the 1870s. Other changes also revealed the benefits that industrialization could bring. Between 1876 and
1901, life expectancy for a German man rose from thirty-four to forty-five years. A German woman born in
1876 could expect to live until she was thirty-seven years old; the average German woman born in 1901 lived
to be forty-eight years old.

Taken together, improved sanitation, reliable access to food, and better medical care reduced death rates and
made life more comfortable in industrialized nations. Although the wealthy and the middle class were best
situated to take advantage, the working class benefited as well. Workers could afford inexpensive food and
clothing, and in many places free clinics provided the poor with health care. While workers might not all have
running water and flush toilets in their homes, by the end of the nineteenth century, water taps in the street or
in the basements of apartment houses, shared hallway sinks, and communal toilets allowed the working class
to benefit from clean water and more sanitary streets. Although usually only the wealthy and the middle class
could afford electric lighting in their homes, electricity illuminated city streets and protected the working class
as they peddled wares at night or returned home from work at late hours.

The Family in the Industrial Age

As people moved from small farms and country villages to cities and factory towns, their lives changed in ways
both small and profound. On farms and in artisans' workshops, women and children had labored alongside
husbands and fathers and contributed to the family's income. They did not always have similar opportunities
in the industrial city.

Early in the Industrial Revolution, women and children worked in factories, but by the end of the nineteenth
century, this situation had changed. Although increasing mechanization meant that workers needed less
physical strength, the presence of women and children in the workplace declined. Because wages were low,
adult men still often needed the assistance of wives and children to pay the rent and purchase necessities, but
less of this work now took place in factories. It became a point of pride for working-class men to keep their
wives at home as the middle class did, even if the women were working. Married women also preferred to stay
home when possible; tending to home and children was difficult while also working long hours in factories.

Indeed, many male laborers blamed women's willingness to accept low wages for keeping their own pay low,
and they sought to push women out of the workplace. In the United States and western Europe, children also
had largely ceased working in most factories by the beginning of the twentieth century. Greater mechanization
of the workplace eliminated the jobs that children had once been employed to do. Increasingly, too,
governments passed laws that attempted to ban child labor. In some cases, this effort was motivated by the
390 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       desire of upper-middle-class politicians to protect children while failing to understand the extent to which a
       working-class family might rely on their wages. At other times, politicians worried that children whose days
       were spent in factories would become physically inadequate soldiers or illiterate and uneducated citizens.
       Britain, the first nation to industrialize, led the way in eliminating child labor. The Factory Act of 1819 limited
       children's work to twelve hours a day. The Factory Act of 1833 prohibited children younger than nine from
       working in textile factories, the most common type of factory in Britain at that time. Children under fourteen
       were restricted to working eight hours a day and were required to receive two hours of schooling each day.
       Those fourteen and older could work only twelve hours a day. All children were given an hour for lunch.
       In 1839, Prussia's Child Labor Act banned factory employment for children under nine and limited shifts for
       factory workers under sixteen to ten hours. Children were also banned from working in factories at night. Such
       laws were widely evaded, however, by working-class families who needed children's income and by employers
       who sought inexpensive labor. Many politicians also opposed such legislation, not only because it interfered
       with business but also because it deprived men of the right to govern their families.
       In the face of such opposition to limits on it, child labor continued until laws requiring compulsory education
       helped to move children from factories to schoolrooms. By the end of the nineteenth century, new laws in the
       United States and western and central Europe mandated schooling, largely eliminating formal wage work by
       children under the age of fourteen. In places like Russia and Japan, where industrialization had begun later,
       married women and young children continued to work outside the home. In Japan, for example, more than 70
       percent of married women from the lowest level of the working class (the hinmin) worked outside the home in
       1911, but just ten years later, only 44 percent did.
       The result of these changes was that by the beginning of the twentieth century in the United States, France,
       Great Britain, and Germany, working-class wives tended to supplement the family's income by working at
       home, not outside it. Unmarried women and those whose husbands were disabled or absent still sought factory
       work, but married women more commonly earned money in ways that did not require them to leave the home.
       Some cared for the children of working neighbors and took in laundry. If the family's living space were large
       enough, they might take in boarders, who often slept with the children, and the woman of the house would
       cook and clean for them as well as for her own family. Many women did piecework at home, compensated
       based on the number of items produced. They collected materials from local businesses and assembled small
       items like toys, costume jewelry, or artificial flowers. Some stitched together items of clothing. They were often
       joined by their children, who might also hawk newspapers and peddle wares on the street (Figure 10.7).

Family size was also affected by these changes in the nature of work. In the United States, France, Great
Britain, and Germany, by the beginning of the nineteenth century middle-class families had reduced the
number of children they had. On the farm, in craft shops, and in early factories, children's labor was still
valuable, so the working classes continued to have large families. By the second half of the century, however,
children could no longer earn their keep alongside their parents in the factory and instead had to be fed and
clothed during their school years from a smaller pool of money. They then became an expense many working-
class families could not afford. The inadequate and overcrowded urban housing available to the industrial
working class also made large families undesirable.
Innovations in birth control at this time enabled working-class parents to limit the number of children they
had, just as the middle-class did. Vulcanized rubber made for more comfortable and reliable condoms, as well
as cervical caps and early forms of diaphragms called "womb veils." New printing techniques allowed the
mass-production of pamphlets instructing women in how to limit family size. In 1877, the Malthusian League,
which advocated the use of contraception, was founded in Great Britain. It was named for Thomas Malthus,
who had advocated limiting births in the late eighteenth century in order to prevent the human population
from growing beyond the capacity of the land to support it. Although Malthus himself had opposed the use of
contraceptive devices, Britons like Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant in the 1870s, and Marie Stopes in the
early twentieth century, advocated for their use. In the United States, Margaret Sanger, a visiting nurse who
cared for working-class women in New York and witnessed the detrimental effects on their health of repeated
pregnancies, championed birth control, a term she popularized, as Stopes was doing the same in Britain.
In those parts of Europe where the Catholic Church was powerful and the use of contraceptive devices was
frowned upon, women married later in order to avoid early childbearing. Beginning in the 1870s, working-
class families began to shrink in size, and by the start of the twentieth century, the average family size for
laborers had dropped from four to six children to two to four, only slightly larger than among the middle class.
392 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       This reduction in family size caused by falling birth rates in industrialized nations is called the demographic
       transition.

       The main job of nearly all city children at this time was education. The industrialized world called for skills
       that could be learned only in school. Achieving middle-class status depended on obtaining a job for which at
       least a secondary school education was needed, and providing one for their children was an important goal for
       middle-class parents seeking to maintain their position in the world. By the end of the nineteenth century,
       some members of the middle class, especially young men, attended college, but education beyond secondary
       school was reserved largely for the sons of the wealthy.

       Aspirational members of the working class sought to keep their children in school until they had completed
       the elementary grades, where they acquired basic literacy and learned arithmetic. Some children also
       attended a few years of secondary school, where they were introduced to mathematics, history, and perhaps a
       modern or classical language like Latin. A job that required little beyond a basic education, such as store clerk,
       cashier, or bookkeeper, could raise a child into the higher levels of the working class. If a daughter were to
       complete secondary school and become a teacher, she crossed the threshold into the lower ranks of the middle
       class.

       By the end of the nineteenth century, industrialized societies had created systems of public education that
       were able to instill basic literacy in a majority of their populations. In Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands,
       nearly all people were literate by 1910. Ninety percent of adult Japanese men could read. More than 80 percent
       of the French and Belgian populations could as well. Even in countries that were slower to industrialize, like
       Italy, by the beginning of the twentieth century, more than half the population could read.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:
         · Describe the benefits of living in a city in the Second Industrial Revolution
         · Analyze the problems of city life and their relationship to industrialization
         · Identify cultural and artistic movements of the Second Industrial Revolution

       Hand in hand with industrialization went the process of urbanization. Industrial cities grew by leaps and
       bounds as workers streamed from the countryside and from overseas to find work in factories and other places
       of employment. City life was challenging, especially for those whose only experience of urban life had been
       their nearby market town. The rapidity with which growth and change took place often made it difficult to plan
       for the orderly development of cities. As a result, cities were dirty and overcrowded. However, they did offer
       exciting opportunities and benefits not available in the countryside.

      The Benefits of Life in the Industrial City

       In the nineteenth century, people came to industrial cities largely to find work. Some were also attracted by the
       excitement of city life. There were many drawbacks to living in nineteenth-century cities, but there were
       benefits too.

       One of the advantages was the wealth of opportunities for leisure and recreation, some of which could be found
       only in cities. For instance, for the wealthy elite and the growing middle class--the sales representatives,
       engineers, accountants, and managers on whom industrialization was so dependent--there were libraries and
       bookstores. Many libraries were subscription libraries that loaned books only to dues-paying members, but
       free libraries also existed in communities ranging from large cities such as Boston, New York, London, Paris,
       Berlin, Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tokyo, and Kyoto to small towns like Peterborough, New Hampshire.
       Newspapers abounded; every city published at least one, and some had many more. Theaters staged concerts,
       plays, ballets, and operas for the wealthy and middle class, but often the working class could observe the action
       and listen to the music. Even the city of Manaus in the depths of the Brazilian rain forest featured an opera

house, built between 1885 and 1892, where rubber barons and the wealthy bankers and merchants who
served them could attend operas, plays, and concerts.
Members of the working class had other options for entertainment. Music halls in Britain, burlesque theaters
in the United States, and cabarets in Paris featured young women singing and dancing. More often than not,
skirts were kicked in the air, an exciting prospect at a time when women's dresses covered the tops of their
shoes. Dance halls attracted men and women every night. Even after long days in factories and offices, young
city dwellers found the energy to dance, and many dances, like the tango, which emerged in the 1880s in the
dance halls of Buenos Aires, were developed and popularized by working-class men and women.
By the end of the nineteenth century, cities offered yet more forms of entertainment that even the working
class could afford. Arcades contained machines that enabled people to watch short films for a small sum. Early
movie theaters appeared in cities at the end of the century, featuring silent films with simple story lines.
Amusement parks, lavishly decorated with electric lights and steam-powered rides, appeared at the end of
streetcar and rail lines. Attractions such as roller coasters, Ferris wheels, and target shooting commonly
offered visceral thrills like flying through the air or served as outlets for aggression. For men and women used
to boring, repetitive labor and forced to suppress their resentment while on the job, the attraction was obvious.
Some parks, like Copenhagen's Tivoli (Denmark) and Coney Island's Dreamland (New York), appealed more
strongly to families because they were considered more sedate and refined. Dreamland sought to provide a
supposedly educational experience by reproducing Swiss landscapes and Venetian canals for visitors (Figure
10.8). It also featured shows with biblical themes that warned of the punishment for sin.

builder favored. From one vantage spot, visitors could see architectural styles typical of various European countries.

Among the delights of city life was shopping. Public transportation and the mass production of consumer
goods aided in the creation of the modern department store, with enticing window displays, a wide variety of
goods, and electrical illumination. All the world's major industrialized cities possessed at least one such grand
store. Philadelphia had Wanamaker's, London boasted Selfridge's, New York had Stewart's and Macy's, and in
Paris it was Le Bon Marché (Figure 10.9). Mitsukoshi and Matsuzakaya in Tokyo introduced another innovation
394 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       to Japanese society, which normally required people to go unshod indoors: Customers could wear their shoes
       inside the stores.

       FIGURE 10.9 The Bon Marché and Wanamaker's. The Bon Marché department store (a) was a favorite place for
       Parisians to shop. Management went to great lengths to make customers happy, even maintaining a fleet of horse-
       drawn conveyances to drive them home. Opening to crowds during the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, Wanamaker's
       (b) in Philadelphia was modeled on the European open-air market, like Les Halles in Paris. In 1878, Wanamaker's

       Along with housework and childcare, consumption was an important part of the lives of middle-class women
       during the Second Industrial Revolution. Stores enticed them with tearooms and ladies' lounges, where they
       could rest should shopping tire them. Department stores also gave young working-class women opportunities
       for employment in clean, safe settings. Even those who could not afford to purchase the goods could still
       delight in looking at them; thus, window shopping was born. The inherent pleasure of the pastime is captured
       in the French term lecher les vitrines, literally, "licking the window glass." By acquainting visitors with the
       latest styles, department stores helped to shape a developing consumer culture.

      The Challenges of Life in the Industrial City

       Although city life brought many benefits, it also posed challenges for people of all classes. The first was finding
       a place to live. Urban populations grew quickly in the second half of the nineteenth century as people flocked
       to the industrial city from the countryside and abroad. By the middle of the century, more British people lived
       in cities and towns than in rural areas. Housing construction did not keep up, and cities and living spaces were
       often cramped and crowded.
       Many of the middle class moved to the new suburbs that sprang up around cities, using horse-drawn or
       electrified streetcars to travel to work. For working-class people, options were more limited. Laborers with
       families often attempted to live on the edges of cities like London, away from the dirt, crowds, and noise. As
       urban areas grew, however, these neighborhoods were often absorbed into the city proper. If you could not
       afford to live far away from the city, soon enough the city would find you.

This is an online archive of newspaper articles (https://openstax.org/l/77EastEnd) describing London's East
End, a poor neighborhood. Most of the articles are from the 1880s, when the serial killer Jack the Ripper
hunted his victims there.

Regardless of the city, housing was problematic and usually in short supply. Families with children might find
themselves occupying only two or three rooms. Cooking, eating, working, and socializing frequently took place
in the same space. Separate areas might be reserved for sleeping and for visiting, but they were cramped as
well. A bed for yourself--let alone a room--was an unrealizable dream for members of the working class.
Family members might even share a bed with boarders.
Housing configurations varied according to place. In British cities, the preference was for single-family
dwellings; houses were narrow, with one room on the ground floor, another on top, and perhaps a third above
that. Skilled workers might be able to afford houses with two rooms on the bottom floor and more above. They
might even have a small garden. In France and the United States, the preference was for apartment buildings.
In the United States, these might be built side by side with several apartments per floor; each working-class
family occupied two or three rooms, and apartments on the inside walls might lack fresh air and daylight. In
France, the working class might inhabit the same apartment houses as middle-class families but not the same
floors. The middle class lived on the second floor (the étage noble), and other families lived above them in
descending order of rank as they approached the roof; the very poorest lived in the attic where they baked in
the summer, froze in the winter, and were regularly rained upon (Figure 10.10).

       The very worst-off might live in dark basement apartments that flooded when it rained. Others might occupy a
       single room in what was once a large middle-class home and was now an apartment house occupied by
       numerous families. Sometimes living spaces were so small as to be almost unimaginable. In 1901, an unskilled
       kozukai (errand man) in Tokyo shared a 100-square-foot room with his wife and two teenage children. Other
       Japanese lived in even smaller spaces. The poorest laborers rented floor space by the night in a common
       sleeping room and had to battle other sleepers for the privilege. Bedding was provided only for a fee, and
       bedbugs and lice were abundant.
       Some members of the working class might be provided with housing by their employers. The American
       railroad car manufacturer George Pullman built a model town for his employees in 1884, on the south side of
       Chicago near the plant where his famous sleeping cars were produced. Workers were not required to live in the
       town, but it provided amenities they would likely not have been able to afford elsewhere. There were parks, a
       store, a church, a school, a library, and a theater. Employees used their wages to pay their rent and to buy what
       they needed at the store. Each worker's home featured gas lighting and indoor plumbing, and trash was
       collected every day. Pullman believed that housing his workers in a clean, orderly environment would make
       them more productive. He also believed that by providing them with a decent standard of living, he could
       prevent strikes or worse forms of unrest. By 1893, about twelve thousand people lived in the town.
       There were problems, however. Workers were never allowed to purchase their homes, which Pullman's agents
       inspected at random to make sure they were kept clean and well maintained. Workers who lost their jobs were
       evicted with their families. All were expected to attend church on Sundays. Pullman chose the books to be kept
       in the library and the plays to be performed in the theater. There was no saloon. In 1894, Pullman cut
       employees' wages in the wake of an economic depression and laid off many workers. However, he refused to
       lower their rents, which were already higher than those in the surrounding area. The workers saw no
       alternative but to go on strike. Other U.S. business owners, like chocolate king Milton Hershey and piano

manufacturer Henry Steinway, also built model towns for their employees for the same reasons Pullman had.

European employers also provided towns for their workers. The first such towns were Copley and Saltaire, in
Britain, both founded in the middle of the nineteenth century. In northern Italy, the Crespi family built the
town of Crespi d'Adda in 1878 for workers at its textile factory. In addition to single-family houses with
gardens, the town had a school, a clinic, a church, and a theater. To encourage a sense of equality among the
workers, all the houses were the same except those belonging to the factory manager, the clinic's doctor, and
the priest. Towns for miners and factory workers were also established in Germany, Denmark, Sweden,
Finland, and northeastern Spain. Some were intended simply to provide housing for workers employed by
mines or mills located in rural areas. Others, like Port Sunlight and Bourneville in England, were meant to
provide not just a place to live but a model community for the working class.

Some laborers were housed in the factories at which they worked. Workers in the Japanese textile industry,
most of whom were young unmarried women and teenage girls, lived in dormitories owned by the factories in
places like Osaka. Many Russian workers also lived in barracks in the factories where they labored in Moscow
and Saint Petersburg. Several families might share a single room. Single men slept in bunks arranged side by
side to the ceiling with no privacy. When factories lacked space, workers might sleep in shifts, and single
women and families might sleep in the single men's dormitories as well.

Just as great as the challenge of overcrowding and poor housing was the problem of dirt. Some cities had
alleviated many aspects of this problem by the end of the nineteenth century, but others remained. The major
source of dirt in the nineteenth century was waste--factory waste, human waste, and animal waste, especially
horse manure. As cities grew larger, public transportation became a necessity. The solution most cities settled
on was horse-drawn streetcars and omnibuses. Thousands of urban dwellers made use of them.

These forms of public transport, however, meant the introduction of more horses, beyond those needed to pull
freight wagons and the carriages of the wealthy, and horses fouled the cities' streets. The average horse
produces thirty to fifty pounds of manure each day. In 1878, there were approximately 78,000 horses in Paris.
At about this time, horses dropped some 600,000 tons of manure in Chicago's thoroughfares each year. When
they died in harness, their bodies were often left to rot in the streets. To horse manure and carcasses was
added the waste of humans who lacked indoor toilets in their homes and did not wish to visit outdoor latrines
in the dark. The buckets and chamber pots they filled during the night were often emptied into the streets in
the morning along with kitchen waste. The piles of garbage and manure attracted rats and flies.

This problem was somewhat alleviated when new forms of public transportation appeared. Commuter railway
lines that transported middle-class people to and from the suburbs actually increased the number of horses in
cities at first, because horse-drawn streetcars were needed to transport commuters from rail stations to their
destinations within the city. It was only with the electrification of streetcar lines and the building of
underground railroads in the late nineteenth century that cities started to become cleaner. New York City
introduced electrified streetcars in 1881. Prague did so in 1891, and London in 1901.

Although London lagged in introducing electric streetcars, it was a pioneer in building underground railroads,
opening the world's first subway, the Metropolitan line of the London Underground system, in 1863. Other
cities quickly followed. Glasgow and Budapest opened their undergrounds in 1896, as did Paris in 1900, New
York in 1904, and Buenos Aires in 1913. These modes of transportation also had the benefit of being faster and
less expensive than conveyances that traveled on crowded surface streets.

As for water, urban factories, slaughterhouses, and tanneries often dumped waste directly into nearby bodies
of water. Through the process of capillary action, contaminated water and liquefying waste, like that deposited
in latrines, could travel to the sources of public drinking water. As a result, this water was dirty and sometimes
smelled worse than the streets. The stockyards and slaughterhouses of Chicago tossed the manure, blood, and
unused organs of cows, sheep, and pigs into a fork of the Chicago River. The methane gases produced from the
decomposing organic matter caused bubbles to rise to the surface, giving this stretch of the river the name
398 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       Bubbly Creek (Figure 10.11). The amount of waste produced by the stockyards and slaughterhouses was so
       great that people traveling to Chicago by train in the middle of the night reportedly could smell the city long
       before they saw it.

       FIGURE 10.11 Bubbly Creek. In this 1911 photograph, a man stands on an island formed by solidified waste in
       Chicago's Bubbly Creek. The waste surrounding the creek was so deep that observers reported seeing chickens sink
       into it and disappear from sight. (credit: "Bubbly Creek" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Flush toilets prevented human waste from being deposited in backyard latrines or tossed into the streets, but
       they were only part of the solution. The waste still needed to be disposed of somewhere. In too many cities,
       household drains simply carried it to sewer systems that ultimately dumped it into the same rivers from which
       water for drinking and bathing was taken. By 1858, six feet of waste had piled up along the banks of the
       Thames in London, and the stench was so intense that custodians at the Houses of Parliament covered the
       windows with curtains soaked in chloride of lime, a disinfectant, to keep the politicians inside from passing
       out. The smell was dubbed the Great Stink, and carbolic acid, another disinfectant, was poured into the river to
       alleviate the problem.
       The Great Stink inspired the rebuilding of London's sewer system by railway engineer Joseph Bazalgette
       between 1859 and 1875, as shown in Figure 10.12(a). Bazalgette was knighted for his work. The disposal of
       London's sewage was further refined when the city began purifying waste at two major pumping systems in the
       1880s and then transporting it to be dumped in the North Sea, a process that continued until 1998. Other
       cities built similar systems over the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Some cities
       even established public toilets, as shown in Figure 10.12(b).

City air was also dirty in the late nineteenth century. Coal was burned to generate both steam power and
electricity, and coal smoke plagued industrial cities as they grew in size. Soot lay upon every surface, including
people's clothing. Anyone who accidentally left windows open found their furniture covered with it. London
residents noted how air pollution transformed the color of sunsets. For some this was a mark of pride, and
schoolchildren in Osaka, Japan, learned that their hometown was "the City of Smoke."
Hard on the heels of dirty streets, water, and air came disease. Respiratory problems caused by the inhalation
of coal smoke affected many in the nineteenth century. Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma were
common. Approximately one-third of child deaths in nineteenth-century England were attributed to
respiratory ailments. Throughout the century, waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid claimed
thousands of lives in the cities. Both these illnesses, which kill through dehydration from vomiting and copious
diarrhea, are transmitted through water or food that has come in contact with the feces of infected people.
Many cholera pandemics occurred in the first half of the nineteenth century, before industrial technology
made the building of secure water and sewer lines possible and good personal hygiene feasible. However,
many outbreaks occurred in the second half of the nineteenth century in cities that had not yet modernized
their water and sewer systems, and in the poorer neighborhoods of cities that had (Figure 10.13). Three
thousand people died of cholera in Vienna within the span of a few months in 1873. In 1892, in the German
city of Hamburg, more than eight thousand people died of it. A vaccine was finally developed in 1885.
400 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       cholera as the Grim Reaper mowing down populations. (credit: "Cholera" by Le Petit Journal/Wikimedia Commons,
       Public Domain)
       Finally, overcrowding also contributed to disease. Although tuberculosis affected people in rural areas too, the
       overcrowded homes and workplaces of industrial cities encouraged it to spread quickly and claim many lives.
       All social classes suffered from the disease, but it had its greatest impact on the poor, for whom overcrowding
       was the worst and whose homes often lacked sunlight, which kills tuberculosis bacilli.
       Although not necessarily fatal, alcoholism was also a significant health problem in nineteenth-century cities,
       especially among working-class men. Cities contained numerous saloons, taverns, pubs, cafés, and beer halls,
       and working-class men routinely sought them out after a hard day. Alcohol relieved boredom, calmed
       frustrations, and eased the physical pain of factory workers, miners, and dock hands. Establishments that
       served alcohol commonly offered other services as well, including free or inexpensive food, an employment
       exchange where men might learn of new jobs, and a place to hear the newspaper read or have a letter written.
       Men also used drinking establishments as places to discuss politics.
       On Sundays, the only day of rest for European and American workers, alcohol consumption was high as many
       men spent the day drinking. Supervisors reported that it was not uncommon for men to come to work on
       Monday mornings hungover or still intoxicated. In an attempt to combat this problem, employers began to cut
       work hours in half on Saturdays, in the hope that if men started drinking earlier, they would finish earlier.
       Eventually, and largely owing to significant lobbying from labor unions, workers received two full days off on
       the weekends.
       Prostitution, both formal and informal, was common in nineteenth-century cities. Some prostitutes were
       professionals who lived in brothels, but many others were simply young single women who could not survive

on their meager wages alone. Instead of a fee, they might simply want a man to purchase them dinner or new
clothing. Even the institution of prostitution modernized in the nineteenth century, and brothels advertised
themselves in books of "things to do" in town that could be purchased at railway stations. When asked why
they lived such a lifestyle, some women reported that they had been trapped by means of seduction, but many
professional prostitutes said the job paid better, required less work, and offered them more privacy than did a
job as a factory worker or domestic servant. Sexually transmitted diseases were rampant, however. Many
prostitutes and their clients suffered from syphilis, and married men sometimes infected their wives. The
result was infertility or babies who were stillborn or blind or had mental disabilities. With no effective cure,
syphilis killed its victims after years of agony.

Cultural Movements of the Second Industrial Revolution

The industrial city was more than a place for people to live, work, and entertain themselves. It was also the
subject of late nineteenth-century art and literature. Industrialization influenced the cultural creations of the
time just as much as it did the methods of production and transportation.

The first significant cultural response to industrialization began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries with romanticism, an artistic movement that valued emotion and imagination and took as its
subjects the themes of nature, the ordinary person, the exotic, the ancient, and the supernatural. Romantic
writers and artists stressed the beauty and awe-inspiring power of nature and decried the effect that cities and
industrial development had on people and the physical environment. William Blake's description of England's
factories as "dark satanic mills" perfectly expressed the romantics' attitude toward modern life.

Another important artistic and literary movement of the nineteenth century was realism. Realism focused on
everyday life in the contemporary world instead of on the exotic, the ancient, and the faraway as romanticism
had. Realists depicted life as it was, even if that meant presenting scenes of its uglier side, although some
realist painters such as Rosa Bonheur and Jean-François Millet chose to depict life in the countryside and
painted rural horse fairs, oxen straining at the plow, and men sowing fields. Modern cities and their
inhabitants were the focus of many others such as John Sloan and George Luks, who portrayed the inside of
barrooms and the teeming streets of working-class neighborhoods.

Writers also took the city as their subject. One of the greatest realist writers of the nineteenth century was
Britain's Charles Dickens. In his many and widely read novels, Dickens sympathetically depicted the
hardscrabble lives of poor, working-class, and middle-class urban dwellers, setting scenes in foundling homes,
prisons, impoverished neighborhoods, and dark city streets. Some critics charged him with being unrealistic
in his depiction of the virtuous poor, but his portrayals (and his activism) helped raise awareness, especially of
the plight of children, and bring about some social change. Other writers focused even more intently on the
shabbier side of life. In Russia, novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky described the streets of St. Petersburg, the
rundown quarters in which the poor were condemned to live, and the cheap saloons in which they sought
relief. Honoré de Balzac of France depicted the seedy side of life in French cities, often focusing on stories of
crime. In Madame Bovary, another French novelist, Gustave Flaubert, wrote of a rural doctor's young wife
whose desire for consumer goods and urban pleasures leads to her ruin. American writer Kate Chopin also
addressed the problem of women who felt stifled by married life and the social conventions of the time.

In the late nineteenth century, realism was joined and surpassed by naturalism, a style that featured detached
and impersonal depictions of characters whose actions were molded by their environment in ways they often
had no ability to control. The French novelist Émile Zola was the creator of naturalism, and his numerous
works depict people trapped by their environment or their heredity into acting in ways for which they cannot
be held fully responsible. For example, in Thérèse Raquin, Zola's first naturalistic novel, which he published in
installments in the magazine L'Artiste in 1867, the title character is an orphan forced by the woman who raised
her to marry her sickly son, a man Thérèse does not love and eventually murders, with the help of a brutish
man to whom she finds herself drawn by irresistible sexual impulses. Literary critics were shocked by Thérèse
Raquin, as they also were by later works of naturalism, and decried it as immoral.
402 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       American readers were similarly shocked by McTeague, an 1899 novel by Frank Norris. In this story,
       McTeague, a dentist, marries Trina, with whom his friend was in love. McTeague's friend works his revenge by
       destroying his dental practice, leading McTeague to run away after stealing money from Trina. When he
       returns, having spent all that he had stolen, Trina refuses to help him, and he beats her to death. He then runs
       from the law with his former friend in pursuit. The novel ends with McTeague stranded in the desert,
       handcuffed to the body of his friend, whom he has killed. In the world depicted in McTeague, people are
       greedy, faithless, and violent, and there is no escape from the horrors of life.

         · Discuss the abolition of slavery and serfdom during the Second Industrial Revolution
         · Describe forms of coerced and semicoerced labor that existed during the Second Industrial
             Revolution

       Most workers in industrialized countries during the period of the Second Industrial Revolution were free.
       "Free" in this context is a relative term, however. Their employers could not buy or sell them or their labor.
       They were legally able to leave their places of employment if they chose. But the extreme poverty of many
       workers makes it difficult to think of them as truly free. They toiled for long hours at dangerous jobs they hated
       because the alternative was homelessness and starvation. Nevertheless, they had advantages and choices,
       even if limited ones, that many other nineteenth-century workers did not have. For many people, to one degree
       or another, employers still had the legal right to compel their labor.

      Slavery and Serfdom

       By the end of the nineteenth century, chattel slavery, in which one human being is owned by another and can
       be bought or sold, lingered in only a few places on the globe. Some nations had already abolished slavery
       before the Second Industrial Revolution began. Japan officially did so in the sixteenth century. Britain
       abolished the slave trade and ended slavery completely in 1834. France banned slavery in 1848, freeing nearly
       all enslaved people in the Caribbean. In India, the Penal Code of 1861 punished those who attempted to
       enslave others. The Netherlands and the United States were among the last industrialized nations to end the
       practice, with the Dutch freeing enslaved people in the South American colony of Suriname in 1863 and the
       United States abolishing slavery with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to its Constitution in 1865.

       Most Latin American nations ended slavery following their wars of independence in the early nineteenth
       century. Brazil, however, with its primarily agricultural economy, long resisted reformers' calls for
       emancipation. In 1850, the country finally bowed to pressure from its chief trading partner, Great Britain,
       which had assumed the moral duty of abolishing slavery around the world soon after it liberated its own
       enslaved people. Brazil ended its slave trade, and in 1871 it passed a law that freed all children born to
       enslaved women from that point forward. In 1885, it decreed that all enslaved people would be free when they
       reached their sixtieth birthdays. Finally, it completely abolished slavery in 1888.

       Along with British pressure, other factors influenced Brazil's decision. The battlefield performance of enslaved
       men during Brazil's 1864-1870 war with Paraguay led many White soldiers to admire the Afro-Brazilian
       fighters, and they became reluctant to recapture runaways. Many White Brazilians also believed their nation
       could not become modern and industrialized if it possessed a large population of African ancestry. For them,
       getting rid of slavery was the first step on the path to creating a Brazil that was more White.

       Serfdom also largely disappeared in the second half of the nineteenth century. Serfs were unfree peasants who
       were legally bound to work the land on which they lived, land that was owned by another. Russia held nearly all
       Europe's remaining serfs. Approximately eleven million were owned by private citizens, and another twelve to
       thirteen million were owned by the state. Tsar Alexander II abolished serfdom in Russia in 1861. This did not

necessarily improve serfs' lives, however. Though emancipated, they were required to serve their masters for
two more years. They were then allowed to remain on the lands they had worked, but they had to purchase
them, often at high prices. Domestic serfs, those who had been household servants, received no land. In some
parts of the Russian empire, serfdom lingered on for a few more decades.

This is a 2017 report on modern slavery (https://openstax.org/l/772017slavery) in which many interesting and
surprising facts can be found in the first few pages.

Contract Labor and Debt Bondage

While slavery and serfdom disappeared from the industrialized world in the nineteenth century, other means
remained for securing a long-term or permanent labor force for both agricultural and industrial production.
Two such systems are contract labor and debt bondage. Contract labor, a system in which people sign
contracts promising to perform work in exchange for a fee, still exists today. Indentured servitude is a form of
contract labor in which people pledge to work for an agreed period of time for an agreed form of
compensation. Although indentured servants are not enslaved, while their contract is in force, their employers
have nearly total control over them, and they are not allowed to leave their service. Debt bondage is a system in
which a person who owes money works (or provides someone else to work) for the creditor until the debt has
been repaid through labor. Indentured servitude and debt bondage are similar and were common in the later
nineteenth century; they differ from slavery in that, theoretically, at a point in time the bondage will end.

In the United States, indentured servitude had been common during the colonial period, and it was the means
by which many Europeans obtained passage to North America. The practice had largely died out in the United
States by the middle of the nineteenth century but still existed in a few places. In Hawaii, plantation owners
used contract labor from Portugal, China, Korea, Japan, and the Philippines to grow their crops, especially
sugarcane. Many Chinese immigrants also came to the United States as contract laborers. They were not
working under a contract with their employer. Instead, they had agreed to work for one of their compatriots to
pay for their passage to the United States. Many Chinese workers were taken abroad by the Six Companies, a
Chinese-owned business formed to transport Chinese immigrants to North America, and they had to repay
their debt to the company before they were allowed to return home.

Other parts of the world also relied on various forms of contract labor once slavery had been abolished. During
the nineteenth century, Australia depended on indentured laborers from the islands of the Pacific, such as the
Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Samoa, and the Gilbert Islands (now called Kiribati). A flourishing trade also
provided Chinese and Indian laborers to work in Latin America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and European
colonies in Africa. These laborers were underpaid, overworked, brutally disciplined, and given only enough
food to allow them to work. Reports about their poor treatment convinced many industrialized countries to
end participation in the trade. Britain prohibited its ships from carrying Asian laborers to Cuba and Peru, two
of the main destinations. In 1874, Portugal, following Britain's example, prevented the trade from being
carried on in Macao, a Portuguese colony in Asia through which many Chinese laborers were shipped
elsewhere in the world.

Debt bondage was also a common source of labor in some parts of the world in the late nineteenth century. In
the 1880s in Japan, faced with an economic depression that led many to bankruptcy and starvation, parents
"rented" their children, especially daughters, to factories. The girls were provided with food and shelter, and
money they earned was sent home to their parents. Daughters might also be hired out to brothels; dutiful ones
might make the decision themselves to spare their parents the pain. In the United States, debt bondage was a
common means by which southern farmers kept a labor force of African American people and poor White
people at their disposal. It also trapped many Asian laborers who immigrated to South America, even after
their contracts had expired.
404 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       In some places, debt bondage was nearly impossible to escape. Sharecroppers and tenant farmers working
       other people's land depended on the harvest for their income. In the time before the harvest, they purchased
       necessities like food on credit from a local store, which was usually owned by the landlord. They also often
       needed to purchase seed and use equipment owned by the landlord. When they sold their crops following the
       harvest, they repaid their debts. Often, the prices of goods and the interest charged by the store owner were so
       high that income from the harvest was insufficient to satisfy the workers' debts, and the unpaid portion was
       added to the amount borrowed against the next harvest. Some employers paid their workers with scrip, a
       substitute for money that could be exchanged only at the store the employer owned; because they could not
       shop elsewhere, laborers had no choice but to go into debt. In Japanese brothels, the young women were not
       paid in scrip, but the cost of everything provided for them, including clothing and food, was recorded, and the
       women could not go free until they had repaid both the original sum exchanged for them and the total cost of
       their upkeep.

      Penal Labor

       Forced labor assigned as punishment to those convicted of crimes, known as penal labor, was also employed
       in the second half of the nineteenth century. From 1788 to 1868, British convicts, most of whom had been
       found guilty of nonviolent crimes, were given the choice of languishing in a cell or being transported to the
       colony of Australia. If they chose Australia, after an ocean journey that might last eight months, they had to
       endure seven to ten years of labor. The unlucky might be assigned to work gangs, building roads or
       constructing government buildings. Others went to work for farmers or merchants. After they had served their
       sentences, they were free to remain in Australia as settlers or return to England.
       Like Britain, Russia used convicted prisoners to satisfy the need for labor in distant parts of the empire, where
       it was difficult to attract voluntary settlers. The katorga system sent prisoners to Siberia and the Russian Far
       East (Figure 10.14). The men, often political prisoners, typically felled timber or worked in mines. Sometimes
       they were rented out to private employers.

 Penal Labor in Russia

  This excerpt is from the 1887 book In Russian and French Prisons by Peter Kropotkin. The book is based on
  Kropotkin's experiences as a young military officer in the 1860s, when he first became interested in the question
  of crime and punishment and served on a committee for the reform of the Russian penal system. In this excerpt,
  he describes the treatment of prisoners working at a Siberian gold mine, including punishments such as the
  blackholes--"the warm one, and the cold one underground with a temperature at freezing point."

        As a rule, the hard-labour convict must be kept in prison, at the mines, only for about one-third of the
        time to which he has been condemned. Beyond this time, he must be settled in the village close by the
        mine, in a separate house, with his family, if his wife has followed him; he is bound to go to work like
        other convicts, but without chains, and he has his own house and hearth. It is obvious that this law
        might be an immense benefit for the convicts, but its provisions are marred by the manner in which it is
        applied. The liberation of the convict depends entirely upon the caprice of the superintendent of the
        mine. Moreover, with the absurd payment for his labour, which hardly reaches a few shillings per month
        in addition to the ration of flour, the liberated convict falls, with but few exceptions, into the most
        dreadful misery. . . . The punishments depend also entirely upon the fancy of the superintendent of the
        works, and mostly they are atrocious. The privation of food and the blackhole . . . are considered as
        merely childish punishments. Only the plete, the cat-o'-nine-tails, distributed at will, for the slightest
        delinquency, and to the amount dictated by the good or bad temper of the manager, is considered as a
        punishment. It is so usual a thing in the minds of the overseers, that "hundred pletes," a hundred lashes
        with the cat-o'-nine-tails, are ordered with the same easiness as one week's incarceration would be
        ordered in European prisons.

        --Peter Kropotkin, In Russian and French Prisons

    · Based on this excerpt, explain why the author later calls the superintendent of the mines "a king in his
        dominions."

    · Why do you think the privation of food and the "blackhole" are considered "childish punishments" in
        comparison to a whipping?

Many other countries, such as the United States, also used convicts for labor or rented them for use by private
citizens. After the abolition of slavery, the southern U.S. states often required African American men to sign
yearly contracts with White employers. A man who did not have such a contract could be arrested for vagrancy
and then forced to sign a labor contract and work in agriculture. People found guilty of and imprisoned for
actual crimes were also often required to perform free labor, either inside or outside the prison. Prisoners were
often used to build roads in the southern United States.

406 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       nations sought people to work in mines and factories, and countries that had developed export economies
       needed hands to work in their forests and fields. These forces combined to promote a mass migration of
       people across the face of the earth, assisted by new industrial technologies.

      European Immigration

       Over the course of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century, approximately sixty
       million Europeans sought better economic opportunities on other continents. Most came from relatively
       nonindustrialized or agricultural regions, such as southern Italy and Sicily. Approximately twenty-eight
       million Europeans and Canadians immigrated to the United States during this time, the majority between
       1890 and 1914. Most were peasant farmers from southern and eastern Europe. Many also continued to arrive
       from Germany and Ireland, the countries that had been responsible for the greatest influx of immigrants in the
       first half of the nineteenth century. Along with those fleeing poverty came victims of religious persecution,
       especially Jewish people of the Russian empire. They had faced discrimination and anti-Semitism, which often
       culminated in waves of violence called pogroms that left people dead and their property destroyed. Political
       dissidents and craftspeople displaced by industrialization made up the rest.

       After the United States, it was Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay that received the largest numbers. Some
       4.5 million emigrants went to Argentina, where at one point they made up 30 percent of the population. Latin
       America attracted many Italians and Germans as well as Spanish and Portuguese settlers. Canada was the
       destination of approximately 5.1 million people between the 1850s and the 1920s. Other common landing
       places for European immigrants were Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Particularly attractive after
       gold was discovered there were Australia in 1851 and South Africa in 1886.

       Once in their new homes, European immigrants performed a large variety of jobs. Many worked in factories.
       Jewish people were especially active in the garment industry in places like New York City. In the United States,
       Polish people and other eastern Europeans worked in the steel industry in Pittsburgh and in Chicago's
       stockyards. The Portuguese often worked in the fishing industry or, in New England, alongside French
       Canadians in textile mills. Italian immigrants did a variety of work in agriculture, mining, and the building
       trades. The Welsh found jobs as miners in the West. Irish immigrants worked in mines, built railroads, and
       labored in factories throughout the United States. Women from all these ethnic groups entered domestic
       service.

       The response of the countries where immigrants settled often depended on the newcomers' ethnicity. In the
       United States, the "foreign" ways of Germans and eastern European Christians might be mocked but were
       largely accepted. Irish newcomers, most of whom were Roman Catholics, had been rejected when they first
       began to migrate to the largely Protestant United States in large numbers in the 1840s and 1850s, but by the
       second half of the nineteenth century, they and their children had established themselves as politicians,
       business owners, and police officers. Jewish people and Italians, however, who were more recent immigrants,
       often faced discrimination, and anti-Semitism was prevalent.

       By the end of the nineteenth century, many native-born Protestants of northern European ancestry in the
       United States began to call for changes in immigration laws. These calls were met in 1924 with the passage of
       the Johnson-Reed Act, which set a quota on the total number of immigrants allowed to enter the United States
       from outside the Western Hemisphere. In addition, the act limited the number of immigrants of each
       nationality to 2 percent of the number already living in the United States in 1890. Thus, a person might be
       turned away if the permitted number of immigrants of that particular nationality had already been admitted,
       even if the total limit had not been reached. Before 1890, most immigrants had come from northern and
       western Europe and relatively few from southern or eastern Europe. Thus, the 2 percent quota allowed far
       more English, Irish, and German people to enter than Italian, Polish, or Russian Jewish people. Immigration
       from Asia, with the exception of the U.S. territory of the Philippines, was banned.

       In Latin America, the situation was much different. Argentina and Uruguay, for instance, had never had large

populations because they lacked their neighbors' mineral wealth and climates conducive to the growing of
sugar and coffee. The arrival of European immigrants there was thus a welcome boost. Brazil and Venezuela
deliberately sought out European immigrants to make their predominantly African, Native American, and
biracial population more White.

Asian Exodus

In the nineteenth century, many people of East Asia and India left home to seek work abroad, just as many
Europeans did. Most who left China were escaping poverty. Primarily men, they came largely from the
southern provinces, especially Fujian, where the quality of the land had always made agriculture difficult, and
Guangdong. In the middle of the nineteenth century, many Chinese people fled hardships occasioned by the
deadliest civil war in the history of the world. From 1850 to 1864, more than twenty million Chinese people
died in the Taiping Rebellion, an uprising led by Hong Xiuquan, who believed himself to be "God's Chinese
son" and sought to impose a new moral order on society. The war's destruction of towns, farms, livestock, and
crops left millions dead or dying from famine.

The Chinese diaspora in the nineteenth century was perhaps the widest of any ethnic group, dispersing
emigrants around the globe. Chinese laborers came to the Kingdom of Hawaii to work on sugarcane
plantations. They sought work in the United States building railroads, mining, and working as agricultural
laborers and in service occupations. Thousands of Chinese people performed similar jobs in the Canadian
province of British Columbia. Chinese people also immigrated to Europe, primarily Britain, as well as to
Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, and South Africa. They were hired as contract laborers in South African gold
mines when the owners realized they would work longer hours for lower wages than would native Africans,
who often left the mines after a few years.

Most people have heard of Ellis Island, the immigration station in the New York City harbor that welcomed
millions of European immigrants to the United States. Less well known was Angel Island in San Francisco Bay
(https://openstax.org/l/77AngelIsland) that served as the station through which most Asian immigrants were
processed while they awaited permission to enter the United States or were returned to their home countries.
Today, it is a national historic landmark.

Large numbers of Chinese people also sought opportunities in South America and the Caribbean. In Peru, the
abolition of slavery in 1854 left the country desperate for workers, and the government subsidized the
importation of laborers. Approximately 100,000 Chinese people immigrated as contract laborers between
1849 and 1874 to fill the need for workers to mine guano (bird and bat excrement used as fertilizer), build
railroads, and toil on sugarcane and cotton plantations. Their contracts typically bound them to work for four
to eight years. During that time, they were subjected to harsh punishments, including whipping and
confinement in plantation jails. When their contracts ended, those who did not find themselves trapped in debt
bondage often moved to the cities.

Chinese people emigrated to other places in Latin America and the Caribbean as well. Many built railroads in
the Spanish colony of Cuba; concerned that they were being mistreated, China signed a treaty with Spain in
1896 to end all labor contracts that bound Chinese laborers. In the 1870s, Mexico's president Porfirio Diaz
encouraged Chinese people to immigrate to Mexico and settle in the northern part of the country. Diaz had first
invited European and White U.S. settlers to Mexico to build railroads as part of a plan to "civilize" the northern
part of the country, with its largely Native American and mestizo (biracial European and Native American)
population. When these laborers found life in the desert undesirable, Diaz invited the Chinese to settle instead.

In Japan, economic depression also led many young men and women to seek their fortunes abroad. Unable to
pay their taxes or purchase food because of a decrease in the price of their rice, farmers were desperate. One
response was to allow sons, and sometimes daughters, to go to the city to look for work that, if found, paid
408 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       wages too low to live on, let alone send to families left behind in rural villages. In the eyes of many Japanese,
       leaving the country completely for a new life elsewhere made more sense. For families that had to sell their
       farms to pay their debts, it may have seemed the only choice.
       The Japanese government encouraged emigration and entered into contractual agreements with other
       countries to provide labor. In 1885, it selected men and women most likely to promote Japan's reputation as a
       respected, civilized nation and instructed them on how to behave when abroad. Japanese immigration was
       largely confined to the Pacific region and to the Americas. In 1868, Japanese contract laborers were sent to
       Guam and the Kingdom of Hawaii. Others went to Australia and the Philippines. Hawaii remained a major
       destination after it was annexed by the United States, because the owners of sugarcane plantations sought
       laborers. Many Japanese also settled on the West Coast of the United States and in the Canadian province of
       British Columbia (Figure 10.15).

       FIGURE 10.15 Japanese Emigration to Canada. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Canada
       attracted many Japanese laborers. These men waiting to debark on Vancouver Island would most likely have sent
       for their wives to join them later. The marriages were arranged for them by their parents in Japan. (credit:
       "Passengers arriving in Vancouver" by UBC Library Digital Collections/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Like the Chinese emigrants, Japanese emigrants also went to South America in substantial numbers. Japanese
       immigration to Peru began in 1899. In 1907, Japan reached an agreement with the United States to limit the
       influx of Japanese people to that country. The Japanese government then signed an agreement with Brazil in
       1908 allowing for the immigration of laborers to work on coffee plantations. Brazil had initially sought Italian
       laborers in an effort to make its population more White, much as Diaz had done in Mexico, but the Italians and
       other European workers found the wages too low and the living conditions too difficult. Many early Japanese
       immigrants to Brazil had sought to earn money and then return home, but they often found themselves
       trapped in debt bondage to their employers and so remained even after their contracts expired. In the twenty-
       first century, the largest concentrations of Japanese people outside Japan are in Brazil and Peru.
       Indians also found their labor in high demand during the Second Industrial Revolution, and many were driven
       by poverty to become indentured laborers, primarily on plantations growing sugarcane. Some 3.5 million
       Indians worked on plantations in Africa. In East Africa, Indians also built railroads. They grew cash crops in
       South America and the Caribbean, to which they brought cannabis, called ganja, which they preferred to
       alcohol as a means for relaxation. They also became part of the labor force in other island nations. In 1879, the
       first Indian laborers entered Fiji to grow sugarcane; so many immigrated there that they now form a
       substantial portion of the country's population.

 Indians in Fiji

  Indians first arrived in Fiji in the late nineteenth century to grow sugarcane. Both they and Fiji were transformed
  by the experience. The Indian immigrants came from a variety of regions, the Hindus among them were from a
  variety of castes, and men greatly outnumbered women. Because there were not enough Indians in the early
  years to form separate communities, they were forced to live together, which weakened adherence to the caste
  system. The skewed sex ratio also meant that members of different castes had to intermarry, which destroyed
  the caste system entirely. The need to live and work together led to the creation of a common language
  composed of elements of various Indian languages. It is now spoken by many indigenous Fiji Islanders as well.

  At times, Fijians of Indian descent have comprised just as large a proportion of Fiji's population as have
  Indigenous Fijians. Many members of the Indigenous population resent this development and have been
  reluctant to share political power with Fijians of Indian ancestry. In 1987 and 2000, strong nationalist
  sentiments among Indigenous Fijians led to coups aimed at depriving Indians of political rights. Anti-Indian
  violence caused many to leave the country where their families had lived for one hundred years. Only within the
  last few years have nationalist feelings died down and people of Indian ancestry become widely recognized as
  true Fijians.

    · What effect(s) did the arrival of Indian immigrants have on Fijian culture and society?

Asian immigrants found themselves more unwelcome than European immigrants were. In 1882, the United
States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which prevented all Chinese laborers from immigrating to the
country. The Johnson-Reed Act banned all immigration from Asia, with the exception of people coming from
U.S. territories in the Pacific. Although Canada did not ban Asian immigration, in 1885 it placed a tax of $50 on
all Chinese people entering the country to work. Students, scientists, merchants, and government officials
were exempt, but in subsequent years, the tax was raised.

Asian immigrants to South America also faced hostility. Violent attacks on Chinese people took place in Peru in
the nineteenth century, as they had in the United States before Chinese immigration was banned. Portuguese-
speaking Brazilians regarded the Japanese people, who resisted becoming bilingual and maintained schools
and newspapers in their own language, as unassimilable, and in 1923 the government imposed a strict quota
on immigrants from Japan.

By the beginning of the twentieth century, Australia also wished to limit immigration to only Europeans. In the
1850s, it tried to discourage the entry of Chinese people by prohibiting the arrival of the families of those
already in the country. It also imposed a tax on Chinese immigrants. At the urging of members of the working
class, who believed the willingness of the Chinese people to work for low wages hurt them, Australia required
that all furniture made by Chinese workers bear a label stating that fact. All this was part of the White Australia
Policy, a movement to exclude Asians and Pacific Islanders from the country.

The White Australia Policy culminated in the passage of the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, excluding
anyone who could not pass a dictation test administered in a European language. This specification
automatically disadvantaged Asians and Pacific Islanders, which the Japanese people heartily protested. Since
the law gave them the discretion, examiners were also careful to choose languages that test takers were
unlikely to know.

     10.5 Regulation, Reform, and Revolutionary Ideologies

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES

       Industrialization and urbanization offered opportunities to many people and improved their lives in many
       ways. However, they also brought much suffering and discontent. The period of the Second Industrial
       Revolution gave birth to a number of reform movements and legal efforts to eliminate the problems that
       urbanization and industrialization caused. Some efforts were successful; many were not. When things did not
       change--or did not change fast enough--people sometimes turned to violent conflict and threatened
       revolution.

      Regulation and Reform

       The challenges of the industrial age must have seemed overwhelming to observers of the time, and the
       difficulties insurmountable. Nevertheless, governments attempted to solve some of the most important
       problems. Their motives varied. Many officials were sensitive to the criticisms of social activists and reformers,
       and some politicians came from their ranks. They genuinely wished to improve the lives of city dwellers and
       the working class.
       Politicians often acted to please the wealthy and middle class, however, who found themselves threatened by
       dirty air, smelly streets, and infectious diseases that domestic servants might bring into their homes (Figure
       10.16). Florence Kelley, an American activist who sought to end child labor, objected to it not only because it
       deprived young people of the freedom of childhood, but also because she feared the products made by children
       in tenement apartments might be dirty and infect her own family.

Many politicians at both the local and national levels also realized that protecting workers' health and welfare
made the nation stronger. Sick workers were unproductive, and travelers avoided cities suffering epidemics.
Numerous laws were passed to combat disease and render cities clean. In 1848, Britain took a step forward by
passing the Public Health Act, which created the National Board of Health to regulate such matters as the
dumping of sewage. In 1863, Britain's Alkali Act sought to reduce hydrogen chloride emissions by empowering
investigators to suggest changes to factory owners, though without the power to compel obedience. In the
1880s, several American cities, including Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati, passed ordinances to limit
smoke emissions. None of these laws were very successful. Businesses ignored them, and cities usually did not
enforce them.

Housing also became a concern of governments during the Second Industrial Revolution. Regulations often
outlawed dangers such as apartments without windows or ventilation, where infectious diseases rapidly bred.
Some municipalities built housing for the poor or tore down slums and relocated workers to other parts of the
city. Between 1853 and 1870, Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann redesigned Paris; as part of these efforts,
workers' dwellings in the center of the city were razed. Naples, Italy, was rebuilt between 1889 and 1918 to
prevent the return of cholera. In the 1880s and 1890s, Japanese officials in Tokyo and Osaka also tried to clear
slums and remove the poor from districts inhabited by the middle class. These efforts were often unsuccessful,
however, and poor neighborhoods often abutted even the most prestigious ones. In 1906, one Japanese
newspaper reported that the emperor's palace was affected when the poor neighborhood adjacent to it
flooded.

In 1883, Germany passed the Health Insurance Law, requiring that employers provide health insurance for
their employees, using money drawn from workers' pay and added to employers' contributions. In 1889, the
German government extended insurance to the elderly and those with disabilities. In 1898, France also
provided insurance to those injured at work. In 1911, Britain's National Insurance Act provided for the health
care of about one-third of British workers. In 1912, Russia passed a similar law.

Concern for safety in the industrial workplace, especially of women and children, also inspired much
legislation. Early laws applied to only certain industries like textiles and mining. Factory Acts passed in Britain
in the 1860s through the 1880s expanded the types of businesses covered by the older laws. In 1860, the Coal
Mines Regulation Act made twelve years the minimum age for boys to work in mines, and in 1891, Britain
made eleven years the minimum age for factory work.

Many U.S. states passed laws limiting work hours for women in strenuous industries like laundry. Employers
challenged these actions, though, and courts, favoring a policy of laissez-faire, commonly overturned
protective legislation. Limiting adults' working hours was thought to deprive them of their freedom of contract
as well as burdening employers. Many efforts to limit hours or ban women and children from certain jobs
altogether were also often resented by the working class. For those commonly paid by the hour or the piece,
more time in the workplace meant more money, and people who were desperate often had to take the only jobs
they could find.

The creation of urban parks was the goal of reformers who saw green spaces as a solution to the dirt and chaos
of the city. The nineteenth-century middle and upper-middle classes, like good Romantics, believed in the
redemptive power of nature. Not only was fresh air good for city dwellers' lungs, but the very sight of green
grass, trees, and flowers was thought to be a source of moral uplift. Politicians were swayed by their claims.
New York City built Central Park in 1858. The government of Japan decreed in 1873 that parks be built in
412 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       urban areas (Figure 10.17). German emperor Wilhelm I ceded his rights to the Tiergarten, a royal hunting
       park, and made it part of the city of Berlin in 1881. The middle class sometimes feared the working class would
       behave inappropriately in parks, and places like Central Park often prohibited visitors from picnicking on the
       grass, picking flowers, and playing games on the lawn.

       FIGURE 10.17 Tsuruma Park. In 1873, the government of Japan decreed that public parks be established in the
       cities. Tsuruma Park opened in Nagoya in 1909. In its center is a European-style bandstand, shown here. (credit:
       "Tsurumai Park 1910" by Japan to-day/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Regulations and laws sometimes failed to yield the improvements many social activists thought were
       necessary. Reform movements arose both to change private behaviors the middle class believed harmful or
       immoral, such as drinking or having extramarital sex, and to pressure governments to make broader changes.
       Sometimes they were successful. In the United States, for example, prostitution was made illegal in many
       cities. In other countries such as France, prostitution was not prohibited, and new laws attempted to regulate it
       and prevent the spread of venereal disease.
       The excessive consumption of alcohol was another problem addressed primarily through reform efforts. The
       middle class blamed drinking for myriad problems including poverty, street crime, worker absenteeism,
       workplace accidents, and domestic violence. Efforts to address these generally took one of two
       approaches--temperance, which forbade hard liquor and encouraged moderate consumption of other
       alcoholic beverages, and prohibition, which attempted to ban the manufacture and consumption of all
       alcoholic beverages.
       Temperance and prohibition movements made the greatest headway in countries with large Protestant
       populations, such as the United States, England, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. The United Kingdom Alliance
       for the Total and Immediate Suppression of the Liquor Traffic by the Will of the People, usually referred to
       simply as the United Kingdom Alliance, intended to prohibit the trade in alcohol entirely. In the United States,
       the Anti-Saloon League attempted to close places where alcohol was served, including by physically destroying
       barrooms.
       Women played crucial roles in many of these reform movements; such activism was considered an
       appropriate occupation for wealthy or middle-class women and directly related to their interests at the time.
       Husbands who visited prostitutes could bring disease home. Alcoholic men could leave families in financial
       ruin, and drunken husbands and fathers physically abused wives and children. Cleaning up the city was often
       equated to cleaning up the home.

The women engaged in reform movements usually realized they could be more effective if they had the right to
vote, run for public office, or control property. Access to university education and the professions would also
boost their ability to improve society. Many were therefore also active in women's rights movements.

Reformers often regarded problems like poverty and drunkenness as the result of a lack of self-discipline and
of a strong moral compass. The poor could best be helped, they believed, through moral uplift. The Scottish
writer Samuel Smiles, for example, believed morality was the key to success. Adopting that attitude, charitable
societies and religious organizations often established missions in poor neighborhoods through which they
hoped to encourage the working class to change their ways.

Nineteenth-century reformers also insisted the poor not become dependent on charity. British housing
reformer Octavia Hill was an advocate of this position. She worked with art critic John Ruskin to provide
attractive housing for the poor, but the housing was not free, and while rents were low, those who failed to pay
on time risked eviction. Hill also evicted tenants who allowed their homes to become overcrowded or failed to
send their children to school.

Others believed the poor were irredeemable and that their personal traits, many of which were thought to be
hereditary, made change impossible. Thus, attempts at charity and moral uplift were seen to do no good. Social
Darwinism, a pseudoscientific belief that some people were better equipped for survival than others, was
advocated by British sociologist Herbert Spencer. Spencer believed it was useless to help the poor because
they were destined to die out. He regarded them as having "lost" the competition of life because they did not
possess the traits necessary to rise to the top. He did not believe the poor should be helped to survive and
opposed offering them financial assistance.

                                                                                                    DUELING VOICES

 Helping the Poor

  How best to help the poor was a great concern of nineteenth-century society. Some people, like Samuel Smiles,
  believed the poor could help themselves by adopting more disciplined habits. Others, however, like the Reverend
  Osborne Jay, believed they could not change. Jay came to hold this position after working with the poor in
  Bethnal Green, a working-class neighborhood in London's East End. In the first of the two excerpts that follow,
  Samuel Smiles discusses the importance of self-improvement. In the second excerpt, the Reverend Jay, the
  minister of Holy Trinity Church in Shoreditch, a poor district in East London, answers questions posed by a
  reporter about the cause of "the degradation" of the poor and the best response to it.

        National progress is the sum of individual industry, energy, and uprightness, as national decay is of
        individual idleness, selfishness, and vice. What we are accustomed to decry as great social evils, will, for
        the most part, be found to be but the outgrowth of man's own perverted life; and though we may
        endeavour to cut them down and extirpate them by means of Law, they will only spring up again with
        fresh luxuriance in some other form, unless the conditions of personal life and character are radically
        improved. If this view be correct, then it follows that the highest patriotism and philanthropy consist,
        not so much in altering laws and modifying institutions, as in helping and stimulating men to elevate and
        improve themselves by their own free and independent individual action.

        --Samuel Smiles, Self-Help

        There is no temptation like that of poverty. It is the greatest that can fall in the way of any man or
        woman. It fills our prisons and turns honesty into crime and virtue into dishonor. But it must also be
        remembered that at the very outset of our social problem we are met by the incontrovertible fact that

               uniformly fairly judged. But science in unmistakable accents teaches the reverse. . . . There is, it seems
               to me, only one solution to this problem. Education has failed, religious work cannot he expected to do
               what is needed, the Poor Law and prison systems are alike ineffective, and universal charity cannot
               rightly be considered a real factor in the case. The only method, I think, is to stop the supply of persons
               born to be lazy, immoral, and deficient in intellect. This can only be done by sending the present stock of
               them to what I will call a penal settlement. . . . The fact is, all men are not equal, nor can they be treated
               as such. This, through no fault of their own, I grant; but we can prevent them bringing into the world
               children stamped with the character of their parents.

       A particular type of reform movement resulted in the creation of trade and labor unions to represent workers
       in dealings with management. In trade unions, workers organized within a particular craft or industry. In
       labor unions, skilled and unskilled workers of all kinds joined together to promote and defend their interests.
       In Britain, trade unions were at the forefront of change. In 1866, the Trades Union Congress, a federation of
       English and Welsh trade unions, was formed primarily to represent the interests of skilled workers. In 1871,
       the British government legalized their existence, and in 1875, Parliament made it legal for workers to strike as
       well. The result was that trade union membership increased from about 100,000 to about one million by the
       middle of the 1870s. Coal miners, iron and steel workers, and textile factory employees were the first to
       unionize. In the 1880s and 1890s, unions began to make concerted efforts to organize unskilled laborers. Two
       million people had joined British trade unions by the beginning of the twentieth century.

       Workers' demands focused largely on improving wages, hours, and working conditions. Establishing an eight-
       hour day was the goal of many unions. When these goals were not met, they struck. In 1881, women in British
       match factories went on strike. They wanted relief from fourteen-hour days and the hazards of working with
       white phosphorous. Between 1910 and 1914, a period known as the Great Unrest, miners, dockworkers, and
       railway workers across Britain went on strike repeatedly, and workers in other industries walked off the job to
       place added pressure on the strikers' employers to give in to their demands.

       In the United States, both trade unions and labor unions existed. The American Federation of Labor (AFL),
       originally called the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions of the United States and Canada, was
       established by Samuel Gompers in 1886. Like the British Trades Union Congress, it included many different
       unions, though originally, only skilled White male workers could join. The AFL supported strikes, but Gompers
       preferred to avoid them. Even if he had favored strikes, it would have been difficult for members to use them.
       Employers routinely called in the police, private detectives, or the military to disperse striking employees, and
       union leaders could be jailed.

       When Pullman employees went on strike in 1894, more than 100,000 American railroad workers refused to
       handle any train with cars manufactured by Pullman's company. Rail travel ground to a halt, and the
       transportation of the U.S. mail along with it. Violence broke out as striking workers and those who supported
       them burned buildings and attacked African American men who had been hired by railroad owners to replace
       the strikers. The U.S. Army was brought in to end the strike by attacking the workers. Many strikes ended the

way the Pullman strike had.

Revolutionary Ideologies

In Britain and the United States, the organization of unions developed independent of politics. In places such
as Germany, France, and Russia, however, political ideology spurred the development of unions. The
predominant political ideology that influenced their growth was socialism. Today, socialism is a political
theory that advocates the ownership of the means of production by the government. Socialism in the
nineteenth century was somewhat different and took many forms. The only unifying features were a dislike of
laissez-faire capitalism, a desire to improve the lives of the poor, and a belief that the government should be
responsible for solving problems caused by capitalism and industrialization.

In the early nineteenth century, utopian socialism, which focused on perfecting society, dominated. French
visionaries like Henri de Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier wrote of ideal societies based on sharing and
cooperation. They sought to completely alter society and often advocated innovations like communal housing,
free love, and women's rights--all considered radical at the time. Some reformers tried to establish utopian
communities based on these ideals. For example, Robert Owen, a British textile manufacturer, tried to put
some of these ideas into practice in the British village of New Lanark, where the employees of his father-in-
law's textile mill lived, and in the town of New Harmony, Indiana. Residents worked an eight-hour day, lived in
decent housing, and raised their children communally.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, utopian socialism had been largely replaced by scientific socialism.
The term "scientific socialism" was first used by French economist and philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon
to refer to the ordering of society according to the dictates of reason and was popularized by Karl Marx and
Friedrich Engels. Marx and Engels published their ideas in The Communist Manifesto in 1848, a year in which
political revolutions swept Europe. As a result of these revolutions, voting rights for men were established or
expanded in France and Prussia. By the end of the nineteenth century, men in France and Germany (which
united with Prussia in 1871 to form the most powerful German-speaking state) had used the vote to change
their countries. Many espoused the socialist ideology described by Marx and Engels.

Marx and Engels believed that historical change took place as a result of struggles between opposed social
classes. In the age of industrialization, the struggle would take place between the bourgeoisie, who owned the
means of industrial production such as the factories, mines, and railroads by which wealth was generated, and
the proletariat, the underpaid workers whose labor they exploited. Marx and Engels believed capitalism would
be destroyed when the have-nots rose up in revolution and overthrew their bourgeois oppressors. All people
would then be equal, and all property would be held in common. Class divisions and class conflict would
become a thing of the past. This philosophy became known as Marxism and formed the basic ideology of those
who called themselves socialists in the second half of the nineteenth century.

Marx never attempted to put his philosophy into practice. However, during the period of the Second Industrial
Revolution, many workers turned to his ideas as a basis on which to organize unions and establish political
parties. In 1864, socialists founded the International Workingmen's Association (IWA) in London. Many
different types of socialists belonged to the IWA, including Marx, and conflict soon arose over a variety of
issues. Some socialists advocated the use of violence to effect change, while others advocated more peaceful,
democratic means. Those who favored peaceful means are often called social democrats.

One of the largest and most influential of the political parties that espoused social democracy was the German
Social Democratic Party. Formed in 1875, it advocated laws to improve the conditions of the working class, and
many of its members were elected to the German parliament. One of their chief goals was to reduce the
number of hours people worked, and they were active in establishing many trade unions and passing laws to
protect workers. Similar parties formed in other countries. The Federation of the Socialist Workers of France
(FSWF) was established in 1879. The Social Democratic Party of Austria was founded in 1889.

These parties competed for workers' support with those that advocated more revolutionary action. The French
416 10 · Life and Labor in the Industrial World

       Workers' Party was established in 1880 to provide an alternative to the more gradual path to socialism favored
       by the FSWF. The Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, established in 1898, united many smaller socialist
       organizations. The Socialist Revolutionary Party, which engaged in the assassination of government officials,
       formed in Russia in 1902. It ignored Marx's emphasis on industrial workers and sought to organize peasants
       as well. Most Russian socialist groups that took a more orthodox Marxist approach became members of the
       Russian Social Democratic Labor Party when it formed in 1898. The Bolshevik faction of this party, which
       advocated revolution, gained control of the Russian government in 1917.
       Another source of conflict among socialists was the role to be played by government in the construction of the
       ideal socialist state. Although Marx wrote of government eventually disappearing once class divisions had
       been erased and equality achieved, he also indicated that, until then, a government of the workers would be
       needed to manage society. Some socialists feared the existence of this new government would simply lead to
       the creation of a new group of authorities to oppress the people. They believed government should be
       abolished, an ideology known as anarchism. One of the foremost anarchists of the nineteenth century was
       Mikhail Bakunin, a Russian revolutionary. Bakunin joined the IWA in 1868. However, he clashed with Marx
       over the role government should play in bringing about socialism. In 1872, at the Fifth Congress of the IWA, his
       disagreement with Marx led to his expulsion from the group.
       Business owners and members of the middle and upper classes in general disapproved of and feared socialist
       and anarchist movements. They believed business owners performed a valuable service by providing goods
       and services at reasonable prices, making the economy prosper, and keeping their countries strong and
       competitive. They were thus entitled to earn what they believed was a fair profit for assuming the financial
       risks of engaging in business. To do that while keeping prices low, they could not pay wages as high as their
       employees would have liked.
       Opponents of socialism and anarchism argued further that workers were free to accept the terms of
       employment or leave if not satisfied. If business owners were not allowed to earn a profit, they would not take
       the financial risks on which the economy depended. If people were not allowed to accumulate private property,
       they would lack the incentive to work. Violence and the destruction of property benefited no one. Workers
       would be better served by striving to improve their position and that of their children through education and
       the habits of thrift and self-discipline than by listening to the promises of demagogues who preached disloyalty
       to employers and spun utopian fantasies of workers' paradises.

Section Summary

10.1 Inventions, Innovations, and Mechanization

During the Second Industrial Revolution, life in industrialized nations changed dramatically. The electrified,
mechanized workplace meant long hours and low wages for unskilled factory workers. Work was often
dangerous and unemployment precarious. Nevertheless, industrialization did bring benefits. Mass-produced
consumer goods were priced so that by the end of the nineteenth century, members of the working class could
afford to purchase less-expensive versions of items that had once been available only to the middle and
wealthy classes. The mechanization of agriculture and the development of refrigerated railroad cars made
food more available and less expensive. Improved sanitation and medical advances reduced infant mortality
and increased adults' life expectancies. Important demographic changes took place at the same time. By the
end of the nineteenth century, both middle-class and working-class families were having fewer children as
laws restricting child labor and mandating education made it more difficult to employ children.

10.2 Life in the Industrial City

By the end of the nineteenth century, cities in industrialized nations were filled with people in search of work.
These cities offered many benefits. For those who preferred high culture, plays, concerts, operas, and ballets
were regularly staged. Music halls, arcades, and burlesque shows catered to the popular taste, as did
amusement parks. Libraries and parks were open to everyone. Department stores gave people the opportunity
to buy the latest fashions--or to dream about them through the window.

There were negative aspects to city life as well. Housing, especially for immigrants and the working class, was
usually overcrowded, and rooms often lacked fresh air and sunlight. Both the water and the air in industrial
cities were polluted, and infectious diseases such as cholera and tuberculosis were common. Poverty drove
many to drink, and some women resorted to prostitution to survive. The literature and art produced by
romantics, realists, and naturalists depicted all aspects of life in the industrial age.

10.3 Coerced and Semicoerced Labor

Although working-class people in industrialized nations had limited choices about the place and terms of their
employment, many other workers did not have even this small degree of freedom. Slavery continued into the
second half of the nineteenth century in the United States and Brazil, as did serfdom in Russia. In other forms
of unfree labor, contract laborers and indentured servants performed agricultural and other work on every one
of the six inhabited continents. Debt bondage also trapped many people, including African American
sharecroppers in the United States and female textile workers in Japan. Prisoners were also often sentenced to
perform labor as part of their punishment. These systems of coerced and semicoerced labor remained intact
throughout the nineteenth century in various parts of the world.

10.4 Communities in Diaspora

Witnessed in the second half of the nineteenth century was the migration of large numbers of people fleeing
poverty, violence, and natural disaster. Europeans emigrated to North and South America, Australia, New
Zealand, and South Africa. Asians traveled to western Europe, the Americas, and Africa. Immigrants
performed largely low-paid, physically demanding work on plantations and railroads and in factories. Non-
European immigrants also faced racism in societies dominated by Europeans. Some countries attempted to
restrict the immigration of particular groups. The United States, Canada, and Australia took steps to prohibit
Asian migration. The United States also sought to limit immigration from southern and eastern Europe.

10.5 Regulation, Reform, and Revolutionary Ideologies

Attempts to solve the problems caused by industrialization and urbanization took a variety of forms. Some
governments passed laws to abolish child labor, provide insurance for workers, ensure safe housing, prevent
air and water pollution, and regulate prostitution. Middle-class reformers sought to improve society by altering
personal behavior. They stressed the importance of morality and often attempted to restrict or prohibit the
consumption of alcohol. Many also advocated for women's rights. Members of the working class tried to better
their lives by forming unions to force employers to reduce their hours, raise their wages, and provide safer
working conditions. Many also turned to politics as a way to protect their interests. Influenced by the ideology
of socialism, which theorized that the destruction of capitalism was the solution to social ills, they joined social
democratic parties that organized unions and forced governments to pass legislation to protect workers. Other
socialists advocated the violent overthrow of the ruling elites, as did some anarchists.

INTRODUCTION World War I served as a clear demarcation line. By separating the world of empires from an
emerging and more modern world, the conflict set the stage for a redrawn map of Europe. It featured many
characteristics that have since become common in warfare--total war, civilian losses, massive numbers of
troops in armies, and warfare that relies on military technology as well as the courageous charge of soldiers
against enemies (Figure 11.1). The war was a surprise to many and was welcomed by some when it broke out
in 1914. Its level of destruction, however, came to shape public opinion about war for decades.

11.1 Alliances, Expansion, and Conflict

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe political conditions in Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century
  · Analyze the nature of the alliances made among European powers by 1914
  · Explain how the desire for colonies destabilized the balance of power in the early twentieth century
  · Describe the competition to build modern navies in the early twentieth century

By the early twentieth century, Europe had achieved outward stability through a series of alliances. Such
accords were a hallmark of nineteenth-century diplomacy and had maintained peace for decades on the
continent, compressing the wars that did occur into finite conflicts. In the 1900s, these alliances had solidified
two opposed groups, each with major powers that allied with one another and then developed relationships
with smaller nations. Germany's territorial ambitions put it in direct conflict with other imperialistic powers as
it sought to expand its colonial holdings. Its desire to be taken more seriously and become a force in global
affairs threatened to destabilize the peace when its goals brought it into competition with other countries
hungry for land and power, notably Great Britain, and led to military buildups. A specter of war soon hung over
Europe.

The Long Peace

The decades before the world erupted into the Great War, as World War I was known, were generally marked by
great stability. The work done in 1815 to create a balance of power among European nations in the wake of the
Napoleonic Wars had been quite successful. The Concert of Europe--an informal agreement to maintain the
status quo--had been able to absorb some internal conflicts and the growth of more liberal political thoughts
without incurring political or territorial instability. There were occasionally military conflicts, but these were
usually of short duration and limited in scale.

Prussia, however, with its militarized culture, clearly did still see warfare as a means of achieving its own ends,
as did other nations such as France. Austria-Hungary and Prussia went to war in 1866. The conflict lasted only
about seven weeks and was handily won by Prussia, which had invested in better military technology and
weaponry and now annexed several German states. Austria was effectively barred from participating in
German affairs from that point forward, and Prussia became the dominant German state. The war also forced
Austria into accepting the dual monarchy system, an unwieldy alliance with Hungary. Austria agreed because
it needed allies after being ousted from German affairs, but it and Hungary had separate national governments
and parliaments (and different goals) despite being part of the same empire.

The Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and 1871 was another fairly brief conflict that resulted in major change.
France declared war against Prussia after a dispute over who would inherit the Spanish throne. The fighting
lasted only a few months, but Paris was besieged by the Prussian army, and Napoléon III was captured. The
treaty that ended the conflict forced France to pay a large war indemnity to Prussia. France also had to pay for
the occupation forces, while losing the territories of Alsace and Lorraine (which changed hands again several
times during the first half of the twentieth century). This was a humiliating defeat for France, though it paved
the way for the unification of the German Empire. The signing of the treaty in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace
of Versailles cemented Prussia's leadership of the new empire and its successful achievement of what had
been left undone by the revolutions of 1848: Germany automatically emerged as a major power in Europe.

The fighting in these wars was localized, and because they were short, the conflicts did not require the
mobilization of a country's economy or full resources. They did not involve numerous countries either, and the
fighting rarely spilled over into other nations' lands. With the exception of the Franco-Prussian War, their
impact on civilian society was minimal, with little loss of civilian life or destruction of property. In a sense,
their very nature lulled much of Europe into expecting that although there might be future wars, they would be
swift and small affairs.

      Treaties and Alliances

       Since he first rose to power in 1862, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck had pursued conservative policies
       that strengthened first Prussia and then Germany itself. In particular, Bismarck hoped to check the power of
       Russia and France by developing a series of alliances that would keep them from growing more dominant and
       presenting a threat to German leadership in the region. A military alliance with Austria-Hungary was created
       to stand up to Russia. This alliance later grew to include Italy and became formalized as the Triple Alliance. In
       1894, Russia and France signed a treaty pledging military support for one another if attacked and requiring
       each to mobilize its armies if the other did so. In 1907, the Triple Entente was created between Russia, France,
       and Britain, growing out of a shared distrust of German aims.
       By the early twentieth century, then, a series of alliances had effectively divided Europe into two blocs of
       power. A bloc is a group of countries united for a common purpose. One bloc included Russia, France, and
       Britain, and the other Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. While these two groups stood opposed to one
       another, there were nuances in the arrangements. Britain, for example, had not promised any mutual aid in
       times of war when it signed its initial agreement with France, nor had it done so in its agreement with Russia,
       while France was bound to provide military support for Russia if Russia were attacked and not the aggressor.
       What these new alliances also did was provide fuel for the German emperor Wilhelm II's growing concern that
       he was surrounded by hostile nations (Figure 11.4). Some of this preoccupation was undoubtedly justified.
       Germany faced a hostile France to its west and Russia to its east. But Wilhelm's fixation on it drove him and
       Germany to adopt even more aggressive stances toward their "enemies" that helped create the cataclysm of
       World War I.

Colonies and Conflict

The view that imperial strength should be devoted to colony building was still very much in place in the late
1800s. Still industrializing, and having unified as a country only in 1871, Germany soon felt the pressure to
build an overseas empire, just as the other industrializing nations of the world--Britain, France, Belgium, the
United States, Russia, and Japan--did. But there were limited locales it could target.
Germany began to look to the Pacific as a place where it could establish itself as a colonial power. The United
States, Britain, France, Japan, and the Netherlands already held extensive territory in the Pacific. Germany
soon claimed part of New Guinea, part of the Solomon Islands, and the Marshall Islands. In 1899, Germany's
growing power in the Pacific led to the partitioning of the Samoan Islands with the United States. Germany also
gained some of the smaller island groups--Palau, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands--by the beginning of
the twentieth century. In addition, it planned to join the "Scramble for Africa" in which European nations were
engaging to shore up their colonial holdings on the African continent.
When Germany went in search of African colonies, there was not much left. Britain, France, Belgium, and
Portugal had already seized control of most of the continent and did not welcome the claims of yet another
European nation. Germany took a portion of East Africa and Southwest Africa, which had a large border with
the British colonies. Togoland and the Cameroons also became part of the German colonial empire (Figure
11.5).

In 1905, Germany clashed with both France and Britain in North Africa. Kaiser Wilhelm II arrived in Morocco
that year and made a speech in which he threw his full support behind its being an independent state led by
the sultan. He also voiced his expectation that Germany would enjoy the same benefits of trade in the region
that France and England did. Wilhelm hoped to divide Britain and France by thus claiming a place for
430 11 · The War to End All Wars

       Germany in North Africa equivalent to that held by other European nations. Instead, in response to this First
       Moroccan Crisis, Britain and France established stronger bonds of friendship.

       A few years later, another crisis erupted over Morocco, though this one was more media driven and involved
       more national posturing. The Second Moroccan Crisis started in 1911. France and Germany had been
       negotiating over what say Germany would have in rail lines under construction in Morocco and over some
       territory in the French Congo that Germany wanted. Britain and France had earlier become alarmed by
       Germany's plans to build another railroad in concert with the Ottoman Empire that would link Berlin to
       Baghdad. This railway would provide Germany with more direct access to both Persian Gulf oil and its African
       colonies. Moving oil and other goods by rail would also make Germany less vulnerable to potential British
       naval attacks.

       In May 1911, France, fearing rebellion in Morocco, sent troops to the city of Fez. In July of that year, Germany
       sent a gunboat to Agadir, a Moroccan port on the Atlantic, to ensure that it would be compensated for any loss
       of control over Moroccan territory that resulted from French intervention. Germany also undoubtedly
       intended to frighten Britain and force it to back out of its alliance with France. Soon British politicians and the
       media seized on the opportunity to attack Germany for its demands. The British said they were not yet sending
       in the Royal Navy but would be monitoring the situation. In the end, France and Germany held successful
       negotiations over the issues, with Germany receiving territory in the French Congo in exchange for
       acknowledging French dominance in Morocco, but the international effect of the crisis was broader. Britain
       was reinforced in its view that Germany posed a threat to its own colonial ambitions. On the German side, the
       military leadership gained greater political influence in the capital in Berlin.

      The Growth of Militaries

       Naval power assumed a greater role in world affairs in the late nineteenth century. As more of the
       industrialized nations embarked on empire building, and as reaching international markets became an
       expected part of their strategy, the value of having strong navies to protect commercial trade only grew.
       Maintaining supply and fueling stations around the world to service these navies and fleets of merchant ships
       became a key argument in favor of developing more colonies.

       At the start of the twentieth century, Great Britain was still the unmatched naval power in the world. Kaiser
       Wilhelm II was determined to counter Britain's sea power by building up the German navy. In this, he was ably
       assisted by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. Tirpitz had similarly grand dreams for the navy, and through his
       various positions in the naval high command, he set out an ambitious building program for new battleships.

           LINK TO LEARNING

       This website has statistics on the naval ships (https://openstax.org/l/77NavalStats) that Britain and Germany
       possessed prior to World War I. England contended that it saw Germany as a viable threat. Do the numbers
       back up its claim?

       Germany's fear of naval inferiority became especially strong after 1906. In that year, Britain debuted an
       entirely new class of ship when the HMS Dreadnought set sail. What made this ship different was its ten
       12-inch guns, some of them mounted on rotatable turrets, and its faster speed, powered by steam turbines.
       Other ships of the period had only a handful of guns and not all of this size. No other warship could match it in
       battle. Germany tried to keep pace by constructing ships similar in size, but although it clearly hoped to one
       day outbuild Britain, at no point before or during the war did its fleet ever match the British numbers (Figure
       11.6).

 A German Perspective

  In 1911, General Friedrich von Bernhardi, a German military commander, published a book entitled Germany and
  the Next War in which he asserted that Germany was correct to establish itself as a major power and defend its
  rights in Europe and the world. This translated passage addresses the situation in which Germany believed itself
  to be in the years before the war.

        When a State is confronted by the material impossibility of supporting any longer the warlike
        preparations which the power of its enemies has forced upon it, when it is clear that the rival States
        must gradually acquire from natural reasons a lead that cannot be won back, when there are indications
        of an offensive alliance of stronger enemies who only await the favourable moment to strike - the moral
        duty of the State towards its citizens is to begin the struggle while the prospects of success and the
        political circumstances are still tolerably favourable. When, on the other hand, the hostile States are
        weakened or hampered by affairs at home and abroad, but its own warlike strength shows elements of
        superiority, it is imperative to use the favourable circumstances to promote its own political aims. The
        danger of a war may be faced the more readily if there is good prospect that great results may be
        obtained with comparatively small sacrifices. [. . .]
        Thus in order to decide what paths German policy must take in order to further the interests of the
        German people, and what possibilities of war are involved, we must first try to estimate the problems of
        State and of civilization which are to be solved, and discover what political purposes correspond to
        these problems.

Germany's army, however, was much larger than Britain's. Compulsory military service was the norm in
Germany and Austria-Hungary. Germany placed high reliance on its active military units, which totaled close
to four million soldiers, and had numerous units on reserve as well. Germany's ally Austria-Hungary had a
smaller force of under 500,000. In reaction to the growth and power of the German army, other nations also
built up their armies.
432 11 · The War to End All Wars

       In Russia, military service was required. Although its armies were poorly trained and outfitted, its peacetime
       forces numbered nearly 1.5 million, and millions more could be called up as part of military mobilization.
       France had also adopted compulsory service (at the time it required three years of service from all men) and
       fielded an active army of almost 1.3 million. Those who had already done their compulsory service were
       classified as reservists and could be mobilized as well.

       The British army, which relied on volunteer troops, was still relatively small at the onset of the war. The Old
       Regulars, as they were known, numbered only a little over a quarter-million. The strength of Britain lay rather
       in its navy. The British reveled in what they called the "splendid isolation" of their island, an acknowledgment
       that issues on the European continent did not directly touch it.

       The United States, which did not enter the war until 1917, had also chosen to keep a small military force,
       numbering fewer than 130,000. It had built up its navy beginning in the 1890s, when its imperial advances
       necessitated a more efficient and up-to-date force, though it did not have the ship numbers that European
       powers possessed. For the United States, keeping a small force was compatible with the isolationist tendencies
       it had maintained through the 1800s. With oceans on two sides, the country was relatively protected from
       overseas entanglements and had diplomatically tried to avoid them.

       Besides building up their armies and navies, military planners in several European countries also began
       designing how operations would occur in the next war. Germany anticipated that, encircled by enemies, it
       would have to fight on two fronts--against Russia on one side and France on the other. Developed by Field
       Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen in the early 1900s, the Schlieffen Plan held that Russia would be slow to
       mobilize, so Germany should use that time to attack Belgium and France and then pivot to fight Russia. This
       plan would make the conflict a short one. The French designed Plan XVII, which called for a major French
       offensive through Alsace-Lorraine to target the industrial heartland of Germany. Russia developed Plan 19,
       which would order Russian attacks on East Prussia once Germany was engaged against France.

     11.2 The Collapse of the Ottomans and the Coming of War

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:
         · Identify the causes of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire
         · Analyze the rise of nationalism among minority ethnic groups within Austria-Hungary and the
             Ottoman Empire

       Former German chancellor Otto von Bismarck supposedly commented that the next big problem for Europe,
       most likely the next big war, would come out of "some damned foolish thing in the Balkans." This prediction
       proved to be remarkably precise. The events of 1914 did not happen in a vacuum and were the result of many
       years of rising tensions in a volatile region of Europe, coupled with diplomatic maneuvers among the great
       empires of the continent. Yet even as the prelude to the war unfolded, most people did not truly expect conflict
       to be the outcome.

      The "Sick Man of Europe"

       The Ottoman Empire had always been predicated on expansion. It drew its strength from its territorial gains
       and the exploitation of the best and brightest from these new territories to serve the leader of the empire, the
       sultan. The strategy had worked for a number of centuries, even delivering an Ottoman army as far as the gates
       of Vienna in 1683 before it was pushed back. At its height, the empire encompassed areas of the Middle East,
       northern Africa, and significant swaths of southeastern Europe (Figure 11.7).

Starting in the 1800s, however, the Ottoman Empire entered a period of waning power as it grew unable to
respond to nationalistic challenges. In the 1820s, nationalist leaders in Greece began fighting the Greek Civil
War, and in 1830 Greece gained its independence from the Ottomans. More countries split off from the Empire
in the 1870s, including Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria. By the end of the nineteenth century, the demise of the
empire, now known as "the sick man of Europe," was being predicted; only the timing was in question. The
Ottoman Empire was no longer strong enough to hold onto its outlying areas, and these grew ever more
destabilized. The other powers in Europe watched with concern as the Ottoman Empire became weaker and
other countries stepped in to fill the power vacuum, occupying and administering a region but not annexing it
as Ottoman influence withdrew.
The ideology of nationalism was taking hold across Europe in the 1800s, and in the 1900s it only grew. The
prospect of having a country for each nationality was tantalizingly appealing: Poland for the Poles, Serbia for
the Serbs, and so on. In an empire, however, nationalism was a powerful danger. Empires were built of many
different nationalities, and they would disintegrate if each group were granted its own land and nation. The
Ottoman Empire had already seen such pressures develop in its eastern sections, and Austria-Hungary faced
this problem as well: more than ten different nationalities could be found within its borders. The concept of
434 11 · The War to End All Wars

       nationalism threatened the Austro-Hungarian Empire's very survival (Figure 11.8).

       FIGURE 11.8 Ethnic Groups in Austria-Hungary. This map displays the various nationalities that all resided within
       the empire of Austria-Hungary at the time of World War I. (credit: modification of work "Linguistic map of the
       Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in the 1910s" by Yale University Library/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       The theory of pan-Slavic nationalism, which would unite all Slavic people under one rule, was a powerful one
       too. Slavic peoples have a shared historic culture and similar languages that include Bulgarian, Russian,
       Croatian, Serbian, Slovak, Czech, and Polish. They extended throughout the Balkan region and shared many of
       the same animosities toward the imperial powers of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. By the
       twentieth century, Serbia had emerged as the leader of the pan-Slavic position in the Balkans. Its policy was
       characterized by hatred of Austria-Hungary and opposition to that empire's forays into Balkan issues. Russia,
       too, was a Slavic nation and showed great interest in what was happening to its historic kin in the Balkans.
       Indeed, Russia saw itself as the natural leader of any potential pan-Slavic political entity that might emerge in
       the Balkans. Russia also saw Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans as rivals in the region and did not want either
       power to make any territorial gains. Russia hoped that by gaining influence in the Balkans, it could gain direct
       access to the Mediterranean Sea. Before 1914, however, Russia was not prepared to risk war to maintain this
       stance.
       The Balkans was a prime example of both the threat of nationalism and the threat from the weakening power
       of the Ottoman Empire. The region housed people of different nationalities and different religions. The
       Ottomans had been steadily losing power there and were certain to continue to do so. The nearby empire of
       Austria-Hungary looked covetously upon the Balkans, seeing an opportunity to take over more territory. In
       1908, Austria-Hungary moved to block Serbian expansion in the Balkans by taking over administration of

Serbia continued its plan to exercise more control through the Balkans and helped found the Balkan League
with Greece, Bulgaria, and Montenegro in 1912. The league then touched off the First Balkan War in October
1912 by attacking Macedonia, which was still held by the Ottomans. In May 1913, the Balkan League
comprehensively defeated the Ottomans and forced them to give up most of their territory in Europe.
Disagreements among the victors in the Balkans soon devolved into the Second Balkan War as Bulgaria
attacked Serbia and Greece in 1913. Bulgaria was soon defeated, but this loss drove it to forge a deeper alliance
with the Central powers--Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire--when World War I broke out.
The Balkan Wars also forced continued displacement of Muslims from the region. After Serbia's independence
decades earlier, there had been systematic efforts to force Muslims to leave. This drive spread throughout the
Balkans as Christians increasingly attacked Muslims, causing hundreds of thousands to relocate to the
Ottoman Empire. As the empire withdrew from the Balkans, many of these Muslims left with it, although
substantial Muslim populations remained and still live in the Balkans today. The Ottoman Empire then had to
cope with a substantial population increase at the same time that its standing in the world was on a decline.

The Spark That Lit the Powder Keg

Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary had no surviving son in the 1900s, so upon his death, a nephew,
Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was set to inherit control of the empire. The archduke was not particularly well-
liked by his uncle. For one thing, he had new ideas that actually supported more autonomy for the Balkan
region within the empire. He was scheduled to travel to the Balkans in the summer of 1914 for a review of
troops and survey of the region of Bosnia-Herzegovina. A tour of the city of Sarajevo was planned for June 28,
436 11 · The War to End All Wars

       an important date for the Serbian people. It was a day of mourning for the 1389 Battle of Kosovo, which the
       Serbian people had lost to the encroaching Ottoman Empire but which also marked the birth of Serbian unity.
       A visit on such a day by Franz Ferdinand, the symbol of another encroaching empire, was seen as a slap in the
       face (Figure 11.10).

       Late in June, a small band of would-be Bosnian Serb (ethnic Serbs who lived in Bosnia-Herzegovina) assassins
       armed with weapons from the Serbian military crossed the border from Serbia into Bosnia-Herzegovina. They
       belonged to an organization called the Black Hand. Their goal was the separation of Bosnia-Herzegovina from
       Austria-Hungary and its annexation by Serbia to form Greater Serbia, a state comprising all regions of
       importance to ethnic Serbs. The Black Hand's plan was to assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo.
       On June 28, they threw a bomb at his motorcade but missed the archduke. However, that afternoon, one of
       them, Gavrilo Princip, found himself right next to the archduke's touring car after it had taken a wrong turn.
       Princip, then nineteen years old, pulled out a gun and shot both Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife
       Sophie. Both died that day. Princip was arrested immediately.

       their way to the hospital to visit victims of the first attack when the second one occurred.
       Over the course of the next several weeks, a series of investigations was undertaken and ultimatums began
       flying from Austria-Hungary to Serbia. Austria-Hungary demanded Serbian subservience to atone for
       harboring the terrorist organization that planned and carried out the assassination. Austria-Hungary

essentially wanted to destroy Serbia's independence. For its part, Serbia did not want to go to war with Austria-
Hungary and would have agreed to many concessions, but it could not effectively agree to give up its
independence. As the situation grew more desperate, Serbia turned to its ally Russia. Appealing to the Slavic
heritage of both nations, Serbian leaders extracted a promise that Russia would come to their aid if Austria-
Hungary attacked.

For Austria-Hungary, the prospect of war with Russia was much more complicated than war solely with Serbia
would be. Austria-Hungary turned to its longtime ally Germany for a show of support. Germany then extended
a "blank check" to Austria-Hungary, asking for no details about what Austria-Hungary was planning but
essentially agreed to back it no matter what. Germany expected that Austria-Hungary would make a quick
move against Serbia, but as the weeks passed, its "blank check" came to look like an endorsement of Austria-
Hungary's hostile behavior.

Over the next month, what had been an argument between two nations was enveloping the entire continent. It
was becoming clear that if war broke out, it would pull into it many countries bound by their treaty obligations
to one another. Many people were alarmed, believing such a war would have few winners. One group that
loudly protested a possible war were Europe's socialist leaders. They were already predisposed to reject
monarchial arguments in favor of a war, since the industrial masses would be the ones fighting it. Even once
the war started, socialists such as Keir Hardie, one of the founders of the Labour Party in Great Britain, were
still trying to organize workers to strike in protest against it.

In France, as the war approached, the socialist leader Jean Jaurès was increasingly concerned about how it
would affect the French people. Jaurès had been speaking out in favor of pacifism for many years and had
opposed France's three-year conscription law in 1913. In 1914, he continued to agitate against the prospect of
a general European war. Arguing that no workers anywhere would benefit from a war of the elites, he even tried
to work with German socialists in opposition to the war, attending the congress of the Socialist International in
Brussels in July 1914. On July 31, however, Raoul Villain, a young man with French nationalist sympathies,
shot and killed Jaurès in Paris, where he was dining after his return from Brussels. The outcry over Jaurès's
death threatened to further disrupt France's precarious position, while other countries were already
mobilizing their troops.

For socialists across Europe, the war became a defining moment. Their shared ideal of international socialism
came up against their nationalist sympathies and love of country. Once the war did break out, they came out in
support of it and endorsed funding it. Russian socialists were less likely to support the war effort, though later
they played a role in the war as the Russian monarchy collapsed. In Italy, factional splits among the socialists
helped lead to the rise of Benito Mussolini. Unlike other Italian socialists, Mussolini supported Italy's entry into
the war because he believed it was the spark needed to launch a socialist revolution. He was expelled from the
party as a result. Mussolini's support for the war made him appealing to Italian nationalists who later formed
the backbone of the postwar fascist movement.

Emboldened by support from Germany's "blank check," Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28,
1914, after Serbia failed to meet the demands of the Austrian ultimatum. Russia ordered mobilization of its
troops on July 30 in response. Germany now found itself pulled into the fight whether it wanted to be or not,
declaring war on Russia on August 1 and ordering full mobilization. France then ordered its own general
mobilization, partly because it was bound to by treaty terms with Russia but also because it feared what a
mobilized Germany might do to it, with memories of the Franco-Prussian War in mind. As it turned out, France
was right to be apprehensive.

The military planners in Germany had been readying for war for many years in the absence of any actual
combat. The Schlieffen Plan for fighting a short, two-front war had been continuously amended after its initial
development, but in 1914 its basic form still rested on the belief that Russia would be slow to mobilize and
unable to field troops for many weeks after a declaration of war. Since Germany was prepared for immediate
mobilization, it would use these weeks to attack France and capture Paris, causing France's surrender (as it
438 11 · The War to End All Wars

       had in 1871), and then it would turn its troops to fight Russia.

       The expectation of a short war was not just on Germany's side. Other countries also believed in 1914 that even
       if a war broke out that summer, the troops would be home by Christmas. Some even saw war as a catharsis for
       all the tension in Europe and felt it would be a welcome event. Many young men, not having experienced a war
       in their lifetimes, excitedly followed news of the diplomatic wrangling and the early calls of mobilization.

       Germany's plan for war on France called for moving westward and then sweeping south to head for Paris. To do
       this, the German armies would need to march across the country of Belgium. On August 2, 1914, they reached
       the Belgian border and asked for permission to enter and cross to France. Belgium was a small country, with a
       small military and no way to successfully fight a German advance. The German military leaders and their
       troops believed it would quickly agree to let them through. But the King of Belgium declined. In 1839, the
       German Confederation (the predecessor of Germany) as well as other countries in Europe had been signatories
       to a treaty that guaranteed the independence of Belgium. The king believed that allowing Germany entrance
       would undermine its independence, and he could not allow that. He ordered the Belgium military to begin
       blowing up bridges to prevent an easy German crossing.

       The German armies entered anyway but were immensely frustrated by their slow progress and Belgium's
       obstinacy. As they made their way, they took their revenge on the Belgian civilians. For weeks they laid siege to
       the fortress town of Liège, demolishing the dozen forts that surrounded it. In some cities, believing they were
       being shot at by civilians, German troops rounded up some of the men in the community and executed them.
       Ultimately, hundreds of civilians including women and children were killed. The German army wrought
       wholesale destruction, burning more than a thousand buildings, including the library in Louvain.

                                                                                                  IN THEIR OWN WORDS

        The Burning of Louvain

         The following is an eyewitness account of the burning of the city of Louvain during the 1914 German invasion of
         Belgium, written by a professor at the local university who describes the fire and a subsequent encounter with
         German soldiers.

               Wednesday, 26th August, 1 o'clock in the morning. Awakened by the glare of burning houses. Went up
               to the roof of the College. Several houses in succession broke into flames. By the Old Market Place, on
               which the University Library building abuts, houses blazed up and collapsed one after another. Watched
               the progress of the fire anxiously.

               1.30 a.m. The houses next to the Library were on fire.

               1.45 a.m. The first flames darted through the roof of the Library. The Library was entirely consumed. [. .
               .]

               We then saw, brought between two soldiers with fixed bayonets and accompanied by two officers,
               Father Eugène Dupiéreux. He held in his clasped hands his crucifix and rosary. We understood. [. . .]

               [The following is the text of a paper found on Father Dupiéreux and read aloud at the scene.]

               "At the beginning of the war we laughed when French newspapers spoke of the invasion of barbarian

        hordes. Those who, like us, have seen the conduct of Germans at Louvain, now know what to expect. . . .
        After the burning of the Library and the University, the barbarians can no longer have a word to say
        against Khalif Omar for burning the Library at Alexandria. And all in the name of German culture!"

        When the paper had been read and translated there was silence for a moment. Father Dupiéreux asked
        to be allowed to receive absolution. "Absolution! What is that?" was the brutal reply. He answered "To
        see a priest." They assented. A priest advanced. Father Dupiéreux knelt down, and the priest heard his
        confession and give [sic] him absolution. When the Father arose his confessor grasped him by the hand,
        and after a few words had been exchanged, Father Dupiéreux advanced alone in the direction of the
        wood. He was pale but quite calm. [. . .]

        Thirty yards from us Father Dupiéreux was ordered to halt. Four soldiers came and lined up ten yards in
        front of us. The order to fire was given by a non-commissioned officer. Father Dupiéreux fell. There was
        silence for two minutes. The Father's arm still moved. We were made to turn round. The victim was
        despatched by a bullet in the temple and buried.

        We do not know whether Father Dupiéreux was tried. In any case, it may be calculated that the trial
        cannot have lasted ten minutes. Moreover, the officers present had an imperfect knowledge of French
        and Father Dupiéreux did not know German. Nobody can have helped him in his defence.

        While this was going on it was explained to us that we were hostages and that if anyone fired on the
        troops we should all be shot.

These weeks, more than any others, shaped the world's perception of the war and of Germany. The "Rape of
Belgium" cast Germany as an aggressor nation that behaved inhumanely in war. It fed the propaganda
machines of the Allies, the nations that united to oppose Germany and Austria-Hungary and originally
consisted of Russia, France, and Britain.

Britain was carefully monitoring events and news at the beginning of August. Foreign Secretary Edward Gray
delivered a speech on August 3 describing what was at stake in failing to react to the threat hanging over
Belgium. Germany and France went to war with one another on August 3, and on August 4 Britain declared war
on Germany. The British Expeditionary Force of close to a quarter of a million soldiers arrived in France and
helped support the French troops as they tried to withstand the German war machine.

The combatants rushed to begin recruiting more troops for their militaries. Conscription laws in some
countries meant that adult men had already received some military training and were assigned to reserve
units, so there was a straightforward means to organize and deploy these troops. Other places, such as Great
Britain, had a volunteer military. Either way, there was mass enthusiasm as the war broke out, and men
thronged to recruiting stations (Figure 11.11).

      The World at War

       Some German units never made it out of Belgium, and fierce fighting there continued for the duration of the
       war. Other units swept south and continued their advance through northern France. French troops moved
       swiftly to block them. The Battle of the Marne in September 1914 created front lines where a stalemate lasted
       several years as both sides dug a trench system from which to fight. German armies were moving toward Paris
       when the French were able to exploit a gap between two of the divisions. A series of flanking maneuvers
       ensued as the French and Germans both raced to the sea. Additional French troops were called up, and at one
       point the French reserves even commandeered the taxicabs of Paris to ferry themselves to the front. The Battle
       of the Marne went on for a week before the German advance was stopped. The battle was fought so close to
       Paris that civilians could hear the sounds of the fighting. Given an information blackout due to government
       censors, rumors about the threat to Paris were rampant. Approximately 800,000 people left the city,
       anticipating a German invasion.

       the Smithsonian. What do they tell you about the way these songs sought to inspire people on the battlefield
       and the home front?

       In the east, Germany found itself facing the Russians in battle much earlier than expected. Due to its size, the
       potential of the Russian military was great, but the reality was quite different; the troops were poorly equipped
       and poorly trained. At the Battle of Tannenberg, for example, communication problems developed among the
       Russian high command, while the troops suffered from lack of supplies; the country's limited rail lines could
       not keep up with their needs. The Germans decimated them. They took more than 90,000 prisoners, and
       another 50,000 Russians had become casualties in the week of fighting. The Germans suffered fewer than
       20,000 casualties in comparison. The general in command of the Russian army committed suicide.
       The Russians' dearth of supplies also featured in a major engagement with the Austro-Hungarian forces as

Russia laid siege to Przemyl in modern-day Poland. As the siege continued from the summer into the fall and
then the winter, Russian soldiers lacked coats and boots to withstand the plummeting temperatures, though
Russia ultimately took the city in 1915. The Austro-Hungarian forces bore the brunt of the siege and fighting in
the nearby mountains to relieve the fortress, experiencing well over 900,000 casualties--an astronomical
number.

The naval power of Great Britain was soon brought to bear. The British instituted a blockade of German ports
that made it exceedingly difficult for Germany to import the goods it needed. The country's industrial strength
helped it survive this blockade for a good portion of the war, but by its last year, shortages were being felt by
every German family. Its navy was not large enough to implement a retaliatory blockade against Britain, but
Germany did consider the North Sea a war zone and used mines and submarines to sink ships sailing there.

In Asia, the coming of the war caused nations to take sides. The Japanese Empire, emboldened by its success
against Russia less than a decade earlier in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), saw the opportunity to
increase its standing in the world and sided with the Allies. Japanese forces attacked the German colonial port
at Qingdao (Tsingtao), a city on the Chinese coast that Germany had held for less than twenty years as the
planned headquarters of its Asian empire. In mid-August 1914, Japan demanded that Germany abandon
Qingdao. When it refused, Japan blockaded the port and began bombarding it. The attacks continued for two
months until Germany surrendered the city in November. Japan was able to cement its relationship with Great
Britain and give its modernizing military another victory that increased its pride.

The Allies rejected offers of military troops from China at the beginning of the war. By 1916, however, the
situation had changed, and Britain and France allowed Chinese laborers to come to Europe. China had been
willing to send combat troops, hoping to gain leverage in treaty negotiations after the war and support for
ousting Japan from its borders, but Japan, which had taken control of Qingdao and hoped to establish itself as
the unquestioned military power in Asia, would not permit it. Thus, approximately 130,000 Chinese laborers
arrived in Europe, to repair equipment and dig trenches but not to fight.

Other combatant powers entered the war after the summer of 1914. In October, the Ottoman Empire engaged
in combat on behalf of the Central powers by attacking Russia's fleet on the Black Sea. For the Ottomans,
entering into the war was a calculated risk. The empire hoped to regain some standing in the world and even
possibly more territory, and clear bonds had developed between the Ottoman leadership and that of Germany
over the past years. Other countries soon followed suit. Bulgaria entered the war via secret agreement in 1915
on the side of the Central powers, also hoping for territorial acquisition at the conclusion of the fighting. On the
other side of the spectrum, Italy had announced its neutrality when the war broke out, but many Italians
harbored a dislike of Austria-Hungary, and there had been many disagreements about the border between the
two countries over the years. In May 1915, Italy declared war against the Central powers, having first secured
Allied support through a secret agreement in April. The hope of reclaiming land lost to Austria-Hungary was
paramount in its decision.

Isolationism had been a consistent practice of U.S. foreign policy, and the United States planned to maintain it,
while at the same time selling products to both the Allied powers of Britain and France and the Central powers
of Germany and Austria-Hungary. It was clear from the outset, however, that "the vast majority of American
trade went to the Allies," partly because of Britain's substantial role in U.S. naval, merchant, and credit
operations but also because the British blockade made it difficult for anyone to trade with Germany. U.S. banks
were soon extending loans and lines of credit to both sides as well, although approximately $2 billion had been
extended to the Allies by the spring of 1917 and a mere $27 million to the Central powers.

Among the American public, there was little support for or interest in entering this European war. Not
hampered by censorship of the news as the combatant powers were, American readers could easily learn
about the casualty numbers and the horror of the war. They congratulated themselves that they were not party
to this insanity and showed little desire to enter it.
442 11 · The War to End All Wars

       There were additional complicating issues for the United States. The country's volunteer army was quite small
       and would have little impact on the war if it entered at this time. While businesses and banks were siding with
       the Allied cause, a substantial number of Irish immigrants were vehemently anti-British because of ongoing
       conflicts in Ireland, and it was questionable how they would react to the United States entering a war on the
       British side. There was also a significantly large German population in the United States that could oppose
       siding with the Allies. President Woodrow Wilson had shown little interest in foreign policy in his previous
       career as a professor of government and history; instead, he saw domestic reform as his administration's main
       focus when he came into office. He had been willing to intervene in Latin America as a neighboring region but
       did not have that same approach regarding Europe. However, his commitment to the freedom of the seas and
       the rights of neutral nations in times of war soon put him on a collision course with Germany.

     11.3 Total War

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:
         · Explain how new technology affected combat in World War I
         · Describe the experience of the average soldier on the battlefield in World War I
         · Discuss the role combatants' colonies and colonial troops played in World War I
         · Analyze the effect of racism on the actions of the major powers in World War I

       World War I was a truly modern war. The combatants used then-new weaponry such as tanks and airplanes as
       well as machine guns and poison gas, making the soldiers' experience unlike anything earlier generations had
       faced in battle. The massive numbers of troops and weapons meant that fighting and destruction regularly
       intruded on civilian life, often with devastating results. Thus, not only armies but entire nations had to do their
       part and bear the brunt of the war. The widespread use of colonial troops brought mass travel to the globe, and
       the interactions of many different peoples played out against the backdrop of combat. For all these reasons,
       and in recognition of its vast extent and destructiveness, World War I came to be called a total war, a war
       fought using all available resources, with no restrictions on weapons or their targets.

      The Unending Horror of War

       Military technology had changed greatly by the beginning of the twentieth century, and these changes were not
       often understood or appreciated by either soldiers or commanders when the war broke out. The recent spread
       of industrialization meant that more weapons with greater firepower could now be turned out of factories. Just
       as the guns of the naval arms race had quickly increased in scope and power, the introduction of machine
       guns, long-range artillery guns, aircraft, and submarines revolutionized warfare in World War I.

       Artillery was one clear example of the way warfare had changed. In the 1800s, cannons were moved by horses.
       In World War I, however, some long-range artillery could be moved only by rail, and in some cases, railroads
       even had to be specially built due to the weight of the guns. Artillery became a key tool for fighting the war. The
       German arms manufacturer Krupp unveiled new artillery throughout the war, each time offering greater
       firepower, but its "Big Bertha," a 420-mm howitzer, was used extensively from the beginning of the war to its
       conclusion. In 1918, the Germans began using the so-called Paris Gun to shell the French capital. While its
       payload was not overly large, this piece of artillery could fire over a distance of eighty miles, propelling a
       missile into the stratosphere before it came back to earth. Most battlefield casualties in World War I were the
       result of artillery fire.

       The power of machine guns, first seen at the turn of the century in the Boer War, also completely changed the
       battlefield experience in total war. Many of the machine guns of World War I were based on a design unveiled
       by inventor Hiram Maxim in 1884. They could fire four to six hundred rounds per minute, utterly transforming
       what an infantry attack looked like. It was this mechanized weaponry that caused the horrific injuries and
       mass casualties suffered during the war. A soldier courageously running across a field against an enemy was
       now undertaking a suicide mission. Barbed wire also became a common sight, strewn across the no-man's-

land between the opposing sides' frontline trenches. It snagged and caught troops as they advanced, slowing
them down as they used wire cutters to break through and making them an easy target for machine gun nests
on the opposite side.
Poison gas, outlawed worldwide today, was employed as an instrument of war by all sides, first by German
troops fighting Russian units in 1914. Different types of gas were used. Chlorine gas with its greenish hue
appeared early in the war, thick and heavy mustard gas came later, and phosgene was used throughout the
combat. Mustard gas could burn the eyes, nose, and skin with injuries that took weeks to heal; for the unlucky,
it could cause permanent blindness and lifelong respiratory problems, and sometimes death. Phosgene gas
was colorless and could be more immediately deadly, through symptoms might not appear for many hours.
Historians estimate that 85 percent of deaths from gassing were due to the effects of phosgene.
By the midpoint of the war, gas masks had become a regular part of a soldier's kit. When a call of "Gas!" went
out, soldiers would quickly don them, though they were tight and severely narrowed the wearer's range of
vision. Soldiers came to fear gas attacks more than any other kind. The prospect of not being able to see your
enemy was unnerving, and the gas might not even be noticed until the first few soldiers collapsed from it.
Flamethrowers were employed by both sides as well but were first introduced by Germany, with substantial
use beginning in 1915. These were intended to spur enemy soldiers out of their trenches in a battle. The most
effective flamethrowers were mobile ones carried by individual soldiers. Their effect was also psychological,
much like that of poison gas.
In 1916, the British unveiled a new invention to support their infantry--the tank (Figure 11.12). Early tanks
showed promise in that they made large artillery mobile and could travel with advancing infantry, which could
help end trench warfare. However, they often malfunctioned and got stuck in the mud too easily. Commanders
at first did not fully understand what a boon to the infantry tanks could be, but in the ensuing years they
learned.

444 11 · The War to End All Wars

       On the sea, the submarine debuted in World War I and heralded a new age of naval combat. Its stealth was its
       biggest tactical advantage; it could sneak up on unsuspecting vessels and fire a torpedo that would sink them.
       The German navy called its subs Unterseeboots or U-boats and focused on expanding this part of its fleet
       during the war. U-boats were seldom submerged because the batteries on which they ran would not allow them
       to stay underwater for too long. In the early months of the war, German submarines warned ships before
       sinking them so that the crew could abandon ship, as was the custom in naval warfare. However, after German
       submarines were destroyed by armed British merchant ships when they made their presence known, they
       began to attack without firing any warning shot or allowing the crew on the targeted ship to abandon it. This
       was used by the Allies as evidence that Germany was a crueler foe than other nations. By 1917, German U-
       boats "had destroyed about thirty percent of the world's merchant ships."

       All combatant armies used aircraft for reconnaissance purposes, and pilots soon began engaging one another
       in aerial "dogfights." Skilled pilots who were able to shoot down enemy planes became known as "aces." They
       kept track of their kills and were heralded for their bravery. The sky was one of the few arenas where skill and
       courage could make a difference in a confrontation with the enemy.

       The use of all these weapons to wage war on an industrial scale meant soldiers suffered more in this war than
       in past conflicts. The number of casualties was immense. Approximately nine hundred French soldiers died
       every day on the western front. Even more German soldiers died each day. The need to care for the wounded
       was also enormous. Huge numbers of doctors, nurses, and stretcher-bearers were needed to get them safely
       from the battlefields and trenches to medical care. Medical science had improved significantly, leading to a
       much greater understanding of infection, and new technologies such as the x-ray made care far superior to
       what soldiers could expect in the 1800s. Soldiers could now survive their wounds, but they then faced a
       number of problems earlier generations had never experienced. Some needed plastic surgery to repair broken
       or blown-away bones or metal masks to hide them, and when repairs to arms or legs were not possible,
       amputation might leave a soldier facing the future with prosthetic limbs.

       Physical wounds were fairly straightforward for doctors and nurses to tackle. The psychological wounds were
       much more problematic. Never before had so many people been subjected to such intense bombardment as in
       the trenches and battles of World War I. Doctors began diagnosing cases of "shell shock" early in the war, a
       diagnosis not new but newly named because it was thought to have been brought on by the intense shelling
       that accompanied the war. However, medical science later learned that it was the intense psychological
       pressures on the soldiers rather than the shelling itself that caused the condition. Shell shock went by other
       names in later wars, such as battle fatigue and, today, post-traumatic stress disorder. Some symptoms were
       mild, like a shaking hand or constant twitch. Others were more serious, including flashbacks to battle, inability
       to speak, loss of contact with reality, or fear of any unexpected sound. Those dealing with shell shock often had
       to be sent to hospitals far from the frontlines, and recovery was exceedingly slow as psychologists tried to help
       them reenter peacetime society.

                                                                                                  IN THEIR OWN WORDS

        A Poet's View of War

         Siegfried Sassoon was an English poet who rose to the rank of captain while serving in World War I. In his poetry,
         he described the horrors of the battlefield and critiqued those he saw as responsible for the war. "Counter-
         Attack" describes the experience of combat for an ordinary soldier on the day of a counterattack. Allemands
         (literally, the Germans) refers to the opposing German forces.

        With bombers posted, Lewis guns well placed,
        And clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench.
        The place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legs
        High-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the saps
        And trunks, face downward, in the sucking mud,
        Wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled;
        And naked sodden buttocks, mats of hair,
        Bulged, clotted heads slept in the plastering slime.
        And then the rain began,--the jolly old rain!

        A yawning soldier knelt against the bank,
        Staring across the morning blear with fog;
        He wondered when the Allemands would get busy;
        And then, of course, they started with five-nines
        Traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud.
        Mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst
        Spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell,
        While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke.
        He crouched and flinched, dizzy with galloping fear,
        Sick for escape,--loathing the strangled horror
        And butchered, frantic gestures of the dead.

        An officer came blundering down the trench:
        "Stand-to and man the fire step!" On he went . . .
        Gasping and bawling, "Fire-step . . . counter-attack!"
        Then the haze lifted. Bombing on the right
        Down the old sap: machine-guns on the left;
        And stumbling figures looming out in front.
        "O Christ, they're coming at us!" Bullets spat,
        And he remembered his rifle . . . rapid fire . . .
        And started blazing wildly . . . then a bang
        Crumpled and spun him sideways, knocked him out
        To grunt and wriggle: none heeded him; he choked
        And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom,
        Lost in a blurred confusion of yells and groans . . .
        Down, and down, and down, he sank and drowned,
        Bleeding to death. The counter-attack had failed.

New military technology plus armies consisting of millions of troops meant battles were no longer quick. They
would rage for months and exact a devastating toll of human life. In February 1916, for example, the Battle of
Verdun began. The Germans intended this battle to take out as many French troops as possible, to make
"France bleed," as German General Erich von Falkenhayn stated. They chose Verdun because it had great
historical and cultural significance to the French nation, and France would do anything to protect it. Only one
long road ran into the city, and the French were forced to bring hundreds of thousands of troops and supplies
along it. The battle raged from February to December. France managed to stave off the German attacks but
446 11 · The War to End All Wars

       suffered approximately 450,000 casualties, and Germany about 300,000.

       The British and the Germans had their own battle of attrition along the Somme River. Starting on July 1, 1916,
       the Battle of the Somme began with British infantry charges that caused tens of thousands of deaths on the
       first day alone. Britain continued to launch offensives as the Germans rebuilt their line slightly farther back.
       British commanders finally called an end to the battle in November, unable to break the German line and
       having advanced only a handful of miles. By the time it ended, total casualties from both sides totaled a
       million.

       As the land war droned on, the power of the submarine was being starkly demonstrated on the high seas. In
       May 1915, the RMS Lusitania, a passenger liner owned by Cunard, was sailing from New York City to Liverpool.
       Unbeknownst to the passengers, the British owners of the ship had chosen to transport four million rounds of
       ammunition in the cargo hold during the return voyage to Britain. The German government learned of this
       plan and had previously announced that any ship carrying military weapons or equipment was subject to
       being sunk. This threat put the Lusitania in the cross-hairs of the German submarines. Off the coast of Ireland
       on May 7, a German sub torpedoed the liner, which sank in about twenty minutes. More than twelve hundred
       people died in the chilly waters, including 128 U.S. citizens.

       The outcry was immediate. Early news reports focused on the fact that civilians and families had been on
       board an unarmed passenger ship, again casting Germany as a violator of the norms of warfare. In the United
       States, however, the public frustration did not result in a push for war with Germany. While aware of what the
       war was like via the uncensored news stories in the American media, most still felt it was better not to get
       involved.

       Their focus on a naval arms race before the war did not result in many battles between the surface fleets of
       Britain and Germany. In fact, there was only one major naval engagement, the Battle of Jutland, fought in 1916
       by about 250 ships. Both sides sank or damaged many enemy craft, and both claimed a win, though no
       decisive victory was gained by either. The German navy, however, never again dared to confront the British
       navy.

       It was truly with submarines that naval warfare was fought in World War I. Through 1915 and 1916, German
       submarines continued to patrol the war zones off the coasts of Britain and France, sinking an increasing
       number of vessels. In 1916, German submarines torpedoed the Sussex, a civilian ferry, and several U.S.
       citizens were killed. This provoked outrage in the United States, and President Wilson demanded apologies
       and restitution. Germany responded by apologizing and agreeing to only engage in restricted submarine
       warfare. That is, German submarines would not target U.S. ships and would endeavor not to fire on ships that
       had U.S. citizens on board. Implementing such restrictions was impossible, however. Theoretically, Germany
       would have to have had all U.S. citizens leave a ship before torpedoing it.

       The compromise did allow the United States to remain neutral even as tensions mounted. But in 1917, the
       terms changed. Germany announced in January of that year that it would engage in unrestricted submarine
       warfare. This meant that any ship in a war zone was a target for sinking even if it were sailing under the flag of
       a neutral power, so U.S. merchant ships were now subject to being torpedoed.

       Germany made this decision because it felt that Britain would be forced to pull out of the war if the lifeline of
       cargo coming to it from the United States were cut off. Germany had suffered food shortages beginning in
       1915. By 1917, as a result of the British blockade and the enlistment of male farm laborers for war, the nation's
       urban population was starving, and its troops were on reduced rations. Unless Britain withdrew from the war
       soon, Germany would be forced to surrender. Obviously, Germany knew this decision would anger the United
       States and could well cause it to enter the war itself, but it was a gamble its leaders were prepared to take. They
       fully believed that Germany could achieve victory if it could force the British to surrender before the United
       States could enter the war.

The United States Enters the War

Further exacerbating tensions between Germany and the United States was the publication on March 1, 1917,
of the Zimmermann Telegram. This message had been sent to Mexico by Germany's foreign minister, Arthur
Zimmermann, offering a deal. In 1916, there had been numerous disturbances along the border between the
United States and Mexico due to the exploits of Francisco "Pancho" Villa as he attacked U.S. towns. The U.S.
Army had responded by sending thousands of troops to track Villa down. Germany wanted the Mexican
government, in the event of war with the United States, to actively cause more disturbances along the border,
keeping even more U.S. troops there and thus unavailable for deployment to Europe. In return for Mexico's
cooperation, upon its victory, Germany would grant it the region of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, territory it
had lost in 1848 as a result of war with the United States.

In reality, it was unlikely that the Mexican government would have been able to participate in such a plan even
if it had wanted to. In 1917, Mexico was embroiled in violent conflict among numerous revolutionary factions,
of which Villa's forces were one. The trouble had begun in 1910 when the liberal politician Francisco Madero
had announced his candidacy for the Mexican presidency, an office that had been held continuously since
1884 by the dictatorial Porfirio Díaz, whose regime had favored wealthy landowners and business owners. Díaz
handily won the rigged election and had Madero arrested, an action that led to uprisings throughout the
country. In 1911, Díaz was forced to resign and went into exile.

However, when Madero, who had been declared president, failed to deliver on expected reforms, revolt broke
out against his administration as well, and in 1913 he was forced to relinquish his office. He was replaced by
Victoriano Huerta, a general who commanded rebellious forces within the Mexican army, and he was executed
soon thereafter. Huerta, however, attempted to rule in a dictatorial fashion, and opposition quickly arose. In
the south, Emiliano Zapata led a rebellion among Indigenous peasants who hoped to force a program of land
reform. In the north, the revolution was led by Venustiano Carranza, Alvaro Obregon, and Pancho Villa. U.S.
president Woodrow Wilson supported Carranza and supplied his forces with munitions. Wilson also used the
occasion to order U.S. marines to invade Mexico to prevent damage to U.S.-owned property. In April 1914, the
U.S. Navy took control of the Mexican port of Veracruz.

Throughout the summer of 1914, the various rebel factions did battle with one another as each leader sought
to replace Huerta, who fled into exile in July. Carranza declared himself president over the objections of Villa
and Zapata. In retaliation for U.S. support of Carranza, Villa attacked the town of Columbus, New Mexico, in
March 1916, prompting Wilson to dispatch five thousand troops across the border to capture him. Villa evaded
them, and within a year they had retreated. The U.S. invasion damaged U.S. relations with Carranza, however,
who refused to countenance the insult to Mexican sovereignty. By 1917, he was firmly in power, but rebellion
continued, led by Villa in the northern state of Chihuahua and by Zapata in Morelos in the south.

Thus, when Germany approached Carranza with its offer of an alliance against the United States, Carranza was
not in a position to accept even if he had wanted to. Nevertheless, when this offer was made public, the United
States was livid. It was not yet a combatant, and Germany was already planning how to dismember it. U.S.
banks, which realized the loans they had extended to the European Allies would go unpaid if Germany won,
already supported their country's involvement, as did businesses that hoped U.S. assistance would encourage
the Allies to grant them greater access to global markets. Now popular support for going to war against
Germany swelled. In April 1917, the United States, already angered by the sinking of the Lusitania and the
Sussex, entered the conflict on the side of the Allied powers.

Life in the Trenches, the Mountains, and the Desert

The trenches of the western front, born of the stalemate in which the Allies and Central powers found
themselves in the fall of 1914, became synonymous with the war. The horror of unrelenting artillery fire
coupled with unending mud made this arena of fighting unique. Troops literally dug in for protection from
enemy artillery barrages and then found themselves stranded in these locations. From the beginning, the
448 11 · The War to End All Wars

       German troops dug deeper and more elaborate trenches, as if planning to stay for a long time. The early Allied
       trenches were more rudimentary but became more highly developed over the years.

       At its height, the trench system traversed nearly five hundred miles. At the front were soldiers who generally
       stayed in position for several days before being moved back to the second-line support trenches and the third-
       line reserve trenches. Farther back was the long-range artillery. Behind the trench system lay field hospitals
       and villages across the French and Belgian countryside.

       Soldiers found life in the trenches tedious. There was little to do but always the prospect of death just above the
       parapet. It rained regularly, and the trenches became filled with mud. Soldiers put down wooden planks to
       help, but it was hard to avoid some measure of hypothermia. Constant moisture on feet and legs caused trench
       foot when the skin could not dry and began to split and come off. It was intensely painful but hard to avoid.
       Trenches also became strewn with debris and trash, and disease easily spread in these close quarters.

       The proximity of the two armies could lead to rare exchanges, however. In one example, at Christmas the first
       year of the war in 1914, German and British soldiers faced one another from their respective trenches, and
       some began calling out across the no-man's land between them. First one side and then the other sang
       Christmas carols. Finally, soldiers from both sides cautiously began climbing out of their trenches and ended
       up meeting in the no-man's land between them, where they exchanged cigarettes, candy, and souvenirs. Many
       soldiers reported similar experiences. The Christmas truce displays the humanity that could still be seen in
       the war, but it also angered those at headquarters. Such camaraderie was not allowed to occur again.

       British and German soldiers in the trenches on the western front in 1914, presented by the Imperial War
       Museums.

       In other combat regions, the armies were more mobile, but the fighting came with its own set of problems. For
       example, battles between Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces ranged over the Italian Alps, forcing soldiers to
       fight at high altitude with few opportunities to resupply. Besides the need to live in caves or scale mountain
       heights, troops also faced regular snowfall and subfreezing temperatures. The threat from frostbite and
       avalanches was real, and the poor conditions accounted for more than half the casualties suffered during this
       mountainous fighting. The narrow passes of the Alps also offered little chance to retreat.

       Fighting in the Caucasus between the Russians and the Ottomans began in 1914. The front was isolated, and
       the Ottomans did not have the rail lines to supply operations far from the front. The snow was many feet deep,
       and temperatures plunged below zero as the troops fought. The Ottoman troops were unable to continue given
       their lack of supplies, and they suffered tens of thousands of casualties. In arid climates around the
       Mediterranean and the Middle East, armies had to ensure adequate water supplies in the desert. It was difficult
       to find enough feed for horses, so particularly in the Middle East, troops became more reliant on camels as a
       means of carrying supplies and even people.

      Colonies, Race, and the War

       As the imperial powers went to war with one another, so too did their colonies in multiple ways. In some cases,
       colonial troops came to Europe to fight, such as those the French brought from Senegal or the British brought
       from India. In other cases, such as in Africa, fighting took place in the colonies themselves.

       France had extensive colonial holdings throughout Africa and enlisted more than 600,000 soldiers there, most
       of them from the continent's west and north. France also employed troops from French Indochina (modern-
       day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). More than ninety thousand people from French Indochina were brought to
       Europe, about half of them as laborers for the French armies. Britain made great use of roughly 1.3 million
       soldiers from India (Figure 11.13). Many were brought to Europe where they fought in the trenches of France

and Belgium. Others went to the other theaters of the war--Mesopotamia, Africa, and the Mediterranean. More
than three million Africans participated in the war, either as soldiers or in a support capacity. While many
fought in Europe, many others fought in French, British, and German colonies in Africa.

Germany's colonial forces in Africa were mainly located in East Africa. Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck
commanded thousands of German troops, along with thousands of African porters who carried all the
supplies. The plight of African porters underscores the effect racism had on the way the war was fought and
who was considered expendable. Porters were given strict rations, in some locations only one thousand
calories a day, and forced to march many miles while carrying sixty-pound loads. The death rate among
porters was 20 percent over the course of the war, higher than the death rate for British soldiers.
In addition to colonial troops, the troops of British dominions fought in the war as well. From the very
beginning of the conflict, soldiers were organized from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and sent to the
Mediterranean and European theaters. Some of the battles in which they fought became key episodes in their
growing national histories.
For example, the ANZAC forces representing Australia and New Zealand saw heavy action in the
Mediterranean in 1915. The idea behind the British plan was to launch a ship-based artillery attack at the
Dardanelles and then land troops on a peninsula called Gallipoli. This would allow the British to link up with
Russian forces and coordinate a push against the Turks to isolate the Ottoman Empire and seize control of the
important Turkish straits leading to the Sea of Marmara (Figure 11.14). The brainchild of Winston Churchill,
then First Lord of the Admiralty, the operation suffered problems from its start in February. The first ships
took heavy fire and were crippled by mines. The Turks were prepared for a ground invasion and began firing
on the Allied troops from secure positions. Those who made it ashore were unable to do more than establish
beachheads and did not drive far into the interior. The situation continued through all of 1915 before the
British decided to evacuate their troops. Casualties from both sides totaled approximately 900,000, losses
commemorated in Australia and New Zealand each year on ANZAC Day, April 25. Churchill resigned over the
450 11 · The War to End All Wars

       debacle.

       For Canadian forces, the fighting in 1917 at Vimy Ridge, south of Calais, became the key battle to memorialize
       as a nation. It was fought for a week in April, with Canadian forces charging the German line to take the ridge.
       More than 3,500 Canadian soldiers were killed and approximately 7,000 were wounded. Canada's victory
       became a national rallying point and source of pride.
       Prejudice and discrimination were widely evident within the major powers in the war. For example, the
       interplay between colonial and regular troops and policy decisions about who would be drafted were all
       reflected in the diversity of the armies engaged in the war. The multitude of nationalities that fought in this war
       meant that people were regularly engaging with allies from different backgrounds and ethnicities. The
       prospect of tension in these relationships was clear.
       In the United States, the military was still officially segregated. All-Black units had been formed as early as the
       Civil War, but the military did not integrate any of its branches until after World War II. When the country
       entered World War I, African American men volunteered in substantial numbers, though the government soon
       set ceilings on the number it was willing to accept. Once the draft was enacted, southern draft boards were
       quick to select a disproportionately high number of African Americans in an effort to protect local White men
       from combat. While most African American soldiers from the United States worked in labor units in Europe,
       some did see combat, such as the infantry unit dubbed the Harlem Hellfighters.

The situation developing in the far reaches of the Ottoman Empire also reflected both diversity and prejudice.
Turks dominated in Istanbul, the capital, and in the Anatolian Peninsula. However, large areas of the empire
were inhabited by Muslims of other ethnicities, primarily Arabs. During the war, some of these Arab Muslim
populations, led by the sharif (ruler) of Mecca, began to fight against the Ottoman overlords in the Arab Revolt
of 1916. The British government seized this opportunity to further drive a wedge in the operations of the
Ottoman Empire by offering support to the rebels and promising them an independent Arab state free of
Turkish control. One British officer, T.E. Lawrence, began working with Faisal ibn Hussein, a son of the sharif.
The Arab Revolt was successful in targeting railways and causing problems for the Ottoman forces, but it did
not achieve the goal of independence for Arabia. However, when the war ended with the Ottoman Empire
defeated and soon dissolved, Arabia was able to separate itself from Ottoman control.

European powers approached Arabia and the Middle East with the same colonial conventions under which
they had operated in the nineteenth century. They believed that even after the war they would be the ones
deciding the fate of these lands. In 1916, the Sykes-Picot Agreement, a covert deal made between Britain and
France with the approval of Italy and Russia, divided the areas of the Middle East under two spheres of
influence, with what are today Lebanon, Syria, and northern Iraq going to France and the areas of Jordan,
Kuwait, and southern Iraq going to Britain. Britain, France, and Russia were to share control of Palestine
(Figure 11.15). Britain and France understood that the world's growing reliance on oil would make this region a
major player in the future. The Sykes-Picot Agreement also supported the creation of an independent Arab
state, but this did not come to pass.

       The Sykes-Picot Agreement was kept secret at the time, and promises that contradicted it were explicitly made
       to some of those involved in the Arab Revolt, such as the British promise of Syria to Faisal ibn Hussein. News of
       the agreement leaked out by 1918, angering many throughout the region. The Balfour Declaration that soon
       followed also contributed to frustrations in Palestine by making it clear that Britain supported a Jewish
       homeland in Palestine.
       For its part, Germany sought to appeal to Muslim troops, in part by making sure its Muslim prisoners of war
       were properly treated and pledging them its support for Islam. The Germans even built a mosque so their
       prisoners could properly pray. The aim was to persuade them to fight against the Allied powers instead of
       Germany. The Turkish sultan (a German ally) endorsed this view, calling for all Muslims to fight against their
       oppressors, the Allies. Few prisoners of war heeded the call, however.
       One of the more violent examples of prejudice during this period affected the Armenian population of the
       Ottoman Empire. Armenians were a Christian minority and resided in both Ottoman lands and Russia. Due to
       their background, religion, and location, they were seen as potential collaborators with the Russians, who were
       also Christians. Believing that local Armenians had been working against the Ottoman army, in 1915 Ottoman
       troops began murdering them. The Armenians defended themselves, and the Ottoman government ordered

their removal from the region, granting its officials permission to repress resistance. Over the next few
months, approximately one million Armenians died from forced marches or were executed by the Ottoman
government. The Ottomans did not acknowledge this genocide at the time, and to this day, the Turkish
government does not admit it occurred.

                                                                           THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT

 The Armenian Genocide

  The Armenian people continue to memorialize the genocide that occurred in 1915. They also fear similar actions
  today. The following account is by Jen Langley, a descendant of one of the survivors of 1915 who lives in the
  United States.

        My great-uncle also came from Van and in 1915 saw his entire family murdered. I grew up with him and
        his stories. I knew that he had to sleep next to a wall--a way to keep him in his bed as he relived the
        events of 1915 in his dreams, even as an 85-year-old man.

        We did not talk about recognition when I was growing up. Instead, I just experienced the culture that
        survived--I ate the food, sang the songs, and heard the stories of the "old country." As a child, I did not
        understand yet that the sharing of survivor's stories in my family was heavy with the need for
        acknowledgment. [. . .]

        Every Armenian in America has experienced meeting someone who doesn't even know that Armenia is
        actually a country, never mind that an unrecognized genocide was committed against their people in
        1915. Along with those who are simply unaware, there is the denial that continues to this day. For all of
        the beauty and richness of my Armenian culture that survived, I've come to learn that it's profoundly
        difficult to heal as a people and as individuals in the absence of recognition.

        In 1996, eminent genocide scholar Gregory Stanton defined the eight states of genocide. And though
        "extermination" is one of the stages in his framework, it is not the final stage as one might expect. On
        the contrary, the final stage in Stanton's framework is denial. This illustrates so well that without
        recognition of the incalculable violence and losses faced by Armenians, the physical process of
        extermination begun in 1915 continues in nonphysical forms.

        Being told again and again that our losses have not been profound and that the violence done to us is
        not worthy of the label "genocide" denies our humanity as a people and pushes our chance for
        collective healing onto an ever-receding horizon.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain how the combatant nations were transformed by the need to fight World War I
  · Analyze the role played by women in World War I
  · Describe life on the home front during World War I
  · Discuss the events that led to the Irish Rising in 1916

The conflict of World War I mobilized not just soldiers but entire societies as civilians rose to meet the
production levels needed to support the war effort. Home fronts were transformed as women took up new
454 11 · The War to End All Wars

       roles to replace men who had left for the war zone, families coped with shortages of food and consumer
       products, and civilian protests became more critical of the war and the national governments. Those
       governments often stepped in to set priorities and quotas for civilian entities like private manufacturers and
       even voluntary nursing associations in their efforts to prepare for and carry out their war aims. Some of these
       efforts were more successful than others. Meanwhile, Britain faced an additional challenge when tensions with
       Ireland reached a crisis point in 1916.

      Nations Remade for War

       The length and all-encompassing nature of the war forced each combatant's home front to adapt. In the Allied
       countries of Britain and France, volunteer enthusiasm and conscription meant that many skilled laborers were
       now serving in the military, leaving manufacturing and production in need of new workers whose training
       took time. For other countries, such as Germany, the shortage of raw materials due to the Allied blockade
       forced a search for new sources.

       Issues of production now also became political issues. In 1915, British commanders alleged that part of the
       reason they had been turned back during an attack was that they did not have enough artillery shells. This
       "shell crisis" raised the question of who was at fault in an industrialized government-directed economy. Was
       the government to be blamed for not making sure enough shells were produced? Were the workers not
       working hard enough at producing shells? The British government ended up blaming the army, claiming the
       military had not ordered enough shells. As a result, shell output from British munitions factories (and, in fact,
       from all combatants' munitions factories) increased throughout that year.

       The British government found itself under immense pressure during the war. The Liberal Party was in control,
       but historically it had been anti-war, so the coming of World War I threw the party into disarray. The shell crisis
       and the failures at Gallipoli made the government appear weak. Continued maneuvering against the prime
       minister by David Lloyd George, minister of munitions and a fellow Liberal, solidified divisions within the
       party that came to a head by the end of the war.

       Once the United States entered the war, its government moved to control industrial output in a way it had
       never done before, with the creation of the War Industries Board (WIB). Run by financier Barnard Baruch, the
       WIB was charged with controlling prices and organizing production to support the war. However, because it
       had never embraced central planning or centralized economic control, the U.S. government did not have the
       command of war production that a country like Great Britain did. In the end, the WIB made some progress, but
       it never was in a position to dictate to industry and was immediately shut down at the end of the war. Its
       creation did foreshadow some of the examples of government control that became necessary in World War II,
       however.

       Many national governments coped unsuccessfully with financing the war. Generally, less than a third of the
       cost was paid through taxation. Instead, borrowing by selling war bonds to the public, printing more money,
       and taking on more debt became the main method of paying for the war. Price inflation hit new highs as the
       combination of debt, the printing of money, and product shortages squeezed civilian budgets.

       As the British army found itself in need of more troops, it began active recruitment campaigns. One popular
       tactic tried in the first half of the war was the development of "pals" units. Young men would sign up together
       and be guaranteed assignment to the same unit, a unit of their pals. While certainly an enticement to serve,
       this method of organizing units also meant that neighborhoods and villages might see nearly all their young
       men wounded or killed in the same engagement. The practice was discontinued after the high-casualty
       Somme campaign in 1916.

       For Russia, the war highlighted how far the country still needed to go in industrializing its economy. Railroads
       were not sufficient to move troops to the locations needed while also getting foodstuffs to the cities to feed
       factory workers. Arms manufacturers could not keep up with the numbers of guns and bullets necessary to
       supply the soldiers. The lack of equipment had serious consequences for the morale of the troops, who did not

feel supported by their government and began to question its decision-making.

Women's Work

As the war progressed and more men set off to fight, women in many countries found job opportunities in
traditionally male-oriented fields, most notably the defense industries and munitions plants. In Britain,
women made up a significant percentage of war workers (Figure 11.16). They were sometimes called
"canaries" because of the yellow hue cast on their skin and clothes from the TNT they worked with daily.
Women in France were also disproportionately engaged in the manufacture of arms and armaments. In
Germany, this pattern continued. While some women had worked in factories before the war, the need for
more labor drew those who had worked in domestic service and other capacities, and they often earned more
in the factories than in their old jobs.

     LINK TO LEARNING

To read a first-hand description of the work British female war workers undertook and the way munitions are
made, read an excerpt from the diary of G.M. West, a Voluntary Aid Detachment cook at a munitions factory
(https://openstax.org/l/77MunitionsDiary) in 1916. (There are images from some pages of her diary and a link
to a typed transcript.)
Women also did significant work in the medical field during the war. Few were doctors; most served as nurses.
Among them were both professional nurses (women who had been nurses before the war) and volunteer
nurses who came from both the elite and middle classes. Volunteer nurses from the United States even began
to flow into French hospitals in 1915. The Red Cross organized both nursing and hospital building across
France and Belgium as the war progressed. Women also served as ambulance drivers and worked in x-ray
units, especially mobile ones. French scientist Marie Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, worked with and
456 11 · The War to End All Wars

       trained others for x-ray units.

       Black women who wished to serve found their opportunities limited, just as they were in peacetime. In the
       United States, the absence of male workers meant that in restricted cases, African American women were
       hired for factory and office work. Overseas, African American women served with the Young Women's
       Christian Association (YWCA) to aid U.S. soldiers, but they numbered fewer than twenty-five. Only two African
       American women served as social workers with the YWCA during the war in France. Black women in Britain
       were similarly constrained, though a few were nurses and munitions workers.

       The sense of independence and the novelty of making their own money spurred many women involved in the
       war effort to see political reform and voting rights as the next step. For example, many women in Britain
       viewed the extension of voting rights as a way to reward them for their war work. Suffragists had been
       protesting for years about the need to include women among the voting population in numerous countries
       such as Britain, Germany, and the United States. In 1918, Britain extended the right to vote to property-owning
       women over thirty. Germany gave women the vote in 1918, the first country to grant universal adult female
       suffrage, as did the United States in 1920.

       Another way those on the home front felt the war's effects was through deprivation and doing without.
       Shortages and later rationing came about in some countries, targeting a number of different resources but
       most often food. The idea was that the government would control the allotment of certain food items such as
       meat and sugar so they would be more equitably distributed among the population. Britain started rationing in
       1918. The United States did not mandate food rationing but encouraged people to adopt it voluntarily.

       Britain was particularly vulnerable to shortages because it imported approximately 60 percent of its food.
       Ensuring there was enough to feed the soldiers and the civilian populace was the job of the Women's Land
       Army. In this wartime program, nearly 100,000 British women volunteered to move to rural counties and keep
       farms running after farmers had volunteered or been conscripted into the war. The British government also
       assisted with moneys for new tractors on many farms whose horses had been requisitioned by the army.

       All these changes meant that after the war, women had different expectations for the future and no longer felt
       as constrained by traditional mores. Even fashion had altered considerably during the war to accommodate
       the new kinds of work that women did. Long restrictive skirts were no more, and skirts were several inches
       shorter than in the early 1900s. Many European women also found themselves remaining single. The millions
       of men lost in the war left many unable to find a mate.

       This episode of the podcast Dressed: The History of Fashion (https://openstax.org/l/77Dressed) focuses on
       changes in French fashions during World War I and how keeping the fashion industry healthy during the war
       was important for the French economy as a whole.

      The Civilian Response

       While many civilians fully supported the war effort, others voiced opposition to and criticism of the war itself
       and the reasons behind it. This disapproval became stronger as the war and the shortages went on and morale
       on the home front suffered.

       In Germany, for instance, soldiers were prioritized in the food supply chain, so while they might not enjoy the
       food they were given, there was usually enough of it even if many civilians found it very difficult to find food.
       This was especially true for the elderly and those who were not contributing to the war effort through their
       work. The British blockade of Germany, which ran from 1914 until the end of the war, only compounded the
       problem. Bread rationing began in Germany in 1915. The winter of 1916-1917 was particularly severe, and
       much of the potato crop was lost, leaving many tens of thousands of people with nothing but turnips to eat.
       Food shortages also prompted food riots from 1915 on in Germany.

Food shortages also occurred in Austria-Hungary, which did not have as intricate an infrastructure as
Germany and therefore had fewer options for transporting food. It too was focused on making sure soldiers
were supplied at the expense of the civilian population. As in many combatant countries, the disruptions to
their food supply caused some civilians to begin questioning the government's job in fighting the war and
generally hurt morale at home.

Civilian discontent also rose as more young men were needed for the armies. The war dragged on, and the
early enthusiasm evidenced by young recruits in 1914 disappeared. Some recruits did not have confidence
that the national armies would be able to win battles or that it was worth risking their lives in service. Other
young men were conscientious objectors who for religious and philosophical reasons did not believe in
fighting wars and therefore did not wish to serve. Some would-be soldiers in the empires increasingly
questioned the value of fighting for imperial glory. Canada experienced a conscription crisis in 1917 when it
had to resort to a draft to fulfill Britain's imperial demand for troops. The military was called to quell a protest
in Quebec City and fired on the protesters, killing several.

The use of censorship became a common tool to manage civilian discontent by limiting the information
distributed about the war effort. Newspapers presented only vague descriptions of battles and losses, and
government-sponsored propaganda showed civilians pro-war posters and commentary. Censorship efforts
began in all combatant nations in 1914 and expanded to the United States when it entered in the war in 1917.
The U.S. government created the Committee on Public Information to put out pro-war propaganda via public
speeches and posters that were remarkably effective. Most posters depicted the German troops as bloodthirsty
monsters who would cross the Atlantic to attack the United States if they were not stopped.

                                                                                                BEYOND THE BOOK

 Propaganda Posters

  Propaganda came into wide use in all the combatant nations during World War I. Here are two posters from the
  United States that showcase the all-encompassing nature of these propaganda campaigns.

  The following lithographed poster was part of the United War Work Campaign conducted in association with the
  Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) (Figure 11.17). Note how it shows a variety of attire for women,
  conveying that women could fill many different roles to support the war. Its title also encourages women to
  realize that female workers, "our second line of defense," were needed in the same numbers as male soldiers for
  the war effort.

The U.S. government's effort to squash criticism of the war began in 1917 with the Espionage Act. It set limits
on what could be mailed, banning any type of anti-war newspaper or pamphlet. In 1918, Congress passed the
Sedition Act. This forbade "disloyal, profane, scurrilous, and abusive" language about the decision to enter the
war, the draft, the flag, and armed forces' uniforms. It was not about what might be true, but about what could
be seen as disloyal. Anti-war speech was considered disloyal and therefore seditious. People were unable to
openly question why the United States was in the war or speak out against it without risking imprisonment or
hefty fines. Today we see the Sedition Act as a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which
promises protections for free speech. Despite this, the Supreme Court upheld the act, and approximately two
thousand people were prosecuted under it. Perhaps the best-known prosecution targeted the Socialist Party's
presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs. Debs was sentenced to ten years (and served more than three) for
comments he made against the war, such as questioning why working-class men had to lose their lives in a war
they had no voice in declaring.

While Debs was imprisoned, others such as Russian immigrants and those who supported socialist causes
were viewed as disloyal and targeted for deportation by the U.S. government. Emma Goldman, a self-avowed
anarchist, had come to the United States from Lithuania as a teenager. She had grown interested in radical
politics and by the time of the war was speaking out against the draft. Along with more than two hundred
others, she was deported to Russia in 1919 under wartime legislation in the United States.

Questioning the war could certainly take other forms than direct political speech. The poets Wilfred Owen,
Siegfried Sassoon, Rupert Brooke, and William Butler Yeats published work that put the inhumanity and
suffering of the war on full display. No heroic charges were celebrated in their stanzas. Visual art such as the
work of German artist Käthe Kollwitz conveyed the misery of the war. Kollwitz lost her son in the fighting and
explored the experience of mourning and suffering in her works. These personal depictions of the horror of the
war came clearly across to their audiences and helped fuel criticism of the war.

Due to the use of aircraft in the war, civilians in Europe also had the experience of being displaced from their
own cities. The German military utilized zeppelins as early as 1915 to fly to London and bomb the city. Later in
the war, they used Gotha bombers to attack the British capital. Hundreds of civilians were killed and thousands
injured through this bombing campaign. Those who survived the destruction of their homes became refugees
in their own country. The psychological impact of this bombing was immense. For the first time, civilians were
at risk in a country where no ground fighting was happening. The role of sheer chance in determining whether
a street was hit by a bomb made the danger seem much greater than it was.

Refugees emerged all over Europe. By the end of 1914, more than three million people in France and Belgium
alone had left their homes. While many were eventually able to return, the problem of housing millions of
displaced people continued throughout the war. On the eastern front, Jewish citizens fled their homes by the
tens of thousands, and many found themselves further east in Russia than had previously been allowed due to
anti-Semitic laws. Refugees often fled with very little, which made their relocations especially painful.

      The Easter Rising

       Tensions between Ireland and Britain can be traced to the twelfth century when the English seized Ireland.
       The political issue of home rule for Ireland was the most contentious one between the two in the early
       twentieth century. If approved, home rule would offer Ireland its own parliament and rights to deal with
       domestic issues rather than having to listen to the dictates of London. Support for it had grown significantly,
       and it had even been partially approved at the time of the war. But Protestant Unionists in the north of Ireland,
       who approved of the union with Britain and feared a Catholic-dominated Irish government, worried they would
       be discriminated against if home rule were enacted. The question was tabled while the British government
       focused on the war effort.

       Irish nationalists were frustrated by the delay, however, and some wanted even more change, not simply home
       rule but an independent Ireland. The cause of Irish nationalism drove Ireland to begin talks with Germany,
       since the two shared the common enemy of Britain, and the Irish Republican Brotherhood organized an
       uprising to be supported by German weapons. When the weapons failed to arrive, the Brotherhood decided to
       continue with the rebellion anyway. The Easter Rising began on April 24, 1916, and lasted for several days.
       Irish nationalists announced the establishment of the Irish Republic and seized key buildings in Dublin. The
       British responded with military force, and the clashes between the two groups resulted in thousands of
       casualties, including many civilians. As the Irish revolutionaries surrendered, unable to withstand the trained
       military troops, they found themselves subject to harsh punishment, and many of the rebellion's leaders were
       executed.

       The British response further drove the radicalism of many Irish youth. After the war, the counties of the south
       organized to form the Irish Free State, which today has become the Republic of Ireland. The northern counties
       are still part of the United Kingdom.

     11.5 The War Ends

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:
         · Describe tsarist autocracy and the challenges to it in pre-World War I Russia
         · Analyze how and why the Bolshevik Revolution began and its effect on Russian participation in
             World War I
         · Explain why World War I came to an end in November 1918

       World War I spelled the end of an era. The growth of socialist ideology and of the Bolshevik Party turned
       Russians' thoughts away from the war and toward revolution, ending both tsarist rule and Russia's
       involvement in the war long before the armistice of November 1918. German success early in 1918 was halted
       by the size of the armies it faced later that year. With the world fighting not only a war but a deadly influenza
       virus, the last year of conflict saw even more death and set the stage for a rebuilt world to emerge in the
       aftermath.

      The 1905 Revolution

       Long-standing problems in Russia such as a stagnant bureaucracy became exacerbated by the war. The
       Romanov tsars, in control since the 1600s, saw themselves as absolute rulers who governed without being
       questioned, but more liberal ideologies emerging in Europe in the 1700s and 1800s reached parts of Russian
       society, inspiring a desire for reform and reducing public tolerance for those in power. Socialist and Marxist
       ideologies, in particular, took hold among many young Russians, who felt the time had come to overthrow the
       tsarist state. In the early 1900s, a political faction known as the Bolsheviks appeared that followed these
       ideologies. Its members believed that violent revolution was necessary to oust the tsar and that the revolution
       needed a strong leader who could control the working class. Their push for reform and its accompanying
       violence eventually caused Russia to withdraw from the war.

On January 5, 1905, many workers gathered to protest peacefully outside Tsar Nicholas II's Winter Palace in St.
Petersburg. They were led by a local cleric and appealed to the tsar (who was not in residence) for
improvements to their working conditions, as well as a government that would share power with a popularly
elected assembly. They made this direct appeal because they saw the tsar as their "Little Father," someone who
would care for his people. Instead, military troops fired on the crowd. Around one thousand people were killed
in the melee as blood spilled all over the snow, and the day came to be called "Bloody Sunday."

The backlash against the tsar was brutal. Workers in numerous cities went on strike to protest the bloodshed
as part of the Revolution of 1905. Many strikes turned violent as more troops were ordered to put them down.
With no end in sight, Nicholas II was forced to concede that he would no longer rule autocratically, and that a
national legislature would meet to create a new voice in the government. The legislature was called the Duma
and first met in 1906. It was composed of middle-class men and peasants, but it had two houses. One was
indirectly chosen by an electoral college whose members were selected by men over age twenty-five. The other
house had members appointed by the tsar. This second house dominated the Duma, limiting the legislature's
ability to function as a true representative assembly. While it was a step forward in line with some
revolutionary aims, it did not signal a true sharing of power by the tsar.

Peace, Land, and Bread

Russia had significant difficulty achieving victories in World War I. Its armies were massive but also suffered
enormous casualties, and millions were killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, sometimes thanks to incompetent
commanders and lack of supplies. Morale was low, and soldiers were aware that food shortages had caused
long lines and even riots in the cities and towns they had left behind. Shortages of guns and other munitions
further compromised the effectiveness of the military. The tsarist government did not seem up to the challenge
of fighting the war.

Also undermining popular support for the monarchy was Tsarina Alexandra's steady reliance on the advice of
the monk Rasputin, who appeared able to relieve the suffering of her young son Alexei, who had hemophilia
and was heir to the throne. The favor shown to Rasputin, along with rumors of his romantic exploits, made for
many questions about his true relationship with Alexandra, who was German and whom the Russian people
had never really liked. After the tsar went to the front to direct the fighting in the autumn of 1915, Russia's
losses could be attributed to him, and leaving Alexandra (and her adviser Rasputin) in charge of the country
when the tsar was away was an unpopular decision that helped bring about the break between the Russian
people and their "Little Father."

The end of the tsarist government began with the February Revolution in 1917. In March (February under the
Julian calendar used in Russia), close to 100,000 people went on strike in the capital of Petrograd (meaning
"Peter's City" in Russian and replacing the German name St. Petersburg after war with Germany began in
1914). The strike spread over the next several days as more workers took to the streets (Figure 11.19). The
government tried to repress these protests and called out soldiers to disperse the crowds. While some soldiers
fired on the workers, killing them, as the days passed, the soldiers' sympathy with the workers grew, and they
refused to fire. Their defection marked a turning point in the city.

       Petrograd in 1917. (credit: "Soldiers demonstration. February 1917" by socialist.memo.ru/Wikimedia Commons,
       Public Domain)
       The soldiers formed the Petrograd Soviet (a council representing workers, soldiers, and peasants) to establish
       power in the city. A group of moderate politicians then established a new government for Russia under the
       auspices of the Duma. This provisional government was led by Alexander Kerensky, a lawyer who had become
       popular for assisting revolutionaries in the past. Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate, paving the way for the
       end of three hundred years of Romanov rule.
       Kerensky was dedicated to continuing Russia's participation in World War I, partly because he feared that aid
       he needed from the West to support Russia's economy would be lost if he withdrew from the conflict. However,
       this position became increasingly unpopular with the Russian people. The provisional government and the
       Petrograd Soviet (which was becoming more anti-war) then vied for power in Russia.

                                                                                                          DUELING VOICES
        The Provisional Government

         Various political parties in Russia responded in their own ways to the abdication of the tsar and the creation of
         the provisional government. As you read these excerpts from several such statements, look for similarities and
         differences.

               The task of the working class and the revolutionary army is to create a Provisional revolutionary
               government which will stand at the head of the new-born republican order. The Provisional
               revolutionary government must draw up temporary laws to defend the rights and liberties of the people,
               to confiscate church, landowners', government and crown lands and transfer them to the people; to
               introduce the eight-hour working day, and to summon a Constituent Assembly on the basis of a suffrage
               which is universal, without regard to sex, nationality or religion, direct, equal and secret. . . .

        -- Manifesto of the Central Committee of the Social Democrats, February 27, 1917

        The conference considers that support for the Provisional Government is absolutely necessary whilst it
        carries out its declared programme: an amnesty, the granting of individual freedoms, the repeal of
        estate, religious and national restrictions, and preparation for the Constituent Assembly.

        The conference reserves the right to change its attitude should the Provisional Government not adhere
        to the implementation of this programme. The conference also recognises that any attempts to
        undermine the work of the Provisional Government in the fulfilment of its programme must be
        combated.

        --Resolution of the Conference of the Petrograd Socialist-Revolutionaries, March 2, 1917

        The old regime has gone. . . . All citizens should have confidence in their regime and should combine
        their efforts to allow the government created by the Duma to complete its great task of liberating Russia
        from the external enemy and establishing peace inside Russia, on the basis of law, equality and
        freedom. . . .

        Forget all your party, class, estate and national differences! Each class, estate and nationality should be
        able to express its opinions and achieve its aims. The most important slogan now is `Organisation and
        Unity', organisation and unity for victory over the external enemy, organisation and unity in internal
        construction.

        --From the Central Committee of the Constitutional Democrat [Kadet] Party, March 3, 1917

        All Russians should put aside their disagreements and should unite around the Provisional Government,
        now the sole legal authority in Russia, dedicated to defend order and the state system and to the
        successful conclusion of the war. . . . Each one of us should direct all our strength and actions to
        harmonious work with all devoted sons of our homeland.

        --A Resolution of the Council of the United Nobility, March 10, 1917

    · What do these responses have in common? What are their key differences?
    · What do the responses reflect as a hope for Russia?

Germany saw an opportunity to take advantage of Russia's disintegrating political situation. A young Russian
named Vladimir Ilyich Lenin had supported the cause of revolution in his native country for many years. His
older brother had been executed for involvement in an attempt to assassinate Alexander III, Nicholas II's
father. Lenin had then left Russia, branded a radical and forced into exile. Germany helped him return to
Russia to energize the revolution there and undermine the tsarist government's conduct of the war.

Lenin's arrival in Russia was like a lightning bolt. He quickly became the leader of the revolutionary cause, and
the group he led, the Bolsheviks, challenged Kerensky's provisional government. In the October Revolution in
1917, Lenin led a coup and seized power from the other political factions in Petrograd. He spoke of creating a
government in which the Soviets would hold power. Capitalizing on a campaign of "Peace, Land, Bread,"
Lenin's government moved to end the war with Germany. Germany was only too happy to work out an
agreement that would allow it to focus solely on the war on its western front.

Lenin's goal was to end the fighting as quickly as possible, so he agreed to terms that were fairly advantageous
for Germany and the Central powers. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on March 3, 1918. In it, Russia
gave up significant territory to the Central powers, including areas of Poland and Ukraine, Finland, and the
Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia), which gave Germany new ports (Figure 11.20). In return, Russia
was able to end its participation in the war as Lenin focused on building a Communist state, the Soviet Union.
464 11 · The War to End All Wars

       FIGURE 11.20 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This map shows the area affected by the 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,
       including territory in what are now the states of Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Germany gained substantially
       from Russia, but the concessions were worth it to Lenin to extricate Russia from the war. (credit: modification of
       work "Europe 1920 simplyfied" by London Geographical Institute/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       In 1918, after being held under house arrest for two years, the former tsar, his wife, and their five children were
       executed. A civil war broke out that year pitting the White Army, which opposed Lenin, against the Red Army,
       which supported the Bolshevik government. This conflict lasted until 1923, when the Red Army proved
       victorious.

      The Final Year

       The final year of the war started auspiciously for Germany. In March, its troops began an offensive against the
       British and quickly took the advantage. Poor weather and fog created confusion, and the British may have
       retreated farther than they needed to. The Germans again moved toward Paris and resumed bombarding the
       city as they had in the early weeks of the war. Germany also worked out treaties with Russia and Romania,

which exited the war and ceded territory in the process. By the summer of 1918, these successes meant that
Germany held more territory than at any time in the past.

In that same summer, however, the mass of U.S. troops finally arrived. After four long years of war, the French
and British welcomed the aid. China and Greece also entered the war, as did Brazil in October 1917. (Haiti,
Cuba, and most of the nations of Central America also declared war on the Central powers between the spring
of 1917 and the summer of 1918, but none sent troops or played a decisive role in the fighting.) While the
Central powers had been successful in the first half of 1918, the Allies' sheer numbers gave them a nearly three
to one advantage that the Central powers could not withstand for long.

The Allies began offensive maneuvers, gaining some victories and setting the stage for the events of the fall.
The last major engagement of the war was the Meuse-Argonne offensive in France, which began in September
1918. This Allied counterattack had been planned for many months. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops
joined the British and French forces, employing tactics that included infantry attack and the use of poison gas,
tanks, and aircraft. The Allied armies quickly advanced several miles. The German armies held on, but over
the next month, the tide turned against them.

The situation for Germany was bleak. Food shortages were causing widespread panic and despair. Troops
began deserting, and civil unrest spread throughout Germany and Austria-Hungary. German naval
commanders wanted to achieve one last moment of glory by sailing the fleet out in late October to engage the
British. The German sailors, however, knew there was no chance of victory and had no wish to go on a suicide
mission. About one thousand of them mutinied and refused to set sail. In Kiel, home to a major German naval
base, both sailors and workers refused to follow orders. The revolt soon spread to other cities.

In Berlin, the far-left Socialist Party's politicians seized on the burgeoning revolt as a way to force a major
change in the government and restore order. They called for the abdication of the Kaiser and the establishment
of a republic. Wilhelm II abdicated on November 9, 1918, leaving the country for the Netherlands where he
lived until his death in 1941. The civilian political leaders of the more moderate Social Democrats now
proclaimed a provisional government, making Germany a republic. The German military agreed to work under
this new civilian government. Political leaders then took up the negotiations that had already begun for an
armistice, or cease-fire agreement, with the Allies. They believed Germany could not win the war and was best
served by ending it. This maneuver helped isolate the socialist radicals.

Compounding the problems the Central powers faced in the final months of the war was the entrance on both
the battlefield and the home front of another foe--influenza. By the fall of 1918, a flu pandemic was raging
throughout Europe and the United States. The first cases had been reported in the United States earlier that
year, and the mass movement of troops across the Atlantic Ocean had undoubtedly facilitated the virus's
spread. The flu proved quite deadly, especially among young adults. As the pandemic continued unabated,
tens of millions of people around the world died before the virus burned itself out the next year.

Austria came to terms on an armistice on November 3, 1918, and Hungary followed on November 13. For
Germany, an armistice was set to go into effect on November 11 at 11:00 a.m., imposing a cease-fire on all
units. The armies continued to fight up until the precise minute. Then, at the appointed time, the guns fell
silent. Men climbed out of their trenches and came from behind their batteries. The decision by the Allies to
request an armistice instead of a surrender was important. A surrender meant that one side had to accept
defeat. This was not something Germany was prepared to do in 1918. The armistice, however, simply meant
that a cease-fire would be imposed while formal negotiations occurred. Germany believed these negotiations
466 11 · The War to End All Wars

       would allow it to preserve some of its gains in the war and extract itself from the fighting with a measure of
       honor and dignity.
       Under the terms of the armistice, German troops had to withdraw from their occupation of parts of France and
       Belgium and return to Germany. (The fact that German troops were still in possession of foreign soil when the
       war ended was a point that later leaders such as Adolf Hitler exploited in the coming decade.) Germany also
       had to turn over its military equipment to the Allies, along with its navy. Most of the ships ended up at Scapa
       Flow, in the Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland, where their German crews scuttled them the following
       year rather than turn them over to the Allies intact.
       The casualties from the war were staggering. They included not only those who died or were wounded but also
       those who were taken prisoner or classified as missing. Russia had more than nine million casualties, France
       more than six million. Germany and Austria-Hungary topped seven million casualties each. In all, more than
       8.5 million soldiers died in the war, and twenty-one million were wounded. The numbers of civilians who
       perished or were wounded were also in the millions.

       It was in this period, with countries still reeling from the aftermath of the carnage, that treaty negotiations
       began. They dragged on for six months following the armistice, and Germany was ultimately proven wrong in
       its expectations of what it could expect from the talks. There was still much damage and suffering from which
       to recover, but the war was over.

Section Summary

11.1 Alliances, Expansion, and Conflict

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Europe was controlled by a series of alliances that served to check
any one power from becoming too large. These alliances had worked for a number of decades, and there had
been little in the way of warfare on the continent. However, competition existed among the powers, especially
in colonial development. In particular, Germany's desire to have more colonies and a correspondingly larger
navy put it in direct competition with the British Empire. Meanwhile, innovations in shipbuilding meant that
early twentieth-century naval ships were both faster and possessed of more firepower than at any time in
history.

11.2 The Collapse of the Ottomans and the Coming of War

The Ottoman Empire was disintegrating due to military losses prior to the war and the push for nationalism
within its borders. The same drive toward nationalism occurred in Austria-Hungary. People of different
nationalities wanted to live in their own independent nations rather than being forced into an empire that did
not serve their needs. When Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb in June 1914, it
caused Austria-Hungary to undertake a war against Serbia, which it blamed for his death. This war drew in
Serbia's ally Russia, and Austria-Hungary's ally Germany. Treaty and alliance obligations then brought more
countries into the conflict.

In the first months of war, the invasion of Belgium painted Germany as the aggressor nation, and fierce fighting
through Belgium and northern France forced civilians to evacuate. With the Battle of the Marne in September
1914, a system of trench warfare was established on the western front. On the eastern front, Russian troops
were poorly equipped and poorly trained and therefore experienced heavy losses. The United States planned
468 11 · Assessments

to maintain its isolationist foreign policy and continued trading with both sides in the conflict, but Britain's
naval blockade of German ports meant that U.S. trade with Germany was somewhat limited.

11.3 Total War

World War I introduced many new technologies seen in warfare today--tanks, machine guns, long-range
artillery, and airplanes. Most troops found themselves under constant threat of bombardment, injury, and
death, and the casualties and destruction of total war were enormous. The large empires fighting in the conflict
brought troops from their colonies and dominions to fight. Fighting also took place outside Europe, across
other continents such as Asia and Africa. Despite the diversity of the forces engaged in the war and the
common cause espoused by each side, numerous examples occurred of racial prejudice and discrimination in
the decision-making and activities of the war.

11.4 War on the Homefront

The war was so all-encompassing that governments had to find new ways to manage the supplies and support
for the war, usually by taking tighter control of industrial output through new legislation. Women entered new
types of work such as munitions manufacture to fill the gaps left by male workers now fighting in the military.
Those on the home front found themselves confronting food shortages and sometimes civil unrest as people
began questioning their government's competence to fight the war. Such questioning was often met with harsh
penalties. Other political challenges also arose, such as the Irish Nationalists striking out against British rule in
the 1916 Easter Rising.

11.5 The War Ends

In 1905, the Russian people rose in rebellion after the government's killing of peaceful protesters. Tsar
Nicholas II allowed the creation of a legislature called the Duma, but he was still not ready to share power with
the people. The tsarist government was unable to mount a successful war effort, however, and the tsar was
forced to abdicate in 1917. The Bolshevik Revolution led by Vladimir Lenin the following year brought
promises of peace, land, and bread to the Russian people.

In 1918, with Russia exiting the war, Germany threw its armies into action in the west, but food shortages and
general unrest in the Central powers meant that early victories could not be sustained. The arrival of U.S.
troops in mass numbers in Europe helped propel Allied victories by the second half of 1918 and pushed
Germany to the brink of collapse. The abdication of the Kaiser and an armistice with a new civilian government
in Germany brought an end to the fighting in November.

INTRODUCTION The interwar years of the 1920s and 1930s saw a world recovering from the upheaval of
World War I. People reacted differently to the horrors of the conflict, but many chose to embrace the present,
and the 1920s were filled with new forms of cultural expression and new opportunities (Figure 12.1). In
Europe the economy still lagged, but in other parts of the world economic growth soared. By the 1930s,
however, economic instability had become common as the Great Depression plunged nations into poverty and
unemployment. Governments dealt with the downturn in a variety of ways, but solutions in several countries
included more authoritarian policies.

     12.1 Recovering from World War I

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe World War I's immediate aftermath
         · List the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles
         · Describe how economic issues in Germany helped lead to the rise of the National Socialists
         · Analyze World War I's effects on the economies of Europe, the United States, East Asia, and Latin

             America
         · Describe international efforts to prevent future global wars
       Two major and competing forces took shape following World War I. One was disillusionment as the sheer
       horror of the war was finally understood. The other was the tantalizing idea that society had learned from the
       war and could build a better tomorrow, freed from the senselessness of war, through new institutions such as
       the League of Nations. Or, in the case of Russia, a new society would be based on more equitable principles.
       The reality turned out to be far from the ideal.

      The Aftermath

       As World War I ended in 1918, the world moved to cope with the destruction it had wrought. Military casualties
       stood between nine and ten million, civilian deaths at approximately ten million, and the number of wounded
       above twenty-one million. Veterans had both physical and emotional wounds; some needed physical therapy,
       prosthetics, or vocational training for their postwar lives. The civilian toll meant families had lost not only

sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers but daughters, sisters, wives, and mothers. The war also brought into
question the notions of superiority that had permeated Western civilization. People wondered whether the
West was declining and could no longer consider itself a moral leader in the world.
In Belgium and eastern France, the physical destruction was immense. Thousands of acres, often of prime
farmland, were barren after years of artillery bombardment. Towns such as Ypres in Belgium had been shelled
so heavily that many buildings had collapsed (Figure 12.3). People had to filter back to the farmlands and cities
they had fled and begin to rebuild their lives. Some towns, such as Thiepval, France, had been so thoroughly
destroyed that they were never rebuilt.

In the defeated countries of Germany and Austria-Hungary, economies were in free fall. Millions of men
returned home to find stubborn economic instability and labor markets in transition, with factories ill-
equipped to return to peacetime production. For men from Europe's colonies, it took even longer to return
home because European troops were demobilized first. Even the victorious nations faced economic problems.
Britain and France had borrowed billions to finance the war and had sizable debts to repay, many to the United
States. Industries across the world had to reconvert their machinery and processes to begin producing
consumer items again, causing continued unemployment.
The world was still dealing with the flu pandemic of 1918-1920, closing schools and theaters and canceling
public activities. People were encouraged to wear masks and limit their movement until the crisis had passed.
The flu eventually infected about one-third of the world's population, killing tens of millions, especially
younger people. By early 1920, it had stopped spreading, however, and people were able to return to their pre-
pandemic lives.
Political change was in the winds. The takeover of Russia in 1917 by a small but determined Bolshevik force
476 12 · The Interwar Period

       sent shockwaves through many nations as they began to fear similar uprisings within their own borders. In the
       United States, a "Red Scare" was unfolding in 1919. Fear of immigrants who might be communists or socialists
       was expressed in the growth of nativism--the idea that the nation should be reserved for native-born people of
       northern European ancestry. A number of mail bombs sent to politicians, businessmen, and newspaper
       editors heightened public fears of anarchy, and Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer began authorizing what
       were later called the Palmer Raids, targeting newspaper presses, immigrant groups, and Russian worker
       unions, often without proper search warrants. Supposed "radical aliens" were arrested; some were held for
       months without being charged, and some were deported to Russia. The Palmer Raids demonstrated the power
       of the government to ignore individual rights. The American Civil Liberties Union was formed in 1920 to
       provide legal assistance to those targeted by the raids. As the months passed with no clear threat of a
       communist takeover, the public increasingly viewed Palmer's actions with suspicion, and his political career
       ended.

      The Treaty of Versailles

       In January 1919, the leaders of the major Allied powers (except Russia) met outside Paris at Versailles to
       negotiate the treaty formally ending the war (Figure 12.4). Committees were assigned to resolve the many
       issues concerning not only Europe but also the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The conference lasted about a
       year. In its finished form, the Treaty of Versailles was actually a series of treaties, a "massive document that
       ran to 436 pages containing 433 articles organized into fifteen parts."

President Woodrow Wilson arrived in Paris in 1919 to grand parades and a hero's welcome. In January 1918,
he had already published a plan he hoped would be the basis of the treaty--the Fourteen Points--embodying
his wish to prevent future war by solving issues he believed had led to the recent conflict. Among these points
were the rights of neutral nations, freedom of the seas, and the need to break up the empires that had caused
the war and create new sovereign states in Europe. Wilson's last point proposed a League of Nations where
member nations could come together for mutual security and work out problems without resorting to war.

Wilson also strongly advocated self-determination, the idea that each ethnic group should have its own
government. The treaty ushered in a major redrawing of Europe, and new countries flooded onto the map.
Their borders were drawn by diplomats in Paris, however, and did not always reflect where people of different
nationalities lived. Nor could they. In an already diverse empire such as Austria-Hungary, people of different
backgrounds lived side by side, so it was no easy feat to draw a border. In some cases, the treaty grouped
people in ways that may not have made sense to them. For example, the new country of Czechoslovakia was
predominantly composed of Czechs and Slovaks, who did not see themselves as having similar nationalities.

Poland resurfaced after having been partitioned out of existence in the late 1700s. A new Polish nation was
carved from territory on the German Empire's eastern side and land Russia had relinquished under the 1918
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ending its involvement in the war. The German-speaking country of Austria became an
independent nation, as did Hungary. The area of the Balkans, the site of so much uncertainty and nationalism
prior to the war, received a particularly unfavorable decision regarding self-determination. The Serbs, Croats,
Bosnians, Montenegrins, and other Slavic groups there viewed themselves as separate nationalities, yet all
were assembled in a single country, to be called Yugoslavia or "land of the Southern Slavs." Yugoslavia was
simply a diplomatic creation, and it did not survive the century (Figure 12.5).

       Other provisions of the treaty were designed to weaken Germany. Great Britain and France were intent on
       punishing Germany for backing Austria-Hungary in 1914 and enlarging the conflict by invading Belgium and
       France. They did not want Germany to simply be blamed for the war; they wanted Germany to literally pay for
       it, so they began a painstaking financial accounting. Every destroyed house or building was assigned a
       monetary value. Every lost military and civilian life was assessed an amount based on what that person's

future earnings might have been. These reparations totaled over $30 billion in 1919 dollars. (For context, a
loaf of bread cost about 9 cents at the time.) Wilson hoped to persuade the other Allied leaders to abandon this
course but was unable to, and the treaty reflected their goal of revenge.

     LINK TO LEARNING

The full text of the Treaty of Versailles (https://openstax.org/l/77Versailles) is available through the Library of
Congress.

Take a few minutes and read through some of the first two parts. The first is about the League of Nations, and
the second is about the borders of Germany.

One of the clearest punishments the treaty inflicted on Germany was restrictions on its military capacity. The
German Army was limited to 100,000 troops, the draft was ended, and the number of ships, planes, tanks, and
submarines was similarly curtailed. The Allied powers hoped that limiting the might of the German Army
would limit its aggressiveness. The method of enforcing these limits was not resolved in Paris, however, and it
arose as a real issue in the 1930s.

Germany was also shrunk, losing 13 percent of the territory it had held in Europe before the war. The Saar
region was to be administered by the League of Nations. The Rhineland in the west (the Rhine River Valley)
became a demilitarized zone. Germany also lost western territory to both France (Alsace-Lorraine, previously
seized by Germany) and Belgium. In the east, German lands and the port of Danzig (now GdaÅ,,sk) were given
to Poland. Other lands went to Lithuania and the new country of Czechoslovakia. As a result, Germany lost
about one-tenth of its population, approximately 6.5 million people. It also had to give up its colonies in Asia
and Africa.

One provision of the treaty related directly to Japan and China. Japan had occupied China's Shandong
Province, a former German concession, including the port of Qingdao (Tsingtao), and continued to hold it after
the war. Without consulting the millions of Chinese people living there at the time, the treaty makers allowed
Japan to retain this territory, which it did until 1922.

The racism of the era was apparent in what was not included in the treaty. Japan had requested a clause
affirming the equality of all nations regardless of race. This proviso would have set the stage for more open
migration and fairer treatment of immigrants (such as Japanese immigrants to the United States). Several
powers supported its inclusion, but Australia (which allowed no non-White immigration) and then the United
States stated their opposition. Wilson claimed a unanimous vote was necessary to include it, though this was
not true for any other clause. In the end, the racial equality clause was absent from the final version of the
treaty. As another example, when France and Britain tallied the destruction of the war, they did not include
African lives lost in the fighting in Africa. The cost of the devastation there was borne solely by Africans.

It was clear that a significant period of adjustment must follow the treaty's signing as the peoples of the new
regions and their fledgling governments established themselves. There was also disappointment. For instance,
in 1915, Italy had been promised territory in Dalmatia in return for joining the Allied cause but was forced to
relinquish it due to Wilson's opposition. This prompted anger in Italy and some anti-American rallies. France
was annoyed that it had received only part of Germany's African colonies of Cameroon and Togo while the rest
went to Britain. Japan, besides being angered at the rejection of the racial equality clause, was disappointed
that it had not been given all of Germany's colonial holdings in Asia and the Pacific. It received only some,
while others went to New Zealand and Australia. Internal ethnic issues had not been fully solved by the treaty
(such as in the creation of Czechoslovakia) and could easily resurface given the chance.

The "war guilt" clause of the treaty, blaming Germany for the war, caused many problems for that country over
the next decades. Its diplomats felt dishonored by being forced to agree to it, and the harsh monetary
reparations left Germany unstable for several years. The government's decision to print more money to pay
480 12 · The Interwar Period

       these debts caused hyperinflation and made its politicians look incompetent. It was easy for rumors of
       conspiracy to take hold, particularly among war veterans. The "stab-in-the-back" theory, for example, claimed
       that German democratic politicians had betrayed the military with the 1918 cease-fire agreement. (In truth,
       the German military had reached its breaking point in 1918 and was not in a position to continue the war,
       especially given the continuous arrival of fresh U.S. troops.)

       The U.S. Senate's biggest worry about the Treaty of Versailles was that if the United States joined the League of
       Nations, its troops could be sent anywhere in the world, drawing the nation into foreign disputes that the
       Senate, then dominated by the Republican Party, wanted to avoid. Senators feared the treaty would thus cost
       them their constitutional power to declare war. They also objected to Britain and France's desire to control the
       League. For these reasons, the United States did not approve the treaty and did not join the League of Nations.
       The organization's ability to mediate and resolve international disputes was weakened by the lack of U.S.
       participation.

       The treaty was more popular in other Allied nations. Britain generally felt it was even-handed and that the
       punishment of Germany was just. The British people looked forward to joining the League. The French also
       agreed with the penalties heaped upon Germany, though some felt they should have gone even further because
       France had suffered more than Britain had. China was frustrated that Japan was allowed to retain Shandong
       under the treaty, but its protests fell on deaf ears. Anger at China's treatment helped lead to the May Fourth
       Movement, which began in Beijing in 1919 as a protest by students. It grew to include labor strikes, calls for a
       boycott of Japanese-made products, and the removal of Japanese-leaning government officials.

      Postwar Recession and Prosperity

       World War I devastated the world's economies. Four long years of conflict and losses had disrupted the labor
       force across Europe, not to mention governments' budgetary predictions. The reparations owed by Germany
       were the means by which Britain and France planned to deal with their own debt, but they also created an
       economic house of cards that could easily tumble down. Africa, Asia, and Latin America also felt the economic
       effects of the war. Before the war, African nations had traded extensively with Europe, especially Germany,
       which had accounted for the majority of European trade with sub-Saharan Africa. When the war began, the
       difficulty of trading with the combatant nations meant that many European goods became more expensive,
       and many Africans could no longer afford them.

       Following the war, Britain and France looked to their African colonies and to Germany's former colonial
       possessions for their financial salvation. Both France and Britain focused on agricultural development. Often
       this meant increasing opportunities for White settlers to reap profit for both themselves and the home country
       while limiting opportunities for Black Africans. In the portion of Cameroon given to France to administer after
       the war, French officials encouraged growing coffee for export. But they also allotted licenses to grow the crop
       primarily to Europeans and restricted the number of acres that Black Africans could cultivate. Lack of
       opportunity for Black people meant that White coffee growers had a ready supply of agricultural laborers who
       were forced to accept low wages. Similarly, in British Tanganyika (present-day Tanzania), the right to cut and
       market timber was reserved for Europeans. Britain and France also invested heavily in railroad building in
       Africa following the war, and Britain poured funds into mining operations in Nigeria, the Gold Coast (Ghana),
       and South Africa.

       East Asian countries were also affected by the war, and the economies of several, such as China and Japan,
       underwent a growth period following its end. Though China was not yet heavily industrialized, it benefited
       from the decrease in global competition caused by Europe's economic issues.

       In the Taisho period in the 1920s, the Japanese economy was buffeted by booms and recessions, the Great
       Kanto Earthquake of 1923, inflation, and a serious banking crisis in 1927. Japan had become heavily
       dependent on trade with the United States, and its urban economy was now undermined by the protectionism
       practiced by both U.S. and European markets in the form of tariffs on foreign imports. Japan's economy

continued growing in the 1920s, however, as the country increased military production and began making
investments in China. Inflation did occur, but the government adopted austerity policies to combat it. Japan
was able to increase its exports after the war even more than China did, and trade with the United States, in
particular, increased substantially.

Latin American countries saw little real economic change after the war. Many had few industries and still
depended on agricultural exports for economic growth. Some faced more competition for these commodities
as other regions around the world began to export increasing amounts of items such as rubber. One Latin
American commodity that did see growth, particularly in Venezuela, was oil, which was becoming increasingly
important in global markets. The heavily industrialized countries of South America, such as Argentina, Brazil,
and Peru, provided stable but minor economic growth. They geared their manufacturing to the export market,
but tariffs rates and internal changes in monetary policy during the 1920s held them back.

The United States did not suffer the physical devastation of war that the other Allies did. It emerged from the
conflict in a position of economic power, a creditor nation to be repaid for its wartime loans to Britain and
France. Thus, the 1920s were a decade of prosperity for the country, in which technological innovations added
to the sense of affluence. Major retailers were ready to sell consumers new items like vacuum cleaners, electric
ovens, and refrigerators through credit lines they paid off over time. Domestic life became significantly easier,
wages increased, and unemployment was low. For U.S. citizens, the future seemed bright.

Germany and Reparations

John Maynard Keynes, the creator of Keynesian economics, was a British economist at the Paris Peace
Conference in 1919. He was so unsettled by the potential financial repercussions of the treaty's terms that he
wrote a book contending the large reparations would mean economic ruin for Germany, endangering the
entire European economy. His predictions were soon borne out.

Germany faced numerous problems as the 1920s began. It was not only blamed for the war, but its foreign
financial assets had also been seized under the treaty, further compromising its economic power, and it had
been physically diminished when many rich industrial areas were cut away from its territory. Thus, one of the
immediate problems facing the new democratic Weimar Republic government was finding a way to pay the
reparations.

The first payment came due in 1921, but Germany was unable to fund the full amount, and the unresolved
issue about how to enforce the treaty terms resurfaced. The next year, 1922, Germany defaulted on its
payments to France and Britain. In response, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr Valley, the center
of German iron, coal, and steel production, as a means to force repayment. The French needed the valley's
resources (especially coal). German residents of the valley resisted the occupation, and many were killed in the
resulting conflict.

To reach an immediate solution, Germany began simply printing more money. But this created an inflationary
cycle, and the economy soon proved incapable of keeping up with the hyperinflation that resulted. The new
money was literally not worth the paper it was printed on (Figure 12.6). The government had to print ever-
larger denominations of bills, and people took wheelbarrows of cash to the store to buy a loaf of bread. Holding
a job seemed ludicrous when pay could not keep up with a rate of inflation that increased by the day. The entire
German middle class saw their savings disappear, and with their money went their support of the government.

       worthless. In this photograph from 1923, Germany children play with stacks of banknotes. (credit: "Hyperinflation in
       Germany in 1923" by Mount Holyoke College/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       In 1924, the United States intervened by arranging the Dawes Plan, by which Germany's installment payments
       were lowered but set to increase in the future as its economy rebounded. Foreign banks, many in the United
       States, also loaned Germany money to stabilize its inflationary economy. This enabled Germany to make its
       payments, but it also meant taking on more debt. In essence, U.S. banks were loaning money to Germany that
       it was using to pay Britain and France, which in turn used that money to pay back their own debts to the United
       States.
       Reparations continued to present an extreme economic hardship for Germany. In 1929, the United States
       announced a new proposal. The Young Plan stretched German reparations across a fifty-nine-year payment
       schedule, slightly lowered the total to $29 billion, and arranged hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of
       additional loans. Germany continued to make payments until 1932, when the worldwide Great Depression
       made it untenable to continue. Later agreements canceled more of the remaining debt, and the last payment
       was finally made in 2010. In all, Germany paid only about one-eighth of the total.
       Poor decisions by Germany's Weimar Republic contributed to growing public frustration with the new
       democratic government. Many political groups attempted to use the country's economic problems to catapult
       themselves to political power. Among these was the National Socialists or Nazi Party, whose members favored
       a more authoritarian government. One man who joined the group in the early 1920s was Adolf Hitler (Figure
       12.7).

Hitler was a veteran of the war who subscribed to the unfounded stab-in-the-back theory and had developed
an abiding hatred of the Treaty of Versailles. He became a persuasive orator in the 1920s and rose up the ranks
of the Nazis as he recruited more people to the group. In 1923, he decided to launch a takeover of the state
government in Munich. The planned Beer Hall Putsch (so named because the targeted politicians were to be
kidnapped at a beer hall) failed, and Hitler and many supporters were arrested. Over the next year in jail,
Hitler wrote the book Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"), in which he outlined his plan for the Nazis to achieve
political power and their goals for the resurgence of Germany. These goals included the uniting of German-
speaking peoples under one government and an expansion eastward in search of Lebensraum or "living
space." His words found a sympathetic audience in the 1920s.

Disarmament and the Commitment to Peace

Still reeling from World War I in the 1920s, the governments of the major powers generally supported
disarmament and limited military buildup. There was great hope that the next decades would be peaceful, and
many agreements reached in the 1920s reflected this commitment to goodwill among nations. In 1921, the
Washington Naval Conference opened to address the issue of the naval arms race that had taken place before
and during World War I. U.S. secretary of state Charles Evans Hughes proposed that the three major naval
powers--Britain, the United States, and Japan--each scuttle a number of ships and restrict future construction.
The Five-Power Treaty that emerged limited the construction of warships and the size of aircraft carriers, then
a new style of vessel in the world's navies. It established ratios for warships whereby Britain and the United
States could have the same number, and for every five ships they had, Japan could have three and France and
Italy 1.75 each. Britain and the United States were allowed more ships because they maintained fleets in both
the Atlantic and the Pacific to protect their colonies.

        The Western View of Japan

         Japan often argued that it was not treated fairly by Western powers at either the Treaty of Versailles negotiations
         or the Washington Naval Conference in the 1920s. One of Japan's leading politicians, Okuma Shigenobu, wrote
         about how the West perceived the Japanese in Illusions of the White Race. As you read his words, look for the
         evidence he presents for his case.

               The white are obsessed with the mistaken theory that they are superior to all other races. This is the
               most serious obstacle in the way of the realization of racial equality. Now the Japanese, the Chinese, the
               Mongolian, the Turks, the Indians, the Afghans, the Persians, the Arabs, the Malayans, the American
               aborigines, and the African peoples are all non-white. They are all held in contempt by the whites. And it
               is the common belief among the whites that the darker the skin, the more inferior is the race. It is based
               neither upon science, nor upon any positive experience. It is mere superstition backed by historical
               prejudices.

               The whites are of the conviction that they are too superior a people to be governed by their non-white
               fellows. Therefore, they demand the privilege of extraterritoriality in the countries of the Asiatic races.
               They establish their own courts and trample under foot the laws and courts of Asiatic countries. . . . Of
               all the non-white countries, Japan had taken the lead in adopting the best parts of European
               civilization--including its military side. She codified her laws, and reformed her police and judicial
               systems, her military and naval forces, thus placing herself almost on an equal footing with that of the
               European countries. Therefore, the Europeans were compelled to withdraw their extraterritorial rights
               from Japan. . . . Some whites regard the development of Japan as an unjustifiable encroachment upon
               their own rights. They either instigate a non-white race against Japan or plan to organize a league of the
               white nations to perpetuate a white supremacy in the world. Be it remembered, however, that no unjust
               and unreasonable agitation against this country will ever succeed, as God never sides with an unjust
               cause.

               --Okuma Shigenobu, Illusions of the White Race

           · What points does Okuma Shigenobu make about Western views?
           · What evidence does he use to back his assertions?

       By the late 1920s, optimism was high that the pain of war might be a thing of the past. It was in this spirit that
       the Kellogg-Briand Pact was written. The pact was a negotiation between U.S. secretary of state Frank Kellogg
       and Aristide Briand, the French foreign minister, renouncing war as an instrument of national policy. Fifteen
       nations signed it in 1928, and another forty-seven followed over the next years. However, there was no way to
       enforce it, and no repercussions for signatories that failed to live up to its ideals. Thus, it did little to curb the
       aggressive military policies of many nations during the following decade.

       The same could be said of the League of Nations. Based on high ideals, the League could issue statements,
       restrictions, or condemnations, but it could not compel other countries to limit their activities. Assessing trade
       restrictions on a country might have some (minor) impact, but the League had no military arm that could
       physically intervene in a member country's actions. Thus, as the 1930s began, it was regularly challenged by
       aggressive acts across the globe that it was powerless to influence. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931. Italy
       invaded Libya in 1931 and Ethiopia in 1935. The League did protest, especially over the Ethiopian invasion,
       but it could do little more than impose economic sanctions against Italy, and even these were not upheld by all
       countries. It was clear the League had no real power and no country need fear it.

12.2 The Formation of the Soviet Union

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe the Soviet Union's early years and the structure of its government
  · Analyze the effects of Stalin's first Five-Year Plan on the Soviet economy
  · Describe life in the Soviet Union under Stalin

Russia underwent massive political upheaval during the Bolshevik takeover in 1917. A bloody civil war was
fought for the next three years before the Bolsheviks and their leader Vladimir Lenin were victorious. Russia
was then reorganized as the Soviet Union in the early 1920s. Lenin's early death created an opening exploited
by Joseph Stalin, an autocrat who reshaped the "worker's paradise" of the Soviet Union to bring it fully under
his authoritarian control.

The Birth of the Soviet Union and the Rise of Stalin

After the Bolshevik seizure of the government and Russia's hasty departure from World War I, Lenin moved to
consolidate power in Russia. Civil war raged from 1918 to 1921 between the Red Army of the Bolsheviks and
the White Army representing all the groups that opposed them, including the Russian upper classes, forces
loyal to the monarchy, and Lenin's enemies within the Russian Social Democrats, such as the Menshevik
faction. Members of the White Army disagreed on whether they sought an anti-Bolshevik communist
government or the return of a tsarist government. The Red Army, though smaller, had a focused goal and was
better organized.

British, French, Japanese, and U.S. troops all invaded Russia in support of the White Army and stayed until
1920, but they were unable to stop the Bolsheviks from seizing control. The civil war ended in 1921 with the
Bolsheviks in control. Approximately 1.5 million soldiers had died in the fighting, but the civilian death toll
was substantially higher--about eight million.

During the civil war, Lenin and the Bolshevik leadership also sought to take over lands outside Russia that had
been controlled by the now-deposed tsar. Lenin approached these regions with the goal of creating a federal
state of republics governed by a soviet, an elected committee of workers' representatives. Each republic in this
new "Soviet Union" would represent an ethnicity and be nominally independent but ultimately under the
central government's control. Many of these areas fiercely resisted incorporation by the Bolsheviks.

In 1919, for example, the Red Army invaded Ukraine and faced strong resistance, but by 1920, the Bolsheviks
had taken control. Belarus was also established as a Soviet republic fairly easily. Both Ukraine and Belarus had
some autonomy but had to rely on Lenin's government to direct foreign policy. Other areas, like the Caucasus,
proved more contentious. Azerbaijan and Armenia were incorporated by the Bolsheviks in 1920. The
government in Georgia was heavily Menshevik and resisted Bolshevik rule, but in 1921 the Red Army took
control of this region as well. In 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was established. It
incorporated the country of Russia and the regions Russia had absorbed as soviet republics under a new
centralized national government quite different from what the revolutionaries had envisioned only a few years
before (Figure 12.8).

       The Bolsheviks had used the civil war to strengthen their control over the economy. This included wielding
       oversight of industrialization and taking steps toward the elimination of private property. The national
       government decided what could be produced and rationed goods throughout the country. Such control was
       held up as necessary to meet government and military needs, but the focus on top-down administration vied
       with the revolution's slogans about workers having more power under communism.
       World War I and the civil war had created massive dislocations in the Russian economy. Industrial production
       had dropped significantly below prewar levels, as had agricultural production and particularly grain output.
       People were out of work, and prices had risen. The economy was essentially bankrupt. To combat these
       problems, Lenin abandoned the earlier economic approach, called war communism, and introduced the New
       Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921. The NEP kept the government in overall control of the economy, but it
       introduced some aspects of capitalism, such as giving peasants the ability to sell their produce on the market
       and allowing small businesses to operate through private not state ownership. This was not the pure socialist
       state Lenin had envisioned. Instead, it was an emergency response to significant hardships and growing
       discontent among the Russian people.
       By the end of the civil war, Russia's Communist Party bureaucracy had grown quite large and intricate. There
       were multiple layers of leaders, from the local through the regional and national levels. One who began to
       exploit his understanding and control of this bureaucracy was Joseph Stalin (Figure 12.9). Stalin had grown up
       in poverty in the Russian Empire's state of Georgia. He adopted the surname Stalin in adulthood because it
       meant "man of steel," and he became a Bolshevik in the early 1900s. In 1922, Stalin became the Communist
       Party's general secretary. This was not a high-level position, but Stalin realized he could use it to consolidate
       power behind the scenes. He controlled all appointments within the party and could ensure that only those
       who agreed with him achieved these positions.

Lenin's death in 1924 opened a power vacuum and a debate over the future of policy in the Soviet Union. There
were two very different paths the country could follow. Favoring one path were leaders such as Leon Trotsky,
the man responsible for making the Red Army a dependable fighting force during the civil war (Figure 12.10).
Trotsky hoped to both increase industrialization and end the more capitalistic policies of the NEP. In
particular, Trotsky hoped the Soviet Union could serve as an example to spur more revolutionary movements
around the world. On the other side were those who wanted to continue the NEP and pursue a slower, less
radical path to industrialization. Stalin, then in his forties, strove to keep out of these specific debates. He and
Trotsky held opposing views on communist ideology and the future of the Soviet Union, but Stalin's control
over the Communist bureaucracy gave him leverage.

488 12 · The Interwar Period

       In 1927, Stalin expelled Trotsky from the Communist Party. In 1929, Trotsky was forced into exile. He was
       assassinated by a Soviet agent in Mexico in 1940. By the end of the 1920s, although the new Soviet government
       did seek to fulfill some of the promises Bolshevism had held out, the collective approach of the early years of
       the decade had devolved to one-man rule.

      The First Five-Year Plan

       Stalin's domestic agenda was codified in the form of Five-Year Plans outlining economic achievements the
       Soviet Union was to have made by each plan's conclusion. The timeline was ambitious, if not impossible. Yet
       officials tried to achieve the goals; they risked losing their jobs or even their lives for not meeting production
       quotas.

       The first Five-Year Plan was designed to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union. Stalin abandoned his earlier
       support of slow growth in light of the need to produce more farm equipment for the peasants and the desire to
       undercut those who had been advocating for more industrialization. Cities devoted to specific industries were
       developed and funded. Iron and steel production was to be raised dramatically under the plan, and new
       electrical power stations were to be built. Many of these goals were achieved, and overall industrial capacity
       increased by approximately 50 percent.

       Stalin's intention to exert state control over all aspects of life in the Soviet Union foundered when it came to
       agriculture. The collectivization of agriculture consisted of the shift from individual farms to large state-run
       farms, and when Communist Party officials moved to quickly meet production quotas that were increased after
       the first Five-Year Plan was implemented, they did so with little regard for the realities of agricultural
       production. The peasants heavily resisted the intrusion of government officials into their workdays. As the
       plan began to be implemented, they even resorted to violent means. The revolution had promised them better
       lives, but these would not be possible under the terms of the plan.

       Across the country's agricultural communities were a number of peasants labeled kulaks by the government.
       Kulaks had prospered under the more liberal policies of the NEP. In the early 1920s, Soviet policy had
       specifically defined a kulak as someone who hired seasonal farm laborers for an individual farm of twenty-five
       to forty acres. Very few farmers fell into this category, but they became scapegoats for Stalin. He blamed them
       for the difficulties in implementing collectivization and cast them as enemies of the state, which made them
       subject to arrest and even execution. Even their family members were prevented from holding certain jobs or
       pursuing university educations.

                                                                                                  IN THEIR OWN WORDS

        Collectivization in the Soviet Union

         The following resolution was adopted during a Soviet Politburo meeting and details plans for punishing villages
         and kulaks who opposed collectivization. Many places opposed this policy and were seen as disloyal by
         government officials. As you read, note what government officials would be looking for and what types of
         punishments they planned to mete out.

               In view of the shameful collapse of grain collection in the more remote regions of Ukraine, the Council of
               People's Commissars and the Central Committee call upon the oblast executive committees and the
               oblast [party] committees as well as the raion executive committees and the raion [party] committees:
               to break up the sabotage of grain collection, which has been organized by kulak and
               counterrevolutionary elements; to liquidate the resistance of some of the rural communists, who in fact
               have become the leaders of the sabotage; to eliminate the passivity and complacency toward the
               saboteurs, incompatible with being a party member; and to ensure, with maximum speed, full and
               absolute compliance with the plan for grain collection.

        The Council of People's Commissars and the Central Committee resolve:

        To place the following villages on the black list for overt disruption of the grain collection plan and for
        malicious sabotage, organized by kulak and counterrevolutionary elements: . . .

        The following measures should be undertaken with respect to these villages:

        Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the
        villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores.

        Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private
        farmers.

        Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations.

        Investigation and purge of all sorts of foreign and hostile elements from cooperative and state
        institutions, to be carried out by organs of the Workers and Peasants Inspectorate.

        Investigation and purge of collective farms in these villages, with removal of counterrevolutionary
        elements and organizers of grain collection disruption.

        The Council of People's Commissars and the Central Committee call upon all collective and private
        farmers who are honest and dedicated to Soviet rule to organize all their efforts for a merciless struggle
        against kulaks and their accomplices in order to: defeat in their villages the kulak sabotage of grain
        collection; fulfill honestly and conscientiously their grain collection obligations to the Soviet authorities;
        and strengthen collective farms.

        --Addendum to the minutes of Politburo [meeting] No. 93, December 6, 1932

    · What are the kulaks accused of?
    · What punishment is being assessed on them?

Stalin speeded the drive to collectivization, and local officials did what they could to comply with the new
targets for grain collection. By 1939, more than 90 percent of the peasants had been forced to live and work on
collective farms. If they resisted, they could be arrested, and many were sent to labor camps in Siberia. While
some poor peasants complied with collectivization because they had little of their own property to lose,
middle-class peasants continued to oppose it, even killing their livestock rather than turning flocks over to the
Soviet government. More than half the nation's livestock was lost under collectivization in the 1930s, and the
numbers did not recover until the 1950s. In some areas, spring planting did not occur due to the upheaval.

The failures of collectivization spelled deaths for millions in the Soviet Union. Approximately two million died
resisting or in prison, and between five and ten million additional lives were lost in a famine caused by the
chaos of the process, the peasants' choice to slaughter their livestock, and government policies that took food
from the peasants. The grain-producing region of Ukraine was hit especially hard; government decisions there
caused mass starvation. Some officials actually went into homes and took whatever food they could find.
Approximately 3.9 million Ukrainians are estimated to have died in the famine they called the Holodomor
("death by famine" in Ukrainian).

The problems surrounding collectivization also led many within the Communist Party to question the wisdom
of Stalin's decisions. In 1934, the assassination of Sergei Kirov, a high-ranking Soviet politician, led to an
investigation that uncovered what Stalin believed was a plot to kill him. Kirov's death, together with the unrest
caused by collectivization, the anti-Soviet rhetoric of Germany's Nazi Party (which had taken control of
Germany in 1933), and his knowledge that many Soviet politicians did not share his vision of the USSR's
future, fed Stalin's growing feelings of paranoia. His belief that he was surrounded by enemies led to a reign of
490 12 · The Interwar Period

       terror in which the Soviet secret police arrested millions of Soviet citizens on suspicion of disloyalty. Many
       were sent to prison camps in Siberia where they perished as a result of starvation and overwork. Some were
       executed immediately following brief trials. Some did not even receive trials. Among those imprisoned or
       killed were kulaks, former tsarist officials, intellectuals, Russian Orthodox priests, ethnic minorities, workers
       (labeled "saboteurs") in factories where accidents had occurred under the frantic pace of the Five-Year Plan,
       Red Army officers, government officials, prominent Soviet politicians, and supporters of Lenin from the
       earliest days of the Bolshevik Revolution. Historians disagree about how many Soviets died as a result of the
       political purges of the 1930s, but one million is a likely figure.

       Despite the clear problems with Stalinist rule, many people living in the Soviet Union, about 80 percent of
       whom were peasants, were still optimistic about the promised equality they believed communism could bring
       to their lives. The school of socialist realism that dominated art in the Soviet Union glorified peasants and
       industrial workers, depicting heroic, muscular steelworkers and smiling farmers wielding agricultural
       implements. Paintings and drawings of male and female workers in the 1930s were about patriotism as much
       as artistic expression.
       The reality behind the government's rhetoric about building a worker's paradise often fell short, however.
       Some improvements in the quality of life were made, literacy increased, electricity was brought to rural areas,
       and some people found opportunities for advancement not possible under tsarist rule. But not everyone
       shared in these changes. People whose innovations in the workplace increased production were rewarded with
       higher pay, recognition, and promotions, but the production goals party leaders laid out were often impossible
       to meet.
       Urban life grew more difficult during the 1930s. Peasants migrated to the cities to fill jobs in the new factories
       built to speed industrialization. Hours were long, pay was low, and housing, clothing, and food were in short
       supply. People crowded into small apartments, and because it was hard to find enough to eat in the state-run
       stores, they became more dependent on dining halls at work or school, where it was also easier for officials to
       monitor their conversations. At the same time, many Soviet citizens remained excited by their belief that the
       government would repay their efforts by providing for their needs better than the tsarist government ever
       would have done.
       Religion served to divide the Soviet government and the masses of Soviet people. Lenin had always seen it as
       dangerous and a competitor to socialism, so from the early days of the Soviet Union, religion was targeted by
       Communist leaders. Yet the history of Orthodox Christianity among the Russian people was long, and many
       found it difficult to abandon their faith and traditions despite government policies to discourage them.
       Soviet ideology demanded that women play new roles in society and the economy, so millions took industrial
       or agricultural jobs outside the home through the 1920s and 1930s. Their situation was fraught with
       discrimination and emotional turmoil, however. Women were rarely given positions of power in their
       workplaces (or within the Soviet political hierarchy), yet they were expected to produce just as much as men.
       Nor did the role of homemaker and mother go away. Women had to fulfill both kinds of roles, highlighting the
       disparity between female and male work.

12.3 The Great Depression

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain the causes of the Great Depression
  · Describe the immediate effects of the Great Depression on the economies of industrialized and
      developing nations

      Depression
  · Analyze the similarities and differences among fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Stalin's Soviet Union

The decade of the 1930s was marked by economic collapse around the world. The Great Depression gripped
numerous countries, causing widespread unemployment, immense poverty, and financial collapse. There
were no easy solutions for any government trying to combat the misery, and different countries adopted
different methods to alleviate the suffering of their people. The inability of capitalist countries to fully solve
their economic problems made ideologies such as communism more attractive. The Great Depression
developed out of a perfect storm of problems, and only the economic stimulation of the onset of World War II
brought the world closer to a return of prosperity.

Economic Collapse

When the economic collapse that came to be known as the Great Depression began in the United States in
1929, it ended the postwar boom and sent the entire world's economy reeling. No economic depression is
caused by one element alone. One contributing factor, however, was economic instability that the rising stock
market in the United States had camouflaged.

The stock market had set new highs seemingly every year of the 1920s. Some of the increase in stock prices
and the resulting valuations of companies' worth made perfect sense at the time. Companies were in fact
selling new products, and more of them. Electric ovens, washing machines, and radios were all highly
desirable new consumer items. However, by the late 1920s, the stock market was beset by a wave of pure
speculation, that is, the buying and selling of shares based solely on bets that stock prices would go even
higher, though unsupported by increased product sales. This guesswork drove stock prices up until they
became dangerously overvalued.

Stock prices began to drop sharply in the fall of 1929 and eventually crashed, bringing bank failures in their
wake as banks' investments in stocks lost value. The lack of banking regulations meant that if a bank went
bankrupt, those who had placed their money on deposit there lost all their savings. Ironically, when customers
began to withdraw their funds because they feared a bank would fail, they often inadvertently triggered that
failure, since banks hold only a small percentage of their money as cash in their vaults and invest the rest. Not
only did these failures hurt depositors in the banks; they left many communities without the means to obtain
loans for businesses or farms, which further compromised the economic health of an area.

Contributing to the Depression was the buying of consumer items on credit. When the Depression came,
households struggling with job losses put their remaining income into keeping a roof over their heads and food
on the table. Their defaults on their credit payments starved the stores, which then had to lay off more workers
to stay afloat. Meanwhile U.S. industry had grown significantly and was producing consumer goods at an
unprecedented rate. With consumers both at home and abroad unable to purchase, however, the twin
problems of overproduction and underconsumption ground the economy to a halt. Contributing to this
financial catastrophe was the unequal distribution of wealth. When the Depression began, the majority of
American families (80 percent) had no savings at all, so a job loss quickly led to homelessness and hunger
(Figure 12.11).

       The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was an example of the isolationist and protectionist policies the U.S.
       government followed in the 1920s. An increased tariff of nearly 40 percent had already been enacted in 1922.
       Smoot-Hawley raised tariff rates another 20 percent on more than twenty thousand kinds of imported goods,
       supposedly to protect American farmers and industries from foreign competition. These extreme rates caused
       other countries to institute their own retaliatory high tariff rates on U.S. goods. Therefore, the industrial might
       of the United States was stymied because its residents were unable to purchase goods due to job losses and
       lack of income, and its businesses were unable to recoup any of their monies by selling goods overseas. Smoot-
       Hawley was the highest tariff the U.S. government has ever enacted. It helped stifle world trade, which
       decreased 30 percent by the early 1930s.
       One of the key aspects of the Great Depression was the way it encumbered foreign trade around the globe.
       Worldwide gross domestic product (GDP)--the value of all the goods and services a country produces in one
       year--decreased by 15 percent between 1929 and 1932. With trade plummeting, many U.S. banks began
       recalling loans made to foreign businesses and countries, which caused crises in other places.

      Worldwide Woe

       When the Great Depression occurred, ordinary people bore the brunt of it. Workers lost their jobs and were
       unable to find new ones as businesses laid off employees. Without the means to pay rent or a mortgage,
       families were evicted and became homeless. Hunger was a significant problem, particularly in urban areas
       where there was little chance of having a garden or finding other available foodstuffs. Families coped however
       they could, sometimes traveling hundreds of miles in the hope that jobs would be available somewhere.
       Homeless camps and shantytowns sprang up, but life in such a place was precarious because city officials
       might force the residents to leave (Figure 12.12).

No part of the world was immune from the effects of the Great Depression. China was still relatively isolated in
the 1930s, but it did experience economic problems when prices for two of its major exports, soybeans and
silk, dropped. As an island nation, Japan had limited natural resources, and its militaristic new government
needed to alleviate scarcities and secure needed resources such as oil and rubber. With a growing population,
it also needed reliable food supplies.
All these factors coalesced into a Japanese plan to target certain areas throughout Asia for takeover, relying
heavily on the Imperial Navy. Japan moved into Manchuria in 1931, setting up the state of Manchukuo there
the following year. Seizing the region meant Japan would not have to pay for the items it wanted, such as rice,
important during a depression that had limited its exports and thus its income from trade. The move also
further established Japan as a preeminent power in the region.
Many regions of Africa produced agricultural crops--wheat, maize, and cotton, for example. As trade declined,
these sectors bore significant losses, and here too the poor suffered most. The colonial areas of Africa often
mirrored the economic troubles of their imperial countries. However, South Africa's gold mines produced
enough income to keep it more stable than other regions in Africa.
Many Latin American countries were unable to contend with the severe decrease in exports the Depression
494 12 · The Interwar Period

       brought. Some had financial systems heavily dependent on the export market and little in the way of an
       industrial sector to make up for the loss. Despite this weakness, however, Latin America weathered the Great
       Depression quite well. Most countries went off the gold standard--a monetary system in which the value of a
       currency is tied directly to the value of gold--in the early 1930s, but there was no widespread banking collapse
       as there was in the United States.

       European countries fought the Great Depression in different ways. Britain saw its exports drop considerably
       and in 1931 found it necessary to lower tariff rates within its empire to stimulate trade. Britain's economy was
       stagnant in the 1920s, so the dip of the Great Depression was not as painful as in the United States, though
       economic sectors such as mining experienced a greater decline than others. Britain did not adopt widespread
       work-relief programs, relying instead on more targeted support of specific industries. France implemented
       austerity programs, hoping to keep taxation levels low. It was only in the late 1930s that the French economy
       turned around, due to an increase in military equipment production.

       In the United States, new president Franklin D. Roosevelt unveiled a comprehensive reform plan in 1933. This
       New Deal was designed to restore faith in the banking system, create work-relief programs to put the
       unemployed to work, increase the bargaining and consumer power of industrial workers, and provide an
       overall enhanced quality of life. Overhauls to the banking system included more regulations on U.S. banks and
       regular audit controls. The creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933 meant that
       depositors could feel their money on deposit was safe. The United States also adopted programs that already
       existed elsewhere. For example, the Social Security Administration was created in 1935 to provide an old-age
       pension program for the country. Germany had such a program for several decades, and Britain had already
       enacted many programs as part of its welfare state that the United States was slow to adopt.

                                                                                 THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT

        The New Deal in a New Century

         Numerous programs enacted during the New Deal era still assist people in the United States today. Here are
         some examples:

           · The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was created in 1933 to insure depositor monies in banks.
               Originally it covered $5,000 per depositor, but it now covers $250,000 per depositor.

           · The Social Security program was begun in 1935 to oversee Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI),
               unemployment insurance, and aid to families.

           · The federal minimum wage was established in 1938 as an increase over the minimum wages in many
               industries, though some workers, such as domestic workers, were left out.

         Some of these programs are the subject of intense debate today. Projections show that Social Security may not
         be able to meet all its obligations in coming decades, which could lead to curtailing of benefits. The minimum
         wage originally reflected increased buying power for workers, rather than setting the bottom threshold of pay as
         it does now. Many states have mandated minimum wages above the federal government's requirement. Some
         argue that a higher minimum wage today will only increase the prices of products and services. Others contend
         that the increased buying power of workers with a higher minimum wage will stimulate the economy for all.

Communism and Authoritarianism

With economic depression dominating the world's nations, frustration built among people who felt their
governments were not actively combating the problems. In countries with capitalist systems, the gap between
the "haves" and "have-nots" was particularly stark in the 1930s. Many of the rich went on with their lives with
little change, while other people lost jobs and homes. The appeal of communist ideology grew among some
who felt abandoned by the capitalist system, and the prospect of economic equality was its most attractive
feature. In other countries, the economic crisis became an opportunity for increased authoritarianism.

The Communist Party experienced substantial growth in many Western democracies in the early 1930s as a
way through the problems of the Great Depression. The Communist International, or Comintern, actively
pursued the spread of communism worldwide during this decade, led by the Soviet Union. For some,
communism offered not simply economic parity but the prospect of racial parity as well. In the United States,
segregation laws and continued discrimination against African Americans caused some to turn to the
egalitarian society promised by communism as a new avenue to pursue. The Communist Party in the United
States also sought to overturn racist policies.

In Western Europe, the allure of communism grew as governments sought to handle the Depression. In France,
different cabinets were formed and repeatedly reorganized, and the disordered political realm threatened to
become a vacuum that far-right politicians could exploit. In 1936, a coalition of leftist groups known as the
Popular Front managed to win power in the government. They introduced progressive and pro-labor policies
such as forty-hour workweeks and minimum wages, both hallmarks of Western democratic responses to the
Great Depression. But as other countries had done, France found it could not resolve the Great Depression
through policy changes alone.

On the pretext that certain actions were necessary for the good of the populace in this time of crisis, some
leaders took advantage of the opportunity to impose authoritarian rule. This was particularly true in Italy,
Spain, and Germany, which all embraced fascism in the 1930s. Fascism was a political movement focused on
transforming citizens into committed nationalists striving for unity and racial purity, to remedy a perceived
national decline. To forge a unified nation, fascists espoused using violence, abandoning democratic norms
and the rule of law to eliminate enemies real or imagined, and employing totalitarianism, the total control by
the government of all aspects of a person's life. The interwar period and the problems of the 1920s gave rise to
disillusionment with democratic and parliamentary governments worldwide.

In Italy, Benito Mussolini was firmly in power by the 1930s. He had begun his rise to national prominence in
1919, partly by denouncing the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which many Italians believed had cheated
their country of land it was owed as a reward for fighting on the Allied side. Like Hitler, Mussolini used fear and
terror to gain political power and used a band of supporters dubbed the Blackshirts to threaten his opponents
with physical violence. In 1924 his Fascist Party won a majority in parliament, and Mussolini, referring to
himself as Il Duce ("the leader"), became the head of Italy. He then outlawed future elections. The fascists in
Italy had wanted to focus on industrial development in the 1920s and 1930s, which had lagged, especially in
the southern half of the country. In the 1930s, in a bid to prop up the industrial sector, Mussolini took over
many industrial entities as banks failed across the country. The Italian government also dismantled labor
unions.

In Spain, a military dictatorship was instituted in 1924. After it ended in 1930, a republic was established that
quickly sought to modernize the nation. It tried to eliminate the Catholic Church's dominant role in society and
politics and attempted other changes such as land redistribution and the institution of voting rights for women
and more liberal divorce laws. However, a serious military coup erupted in 1936. Fascists calling themselves
496 12 · The Interwar Period

       Nationalists had co-opted much of the Spanish military and drawn the support of right-wing conservative
       authoritarians.
       The popular general Francisco Franco, former head of Spain's military academy, was opposed to Republican
       ideologies. Fighting against modernity, the radicalism of the Republicans, and the specter of communism,
       Franco was able to call upon fellow fascists Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini for support. Though it is
       debatable how militarily effective the German and Italian bombing of civilian targets like Madrid and Guernica
       was, it did cause people to shudder at the increased horror of warfare (Figure 12.13). British, French, and other
       European powers pursued a policy of nonintervention, however, believing it prudent given Japanese
       expansion in Asia and elsewhere and the U.S. policy of neutrality. The League of Nations also failed to take
       action.

       FIGURE 12.13 Guernica. This outdoor mural in Guernica, Spain, is based on Pablo Picasso's famous depiction of
       the horrors of aerial bombings of the town in his 1937 painting Guernica. The mural's title calls for Picasso's painting
       to be returned to the town from its current home in a Madrid museum. (credit: "Mural del "Guernica" de Picasso" by

       Lasting from 1936 to 1939, the Spanish Civil War resulted in as many as 500,000 casualties. When the gunfire
       ceased, Franco created his fascist regime. Throughout the 1930s, Spanish fascists claimed that Catholic Spain
       was threatened by a Jewish-Bolshevik-Masonic conspiracy against property and social order, which justified
       the liquidation of hundreds of thousands of Republicans and opponents of Franco. Franco melded fascism with
       all other political parties to create a single political movement. The Catholic Church, the army, and the
       bureaucracy all continued to exercise a degree of independence not permitted in other countries that
       developed forms of fascism. As in Italy, Spanish women were recruited to serve through propaganda work and
       the rearing of patriotic children. Franco's brand of fascism and his revulsion of popular democracy, liberal
       ideals, secularism, feminism, and communism were similar to those of Mussolini and Hitler.
       In Germany, the Depression followed a decade of economic uncertainty and massive inflation, conditions that
       offered the National Socialist Party (Nazi Party) under Adolf Hitler an opportunity to consolidate power. The

rise of fascism in Germany was also the result of Germany's devastating military loss in World War I. Having
been assured of victory, the German population took the news of the armistice as a profound shock. The
country's political parties had forced the kaiser to abdicate in favor of a new constitutional government, the
Weimar Republic. Given the timing of these events, many Germans therefore believed civilian politicians were
responsible for their defeat in the war. In 1919, monarchists, socialists, and communists began to disrupt
politics and violently contest for control of the streets in Berlin and elsewhere.

The Nazis received a substantial boost from their criticism of the Weimar Republic's handling of the
hyperinflation of the 1920s and its response to the onset of the Depression. The Nazis adopted nineteenth-
century theories of the hierarchy of races that proclaimed the Germanic Nordic or Aryan races to be master
humans. In garnering political support, whether through acceptance or intimidation, the German fascist
militias branded journalists as liars, attacked political opponents and Jewish people, and labeled them filthy,
unclean, vermin, or subhuman. The intimidating violence and anti-Semitism of fascists became central to the
political life of the nation after World War I.

Hitler got a second chance to capitalize on the perceived victimization of Germany as the Great Depression put
as many as four million Germans out of work. Public dissatisfaction with the economic turmoil enabled the
Nazis to increase their representation in the Reichstag (the national legislature). Taking advantage of a history
of anti-Semitism in Europe (most notably in Austria), Hitler and the Nazis also claimed that Jewish bankers
and business owners had caused the Great Depression and promised they would no longer be allowed to create
such havoc. Frustrated German voters readily accepted their arguments. The Nazis were becoming the largest
party in the legislature. President Paul von Hindenburg was therefore pressured to appoint Hitler chancellor in
January 1933.

Hitler accumulated power quickly. Just a month after he became chancellor, an arsonist set the German
Reichstag building in Berlin ablaze. In keeping with Nazi opposition to communism, the crime was falsely
blamed on a Dutch communist and communist instigators in general. The climate of crisis convinced
conservative members of parliament to temporarily grant Hitler emergency powers through the Enabling Act
passed in March 1933. Hitler was then able to rule essentially without the involvement of parliament or any
constitutional limitations. In 1934, he declared himself führer ("leader"), fusing the offices of president and
chancellor into one all-powerful role.

Aiding Hitler were some who had been with him since the Beer Hall Putsch. Hermann Göring, a former World
War I fighter ace, became the second most powerful Nazi leader, in charge of organizing the national economy
and commanding the German air force, the Luftwaffe. Heinrich Himmler transformed the paramilitary militia,
the Schutzstaffel (SS), from a small force of 290 to over a million strong and was responsible for promoting
German culture and institutions and overseeing the enforcement of Nazi racial policies.

The various German security and secret police agencies were combined to create the Gestapo, which became
the main dispatcher of violence and enforcer of order. Propaganda increasingly utilized the evolving medium
of mass communications. A powerful example is the work of the German film director Leni Riefenstahl. Her
film of the 1934 Nazi rally in Nuremburg, entitled Triumph of the Will, is still considered an important step in
the development of cinematic technique and the documentary form.

The educational system was reorganized to emphasize the physical development of youth and their thorough
indoctrination into Nazi ideology regarding race and racial history. Eventually all teachers were required to
join the Nazi Teacher's Alliance and use prescribed Nazi textbooks in their teaching. Outside the classroom,
German children were organized into tiered levels of youth organizations, culminating in the Hitler Youth for
498 12 · The Interwar Period

       boys and the League of German Girls. For boys, the focus was on militaristic training, while girls were taught
       racial hygiene (the perceived need to bear children with certain traits) and the domestic skills to be good
       housewives and mothers.

       The Nazis quickly moved to put their promises into action. Laws were passed limiting job opportunities and
       social activities for Jewish people, and restrictions only grew harsher as the decade wore on. Hitler banned all
       political parties other than the Nazis, making Germany a one-party state. All newspapers and media were Nazi
       controlled, and radios were widely distributed for free to get the Nazi messages to the masses.

       The Nazis assured the electorate that they were the only ones who could solve Germany's economic problems
       and promised to restore its international prestige. Hitler set out to provide jobs to all who needed them with a
       massive infrastructure program that built new highways and created the Autobahn system. Huge stadiums
       were constructed for sports events (such as the 1936 Berlin Olympics) and Nazi political rallies. New housing
       was built, as well as planes, ships, tanks, and weaponry. The work week was expanded to sixty hours; workers
       could not strike or even ask for raises, but unemployment declined.

       Those not working in an industrial capacity could find a place in the ever-expanding Germany military.
       Ignoring the limits imposed by the Versailles Treaty, Hitler swelled the German Army to nearly a million
       soldiers, calling the need to provide employment an emergency that must be met. While the world's powers
       might not have known the full extent of the re-arming underway in Germany, by 1935 they were certainly
       aware it was happening. If there were an opportunity to stop Hitler's plans, it was now, before Germany
       amassed the weapons it would need for the next war. However, there was little international will for such
       intervention. It could very well mean military engagement, and in the throes of the Depression, none of the
       former Allied nations were interested. Nor was there any popular support in these nations for such actions.

       Through employment programs and deficit spending (spending based on borrowing money rather than on
       raising money through taxation), the economic problems in Germany did begin to turn around under Hitler's
       government. The unemployment rate dropped from a high of approximately 30 percent to about 10 percent.
       Many around the world applauded Hitler's handling of the Great Depression. For those on the right side of the
       Nazis, life could be acceptable if not pleasant, with employment, local and national events and festivals, plenty
       of vigorous outdoor physical activity, and constant reminders of being part of a chosen people with a special
       purpose led by a messianic leader. Life for enemies of the regime could be full of deprivation and terror.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:
         · Describe the breakup of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I
         · Explain the division of Germany's colonies among the Allied Powers
         · Describe resistance to colonization in Africa and Asia

       It was not just Europe that underwent major changes in the interwar years. The Ottoman Empire ceased to
       exist, and the region it had dominated now became a multitude of various powers, of which Turkey retained
       the largest Ottoman legacy. The colonies Germany had held in Asia and Africa were distributed among the
       victorious countries and came under new governments. The rhetoric of self-determination of nations was not
       applied equally around the world, but its focus on nationalist ideologies filtered through many societies,
       spurring the growth of nationalist movements around the globe.

      To the Victors Go the Spoils

       Already beset by internal problems and increasing difficulty controlling its holdings throughout Arabia and the
       Middle East, the Ottoman Empire had signed the Armistice of Mudros on October 30, 1918, bringing its
       participation in World War I to an end. During the war, a number of proposals for dismembering the empire
       had been considered. In 1919, Allied forces seized areas in the former Ottoman Empire, Greece captured

Western Anatolia, and other Allied forces moved into Istanbul. The Turkish National Movement that resisted
these occupations was led by Mustafa Kemal, later renamed Atatürk ("father of the Turks") and already a
Turkish hero for his performance at the Battle of Gallipoli.
The 1920 Treaty of Sèvres partitioned the empire, leaving the Ottomans with control over only Istanbul and
Thrace. The Turks led by Mustafa Kemal won battles on several fronts, however, and forced a renegotiation of
the treaty. The Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 provided for an independent Turkey to succeed the Ottoman
government. It also established League of Nations mandates in the Middle East. Under the mandate system,
the administration of territories once controlled by the Ottomans was transferred to France or Britain, which
were expected to govern these regions until some unspecified point in the future when the people there were
deemed ready to govern themselves. Among the mandated areas were modern Iraq, Israel, Syria, Jordan,
Lebanon, and Palestine (Figure 12.14).

Arabia was not easily controlled by the European powers. Warfare continued to break out over access to sites
such as Mecca and Medina, both holy places in the Islamic faith. By the mid-1920s, the Saud family had taken
control of areas of the Nejd (the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula) and the Hejaz (the peninsula's western region),
and soon after they consolidated that control by forming a new nation, Saudi Arabia, which came into being in
1932.
During the war, Britain and France had each begun to outline spheres of influence for themselves in the
defunct Ottoman Empire. A French mandate covered Syria and Lebanon, and a British mandate the area of
Iraq, Palestine, and the Transjordan (the East Bank). Despite their talk of self-determination, Europe's
surviving imperial powers clearly planned no deviation from the traditional course of empires in this region.
Neither Britain nor France consulted the people who lived in the mandate areas about the decisions their
governments would be making for them.
It soon became clear that the mandate system would not ensure full European control. For example, the British
500 12 · The Interwar Period

       mandate over Mesopotamia, renamed Iraq, came under pressure from nationalists throughout the 1920s and
       1930s. King Faisal (to whom the British had promised the rule of Syria) accepted being ruler of Iraq, but Britain
       controlled most of the government. The next king of Iraq had to accept similar conditions, but Iraqi
       nationalists became increasingly vocal about their frustration with the British presence.

       The British complicated matters in another part of their mandate with the Balfour Declaration. This
       statement, one of many conflicting promises Britain made to various groups during the war, was issued by
       British foreign secretary Alfred Balfour in 1917. Balfour wrote that Britain supported a "national home" for
       Jewish people in Palestine. Ever since the nineteenth century, many European Jews had worked through
       Zionist organizations to encourage the return of Jews to their ancestral homeland in the Middle East. The
       Balfour Declaration marked the accomplishment of the goal that pro-Zionist groups had worked toward for
       years. Palestine was a British mandate after the war but mainly inhabited by Arab peoples; the move to
       introduce a substantial number of Jewish residents (with government support) promised to cause problems,
       and in fact it touched off religious and property disagreements that continue to this day.

       The British began by summarily making an area of Palestine available to Jewish immigrants and, between
       1922 and 1935, the Jewish population as a percentage of the total population increased threefold, from 9
       percent to almost 27 percent. The Palestinians immediately complained of being treated as second-class
       citizens in their own land and about Britain's failed promise to grant Arabs independence. Riots and protests
       became so common that Britain ultimately restricted immigration to Palestine, cutting off a route of escape for
       Jewish people fleeing the anti-Semitic policies of the Nazis.

                                                                                                          DUELING VOICES

        A Jewish Homeland in Palestine

         The subject of a Jewish homeland in Palestine was quite controversial. Here are two voices on opposite sides of
         the issue. First is an excerpt from Theodor Herzl's pamphlet advocating a Jewish homeland. (A diaspora is the
         scattering of a population; a gestor is someone who intervenes.) The second excerpt is from a letter written by a
         Jewish politician who opposed Britain's support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

         "Negotiorum Gestio"

               The Jewish people are at present prevented by the Diaspora from conducting their political affairs
               themselves. Besides, they are in a condition of more or less severe distress in many parts of the world.
               They need, above all things a gestor. This gestor cannot, of course, be a single individual. Such a one
               would either make himself ridiculous, or--seeing that he would appear to be working for his own
               interests--contemptible.

               The gestor of the Jews must therefore be a body corporate.

               And that is the Society of Jews.

         "Benefits of the Emigration of the Jews"

               The States would have a further advantage in the enormous increase of their export trade; for, since the
               emigrant Jews "over there" would depend for a long time to come on European productions, they would
               necessarily have to import them. The local groups would keep up a just balance, and the customary
               needs would have to be supplied for a long time at the accustomed places.

               Another, and perhaps one of the greatest advantages, would be the ensuing social relief. Social
               dissatisfaction would be appeased during the twenty or more years which the emigration of the Jews
               would occupy, and would in any case be set at rest during the whole transition period.

        I lay down with emphasis four principles:

        1. I assert that there is not a Jewish nation. [. . .] It is no more true to say that a Jewish Englishman and
        a Jewish Moor are of the same nation than it is to say that a Christian Englishman and a Christian
        Frenchman are of the same nation. [. . .

        2. When the Jews are told that Palestine is their national home, every country will immediately desire to
        get rid of its Jewish citizens, and you will find a population in Palestine driving out its present
        inhabitants, taking all the best in the country, drawn from all quarters of the globe, speaking every
        language on the face of the earth, and incapable of communicating with one another except by means of
        an interpreter. [. . .

        3. I claim that the lives that British Jews have led, that the aims that they have had before them, that
        the part that they have played in our public life and our public institutions, have entitled them to be
        regarded, not as British Jews, but as Jewish Britons. [. . .

        4. I deny that Palestine is to-day associated with the Jews or properly to be regarded as a fit place for
        them to live in. [. . .] I would not deny to Jews in Palestine equal rights to colonisation with those who
        profess other religions, but a religious test of citizenship seems to me to be the only admitted by those
        who take a bigoted and narrow view of one particular epoch of the history of Palestine, and claim for the
        Jews a position to which they are not entitled.

The Asian and African holdings of the German Empire were also divided among the victors. Some of
Germany's Asian lands had been relinquished early in the war, such as Samoa, which New Zealand formally
took over after the war. Australia took German New Guinea and Nauru. The Japanese Empire gained German-
held islands north of the equator, such as the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands (Figure 12.15).
502 12 · The Interwar Period

       In Africa, Germany had held Kamerun (including modern Cameroon as well as areas of Chad, Gabon, Nigeria,
       and the Congo), German East Africa (Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania), Togoland (Togo and part of Ghana), and
       German Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia). These became mandates after the war. Both Britain and
       France gained land in Togo and Cameroon, South Africa took Southwest Africa, and the Belgians received land
       in Burundi and Rwanda. No one consulted the African peoples in making these divisions, and in fact the
       borders cut through ethnic groups, leaving some groups divided between two governments. Self-
       determination of nations was clearly not at work in Africa, and increasingly louder voices questioned whether
       Europe had any real moral authority over African colonies.

      The Fight for Self-Determination in Africa

       Most Africans were not considered citizens of the empires of which they were part. Imperial powers exploited
       the colonies for their mineral wealth and other resources. They did little to better the lives of Africans, and the
       rhetoric of "civilizing" the continent was based on ingrained assumptions of White superiority. However,
       participation in World War I changed things for many Africans. More than one million Africans had fought in
       the war. The sense that their contribution should be rewarded with new political power was one result. Another
       was their exposure to international issues and the recognition that the principle of self-determination applied
       directly to themselves.
       A number of groups had begun to argue for more African involvement in colonial governments beginning in
       the late 1800s. In 1918, the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA) was formed to pressure the
       British government to turn legislative work over to elected assemblies in its West African colonies. This
       initiative marked a political awakening in the four British colonies of West Africa. The NCBWA sought to have
       them work as a cohesive political unit. The war itself had caused many European officials to depart Africa,
       turning a number of services over to Africans to administer and thus providing new roles for them to play in

the running of their countries. Many imperial powers also squeezed their African colonies to produce more for
the war effort but failed to pay fair prices for these items. This clear exploitation, along with a growing sense of
their power, led many Africans to embrace nationalist movements after the war.
With the Great Depression came increasing pressure to "do more" with African colonies, as a way for imperial
countries to deal with their economic problems. Those that could cultivate greater economic development in
the colonies would benefit from increased resources and develop a colonial population with greater buying
power for its own goods. Such development was a slow process in the 1930s, however (Figure 12.16). The
British government enacted a Colonial Development Act at the end of the 1920s that funneled small amounts
of money into its African colonies. But larger investments did not flow into Africa until after World War II.

FIGURE 12.16 Colonial Africa. This map shows European nations' colonial holdings in Africa during the 1920s and
1930s. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
A growing Pan-African movement also developed in the early twentieth century, with the goal of uniting
African peoples to achieve greater independence. The first Pan-African Congress met in 1918 in Paris,
organized by African American activist W. E. B. Du Bois. Its goal was to influence the Paris Peace Conference to
support self-determination for the African colonies. Its impact was minimal, but it did contribute to the ideas
of African nationalism that were growing at the time.
Another influence on the growth of African nationalism was the work of Marcus Garvey. Garvey was born in
Jamaica and lived in the United States for many years. He founded the Universal Negro Improvement
Association, which hoped to unite all people of African descent into one body with one government. Garvey's
504 12 · The Interwar Period

       work was focused on specific plans for a migration of African Americans from North America to the West
       African country of Liberia. These "Back to Africa" plans fell apart, however. Sufficient funds did not exist to
       make the migration possible. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the
       largest African American civil rights organization in the United States, also refused to endorse Garvey's ideas,
       and the migration never materialized.

       One way people in Africa expressed their independence of thought was by developing an African-based church
       system. Christianity in Africa had been inextricably tied to the missionary model, in which Europeans came to
       Africa and established church missions to spread the Christian faith. The independent African churches that
       began emerging in the late 1800s were formed in places like Ethiopia and Nigeria with the idea that Africans
       should be in charge of them rather than Europeans, whose churches were often seen as simply an extension of
       colonialism. The independence that African-led churches advocated in religious matters soon evolved into
       support for independence in political matters as well.

      An Independent India

       The significant role their troops in the British Army had played in World War I offered Indians some hope that
       Britain might now extend them more rights than before. Indians were also anxious to have the British
       government's restrictive wartime measures lifted. However, it soon became clear that Britain had no plans for
       change. So, as in many other countries, in India a growing nationalist movement now advocated independence
       from colonial rule. The clash between Indian Nationalists and British rulers began almost immediately after
       the end of World War I.

       In early April 1919, Indians began to gather in a walled square in Amritsar, a city in Punjab that was sacred to
       the Sikh population. They were protesting the passage of the Rowlatt Act, which allowed Indians suspected of
       engaging in revolutionary activities to be detained for two years without trial. At times the protests turned
       violent. Then, on April 13, the British Indian Army opened fire on the protestors, who had little chance of
       escape from the closed-in space. Hundreds were killed and more than a thousand wounded. The British
       commander of the unit ultimately resigned after an investigation. The massacre prompted the British
       government to make some legislative changes in India regarding who was eligible to vote and how many Indian
       representatives could sit in the national assembly. However, this small concession did not quell the continued
       criticism from Indian nationalists, who urged independence and self-rule. The Indian National Congress
       argued that India should be ruled by Indians. Its members proposed continued nonviolent disobedience and
       boycotts against British goods, along with a refusal to pay certain taxes.

       In this chaotic and emotional situation, a lawyer named Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi began to take center
       stage. Gandhi adopted and advocated the practice of civil disobedience and nonviolence, wore traditional
       modes of dress, and renounced material possessions. In the 1920s, the movement for self-rule became a
       grassroots operation preaching civil disobedience to people throughout India. Gandhi became head of the
       Indian National Congress in 1921, and it soon became the party of the masses.

       Many British rules flew in the face of Indian traditions, such as those regarding the collection of salt, a common
       element of the Indian diet. Under the colonial system, Indians could not gather or sell salt; instead, they had to
       purchase it from the British and pay a heavy tax. On March 12, 1930, Gandhi began a protest known as the Salt
       March, in which he led his supporters on a two-hundred-mile, twenty-four-day march to the Arabian Sea to
       collect salt from the seawater. Despite British efforts to obscure the salt deposits at the beaches, Gandhi and
       his followers did collect salt, in violation of British law (Figure 12.17Figure B12_04_GandhiSalt). He and

approximately sixty thousand others were arrested for these acts of civil disobedience. In numerous locations
over the next several weeks, other nationalists similarly began collecting salt at coastlines in defiance of the
law. Gandhi was not released from jail until the following year and agreed to suspend the mass act of civil
disobedience.

While the British were not inclined to embrace India's independence movement, within a few years they did
begin to relent on the question of self-rule. While retaining control of the military and foreign policy functions,
they turned other government operations over to Indians via the Government of India Act in 1935. This was an
important step toward more autonomy for India. Muslim representation in India remained an issue, however.
For example, the Indian National Congress was dominated by the Hindu majority, but rather than recognizing
that body as representing all those living in India, the British recognized the separate Muslim League as the
representatives of the Muslim population. The Indian National Congress had achieved a measure of its agenda
in favor of self-rule, but India was still clearly under British control.

War is often a catalyst for societal change, and this was certainly true of World War I. Women had long fought
for increased political rights, and the next decade saw the franchise for women expand in several countries.
Women also adopted freer styles of dress and defied traditional gender roles by working outside the home and
dancing and drinking in public. Likewise, the status of African Americans in the United States drew more
506 12 · The Interwar Period

       attention as civil rights leaders emphasized the contributions of African American veterans to showcase the
       need for fair treatment, and writers and musicians used their work to give voice to the Black experience and to
       honor their heritage. Many countries embarked on efforts to incorporate more democratic principles. It was
       not an easy process, and many nations continued to face significant challenges in achieving their goals. The
       1920s and 1930s also witnessed the growth of new forms of popular culture--the radio and movies--that
       appealed to the masses.

      The Expansion of Democracy

       When the war ended, the suffrage movement had been going on for several decades in the United States and
       Britain. Those who protested in support of women's right to vote, called a suffragist, had sometimes taken
       radical action to highlight their cause, such as Emily Davison who threw herself in front of the King of
       England's horse at a derby in 1913 and was killed. Suffragist leaders in both countries were often arrested, and
       many went on hunger strikes while in jail, enduring forced feedings to draw more attention to the cause.

       Women's support of the war and their physical work in war industries and the medical corps led politicians to
       look more favorably on the idea of women voting. Women won the right to vote in the United States in 1920,
       though it was couched as a reward for their war service. Britain adopted a phase-in approach. First, women
       over thirty who met a property qualification were given the right to vote in 1918. Then in 1928, the vote was
       extended to women twenty-one and older. The property qualifications for men were abolished in 1918, and all
       men twenty-one and older were allowed to vote. For those in the military, the age limit was lowered to
       nineteen.

       Other countries joined the trend. German women won the right to vote in 1918. The new country of Poland
       extended the vote to women immediately. Other countries still imposed limitations, such as property
       qualifications or the need to be a war widow in order to vote. France and Italy lagged behind; women could not
       vote in either country until 1945. In Japan, female activist groups argued for a role in politics throughout the
       1920s and 1930s. Japanese law changed to allow women to attend political rallies, but women did not receive
       the right to vote until after World War II. Rising feminism in China linked to the May Fourth Movement helped
       women obtain individual property rights under the law.

       Individual female voices were also heard. Huda Sha'arawi founded the Egyptian Feminist Union in 1923 and
       stopped wearing her veil and headscarf. She had already been engaged in providing education for girls and
       was active in the Egyptian independence movement. She became vice president of the International Women's
       Union in the 1930s. Zaynab al-Ghazali founded the Muslim Women's Society in Europe in 1936. Al-Ghazali
       contended that women could play a role in politics outside the home while still being adherents to Islam.

       rights. More than eleven thousand Native Americans served in the military during the war, and many hoped
       this volunteer service would provide them U.S. citizenship. Native Americans were in fact granted citizenship
       in 1924. Another group hoping for change were African Americans. Long subject to discriminatory laws and
       racial segregation, African Americans felt World War I offered them an opportunity to prove themselves loyal
       citizens. The United States operated a segregated military, and all-Black service member units serving
       overseas had a unique chance to see how other places treated them. Those in France, in particular, were struck
       by the freedom of movement and acceptance they found there. They were allowed in combat, while U.S. units
       kept them largely in support roles. There was genuine optimism that life in the United States would be

different after the war.

However, after 1918, many found that little had changed. Discriminatory laws remained in place, and poor
treatment even of veterans was commonplace. What was new was the prospect of mobility. In 1917, the lure of
good-paying industrial jobs producing items for the war began drawing African American workers and
families north. This movement continued after the war as factories began to pump out consumer products. By
1920, more than a million African Americans had left the south in a Great Migration, which continued through
the next decades as well.

                                                                                           IN THEIR OWN WORDS

 Marcus Garvey on Race in the United States

  Marcus Garvey was a Jamaican-born activist who spoke and wrote about Pan-Africanism and the need to
  address racial issues worldwide. This is an excerpt from his 1923 speech, "A Last Word Before Incarceration." As
  you read, notice his characterization of African Americans.

        Those of you who have been observing events for the last four or five weeks with keen eyes and keen
        perceptions will come to no other conclusion than this--that through the effort to strangle the Universal
        Negro Improvement Association--through the effort to silence Marcus Garvey--there is a mad desire,
        there is a great plan to permanently lay the Negro low in this civilization and in future civilizations. But
        the world is sadly mistaken. No longer can the Negro be laid low; in laying the Negro low you but bring
        down the pillars of creation, because 400,000,000 Negroes are determined to [be] a man, to take a
        place in the world and to hold that place. The world is sadly mistaken and rudely shocked at the same
        time. They thought that the new Negro would bend; they thought that the new Negro was only bluffing
        and would exhibit the characteristic of the old Negro when pushed to the corner or pushed to the wall. If
        you want to see the new Negro fight, force him to the wall, and the nearer he approaches the wall the
        more he fights, and when he gets to the wall he is even more desperate.

        --Marcus Garvey, "A Last Word Before Incarceration"

    · According to Garvey, how have African Americans changed?
    · In what ways are African Americans not what Whites in the United States expect them to be?

Racism was not absent in the North. The summer of 1919 was marked by race riots in many cities, and in the
1920s the Ku Klux Klan, a White supremacist group formed after the Civil War, spread throughout the nation.
Nevertheless, northern racism seemed mild compared to what African Americans' southern experience had
been, and greater opportunities for jobs and education continued to draw people to the cities of the North and
Midwest. New livelihoods and membership in civil rights groups such as the NAACP drew many into the New
Negro movement in the 1920s. This drive "promoted a renewed sense of racial pride, cultural self-expression,
economic independence, and progressive politics." One of the movement's first tasks was to agitate for a
federal anti-lynching law. Lynching had become a vigilante crime whose targets were overwhelmingly African
American. Anti-lynching activists knew that White men who murdered African Americans would not be
punished by southern state courts. By making lynching a crime that would be tried in a federal court, however,
they hoped to achieve greater justice. An anti-lynching bill came up for a vote in Congress in 1922 but was
rejected, and again in 1935. White southern politicians resisted any federal intrusion, even in humanitarian
causes.

Racial pride also influenced the artists of the Harlem Renaissance, an outpouring of African American
literature, art, and music named for a neighborhood in New York City in which many African American
participants in the Great Migration settled. The Harlem Renaissance, which was in full bloom in the 1920s,
brought into the mainstream the work of many African American writers, such as poet Langston Hughes and
508 12 · The Interwar Period

       Zora Neale Hurston, who wrote about the racial struggles of twentieth-century African Americans in her
       novels, short stories, and plays. The music of African American communities in Harlem and elsewhere
       featured the distinctive blues and jazz styles, which both became international genres and provided the
       soundtrack for the dynamic changes of the decade following World War I.

       Museum of American History and features both words and music.

       The Harlem Renaissance, especially the works of Jamaican-born Claude McKay, in turn inspired the Négritude
       movement, a literary movement that emerged in French-speaking parts of Africa and the Americas. The
       movement was founded by Léopold Sédar Senghor, a Senegalese poet and university professor. Négritude, a
       term coined by Aimé Césaire, a poet and playwright from the Caribbean island of Martinique (at that time a
       French colony), called upon Blacks to reject European culture and values in favor of African ones.

      Democratic Yearnings

       The dismantling of empires at the end of the war was clearly a boon for democracy, but it was not always easy
       for fledgling countries to adopt new political systems. The tense situation in Ireland of the 1920s was just one
       example.

       In 1922, the Irish Free State was created through the Anglo-Irish Treaty. This 1921 pact ended the Irish War of
       Independence that had begun in 1918 when the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish Nationalist Party
       fought British rule. Groups such as Sinn Féin ("We Ourselves"), organized in 1905 to fight for an independent
       Ireland, were often associated with the IRA and sometimes adopted more violent measures than the more
       moderate Irish Nationalist Party. They had the same goal but very different methods.

       The Anglo-Irish Treaty initiated a vote on the future of Ireland. The six northern counties, largely Protestant,
       voted to remain part of the United Kingdom, but the other twenty-six formed the Irish Free State and received
       dominion status in the British Empire. As a dominion, the Irish Free State could make and enforce its own
       laws, make treaties, appoint ambassadors, and send its own representatives to international organizations. A
       sizable number of Catholics remained in the northern counties, however, which ultimately led to long-term
       violence. And while the new arrangement was a significant improvement over the past, it did not fully satisfy
       many Irish republicans, who wanted complete independence for Ireland. Sinn Féin itself was split; some
       members wanted greater sovereignty for Ireland and for the entire island to be rid of the British presence. A
       brief civil war broke out between the IRA and the Free State, but the Free State emerged victorious. In 1937, it
       was reorganized under a new government headed by Éamon de Valera, an anti-treaty leader, and took the
       name "Ireland."

       Japan also took steps toward becoming more democratic for a brief period after World War I. In 1912, a new
       emperor, Taisho, had ushered in a period of liberalism with democratic and progressive politics. For example,
       labor strikes, such as the rice riots in 1918 in which tens of thousands of people protested the government's
       failure to pay market prices for rice, became increasingly common as workers fought for better wages and
       working conditions. Women became active in labor unions and politics for the first time, and the number of
       unions more than tripled in the 1910s. During this period, Japan was viewed as a triumph of constitutional
       government.

       However, the progressive period did not last long. In 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake, measuring 7.8 on the
       Richter scale, destroyed two major cities, Yokohama and Tokyo. Nearly 150,000 people died in the earthquake
       and the resulting fires and tsunamis (Figure 12.18). Rumors quickly spread that Koreans in the area were
       taking advantage of the chaos, were plotting political insurrection, and had already poisoned wells to
       contaminate the drinking water. Several thousand Koreans were targeted and killed in response. The

devastation also provided an opportunity for the conservative and pro-military forces in the Japanese
government to exercise increased control over society. Martial law was declared, and the repression of radicals
was stepped up. Political activists who questioned government policies disappeared.

When the emperor died in 1926, his son Hirohito ascended to power, and the Shöwa period began. Japan's
political system now became increasingly dominated by the military, and the emperor's role was shrouded in
secrecy and worship. The country's military leaders believed more aggressive actions were needed for Japan
to control the Pacific as they wanted to.
Operating with a heightened sense of duty and honor, Japan's military establishment and certain factions of its
army became increasingly contemptuous of civilian leaders. By the late 1920s, they saw these politicians as
incapable of solving domestic issues or addressing challenges from China and the Soviet Union. Some
disaffected Japanese field commanders in China and the Japanese colony of Korea began to engage in direct
actions, forming criminal conspiracies and cover-ups to secure the future of Japan as they saw it, even as they
served the emperor.
Nationalistic secret societies such as the Cherry Blossom Association and the Blood-Pledge Corps blossomed
within the Japanese armed forces, particularly in the prestigious Kwantung Army stationed in Korea. The
Japanese chafed at perceived unequal treatment in world affairs, such as at the Washington Naval Conference.
Anxiety rose about the growth of Chinese nationalism under Chiang Kai-shek and the nationalist Guomindang
government, and what it might mean for Japanese interests in China.
Manchuria, which bordered Korea, was a semiautonomous province of China. In 1931, to precipitate a political
crisis that would enable Japan to intervene, hyper-patriots in the Japanese army conspired to blow up a
portion of the South Manchurian Railway near the Manchurian city of Mukden (Shenyang) and blamed the
incident on Chinese nationalists. The local Japanese commander took the opportunity to occupy Mukden, and
510 12 · The Interwar Period

       field commanders in Korea dispatched reinforcements without any orders from Tokyo to do so. Japanese
       public opinion supported the army's action.
       As the Japanese army fanned out in Manchuria, the Kwantung Army approached the former Chinese Emperor,
       Pu Yi, who had been living in the Japanese concession (an area of the city granted to Japan) in Tianjin since
       1925 (Figure 12.19). The Japanese convinced Pu Yi they had acted in the interests of the Manchurian people to
       preserve law and order in his homeland. They then smuggled him back to Manchuria, and by March 1932, he
       had been persuaded to accept the position of "chief executive" of the newly born state of Manchukuo,
       otherwise known as Manchuria. As the Chinese government called for the League of Nations to intervene and
       pledged to accept its rulings, a British diplomat in Japan warned of "an atmosphere of gun-grease" in Japan.

       FIGURE 12.19 The Last Emperor. This photograph shows Pu Yi, China's last emperor and Manchukuo's first and
       only "chief executive," in the 1930s or 1940s. (credit: "Pu Yi, Qing dynasty, China, Last emperor" by Unknown/

       In the fall of 1931, the League established the Lytton Commission to look into the situation. In January 1932,
       U.S. secretary of state Henry Stimson announced the Stimson Doctrine, which refused to recognize
       Manchukuo as an independent state.
       Chinese public opinion was aroused, and in January 1932, clashes erupted between Japanese marines and
       Chinese troops in the outskirts of Shanghai. In Manchuria, the Lytton Commission found that the Guomindang
       government of China "was no longer exercising any political or administrative `authority in any part of
       Manchuria.'" Japan formally recognized the establishment of Manchukuo, its client state (a subordinate and
       dependent area), as a theoretically free, completely sovereign, and independent nation (Figure 12.20). The
       Lytton Report, published in October 1932, found fault on both sides but did not recommend full autonomy for
       Manchukuo. Japan responded by withdrawing from the League in March 1933. Japan ran the government in
       Manchukuo as a puppet state, controlling the native Chinese officials. Pu Yi continued as "head" of the
       government there until the end of the war, after which China took back control.

The Japanese secret societies within the military were animated by an exaggerated sense of Japan's destiny.
They began a campaign of violence against the Japanese civilian government. Elements of the Imperial Navy
launched a coup in March 1932 by executing Japan's former finance minister, Junnosuke Inoue, and Baron
Dan, the head of Mitsui Corporation, as traitors to the Japanese people. On May 15, Prime Minister Inukai
Tsuyoshi was shot to death by eleven young naval officers. Between 1930 and 1935, the Japanese witnessed
twenty terrorist incidents, the assassination of four political leaders, the attempted murders of five others, and
four coup attempts.
In the first half of the twentieth century, the dominant political party in Japan was a fusion of Meiji oligarchs,
government bureaucrats, and recruits from other political parties. The Seiyukai, as it was named, consistently
supported a march toward authoritarian government. Beginning in 1932, "national unity" governments
dominated by high-ranking military officers increasingly assumed power and repressed threats and enemies.
Authoritarian government took hold from the top down in the mid-1930s, as the military intimidated and
overpowered civilian governance and created a military dictatorship.
The situation in China was quite fluid through the 1920s and 1930s. Revolutionary activity grew but
splintered, and the opposing views of Communists and Nationalists led to civil war. The Guomindang was led
by Sun Yat-sen from 1912 until his death in 1925. Sun Yat-sen developed a more inclusive party and made an
alliance with those who followed the communist path. After his death, Chiang Kai-shek arose as the leader of
the Nationalists. Chiang focused on more traditional positions, and in the late 1920s, he chose to formally oust
the communist members of the Guomindang.
One of the people who had joined the communist ranks was a young member from Hunan Province, Mao
Zedong (Figure 12.21). Mao had had intermittent schooling but was drawn to the revolutionary fervor of the
Russian Revolution of 1917. He had supported both the communist cause and the Guomindang, but after
512 12 · The Interwar Period

       Chiang ousted the communists, Mao took up arms against him.

       FIGURE 12.21 Mao Zedong. This photo of Mao, who was born in 1893, was taken before World War II. (credit:
       "Mao Zedong in Yan'an" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Mao viewed communism and Marxism in a rather unorthodox way. Generally, Marxism relied on the
       proletariat, the industrial workers in the factories, gaining class consciousness. However, this model did not
       exist in China, a land of mostly agricultural peasants and little industrialization. So Mao came to believe that a
       Marxist state could be built on the peasantry rather than on industrial workers. Chinese communists would
       seek to overthrow not the capitalists but the landlords who controlled the land. This was a powerful tonic for
       the mass of Chinese peasants, who hungered for land reform. Such reform would oust the landlords and return
       all the land to the hands of the peasants who worked on it.
       The Nationalists themselves had encouraged assistance from the Soviet Union in the early 1920s, and the
       Soviet Union had responded with aid and training. Once Chiang became head of the Nationalists, however, he
       decided to break with the Communists and planned an extermination of the Communist forces. This forced
       many into hiding, but in 1935, Mao was able to lead them on the Long March to a safe retreat in northern
       China. Many flocked to Mao and his oratory about a new government in China that reflected the will of the
       people. In 1937, however, the Japanese Empire invaded mainland China. Chiang offered Mao a truce, setting
       aside the civil war in favor of fighting against the invading forces. Still, the internal battles between these two
       sides weakened the war effort against the Japanese.
       In Southeast Asia, themes of nationalism were also growing in popularity. Following his inability to be heard at
       negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles, Ho Chi Minh had returned home to the northern part of French
       Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) and organized guerrilla fighters to begin ousting the French.
       Championing Vietnamese nationalism, Ho had received training from the Soviet Union and hoped
       communism would provide a path for his country to achieve independence.
       Turkey welcomed the spread of democratic institutions in the 1920s. After the triumph of his nationalist party
       in the early 1920s, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk established a republic with a constitution and regular elections. The
       Republic of Turkey disassociated itself from the old Ottoman rule by adopting many Westernized elements.
       Women had the right to vote, the Arabic alphabet was no longer used, and traditional dress (veils for women
       and the fez for men) was outlawed. European fashion became the norm. Another major shift in Turkey was its
       adoption of a fully secular society. The legal system was overhauled to focus on a civil code like those of other
       European countries rather than on Islamic law.

Latin American countries, too, had some success expanding democracy in the 1920s. In 1910, revolution broke
out in Mexico. A struggle over leadership followed in which Mexico was governed by a succession of
revolutionary generals without any established way for the next president to come to power. The creation of a
political party was meant to fix this, and by the 1920s, the PRI (the Institutional Revolutionary Party) had been
formed. Though subject to name changes through the decades, this party dominated Mexican politics until the
twenty-first century. There were regular elections and an expansion of voting, reflecting at least the outward
acceptance of democratic institutions. However, the PRI effectively ran a one-party state, and all presidents
and nearly all the members of the legislature were members of the party. In 1938, a new president, Lázaro
Cárdenas, focused on the plight of ordinary workers in Mexico. He supported labor unions, nationalized the oil
industry, promoted land reform, and attempted to bring more socialist policies to Mexico.

Other countries throughout Latin America extended voting rights in the early 1900s. Chile suffered its share of
chaos as reformers tried to seize political power there. Ultimately, Chile was able to build a series of coalition
governments in the 1930s that brought stability for many years. By the 1920s, political instability was
increasingly common in other places like Argentina. In September 1930, General José Félix Uriburu seized
power in the capital, Buenos Aires. Uriburu had been heavily influenced by the Italian version of fascism. He
banned political parties and suspended the constitution. His was the first of several military coups that
occurred in Argentina in the ensuing decades.

A New Culture for the Masses

Alongside the expansion of democracy, the 1920s also shepherded in a new world of mass culture and mass
media. Technological innovations let people connect nearly instantaneously and have shared experiences
without being in the same place. Where the infrastructure existed, it was radio and the movies that made this
possible.

Radio wave technology had been pioneered in the late 1800s, but its widespread use and cultural influence
were still decades off. By the 1920s, radio's value as a news medium was becoming clear, but its true influence
came from commercial radio shows, supported through another new medium called advertising that filled the
airwaves in the mid-1920s. From that point through the interwar years, people could gather to hear the latest
episodes of entertaining soap operas, mystery shows, and westerns, along with news items and live reporting
of sports events.

Silent films had ruled movie theaters in the 1900s and 1910s, but beginning in the late 1920s, "talking
pictures" emerged and quickly became the dominant form of motion pictures. Mass media technologies meant
people could watch the same movies, follow the same soap operas, and cheer for the same teams despite being
hundreds or thousands of miles apart. These experiences created a mass culture for the first time, uniting
people whose lives had once been dominated by regional and local concerns.

The film industries in many countries developed somewhat differently in the 1930s. In the United States, the
industry was centered in Hollywood, a district in Los Angeles, California. The bosses of movie studios wanted
to make films that were popular with audiences and relatively cheap to produce. In other countries, the film
industries were similarly popular, but many were also supportive of artistic experimentation in film. The
German film industry took a modernist approach, seen in the silent 1920 horror film The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari, for example, and many of its films critiqued politics and society in the postwar era. In Japan, the film
industry went through a period of reform in the 1920s as producers and directors began adopting different
filmmaking techniques instead of simply recording a theatrical production. Some films took leftist positions
that reflected the growth of unions in Japanese society, but other genres such as those featuring samurai
characters also became popular and well known.

People were also embracing new ways of living in the 1920s. Women, in particular, were ready to fulfill their
updated expectations for themselves. The "New Woman" of this era abandoned the traditions of the past to
enter an exciting future. Women in many countries were also adopting new plans for their lives, such as
514 12 · The Interwar Period

       pursuing higher education, although a college degree was still quite rare among women. There were also many
       new jobs in the workplace that women were eager to hold. In Europe and the United States, secretarial work
       was becoming dominated by women rather than the men who had held such jobs in the 1800s. Nursing also
       became an important career option for women.
       The New Woman was a significant departure from the nineteenth-century Western woman, who wore her long
       hair piled high on her head and dressed in high-necked blouses and ankle-length skirts. Young women in the
       1920s wore knee-length skirts, discarded corsets, and cut their hair short. They went out in the evenings to
       drink and dance and socialize. A woman who adopted these behaviors became known as a flapper in the
       United States, due to the way these women danced with arms flapping from their sides (Figure 12.22).

       FIGURE 12.22 A Flapper. This early photo of American film star Clara Bow personifies the flapper image. After
       starring in It, a romantic comedy in which she played a salesperson working in a department store, Bow became
       known as the "It Girl" and symbolized the New Woman of the 1920s. (credit: "Photo of Clara Bow in 1921" by
       Brewster Magazine/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       The spread of this modern image of a woman demonstrated the influence the West and especially the United
       States already had on popular culture. The New Woman appeared around the world on signs, in books, in song
       lyrics, and throughout the burgeoning movie industry. Advertisers, in particular, were quick to adopt her
       image, making it one to which female consumers could aspire. Each country had its own version--the moga
       (modern girl) in Japan, the garçonne (tomboy or flapper) in France.

Section Summary

12.1 Recovering from World War I

A period of significant change followed World War I. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles fully blamed Germany for
the war and sought to punish it by assessing reparations of more than $33 billion and physically shrinking the
country. New countries emerged through the redrawing of Europe's maps. Massive physical rebuilding was
necessary in former combat areas in Europe, while the United States emerged as a major player in world

politics and a creditor nation on the brink of prosperity. The economic repercussions of the treaty proved
devastating in Germany, where economic instability and mistrust of the new government opened the door for
the rise of the Nazi Party. In Asia, Japan was growing in both political and military power, positioning itself as a
force throughout the Pacific. Yet in the 1920s and 1930s, hope still prevailed that no such conflict would ever
occur again, underscored by international efforts to both prevent war and intervene in aggression before it
rose to the status of war.

12.2 The Formation of the Soviet Union

The Bolsheviks' effort to wrest control of Russia did not go unchallenged, as evidenced by the civil war that
unfolded after World War I. Though ultimately successful in consolidating power, throughout the 1920s the
Bolsheviks continued to disagree among themselves about the proper application of communist principles.
The power vacuum left after Vladimir Lenin's death allowed Joseph Stalin to emerge as the leader of the new
Soviet Union. Stalin's Five-Year Plans brought not only more centralized economic control but a more
authoritarian government that compelled obedience, no matter the resistance or the impact, including death
and famine. Life in the Soviet Union became more structured and rigid as the government asserted control
over all aspects of civilian life. Anyone even remotely suspected of disloyalty faced imprisonment or death.

12.3 The Great Depression

The Great Depression of the 1930s was an economic downturn unparalleled in modern history. The
interconnectedness of the world's economies became clear as countries around the globe suffered the effects.
While no single event caused the Great Depression, few people were left unscathed. Nations tried innovative
ways to provide for their people, enacting work-relief programs, food programs, and new economic policies to
bring their economies back under control. While many programs helped mitigate the pain of the Depression,
none fully solved it, and some people embraced new political parties that offered different solutions. In the
case of Italy and Germany, these new parties and politicians exploited the decade's economic instability for
their own ends in a grab for greater power.

12.4 Old Empires and New Colonies

The Treaty of Versailles created new countries and new governments and encouraged many groups' desire for
independence. However, independence did not come without struggle. European powers hoped to retain their
hold over resource-rich regions around the world through the colonial or mandate system. Still, many Jewish
people celebrated the promise of a Jewish homeland, while rising nationalism in Africa began to reshape the
politics and geography of that continent. The struggle for independence in India took both violent and
nonviolent forms as leaders chafed against British rule.

12.5 Resistance, Civil Rights, and Democracy

The years following World War I left many democratic yearnings unfulfilled around the globe. African
Americans in the United States were able to seize new job opportunities and greater mobility, but they still
faced marked racism and limitations. Efforts toward self-rule in Ireland made substantial progress but were
also tainted by violence. The promise of greater democracy in China was subsumed by civil war. In Latin
America, the hope of greater equality among social classes was frustrated by political instability and the first
appearance of more authoritarian leaders. Many aspects of Western society wound their way around the globe
via the new technologies of mass media. Peoples around the world clearly wanted change, but implementing it
sometimes proved exceedingly difficult.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

13.1 An Unstable Peace
13.2 Theaters of War
13.3 Keeping the Home Fires Burning
13.4 Out of the Ashes
INTRODUCTION The devastation and dislocations of World War I were so profound that much of Europe was
hard-pressed to recover in its aftermath. Through the tumultuous 1920s, voters worldwide looked to
authoritative leaders and parties to solve their country's problems. This tendency spawned a new approach to
governance in the form of fascism and totalitarianism, which gained power and influence in many places
across the globe. The resulting regimes propelled the world to a bloodier and more devastating sequel to World
War I--World War II. The second global conflict in less than half a century began with Germany's invasion of
Poland in 1939 and Britain and France's decision to oppose it. By the summer of 1940, western Europe had
fallen to German armies, and in 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union (Figure 13.1). As Europe erupted in
flames, on the other side of the world, the armies of the Empire of Japan swept through Asia and the Pacific,
enmeshing millions more in a brutal conflict.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Analyze Japan's efforts to expand its empire in Asia and the Pacific
  · Discuss Hitler's actions in the 1930s and how they led to World War II
  · Explain how and why the United States was less engaged in responding to threats to peace in the

      1930s
  · Discuss why Japan eventually decided to attack the United States
The attempts by Western nations to build a structure of world peace with the Treaty of Versailles and the
League of Nations ultimately unraveled during the 1930s. National and international grievances, competing
ideologies, and economic self-interest all hammered away at the fragile international order.

Asia for Asians

The fight between Japan and China in the 1930s lit the fuse that made World War II a global conflict. The spark
may have been Japan's long-standing perception of Western racism, dating back to the nineteenth century and
shown more recently in the rejection of Japan's proposed racial equality amendment to the Treaty of
Versailles. This had been done at the insistence of Australia and the British delegation. Part of Japan's
underlying thinking was to rid Asia of Western colonial influences, although it also clearly saw itself as the new
leader of the region.
Since the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan had held the right to lease the South Manchuria
Railway in northeastern China, a privilege previously held by Russia. However, Japan now claimed rights to
control extensive territory in northeastern China outside the railway zone and stationed its troops in the
region. In 1931, these troops detonated explosives along the track of the South Manchuria Railway and blamed
the act on Chinese saboteurs. This gave Japan an excuse to invade and annex Manchuria (also called
Manchukuo) on the pretext that it was defending Japanese interests. To deflect international attention from
526 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       this incident, commonly known as the Mukden Incident, the Japanese provoked some sharp clashes with
       Chinese troops in Shanghai. A cease-fire on May 5, 1932, concluded the First Shanghai Incident.
       Simultaneously, the Imperial Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchukuo continued to expand its operations and
       control. The army pushed southward to the Great Wall, absorbing more Chinese territory into its zone of
       control. Eventually, on May 22, 1933, the Japanese and China's Guomindang government (GMD, also spelled
       "Kuomintang") concluded the Tanggu Truce, forming a demilitarized zone that stretched one hundred
       kilometers south of the Great Wall and essentially detached Manchukuo from the nation of China. Thereafter,
       Manchukuo, which had rich coal and iron ore deposits, was developed as an economic engine for the Japanese
       Empire, securing North China, countering any spread of communism or Soviet influence, and preparing the
       way for a wider conflict (Figure 13.4).

       FIGURE 13.4 A Disputed Territory. Beginning in 1933, the Tanggu Truce between China and Japan allowed
       Manchukuo (Manchuria) to be developed as an economic engine for Japan. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,
       OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
       The nationalist GMD government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had been fighting a civil war since
       1927. In 1934, GMD troops displaced from Manchukuo by the Japanese had repositioned themselves south of
       the Great Wall when President Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi)1 ordered them to attack the Chinese communists
       under Mao Zedong at their nearby base in Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. Chinese public opinion rejected the idea
       of Chinese fighting Chinese in the face of Japan's aggression. In December 1936, during the so-called Xian
       Incident, Chiang Kai-shek was taken prisoner in Xian, China, by Manchurian forces and forced to negotiate a
       cessation of the Civil War and the creation of the Second United Front--unifying the GMD and the CCP against
       Japan.
       Tensions in North China escalated early in July 1937, as Japanese troops were conducting night exercises near

         The pinyin system is preferred by the People's Republic of China, and most Chinese names in this textbook are written in pinyin. In
         the case of Chiang Kai-shek, the textbook's editors decided to make an exception and spell his name according to the Wade-Giles
         system because this is how his name appears in most other history textbooks. Jiang Jieshi is how his name would be written in
         pinyin.

the Marco Polo Bridge ten miles west of Beijing and firefights erupted between them and Chinese troops. The
Japanese quickly overcame the Chinese forces and secured their control of the area around Beijing and
Tianjin.

Chiang Kai-shek then decided to shift the fighting to the Shanghai region, where he had better forces and a
seeming numerical advantage. The Japanese responded by mounting a major offensive, and by November
1937, the GMD forces had been badly mauled. After losing 250,000 troops, they retreated westward to China's
capital in Nanjing. Japanese forces closed in on Nanjing, and Chinese troops continued to retreat westward.
On December 12, 1937, Chinese resistance at Nanjing ceased, and Japanese troops entered the defenseless
city, commencing a terrifying seven-week reign of terror and plunder. Foreign witnesses in the city estimated
that twenty thousand Chinese women and girls were raped. Some thirty thousand Chinese soldiers who could
not be evacuated were executed, and perhaps as many as twelve thousand civilians were also killed. Other
historians put the number of dead at 300,000. (Such discrepancies in numbers occur because historians may
disagree on which deaths can be attributed to an event.) The tragedy became known as the "Rape of Nanking"
(the older spelling of Nanjing) and was taken up at the Tokyo War Crimes trials after the war.

Japan redoubled its efforts to subdue China. Having retreated farther west to defend the GMD's new
provisional capital at Chongqing, some GMD armies put up stiff resistance in places, but by 1938, they had
been pushed back significantly. To prevent further Japanese advances, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the opening
of the dikes on the Yellow River, flooding large portions of central China, killing an estimated 400,000 people
and dislocating ten million more. In December 1937, the Japanese sank the USS Panay, a gunboat on the
Yangtze River that was extracting American and Chinese civilians from Nanjing at the time. The Japanese
government accepted responsibility and apologized for the Panay incident, paying restitution of more than $2
million (at least $37 million in today's money). Through all this, public opinion in the United States, while
increasingly shifting in favor of China, was still undecided about entering any war.

The Great Depression and the rise of fascism in Europe seemed to signal the decline of the older Western-
dominated world order. Japanese intellectuals, politicians, military leaders, and mass media envisioned that
Japan could fashion a "new order" of regional supremacy for itself. In an August 1940 radio address, Japanese
foreign minister Yosuke Matsuoka broached his vision for a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a
blueprint for Japan's ascent to world-power status. A year later, he published a book further developing his
ideas for liberating Asians from European domination and expelling the "white race bloc" suppressing Asia's
destiny. By 1941, creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere had become the publicly articulated
objective of Japan's Asian aggression, and it remained so until Japan's defeat in 1945.

Eventually, finding themselves in a stalemate in China and needing more natural resources to sustain the war
and the goal of creating the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese military and civilian
governments began to consider a thrust into Southeast Asia. Such a move would inevitably mean a
confrontation with the United States and its colony the Philippines. Japan conceived a desperately hopeful
plan of war against the United States and an initial knockout strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor,
Hawaii.

Peace in Our Time

In furtherance of his promise to revive Italian glory, Benito Mussolini (popularly known as Il Duce, "the
leader") sought to expand the Italian protectorate of Somali in East Africa. A border dispute with Ethiopia,
which Italy had long sought to colonize, arose in November 1934, and the Ethiopians took the matter to the
League of Nations on January 5, 1935. When a full-scale Italian invasion of Ethiopia began on October 3 of that
year, the League Council immediately declared Italy the aggressor, and fifty-one member nations approved
sanctions against Italy. Unwilling to defy Mussolini, however, the British and French undermined the League in
a secret agreement permitting Italy to absorb Ethiopia into a special economic zone. In May 1936, Italian
forces took the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, and shortly thereafter, Italy formally annexed the country. In
Italy, Mussolini's popularity grew, especially among Italian youth.
528 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       Britain and France were even more reluctant to confront Germany. Adolf Hitler had often pledged to scrap the
       Treaty of Versailles. His first step came just nine months after becoming chancellor when he conducted
       referenda to let the German people decide whether they wanted to remain in the League of Nations. The result
       was predictable, and in October 1933, Germany withdrew from the League.
       By the 1930s, some in Britain and elsewhere had come to view Hitler as a deeply patriotic German seeking
       merely to serve the interests of his battered nation. Others saw him and his politics as potentially dangerous
       and unsettling to European stability. The British government did, however, negotiate with Germany to contain
       the size of the German navy, and France sought a Treaty of Mutual Assistance with the Union of Soviet Socialist
       Republics (USSR). Using the French-Soviet cooperation as an excuse, in March 1935 Hitler publicly announced
       that Germany had already secretly begun to rearm in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles. On March 2, 1936,
       about three thousand German troops reoccupied the Rhineland, a part of Germany demilitarized by the Treaty.
       France feared protesting this too strongly because it did not want and was not ready to fight another war. The
       British public did not see the move as overtly hostile.
       Though the Versailles Treaty specifically prohibited unification of Austria with Germany, Hitler moved to
       accomplish this anyway. Austria's prime minister attempted to stave off unification by calling for a referendum
       in March, but the next day Hitler preemptively sent troops into Austria. When the referendum was held, the
       people voted for union with Germany. Flush with his victory over Austria, Hitler continued to "gather the
       German people," and his eyes turned to those portions of Czechoslovakia called the Sudetenland, containing
       some three million ethnic Germans, including many who had been folded into that nation by the Treaty of
       Versailles (Figure 13.5).

       FIGURE 13.5 The Sudetenland. Inhabited largely by German speakers, the Sudetenland wrapped around the
       northern, western, and southern edges of Czechoslovakia, where that nation bordered Germany and Poland. (credit:

       The Czechoslovaks, in the only real democracy created by the Treaty of Versailles, pinned their hopes for
       defense against Germany on the western nations and on treaties for mutual defense signed with France in the
       1920s and early 1930s. Sudeten Germans had organized their own Nazi Party, however, and began agitating to
       join Germany. By 1938, it seemed that Britain and France were most concerned with avoiding another major
       war, so to defuse the situation, the Czechoslovak government granted the Sudeten Germans self-government.
       Tensions grew. As Hitler pressed for full inclusion of the Sudetenland in Germany and war seemed on the
       horizon, British prime minister Neville Chamberlain flew to Germany to meet with him. Hitler seemed
       prepared for war. Instead, Chamberlain proposed to hold a general conference to address the crisis over the

Sudetenland, and Hitler agreed.
The Munich Conference was attended by Chamberlain, Hitler, French prime minister Édouard Daladier, and
Mussolini (ostensibly a neutral party but one who had already assured Hitler of his support). On September 30,
they produced the Munich Pact, in which Czechoslovakia granted territorial concessions to Germany, Poland,
and Hungary in what has since been called appeasement (Figure 13.6). The hope of Great Britain and France
was that Hitler would be satisfied and cease to be aggressive. The alternative meant fighting Germany, which
neither government wanted.

The Western world had not yet decided which was the greater threat to world peace, a fascist Germany or the
communist Soviet Union. Some political conservatives in England and France hoped for a German alliance
against the Soviets, as did Hitler. The British military was not confident of its preparedness for war, and the
isolationist policy of the United States diminished the hope of any aid from Washington. With anxiety growing
in London over Britain's possessions in Asia and Japanese aggressions there, domestic support for negotiated
solutions was widespread among liberals, and a bargain with Hitler seemed a reasonable policy. In the ensuing
weeks, German troops entered the relinquished areas, and by the spring of 1939, Germany had gone on to
absorb the rest of Czechoslovakia.
During these years, the Nazis were progressively implementing increasingly severe persecutions of Jewish
people. First, a law enacted on April 7, 1933, banned them from positions in the civil service. That same year,
the first and longest-surviving Nazi concentration camp, Dachau, was set up near Munich, intended for
political prisoners (Figure 13.7). Several laws collectively known as the Nuremberg Laws were promulgated in
1935, institutionalizing Nazi racial theories and discrimination against Jewish people. A Jewish person was
defined as anyone with three Jewish grandparents, regardless of whether they were active in the Jewish
religious community or how deeply they identified as German. Jewish people were denied citizenship in the
new Nazi-led German empire, called the Third Reich, and were forbidden to marry or have sexual relations
530 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       with ethnic Germans, designated as "Aryans." They lost the right to vote and most other political rights.

       Germany was becoming legally structured as an "us" versus "them" nation, and the treatment of its Jewish
       people demonstrated the fearsome power of the state. Two days of violent attacks on them in November 1938,
       ignited by the assassination of a German diplomat in Paris by a Polish Jewish man, became known as
       Kristallnacht, the "Night of Broken Glass." Almost every synagogue in Germany was torched during the
       rampage, as well as 90 percent of Jewish-owned businesses. Some thirty thousand Jewish males were taken
       into custody and sent to Dachau, which by then had been augmented by camps at Sachsenhausen and
       Buchenwald. All but about two thousand were released in 1939.
       Kristallnacht caused a severe deterioration in Germany's international standing. In Britain, an outraged public
       pressured Parliament into allowing unaccompanied Jewish children under seventeen to take refuge in
       England. During the nine months before the war, this Kindertransport may have rescued as many as ten
       thousand children. Across Europe, many Jewish people became refugees as they fled the oppressive politics of
       the Nazis. A thirty-two-nation international conference was held in France during the summer of 1938 to solve
       the Jewish refugee crisis, but no country stepped forward to accept any such immigrants. In February 1939, a
       bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress to allow ten thousand Jewish children to enter the country in 1939
       and another ten thousand in 1940. Though popular, the bill failed due to lukewarm political support.
       In Asia, Shanghai was an option for Jewish refugees looking for a new home. The city, along with Franco's
       Spain, was unconditionally open to Jewish migration. Nominally still a German ally in 1939, the Nationalist
       government in the southwestern corner of China formulated a plan to provide a haven for European Jewish

refugees. It had multiple reasons for doing so, including attracting international Jewish support and gaining
favor with Britain and the United States against Japan. A number of schemes were hatched, both by members
of the GMD government and by private individuals, one even gaining the support of scientist Albert Einstein.
GMD diplomats in Europe like Feng Shan Ho, consul general in Vienna, issued visas to Jewish refugees seeking
to relocate to Shanghai. A Jewish community of more than twenty thousand displaced persons had reached the
city by the end of the war.
In May 1939, almost one thousand Jewish refugees escaping Nazi persecution took passage on the MS St.
Louis, a German ocean liner, heading for sanctuary in Cuba. But Cuba refused to admit them. The ship's
captain then tried to get Canada or the United States to accept the refugees, but that effort failed as well. While
the ship sailed around to no avail, conditions on board deteriorated to the point that it came to be called the
"voyage of the damned." Finally, after a month, the ship was forced to return to Antwerp, Belgium, where most
of the passengers disembarked. Ultimately, England accepted about three hundred of them, France took some,
and a few more went to Belgium and the Netherlands. Of the original passengers, 70 percent survived the war,
but more than two hundred were killed by the Nazis.
The ambition to expand eastward had motivated Germany for some time. The hunt for Lebensraum, or living
space, had fueled its search for overseas colonies in the late 1800s and was an express goal of World War I. In
the lands seized from countries in eastern Europe, Hitler envisioned German families settling and producing
large numbers of children, supplanting the native Slavic populations. In this way, physically and culturally
"superior" Germans would reclaim Europe from "inferior" Jewish and Slavic peoples. Similar ideologies meant
to rationalize the displacement of a territory's residents by a supposedly superior population have appeared in
history before, like Manifest Destiny in the United States and Japan's expansionist policies in Korea and
Manchuria. To the east of Germany, the Treaty of Versailles had created an independent Poland and awarded
parts of Germany to Poland in the process. This "Polish Corridor," in an area where many Polish people already
lived, was intended to give Poland access to a port, and the German city of Danzig (Gdask), bordering it, was
made a semi-independent city-state with its own parliament (Figure 13.8). Poland was a prime target of the
Nazis as they looked for Lebensraum.

The lessons learned from Hitler's violation of the Munich Pact spurred Britain and France to take action to
532 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       protect Poland. They have also been invoked by world leaders ever since, whenever the aggression of one
       nation threatens the sovereignty or the territorial integrity of another. Using the example of Munich to warn
       against the perils of allowing one nation to invade another without opposition, whether it be Hitler's Germany
       or Putin's Russia, is known as invoking the Munich Analogy.

       The key to whether Germany could be boxed in was the attitudes of Stalin and the Soviet Union. As early as the
       summer of 1938, Stalin began to think of making some sort of deal with Germany. During the following
       summer, relations between Germany and the Soviet Union began to improve. Stalin, aware of Hitler's musings
       in his book Mein Kampf, understood the long-term threat Germany posed and sought to buy time to prepare
       for possible war. For his part, Hitler wanted to avoid Germany's World War I mistake of fighting on two fronts
       simultaneously. The result was the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact of August 23, 1939. In this pact,
       Germany and the USSR agreed not to attack one another or to assist other nations in attacking the other.
       Included in the agreement were secret protocols that essentially divided eastern Europe between Germany
       and the Soviet Union. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and parts of eastern Poland were allocated to the USSR as a
       reward for cooperating with Germany in the dismemberment of Poland.

       Seeing the pact as an ominous green light for a German eastward thrust, two days later Britain signed a mutual
       defense agreement with Poland. All things seemed ready for the German onslaught, which was launched on
       September 1, 1939. Britain and France fulfilled their commitment to Poland and declared war on Germany,
       forming the partnership known as the Allies, but not on the Soviet Union. About two weeks later, Soviet forces
       invaded Poland from the east. Crushed from two sides, Poland essentially ceased to exist. The European fires
       of World War II had been ignited.

       Poland provided the Germans an opportunity to test their strategy for victory, known as blitzkrieg or "lightning
       war." It consisted of quick, massive air strikes to secure domination of the air, destroy the enemy's ammunition
       stockpiles and the transportation and communications infrastructure, and generally disorient the enemy and
       depress morale. Then a massive land invasion of troops, fast-moving armor, and heavy artillery would
       overwhelm defenses. The Polish army of a million troops lacked modern equipment and was saddled with
       older strategic thinking that urged confronting the Germans head-on. The relatively flat landscape of western
       Poland offered few natural barriers to traffic and suited Germany's battle plan well, enabling the Germans to
       successfully employ several maneuvers to penetrate and encircle.

       The British quickly discovered there was no practical way to render much assistance to the Poles. Instead, they
       relied on the French to engage the Germans. But the French felt they could not sustain an offensive against
       Germany's western front. They preferred to prepare their defenses for an eventual German offensive against
       France. Britain joined the French by deploying the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to defend the French-
       Belgian border. By then, Poland was already lost and had been folded into Hitler's plans of dominating Europe.
       During the winter of 1939-1940, little action took place on the French-German border save for a few clashes of
       patrols and reconnaissance units. That period of waiting has sometimes been referred to as the Phony War or,
       derisively, as the sitzkrieg ("sitting war").

       The German advance westward began with some forays into Norway and Denmark to the north on April 9,
       1940. Not wanting to provoke German invasions, both Belgium and the Netherlands declared neutrality. This
       disadvantaged the British and French, since they were then not allowed to coordinate defenses with Dutch and
       Belgian forces or station troops in their territory. The Germans then launched their full westward offensive on
       May 10, 1940. Within a matter of weeks, German troops had overrun western Europe, storming through the
       Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium and into France, avoiding the Maginot Line, a system of fortifications
       and weapons installations that had been built on the French border in the 1930s in order to protect France
       from another German invasion. Early in the morning of May 23, 1940, the British commander in France,
       seeing the perils of his position, gave the order to begin a withdrawal toward Dunkirk on the French coast.
       Eventually, this culminated in the extraordinary evacuation across the English Channel of much of the BEF
       and thousands of French and other Allied forces between June 15 and 25 using every British boat capable of

crossing the Channel. The retreat saved 200,000 troops.

French prime minister Paul Reynaud resigned rather than sign the armistice agreement with Germany in June
1940. Instead, Marshall Philippe Pétain, a hero of World War I, became the prime minister of a truncated
French government based in Vichy, France, that, although nominally independent, cooperated with Germany.

The remarkable success of the German blitzkrieg in Europe during the summer of 1940 presented the
Japanese military with some significant strategic opportunities. For instance, the isolation of European
colonies in Asia might make them ripe for seizing. Consequently, to provide for mutual defense and perhaps to
frighten the United States away from giving more substantial assistance against them, Japan joined Germany
and Italy in the defensive military alliance called the Tripartite Pact in September 1940. (Japan and Germany
had earlier signed the Anti-Comintern Pact against the Soviet Union, which Japan saw as a rival for dominance
in Asia, in 1936, and Italy had joined in a year later. Japan had parted ways with Germany in 1939, however,
when the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact was signed, and a new agreement was thus in order.) The U.S.
ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, felt discouraged in the attempt to maintain peace. He observed to a
colleague in February 1941, "I saw the work of eight years swept away as if by a typhoon, earthquake and a
tidal wave combined."

Sleeping Giants

Hitler planned to finish off Britain with a cross-channel invasion using air and submarine bases in both
Norway, which had surrendered in June 1940, and northern France. Through the late summer and into the fall
of 1940, the Battle of Britain raged in the skies over Britain as a duel between the German Luftwaffe and the
Royal Air Force (RAF). The Germans initially focused their attacks on shipping in the English Channel and then
began to bomb weapons-production facilities. The British gradually built up the RAF with new recruits of non-
British volunteers, including a few U.S. pilots. Aided in part by the innovation of radar, which gave some
advance warning of German onslaughts, the RAF prevailed. By October 1940, having lost approximately 40
percent of its planes of all types, the Luftwaffe had failed to achieve the air superiority needed to capture
Britain. When the Luftwaffe shifted its focus from military to civilian targets, particularly the bombing of
London, it inadvertently gave the British the opportunity to rebuild their airfields and defense plants and
assemble more planes.

In the 1930s, the United States wanted to insulate itself from conflicts in the rest of the world. Aroused by
dramatic hearings into the causes of the country's entry into World War I, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts
in 1935, 1936, and 1937, forbidding the export of arms and the making of loans to belligerent nations. These
acts effectively handcuffed the government. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in 1933 just two
months after Hitler became chancellor of Germany, was prevented from rendering much assistance to China
against Japan, to Ethiopia against Italy, or to Republican Spain against fascist General Franco. But the 1937
Neutrality Act granted Roosevelt a little leeway. The United States could render nonmilitary assistance such as
oil to a belligerent nation if that nation could both pay cash for the goods and carry them home itself.

As the world watched Hitler annex Czechoslovakia and then invade Poland, Roosevelt sought to offer more
substantial military assistance to Britain and France. To beef up the defenses of the United States, Roosevelt
pressed Congress to approve a two-ocean navy in 1938 and began to funnel aid to Britain and China within the
confines of what was allowable. After much debate, in November 1939 Congress repealed provisions of earlier
Neutrality Acts and authorized trade in military hardware on a cash-and-carry basis. With the Luftwaffe
struggling in the summer of 1940, the responsibility for subduing England increasingly fell to the German
submarine fleet, on the theory that England could be starved to death. Roosevelt created the Atlantic squadron
in January 1939 and gradually expanded a U.S. naval patrol and escort service for shipping headed for
England.

In one ten-day period in July 1940, German submarines sank eleven British destroyers, prompting the British
prime minister, Winston Churchill, to appeal to the United States for help. Liberally interpreting the Neutrality
534 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       Act of 1939, Roosevelt agreed to exchange fifty World War I-era destroyers for lease rights at British naval
       bases in Newfoundland and the Caribbean. Critics and isolationists like aviator Charles Lindbergh, a leader of
       the America First Committee, took Roosevelt to task. But in March 1941, the president persuaded Congress to
       approve the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed the government to "sell, transfer title to, exchange, lease, lend or
       otherwise dispose of, to any such government any defense article." The United States could now provide these
       materials to any country deemed vital to its own defense. It was a way to aid those countries already fighting
       but without taking direct military action.

                                                                                                      BEYOND THE BOOK
        The Question of U.S. Neutrality

         In the 1930s, many in the United States were reluctant to find themselves embroiled in another war. As Hitler's
         power grew in Europe and Japan expanded its empire in the Pacific, the United States thus adopted a policy of
         neutrality. This continued even after Japan invaded China and Germany invaded Poland and ultimately western
         Europe. Although President Franklin Roosevelt favored aiding the British, his opponents in Congress feared the
         potential consequences. The political cartoonist Clifford Berryman created a number of cartoons in the 1930s
         and early 1940s whose subject was U.S. neutrality.
         Examine the two cartoons that follow. In the first (Figure 13.9), Uncle Sam proclaims, "Lafayette, we are here!"
         words spoken by Colonel Charles E. Stanton at the tomb of the Marquis de Lafayette after U.S. troops joined the

         American Revolution.) In the second image, Uncle Sam is working as a hod carrier, someone who carried bricks

The defeat of Poland removed a buffer between German-occupied and Soviet territory. When Germany
invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, Stalin began to take steps to prepare the USSR for what might happen
next. At the end of 1939, he launched the "Winter War" against Finland to obtain territory near Leningrad (the
city formerly known as St. Petersburg or Petrograd) that would bolster Soviet defenses. In April 1941, the
Soviets signed a Neutrality Pact with Japan, freeing both nations from the prospect of a multiple-front war. The
Kremlin in Moscow received a continuous stream of intelligence warning of an impending invasion. After
receiving one such report outlining German battle plans, Stalin called up half a million reservists. Yet, fearing
to provoke the Germans into action, he was cautious with his forces.
Having detected flaws in the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland and its struggle against Finland in the Winter
War, Hitler was confident he could defeat Stalin. Betraying the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, he
assembled the largest land-invasion force in world history, more than three million troops, including
contributions from countries with their own grievance against the Soviet Union such as Finland, Romania,
Hungary, Yugoslavia, Italy, Slovakia, and Spain. Operation Barbarossa began on June 22, 1941, leading the
Soviet Union to formally join the Allies in opposing Germany (Figure 13.10).

       In the first two days of the campaign, two thousand Soviet planes were destroyed on the ground. The speed of
       the German attack was greater than anticipated, and within weeks, Belorussia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia
       had been occupied by the German army, which was called the Wehrmacht ("defense power"). By August, the
       Germans had captured Kyiv, an industrial center that contained a large portion of the Soviet economic
       infrastructure at that time. By November, Hitler had gone farther into Russia than Napoleon had. The German
       army stood at the gates of Leningrad, on the outskirts of Moscow, and on the Don River. Of the 4.5 million
       troops with which the Soviets had begun, 2.5 to 3 million were lost; of their fifteen thousand tanks, only seven
       hundred were left. Moscow was in panic, and a German victory seemed imminent.

       But serious problems arose that came back to haunt the Germans. The speed of the advance had strained the
       delivery of supplies. The force advancing on Moscow needed nearly thirty train shipments of fuel each day to
       maintain its pace, but by November, it was receiving only three. In August, a shortage of clean water had
       spread dysentery and cholera among the troops. When the late summer rains came, German soldiers found
       that they could neither drive fast (because of mud) nor keep themselves and their equipment dry. Once the
       Russian winter began, it became so cold that bread rations froze and had to be chopped into portions with
       axes.

       The siege of Leningrad lasted 872 days and was one of the longest and deadliest in world history. In early 1942,
       nearly 100,000 people in the city starved to death each month, and some of the remaining residents resorted
       to cannibalism to survive. Overall, a million and a half people perished. Facing this, Stalin seems to have
       momentarily faltered. By the end of 1941, his head of security was instructed to send feelers to the Germans
       through the Bulgarian ambassador to Moscow, broaching the possibility of peace.

       of 1941-1944 in "Voices of War: Memories from the Siege of Leningrad" (presented by Russia Beyond).

       With the war expanding into the plains of Russia, Churchill requested a face-to-face meeting with Roosevelt,
       who secretly sailed to Newfoundland in August 1941 for the purpose. This conference was the first of what
       have since become commonplace events in diplomacy--summit meetings of the heads of state. The two leaders
       produced the Atlantic Charter, a recasting of the principles articulated in Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points
       (1918) into eight major points that reflected British and U.S. goals for a postwar world, though not the Soviet
       Union's goals for Europe. It insisted on the unconditional surrender of the Axis nations--Germany, Italy, and
       Japan--renounced any territorial expansion, and affirmed the right of self-determination. There would be
       freedom of the seas, reduced barriers to free trade, and promotion of social welfare through economic
       cooperation. Peace would be promoted through the disarmament of aggressor nations.

      The Attack on Pearl Harbor

       Trying to pressure the Japanese into ceasing their aggression, in August 1941 the United States imposed
       sanctions including an embargo on oil and gas sales to Japan. This action further reinforced Japan's plan to
       turn to the South Pacific to absorb the natural resources of the crumbling European imperial regimes and the
       Philippines, a U.S. colony. Seeing the United States as a soft enemy unwilling to make the sacrifices needed to
       win a war, Japan planned a surprise assault on the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, while last-ditch efforts
       at a diplomatic settlement between Tokyo and Washington were taking place. The United States wanted Japan
       to ultimately withdraw from China, to which it would not agree, and Japan felt the United States would not be
       open to further negotiations. Its leaders decided they had to move against the United States while they still
       could.

       U.S. intelligence services had broken various Japanese codes, and by late November 1941, warnings were

being sent to U.S. forces that war with Japan was likely, with the Philippines as the probable target. Early in the
morning of December 7, a Japanese task force successfully eluded detection in a surprise attack that
devastated the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor, sinking or damaging eight battleships and damaging other smaller
craft, destroying or damaging approximately three hundred aircraft, killing more than two thousand people,
and injuring more than one thousand others. Near-simultaneous attacks were launched on U.S. bases in the
Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island. The following day, Congress voted unanimously to declare war on Japan.
A few days later, following Germany's and Italy's declarations of war against the United States, the country
entered the war in Europe as well on the side of the Allies. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, China also
joined the Allies, but it did not join in the fighting in Europe.

U.S. military planners had estimated that it might take nine million troops organized in more than two
hundred divisions to secure victory in Europe and Asia. A massive recruitment and draft program had to be
instituted to expand the army and prepare it for combat. Eventually, recruitment efforts expanded to African
Americans, women, Native Americans, and thirty-three thousand Japanese Americans. Leadership of the
troops fell to Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was rapidly promoted through the ranks to become a key aide to Chief
of Staff George C. Marshall and commanding general of the European theater of operations.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe the Allied and Axis operations in Europe and Africa during World War II
  · Explain why the Battles of Stalingrad and Midway are considered turning points in World War II
  · Discuss U.S. operations in East Asia and the Pacific during World War II
  · Describe the evolution of the Holocaust after the German invasion of Poland

World War II was perhaps history's most globalizing event. Troops fought battles on three continents, in the air,
and at sea. Britain and the United States planned early in the war to focus on defeating Italy and Germany
before Japan but left the Soviet Union to battle Germany alone. In Asia, the "liberation" of the inhabitants of
European and U.S. colonies by Japanese troops only replaced Western rule with Japanese rule, igniting or
giving impetus to nationalist movements. Fought on so many fronts, World War II proved to be the deadliest
conflict in history. Among those who perished were millions of noncombatants, including the victims of the
Nazi death camps. The experiences of survivors shaped the rest of their lives and the course of the societies to
which they returned.

Europe and Africa

Beginning in 1938 and through the spring of 1941, U.S. military leaders produced several plans of action in the
event of war with the Axis powers. Immediately after winning an unprecedented third term in 1940, Roosevelt
was briefed by his chief of naval operations, Admiral Harold R. Stark, who advised him that the best military
strategy was "Plan D"--a Europe First plan. This focused the United States and Britain on defeating Germany
and Italy first and adopting a defensive posture against Japan if it entered the war.

Mussolini decided to expand his African holdings and in August 1940 occupied British Somaliland,
threatening the British in Egypt. The British counterattacked. Losing ground in Africa from June through
December 1940, Mussolini turned his eyes on the Balkans. In October 1940, expecting an easy victory, Italian
units invaded Greece but were badly defeated. To forestall further disaster, Hitler dispatched General Erwin
Rommel and his Afrika Korps to duel with the British in northeast North Africa. Not only did Germany wish to
support its Italian ally, but it also sought to gain control of the Suez Canal and guarantee its access to Middle
Eastern oil, which would be crucial in winning the war. To further aid his faltering ally and deal with an anti-
German uprising in Yugoslavia, Hitler postponed his invasion of the Soviet Union by several weeks and
invaded Greece on April 6, 1941.
538 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       Fearing that any substantial British effort against the Germans in Norway or northern France would become a
       slaughter, Winston Churchill conceived Operation Gymnast, a plan to engage the Germans in northwest Africa
       instead. On a military mission to London in July 1942, General Eisenhower was deeply disappointed in
       Churchill's approach, considering how badly the Soviets were suffering from German offensives. General
       George C. Marshall favored opening a front in northern Europe in order to draw German resources away from
       its attack on the Soviet Union before the Soviets collapsed. But Churchill prevailed, and the Allies, now
       including the United States, invaded French North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia) in November 1942.
       Key British possessions Egypt and the Suez Canal were saved, and in a January 1943 summit meeting at
       Casablanca in French Morocco, Churchill and Roosevelt planned the next phase of the war, Operation Husky,
       the invasion of Sicily. This choice disappointed Stalin, who had been hoping for an invasion of western Europe
       instead, to draw German troops away from the fighting in the east and the Soviet Union.
       All the while, desperate battles were being waged on the eastern front in the Soviet Union. In August 1941,
       given the initial success of the German invasion and poised to capture Moscow, Hitler delayed the advance to
       decide strategy. The German general staff wanted to drive directly for Moscow and take it before winter. Hitler,
       however, diverted a significant part of his forces to the south. Both Allied and Axis thinkers had long
       recognized the strategic military importance of oil. For some time prior to the war, the British government had
       interjected itself into the politics of Iraq, Persia, Afghanistan, and Egypt for this reason. The Germans too had
       taken a keen interest in the Middle East and central Asia in the 1930s. In 1925, in Iran, Reza Shah had
       consolidated his rule and commenced a program of modernization, increasing ties with Germany and
       employing hundreds of Germans.
       To block potential German access to Iranian oil, the British first demanded the possibly pro-German Shah
       expel Germans and sever ties with Berlin. Taking no chances, British and Soviet forces then invaded Iran in
       August 1941. Iranian resistence collapsed in a couple of days, and Reza Shah was forced to abdicate in favor of
       his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Germans were expelled, and the Allied occupation lasted until 1946.
       During those years, Iran became a funnel through which much Allied aid, especially from the United States,
       was delivered to Stalin as he struggled to hold out against the Wehrmacht.
       By 1939, the global supply of oil was in the hands of seven oil conglomerates--none of which were German.
       Consequently, Germany was heavily reliant on Romanian and Soviet oil between 1939 and 1941. The oil fields
       in the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan, one thousand kilometers from Stalingrad, looked like a possible solution,
       so the German army moved to capture the city of Baku, the center of the Soviet oil-drilling industry. Thus, both
       winter and the German drive for oil saved Moscow.
       In the summer of 1942, the Germans resumed the offensive on all fronts but were unable to get far, except for
       approaching Stalingrad. Hitler was determined to take the city and Stalin to hold it. In July, Stalin issued Order
       No. 227 forbidding Soviet troops from retreating: "Not one step backwards!" By the fall of 1942, German troops
       had actually broken into Stalingrad, but their progress thereafter was gruesomely slow and difficult. For more
       than two months, the Battle of Stalingrad raged with ferocity, sometimes building by building (Figure 13.11).

Stalingrad from within the ruins of a bombed building. (credit: "Stalingrad war 1942" by Unknown/Wikimedia

Having assembled sufficient forces, in November 1942 the Soviet Red Army counterattacked at Stalingrad and
managed to trap the Germans in a noose. The only way for the Germans to resupply was by air, which was far
too limited to sustain them for very long. Despite being specifically forbidden to do so, on January 31, 1943,
German field marshal Friedrich Paulus surrendered what was left of his Sixth Army. The Soviets captured
close to 100,000 German troops. Total casualties in the battle had reached nearly two million, including
substantial numbers of civilians. The Battle of Stalingrad stopped the German advance into the Soviet Union. It
was the first clear defeat for Hitler's Germany and the turning point of the war in Europe, setting the Nazis on a
defensive course for the remainder of the war.
From the time of his first meeting with Churchill in August 1942, a frustrated Stalin had been calling for a
second front against the Nazis in Europe. In the summer of 1943, the Soviets, fresh from saving Stalingrad,
went on the offensive against the Germans. The ensuing Battle of Kursk was the biggest land battle of the war
and the largest tank battle in history. The Soviet victory damaged Germany's war-making capacity by
compromising its armaments.
Mussolini had insisted on contributing 200,000 troops to the invasion of the Soviet Union, and by early 1943,
half of them had become casualties. Allied victories in North Africa and Sicily, along with the Allied bombing of
Rome in July 1943, further humiliated Mussolini. In Italy, a coalition of former fascist supporters, military
officers, the few surviving liberal politicians, and the king himself reached the conclusion that Mussolini must
go. The Grand Fascist Council met for the first time in three years on July 24, 1943, and voted overwhelmingly
to remove him from power and place him under arrest.
A government was formed under Marshal Pietro Badoglio, who initiated secret negotiations with the Allies. The
Allied invasion of the mainland of Italy at the beginning of September provided the impetus for Italy's
surrender on September 8, 1943. Four days later, Hitler had German special forces rescue Mussolini. German
troops already in Italy then moved to disarm the remnants of the Italian army and established a government
540 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       called the Republic of Salo in northern Italy, with Mussolini as its figurehead. However, Italian communist
       partisans captured and executed Mussolini in April 1945.
       Earlier, with Iran secured through the Allied invasion, Tehran had been the site of the first of the World War II
       conferences between the "Big Three": Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin. From November 28 to December 1,
       1943, the Tehran conference addressed relations between the Allies, relations between Turkey and Iran,
       operations in Yugoslavia, the fight against Japan, and plans for the postwar settlement. A protocol signed at the
       conference pledged the Big Three's recognition of Iran's independence. The Big Three also agreed on a cross-
       channel invasion of Europe scheduled for May 1944, in conjunction with a Soviet attack on Germany's eastern
       border. Stalin dominated the conference, using Soviet victories to get preliminary agreements on the borders
       of Poland after the war. Churchill and Roosevelt also consented to the USSR setting up governments
       sympathetic to itself in the Baltic states. Roosevelt and Stalin continued their discussions of a general
       international organization that had been proposed a few months earlier.

      East Asia and the Pacific

       When the Japanese invaded the Philippines beginning in December 1941, the limited U.S. and Filipino forces
       put up stiff resistance in jungle fighting. Outnumbered, however, they surrendered their positions on the
       Bataan Peninsula on April 9, 1942. The command headquarters surrendered at Corregidor Island nearly a
       month later. The resulting sixty-mile forced march to an internment camp led to the deaths of more than a
       quarter of the estimated eighty thousand Allied prisoners and became known as the Bataan Death March. Over
       the course of the war, the Japanese held approximately 140,000 Allied troops under severe conditions at
       various camps in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and on the Japanese home islands. By the end of
       the war, as many as thirty thousand had perished there.
       Five months into 1942, the Japanese had gathered a significant portion of Burma, Malaya and the Straits
       Settlements, Indonesia, French Indochina, and the Philippines into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere
       (Figure 13.12). While deconstructing White colonial rule, the Japanese began to systematically exploit the
       liberated areas for their resources in support of a greater Japan. However impressive the Greater East Asia Co-
       Prosperity Sphere was on paper, however, the Japanese military and civilian administrators were hard-pressed
       to solve significant problems. The extent of the area under control and the size of the captive population
       presented governance issues, while geography severely strained communication and transportation networks.
       Puppet regimes were an attempt to solve some of these problems, such as the collaborationist regime in China
       under Wang Jingwei in 1940, the Ba Maw government in Burma during the Japanese occupation, and the
       administration of José P. Laurel in the defeated Philippines.

Successes were short-lived, however, because in June 1942, the United States decisively won what became the
turning point of the war in the Pacific--the Battle of Midway, which stopped Japan's advance across the Pacific.
The Japanese lost four aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser, and other ships were severely damaged. The
balance of power clearly shifted toward the Allies, and the Japanese navy never recovered its momentum.
Pursuing an island-hopping campaign to roll back Japanese seizures of land, the United States frequently had
to engage the Japanese in dense jungle terrains. For years, the Japanese army had relied on a doctrine that
heroic determination would overcome the technology and other advantages of any foe. Thus, fierce Japanese
resistance extended these battles, as in the Battle of Guadalcanal, which raged on the Pacific island for six
months between August 1942 and February 1943 before Japan finally retreated.
The Japanese military made many missteps across the Pacific. An early attempt to capture part of the Aleutian
542 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       Islands failed. The defensive perimeters of Japan's home islands were constantly redrawn over 1942 and 1943.
       Without reevaluating its strategies, Japan transferred forces from China to plug holes punched in this
       perimeter. Its total losses in the China campaign, from its initial invasion in 1937 to its surrender in 1945,
       approached 500,000. (The Chinese lost as many as ten million. Historians disagree regarding how many
       millions of people were displaced by the war.) An attempted Japanese invasion of India beginning in March
       1944 was called off after massive losses in July 1944. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere began to
       evaporate into chaos and confusion. Because Prime Minister Hideki Tojo was the face of the war party both
       abroad and at home, it seemed clear that no peace settlement with the Allies was conceivable if he were in
       power. Therefore, in July 1944, having lost the support of the emperor for the failure of his strategies, Tojo was
       forced to resign.
       Though the war proved devastating to China, with a severe loss of population, it was able to continue its fight
       against the Japanese. The western Allied powers hoped China could play a major role in defeating the Axis
       powers. To that end, Chiang Kai-shek was invited to a conference in Cairo along with other Allied leaders in
       1943. In the last phase of the war, Chinese forces were able to advance through Burma and reopen the major
       road between China and India. Further offensives took back other Japanese-held territory. By the end of the
       war, China had reclaimed all the land Japan had occupied and emerged as a significant country in world
       affairs.

      South and Southeast Asia

       As Japan moved through Southeast Asia, it promised the inhabitants that it ultimately supported independent
       governments there. In fact, new governments were established in Vietnam, Burma, and other places, and
       though they were always clearly under the thumb of the Japanese military, there was some optimism that "Asia
       for Asians" might prove to truly work (Figure 13.13).

FIGURE 13.13 Japan in Southeast Asia. In an effort to drive the British out of their colonial possessions in South
Asia and gain control of them for their own use, the Japanese launched numerous attacks in the region. This map
shows that the Japanese focused their offensive in the region on Burma in particular. (credit: "Pacific War - Southern
Asia 1942" by U.S. Army/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
In many ways, however, the colonial experience continued for these areas, because their natural resources
were simply redirected to the Japanese government's needs rather than to Europe's. Japanese occupation
proved abusive and high-handed, marked by the denigration of local religions and customs and sometimes by
physical abuse, such as against workers building the Burma-Thailand Railway. It became clear to many
nationalists that they now had an enemy in the Japanese. In Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh raised his nationalist (and
communist) forces against the Japanese in a guerrilla war aided by the United States. In Malaysia, similar
guerrilla movements developed to oust the Japanese.
The 1935 India Act had granted significant autonomy to the British provinces of India and introduced directly
elected provincial assemblies. Fascism, communism, and nationalist desires for full independence all gained
adherents among Indians beginning to more fully engage in politics. The political parties in India were either
frustrated over broken British promises or anxious to see what rewards India might obtain for active and full
support of Britain. For example, the Muslim League often leveraged its support for Britain for political
advantage against the Hindu majority population.
Meanwhile, by mid-1940, anti-British sentiments had begun to erupt across India. In the summer of 1942,
while Japanese and Allied forces were sparring in neighboring Burma, Britain's security concerns about India
grew, and its attempts to repress Indian agitation heightened political tensions there. In August 1942, the
Congress Party, the largest political party in India, granted leadership to the committed nationalist Mohandas
(Mahatma) Gandhi and supported his nonviolent "Quit India" movement. Immediately the British arrested
544 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       Gandhi and other Congress Party leaders and detained them through most of the war.

       A devastating famine in Bengal reached a peak in 1943. It was caused by the dispatch of Indian food supplies
       to support the war effort in Europe, natural disasters toward the end of 1942, an influx of refugees fleeing the
       Japanese offensives in Burma, and general governmental mismanagement. The famine added fuel to the
       Indian desire for independence.

       Continuing to assert its intention to liberate Asia from White rule, Japan successfully recruited the support of
       the Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose, a political rival of Gandhi and former president of the Indian
       National Congress. Bose assembled a Free India Legion of fighters that eventually grew into the Indian
       National Army (INA), about forty thousand strong. Fighting to liberate India, the INA assisted Japanese military
       operations in Burma. When the Japanese seized the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal in 1942, they set up
       Bose as the leader of the Provisional Government (Azad Hind) of India, and the State of Burma became another
       subordinate partner and ally in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere until Japan's defeat in 1945.

      The Holocaust

       Jewish people had been deeply assimilated into German society and culture since the Enlightenment. But anti-
       Semitism had been an undercurrent in European history for centuries, and anti-Jewish propaganda and
       scapegoating began to surface after Germany's defeat in World War I. It continued through the encouragement
       of the Nazis in the 1920s and 1930s. Joseph Goebbels was the master of Nazi propaganda, charged with
       convincing Germans that Jewish people were an existential threat. A constant drumbeat in all forms of media
       began, persuading Germans to accept three propositions meant to morally justify anti-Jewish actions. First,
       Jewish people were a problem. Second, they were like vermin (a tactic of dehumanization). Third, eliminating
       them would make for a better Germany and a better world.

       When the Wehrmacht streamed into Poland in 1939 and encountered the largest Jewish population in the
       world, the Nazis had the opportunity to begin the genocide known as the Holocaust on a huge scale. Special
       execution squads called the Einsatzgruppen ("operational groups") followed the advancing German troops,
       killing enemies and undesirables--largely Jewish people. Jewish people were gathered in ghettoes for better
       control and subjected to forced labor. The largest was the Warsaw ghetto, which by 1941 housed 441,000
       people. That same year, six major concentration camps were established, and railroad lines were built
       specifically to transport prisoners to them. There had been anti-Jewish pogroms (massacres) in Poland before
       the war, and some Polish citizens joined these German extermination activities.

                                                                                                  IN THEIR OWN WORDS

       Einsatzgruppen

         Following Germany's surrender in May 1945, a military court was convened in the city of Nuremberg to try
         Germans accused of war crimes. During questioning by Colonel John Harlan Amen, a U.S. Army intelligence
         officer and lawyer, Otto Ohlendorf described the work of Einsatzgruppen in the Soviet Union. (Ohlendorf, thirty-
         eight years of age, who was head of the Nazi agency in charge of intelligence and security, was found guilty of war
         crimes and executed.)

               COL. AMEN: What were [the] instructions with respect to the Jews and the Communist functionaries?

               OHLENDORF: The instructions were that in the Russian operational areas of the Einsatzgruppen the
               Jews, as well as the Soviet political commissars, were to be liquidated.

               COL. AMEN: And when you say "liquidated" do you mean "killed?"

        OHLENDORF: In the year between June 1941 to June 1942 the Einsatzkommandos [men working for
        the Einsatzgruppen] reported ninety thousand people liquidated.

        COL. AMEN: On what pretext, if any, were they rounded up?
        OHLENDORF: On the pretext that they were to be resettled.
        COL. AMEN: Will you continue?
        OHLENDORF: After the registration the Jews were collected at one place; and from there they were later
        transported to the place of execution, which was, as a rule an antitank ditch or a natural excavation. The
        executions were carried out in a military manner, by firing squads under command.
        COL. AMEN: In what way were they transported to the place of execution?
        OHLENDORF: They were transported to the place of execution in trucks, always only as many as could
        be executed immediately. In this way it was attempted to keep the span of time from the moment in
        which the victims knew what was about to happen to them until the time of their actual execution as
        short as possible.
        COL. AMEN: Was that your idea?
        OHLENDORF: Yes.
        . . .
        OHLENDORF: Some of the unit leaders did not carry out the liquidation in the military manner, but killed
        the victims singly by shooting them in the back of the neck.
        COL. AMEN: And you objected to that procedure?
        OHLENDORF: I was against that procedure, yes.
        COL. AMEN: For what reason?
        OHLENDORF: Because both for the victims and for those who carried out the executions, it was,
        psychologically, an immense burden to bear.

The concentration camps were simultaneously labor and death camps. In 1941, Adolf Eichmann, a leader of
the German SS (the Nazi Party's elite paramilitary corps), noted the challenges of the coming winter: "the Jews
can no longer be fed. It is to be seriously considered whether the most humane solution might not be to finish
546 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       off those Jews not capable of labour by some sort of fast-working preparation." In January 1942 at the Wannsee
       Conference, the Final Solution to the "Jewish question" was discussed. It was decided that German state policy
       would be to eliminate European Jewish people by working them to death, starving them, or otherwise
       exterminating them. They were persecuted in place or sent to death camps.

       Auschwitz in western Poland was the largest of the death camps, originally constructed in 1940 to hold Polish
       political prisoners. It became a death camp in 1941 when Polish and Soviet prisoners were executed there.
       That same year, a new camp (known as Auschwitz II or Birkenau) was built nearby. Its main purpose was to kill
       Jewish people who were brought on freight trains from all over Europe. Other camps also existed at Auschwitz,
       including labor camps where prisoners worked for the chemical company I.G. Farben. Some 1.3 million people
       were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau before Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, ordered the camp closed and
       evacuated in January 1945 as the Soviet army rapidly advanced on it. Of these 1.3 million, 1.1 million would
       die there. The vast majority, nearly one million, were Jewish. Most were murdered with poisonous gas, usually
       immediately upon arrival. Others were shot or beaten to death or died from disease, starvation, or exhaustion
       caused by hard labor.

       Other gas chambers were constructed at Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka in 1942, and arriving prisoners
       deemed unsuitable for work were usually sent almost directly to the "showers," actually gas chambers. The
       systematic implementation of these policies required the collaboration of tens of thousands of people from
       across Europe, which culminated in the murder of more than six million Jewish people and at least three
       million members of other minority groups, including gay and Roma people, communists, socialists, and
       Jehovah's Witnesses, before the war was over. Historians disagree about how many died in the camps, and the
       true number will likely never be known.

       There were many instances of resistance, such as the Warsaw ghetto uprising in 1943. This was ruthlessly
       crushed by the Germans, however, resulting in the deaths of thirteen thousand Jewish people. Unsuccessful
       uprisings also took place in three of the concentration camps, one of which, in Sobibor, perhaps saved some
       lives by forcing the closure of the camp. Beginning in 1942, Irena Sendler, a member of the Polish
       Underground Resistance, participated in the Great Action in the Warsaw ghetto to smuggle out Jewish
       children. She is credited with saving some 2,500 children before she was discovered. Oskar Schindler, a
       member of the Nazi Party, ran a factory in Poland and worked to shield his Jewish workers from the Nazis,
       saving the lives of thousands. Loukas Karrer, the mayor of the Greek island Zakynthos, saved the island's
       entire Jewish population of 275 by refusing to surrender them and then hiding them. In Bulgaria, Dimitar
       Peshev, the deputy speaker of the National Assembly, had supported anti-Semitic legislation, but he refused to
       accept the German request to deport forty-eight thousand Jews and got the government to rescind the order.
       Still, the Nazis sent millions to their deaths.

were. They often coped with shortages of needed items and new workloads as the conflict continued year after
year. Research also continued at home as the countries engaged in the war sought to gain an advantage over
one another. As a result, new technologies and scientific understandings emerged that affected not only the
war and its outcome but the postwar global society as well.

Life on the Home Fronts

For European countries in World War II, the distance between the battlefield and the home front was often very
short or nonexistent. Total war, fought using all available resources with no restrictions on weapons or their
targets, took the conflict to millions. The occupation of territory and the resulting resistance movements
meant that homes, farms, and factories became minor battlefields. Places farther from actual combat, in Africa
and the Americas, were more traditional home fronts.

Partisan resistance groups sprang up, the largest among the Dutch, the French, the Polish, the Soviets, and the
Yugoslavs. On December 7, 1941, Hitler responded to this resistance with his "Night and Fog Decree" in which
he stated that people threatening German security should disappear into the night and fog. Consequently,
thousands of brutal reprisals for resistance were visited on local populations. In the Kragujevac massacre in
October 1941, Germans killed 2,700 Serbians in retaliation for a partisan attack that had killed ten German
soldiers and wounded another twenty-six. Such brutality sometimes recruited more resistance. In Yugoslavia,
for example, German cruelty enabled Josip Broz Tito to recruit and lead 650,000 people against the Germans,
tie down thirty-five German divisions, and destroy eighteen thousand supply trains. In the Soviet Union, the
Germans faced perhaps 150,000 partisans. In the Netherlands, railroad workers went on strike in support of
Allied offensives in the winter of 1944, and the Germans retaliated by cutting off their food supplies, leading to
thirty thousand deaths by starvation.

The experiences of Europeans under German occupation varied greatly depending on their place of residence
(rural or urban), social class, and ethnicity, as well as on the state of the national economy. Since most
resources were funneled toward the Germans and away from local populations, much of Europe had to solve
the problems of food shortages, rationing, and black markets. In the more industrialized countries, German
policy sought to largely maintain the economies and just redirect them toward German needs. In Norway, for
example, the Nazi collaborator Vidkun Quisling ruled as minister president in partnership with Josef
Terboven, a German civilian administrator. The country lost all its foreign trade partners, and its entire
economy became tilted toward Germany. The result was that only about 40 percent of Norwegian production
was left for consumption by Norwegians, necessitating rationing (Figure 13.14).
548 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       FIGURE 13.14 Shortages and Rationing. Because occupied Norway's production was redirected to supplying
       German needs, Norwegians lined up for scarce and rationed goods in Oslo in 1942. (credit: modification of work

       Public Domain)
       Where economies were less modern, it was difficult to increase production. Laborers were lost, either through
       death or because they were sent to Germany to work. As many as twelve million forced laborers from twenty
       different countries, mostly in eastern and central Europe, fell under German control, further depressing the
       production of civilian goods. Despite German hopes, eastern Europe exported to Germany only 800,000 tons of
       bread over the course of the war, and hunger and starvation became common experiences for resident
       populations. In Greece, the appropriation of foodstuffs led to a famine that killed a quarter of a million people
       in the winter of 1941-1942, including 90 percent of the babies born.
       Across the globe, the rationing of food and products useful to the war effort affected life on the home fronts.
       The Germans instituted a four-year economic plan in 1936, and rationing began in August 1939. The first few
       years of the war brought little change in their standard of living, but by early 1945, rationing had grown
       uncomfortably tight. The Italians too had to adjust to rationing, which began in 1939 and progressively
       diminished the standard of living. In 1943, major labor strikes took place in protest against these measures in
       Italy, even in war-related industries. In the Soviet Union, the loss of Ukraine and other grain-producing areas
       necessitated strict rationing. China's agricultural economy had been severely disrupted by the Japanese
       invasion in the 1930s, and the war did little to improve the situation. Food shortages in Japan were severe, and
       by 1944, the population was surviving on eight ounces of rice a day.
       Rationing was a fact of life in Allied countries as well. In Britain in 1939, oil and gasoline were rationed first,
       then a year later foods such as bacon, butter, meat, cheese, and eggs were rationed. In 1940, the Ministry of
       Food established canteens in factories and schools throughout the country to provide food and regulate its
       distribution. In the United States, the Office of Price Administration had been established in August 1941. It
       commenced rationing sugar, meat, butter, gasoline, tires, and canned goods three weeks after Pearl Harbor.
       Many nations sent their children abroad to safer areas. During the blitz of London, one million British children

were evacuated to the countryside or to Canada. By 1942, the Germans, the Soviets, and the Japanese had sent
hundreds of thousands of children out of their major cities, and sometimes their civilian parents as well.

The governments of nearly all the combatants sooner or later assumed command of their economies to direct
labor and resources to their war efforts. As early as the mid-1920s, the Italian government had begun direct
intervention in the economy, and by 1939, Italy had the second-highest percentage of state-owned enterprises
in the world; only the Soviet Union had more. The Soviets had instituted state control and a centrally
commanded economy in 1928 with the goal of industrializing rapidly. When the Germans attacked, about a
third of the western portion of the nation, with most of the Soviet industrial base, fell into German hands. In
anticipation of a conflict with capitalist nations, the Soviets had begun to establish industrial bases east of the
Ural Mountains. During World War II, they intensified their efforts to save their industrial centers and moved
twenty-five hundred factories and twenty-five million people east of the Urals, out of reach of the Wehrmacht.
Steadily, Soviet productive capacity regained its balance and began to achieve impressive results.

Germany's four-year plan, begun in 1936, carried them into the early stages of the war, and in 1942 the
economy was kicked into high gear. The Luftwaffe had taken delivery of 8,300 aircraft in 1939, a number that
exploded to a peak of 39,800 by 1944. British factories similarly began turning out tens of thousands of planes
in the last years of the war. The Japanese shifted to turning out planes to defend the nation from air attacks,
and work on battleships and cruisers ceased altogether.

Government efforts to spur production led to nearly full employment in many nations. In the United States,
unemployment dropped from 15 percent in 1939 to 1 percent in 1943 as seventeen million new civilian jobs
were created. Workers achieved a nearly 100 percent increase in productivity and output. All these changes
transformed the human landscape as workers from across the United States, and increasingly women and
African Americans from the south, were drawn into defense industry work. Half the world's war production
came from the United States. The Lend-Lease program sent material and foodstuffs to forty Allied nations,
mainly Britain and the Soviet Union but also other nations from Brazil and Belgium to Iran and Uruguay.

Total war meant that the enemy's productive capabilities were fair targets for destruction. While the air raids
on Britain often targeted civilian locations, the Allies initially attempted a program of strategic bombing of Axis
locations in Europe. The plan was to disrupt industrial production, though reality often fell short of this goal.
Bombs missed targets and hit purely civilian ones or simply did not inflict the necessary damage on a factory.
Naples sustained nearly two hundred attacks from 1940 to 1944. The Royal Air Force conducted nighttime
bombing campaigns over German cities, similar to those Germany carried out over England. The multiday
attacks on Dresden by more than one thousand British and U.S. bombers in February 1945 dropped high
explosives and firebombs on the center of the city, destroying most of it and killing more than twenty-five
thousand people. Some of these bombing runs were deliberately aimed at civilian targets.

The danger air raids posed to civilians was clear. Air raids killed 60,000 British people and injured 86,000
during the Battle of Britain. Nationwide German wartime losses reached 305,000 killed and 800,000 injured,
with five million rendered homeless. The Allied bombing of Japan was severe as well. The U.S. Air Force
destroyed sixty-nine Japanese cities. The March 1945 raid on Tokyo alone killed between 80,000 and 100,000
people and destroyed the homes of a million more. By 1945, Japan was on the verge of economic collapse.

But life was more than just working in war plants and rationing. Everywhere people tried to maintain some
semblance of ordinary life through diversions and entertainment. Radio programming kept them informed
and entertained. In England, "We'll Meet Again," probably the most popular wartime song, came out in 1939.
The Germans banned jazz, but wherever they went, U.S. soldiers, known as GIs, introduced locals to jazz and
the jitterbug, popular back in the States.

Movies were produced everywhere as both propaganda and distraction. German, Italian, Japanese, and Soviet
films leaned heavily toward propaganda. Most German films were pro-war and heroic in theme, with
significant portions of anti-Semitic propaganda. In general, the Japanese discouraged distractions from the
550 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       war effort. Bars had their hours cut to restrict frivolous activities, but movie houses remained open. Japanese
       pro-war and propagandistic movies began to appear as early as 1937, starting with Marching Song about the
       fighting in China. Beginning in 1941 and often thereafter, many Japanese movies focused on Koreans who
       volunteered and heroically served the greater cause of Japan. Movie theater attendance in Britain increased 50
       percent in 1944 and 1945, and in the United States it also reached new highs.
       The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had unleashed a cascade of racist assumptions about the Japanese, and it
       was generally feared that Japanese Americans living in the United States might engage in espionage or
       sabotage. Executive Order 9066, issued by President Roosevelt in February 1942, authorized West Coast
       military commanders to exclude from designated military areas anyone deemed a threat to national security.
       It thus allowed the widespread forced relocation of tens of thousands of Japanese and Japanese American
       families into ten relocation camps administered by the War Relocation Authority from 1942 until 1946 (Figure
       13.15).

       FIGURE 13.15 The Enforcement of U.S. Executive Order 9066. This map shows the sites of relocation camps set up
       for forcibly displaced Japanese Americans during World War II. (credit: "Map of World War II Japanese American
       internment camps" by National Park Service/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       The internees at these camps, many of them U.S. citizens, were forced to abandon their homes and businesses,
       and most never recovered them. Conditions in the camps were bleak. Families were separated, and men were
       often sent to different locations for investigation and interrogation. Most internees complied, many desiring to
       show their loyalty to the United States. Some even volunteered for and were later enlisted in the army. Others,
       however, felt betrayed and denounced the United States. An even smaller group were deemed recalcitrant and
       repatriated to Japan during and after the war.
       In 1944, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the relocation, but in the early 1980s, the
       federal court system reconsidered the issue. Several Japanese Americans who had been convicted for not

complying with the executive order in the 1940s saw their convictions overturned, and in one case vacated.
Fred Korematsu, a U.S. citizen, had been arrested in 1942 for defying the exclusion order and fought the
abridgment of his civil liberties for forty years. His was one of the convictions finally overturned in the 1980s.
In 1988, the U.S. government formally apologized to the people who had been interned and awarded $20,000
in reparations to each survivor. In an interview in 2000, Korematsu said, "I'll never forget my government
treating me like this. And I really hope that this will never happen to anybody else because of the way they look,
if they look like the enemy of our country."

While most Latin American countries did not participate in combat in the war (Brazil was an exception), none
could avoid the harsh realities of the conflict. All became more dependent on trade with the United States and
were subject to the shortages, rationing, and price controls that came along with the dearth of needed items on
the home front. Some areas saw increased economic opportunity at home, such as Panama, where the canal
had become extremely busy during the war as goods were transferred from ocean to ocean.

Along with becoming a theater of battle in its northern lands, Africa was also drawn into World War II when
Africans were enlisted into the armies fighting fascism. More than a million African soldiers fought in Europe,
North Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific or provided labor for colonial forces during the war. Most were
forcibly recruited and paid far less than White European soldiers. The colonial holdings of the European
powers throughout the continent meant that Africa's resources were available for the war effort. African labor,
for instance, was essential in maintaining the production of such strategic materials as coal, tin, rubber, and
food. Mobilizing African comunities for support forced colonial regimes to deal with resentments associated
with rising prices, increased taxes, inflation, and control of the economies. Increased urbanization of the
continent also offered populations greater freedom of action and expression, calling colonialism into question.
Brazzaville was the capital of Free France (France's collected colonial territories) under Charles de Gaulle, and
issues of subjugation and racism came into stark relief. Many Africans saw their loyal contribution to the Allies
as a down payment for greater self-determination and independence after the war.

Women Mobilized for War

The status and roles of women underwent seismic shifts around the world because of the war. In belligerent
nations, with so many men sent to the far-flung fronts, women represented a large available pool of labor that
could be tapped, and they increased their participation in their nation's economies significantly.

In 1939, women made up 37 percent of the German workforce, but because the Nazis encouraged them to be
homemakers and resisted recruiting them to work, their participation in labor declined between 1939 and
1941. In 1942 when Germany geared up for war, however, more women went into the factories, and their share
of the workforce climbed to about 50 percent. From its initial rise to power, the German Nazi regime had also
promoted schemes to increase marriages and births, for which economic incentives were offered, while birth
control was outlawed.

By 1945, women in the Soviet Union constituted 55 percent of the total workforce. In addition, about 800,000
women served in frontline combat positions, mostly as medical workers. Lyudmila Pavlichenko was a sniper
credited with killing 309 enemies. The Soviet women's air unit called the Night Witches conducted more than
twenty-three thousand bombing runs during the war. The war years led to the death of as many as twenty-five
million Soviet citizens. Therefore, the role of motherhood also gained new importance during the war. In July
1944, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet created the Order of Maternal Glory and the title of Mother-Hero.
There were financial incentives for having two or more children.

The Japanese also rewarded women for having children. The 1940, National Eugenics Law prohibited abortion
or sterilization for any reason except eugenics (a discredited strategy that focused on cultivating desirable
characteristics in a population). Women were encouraged to marry young, have many children, and fulfill their
natural role as mothers. Those who did were rewarded, but women aged eighteen to twenty-five were also
conscripted into the labor force beginning in 1943.
552 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       The Japanese military held views about the needs of men and the subservience of women that led to a vast
       system of forced prostitution and sexual slavery. Korean and Chinese women were the first to suffer, but the
       system spread wherever Japanese troops were, victimizing perhaps as many as 400,000 women from China,
       Korea, and elsewhere in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This type of treatment helped spur many
       women to embrace the activism encouraged by the Chinese Communist Party and to celebrate anti-Japanese
       actions. The nature and scope of the crimes against these "comfort women" remain controversial long after the
       war.

                                                                                 THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT

        Uncomfortable Controversies

         In the early 1990s, surviving Korean victims of sexual exploitation by the Japanese military went to court in
         Japan demanding recognition of their plight and compensation from the government. Through years of litigation,
         the Japanese court system consistently rejected their claims. The issue was revived in 2016 when twelve
         surviving "comfort women" (as they were called) entered South Korean courts to seek justice. In January 2021,
         the Seoul Central District Court rendered a decision in their favor and ordered the Japanese government to pay
         them $91,800 each. The Japanese government again rejected this ruling, and people on the political right in
         Japan, including former prime minister Shinzo Abe, argued that the women had not been forced into anything.
         The charges leveled by the women were only one of the issues remaining from World War II with which Japan
         has yet to come to terms. Both while in office and afterward, Japanese prime ministers have paid visits to
         Yasukuni Shrine to honor soldiers who died in World War II, including men convicted of war crimes such as
         Hideki Tojo. Japanese history textbooks, which must be approved by the Ministry of Education, largely ignore the
         existence of the comfort women and have downplayed or denied the role of the Japanese military in forcing
         civilians on the island of Okinawa to commit suicide rather than surrender after the U.S. victory there in March
         1945.

           · Why do you think these issues still exist?
           · Why might the Japanese government wish to deny or downplay actions of Japanese troops during the war?

       In 1941, all British women between eighteen and fifty years old were declared available for national service.
       The Women's Land Army recruited eighty thousand women for agricultural work on Britain's farms, and
       400,000 served in some other form of civil defense. Eventually, eight million women participated in the British
       war effort.
       Encouraged by their government to think of all jobs as war jobs, six and a half million American women
       entered the labor force during the conflict and made up 50 percent of it by the war's end. Three million
       members of the Women's Land Army planted and harvested food. Women also took their places behind desks
       in hundreds of thousands of government and office jobs and in industries where few women had made inroads
       in the past. By 1944, for instance, the number of women in the banking industry had doubled to about 130,000
       employees. The now-famous "Rosie the Riveter" poster expressed the commitment and competence of women
       stepping into industrial jobs to replace the men who had gone to war (Figure 13.16). Nearly 350,000 women
       also served in some branch of the U.S. military during the war.

Scientists at War

World War II, like World War I, brought about scientific and technological developments that soon became
matters of life and death. The nature of total war itself prompted a transformation in the relationship between
states and scientists. Governments invested in the development of lethal and nonlethal technologies that
ultimately became essential to the war and national security. In the fall of 1939, the British scientific
community rapidly shifted its focus from matters of pure research to work aiding the war effort.
Advances in the understanding of radio waves led to the development of radar, providing advance warning of
enemy attacks. Other advances injected more and better electronics such as microwaves and early versions of
digital computing devices into a wide range of military applications, laying the foundation for the commercial
proliferation of electronics into everyday life after the war. Allied efforts to break the Nazi spy codes inspired
the birth of the first rudimentary computers. The British mathematician Alan Turing and a team of scientists
working for the British Secret Service set out to break the seemingly unbreakable Nazi Enigma code. In the
process, they built an electromagnetic device that could cycle through hundreds of thousands of possible key/
letter combinations in intercepted Nazi messages and eventually succeeded in breaking the code. Another
breakthrough in computing was ENIAC, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, which was first
developed to calculate artillery trajectories for the U.S Army and performed its calculations at electronic, not
mechanical, speed. It is estimated that by 1955, ENIAC had completed more calculations than humans had
ever solved to date.

Long-term results of World War II include the beginning of computerization. Alan Turing predicted that
someday machines would be able to pass the Turing test, which he called the imitation game. That is,
machines would behave in ways that were indistinguishable from human actions. This video explains the
Turing test (https://openstax.org/l/77TuringTest) in more detail. Presented in this video is an example of the
logic of artificial intelligence (https://openstax.org/l/77AILogic) as demonstrated in "Sophia answers the

       Advances were made in life-saving scientific and medical techniques as well. A major medical development
       during the war improved the use and mass production of the antibiotic penicillin. Another life-saving advance
       was the achievement of Charles Drew, an African American physician who developed the process of rendering
       blood plasma, making it easier to store it for longer periods of time and offering an effective replacement for
       whole-blood transfusions. But racial bias entered the picture in 1941 when the American Red Cross agreed
       with a War Department decision to label blood and plasma as either "White" or "Negro." Dr. Drew resigned
       from the National Blood Bank as a result of this racist and unscientific policy.

       Few developments were more dramatic than the massive mobilization of scientific and civilian resources for
       the building of the atomic bomb. In December 1938, German physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann
       accidentally split atoms and discovered nuclear fission. A few months later, the Germans established a secret
       weapons program called the Uranium Club to create an atomic bomb. Seeing the implications of Hahn's work,
       German-born physicist Albert Einstein, who had recently immigrated to the United States, sent a letter to
       President Roosevelt that had been written by physicist Leo Szilard, warning Roosevelt of this research and
       urging an increased U.S. commitment to conducting its own.

       By the late 1930s, British and other scientists became convinced that an atomic bomb was possible, and teams
       of physicists, some of them refugees from Nazi Germany, assembled and began experiments with nuclear
       chain reactions, the catalysts of an atomic explosion. In August 1942, the U.S. government boosted this effort
       with its top-secret Manhattan Project. At dozens of sites across the United States, from Los Alamos in New
       Mexico to Oak Ridge in Tennessee and Hanford in Washington State, 600,000 workers embarked on a frenetic
       race to build the world's first atomic bomb. Meanwhile, Germany and Japan were also attempting to build their
       own. The German effort was hindered by technical and other problems. For example, top German scientists
       had fled Germany, and some were assisting the Manhattan Project. Further, Hitler preferred to support the
       development of V2 bombers for the air war with England rather than an atomic bomb. In 1941, the Japanese
       commissioned physicist Yoshio Nishina to begin working on an atomic bomb, calling the project Ni-Go. But
       lacking any information shared by the Germans and suffering under successful U.S. air raids, the project did
       not make much progress.

       Eventually, in July 1945, the Manhattan Project bore fruit, and a bomb was successfully detonated in the
       Trinity Test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. William L. Laurence, the official historian of the project, described
       this first successful trial of an atomic weapon: "On that moment hung eternity. Time stood still. Space
       contracted to a pinpoint. It was as though the earth had opened and the skies split. One felt as though they had
       been privileged to witness the Birth of the World--to be present at the moment of Creation when the Lord Said:
       Let there be light." President Roosevelt had died suddenly in April 1945, succeeded by Vice President Harry S.
       Truman. It fell to Truman to decide whether to use the new weapon or not.

       might arise. The future of the globe itself seemed to hang in the balance if humans could not avoid using
       violence to solve their problems. However, the use of nuclear weapons to end the fighting in the Pacific meant
       the postwar world had to grapple with new ethical and technological concerns. The rebuilding of war-torn and
       defeated countries added a new dimension to what victory looked like.

Victory in Europe and Plans for Peace

For more than five years after they met in Newfoundland and produced the Atlantic Charter's plan for the end
of the conflict, Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged more than 1,700 letters and messages and held many high-
level meetings to closely coordinate their efforts at every level. At a specialized conference held at Bretton
Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, representatives of forty-four Allied countries together hammered out the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund, both intended
to secure economic security and stability after the war.

As Allied troops marched toward the German border, however, their coalition began to fray. On a visit to Stalin
late in 1944, Churchill signed the Percentages Agreement in which the two decided to divide up eastern
Europe into spheres of influence, with Britain getting a 90 percent share of Greece, the USSR getting 90
percent of Romania, and both holding 50 percent of the political power in Hungary and Yugoslavia. Churchill
thought Stalin should burn the document afterward because "it might be thought rather cynical if it seemed we
had disposed of these issues, so fateful to millions of people, in such an offhand manner."

Finally, several months after the Soviet victory at Kursk, General Eisenhower prepared to open a second front
in the European theater of the war. By May 1944, the German military was facing a dilemma. The Soviet Red
Army was relentlessly rolling back German positions in the east, and it seemed obvious that the British and
U.S. troops were preparing for an invasion of the continent. Given the brutality of the battles on the eastern
front, the Germans chose to retain 228 divisions to counter the Soviets and assigned the defense of Europe to
fifty-eight divisions, only fifteen of which were in the vicinity of Normandy, France.

Normandy, however, was the secret site of the coming invasion. After months of assembling and training
troops, the Allies began their invasion of France at 2 a.m. on June 6, 1944--D-Day. Having assumed
responsibility for nearly every detail but not convinced he had done enough, Eisenhower wrote a letter of
resignation the night before in case things did not go well. But they did. By the second day of the operation,
approximately 160,000 Allied troops with considerable armor were linking up in a continuous line through
Europe and punching holes in German defenses. Paris was liberated just two months later.

A race to capture Berlin then began, with Allied generals vying for the honor of getting there first. As British
and U.S. troops approached from the west, the Soviets closed in on the city from the east. While clearing out
German forces west of the Rhine River, Eisenhower decided to pause for resupply and prepare for the final
push to Berlin.

Hitler believed there might still be hope for a German victory if he could divide the Allied armies from each
other. Four days later. he committed 200,000 troops, one thousand tanks, and large numbers of aircraft to the
Battle of the Bulge in a forested region of the western front. Eisenhower later admitted the Germans had
indeed achieved a tactical surprise in this offensive by penetrating Allied defenses by some fifty miles. Despite
the German successes, however, he felt that by capitalizing on their fatigue, he could stem the tide of the war.
Germany had in fact suffered major losses in what proved to be their final European offensive and another
turning point in the war.

With the conflict nearing its end, the Big Three met again to plan the peace at the Yalta Conference in the
Soviet Crimea from February 4 to 11, 1945 (Figure 13.17). Roosevelt's agenda asked for Soviet support in the
U.S. Pacific War against Japan, specifically in invading Japan. He also hoped for support for the creation of a
new institution--the United Nations--that would be modeled on the premise of collective security but would be
a stronger body than the League of Nations had been. Churchill pressed for free elections and democratic
governments in eastern and central Europe (specifically Poland), while Stalin demanded a Soviet sphere of
political influence in eastern and central Europe.

       Stalin promised free elections in Poland, despite having recently installed a government in Polish territories
       occupied by the Red Army. His preconditions for the Soviet Union's declaring war against Japan were U.S.
       recognition of Mongolian independence from China and of Soviet interests in the Manchurian railways and
       Port Arthur. These were agreed upon without Chinese representation or consent, and Stalin promised that the
       Soviet Union would enter the Pacific War three months after the defeat of Germany. Roosevelt met Stalin's
       price in the hope that the USSR could be dealt with after the war via the United Nations, which the Soviets had
       agreed to join.
       In the Declaration on Liberated Europe, the three leaders agreed that all original governments would be
       restored in the invaded countries (except France, Romania, and Bulgaria and the Polish government-in-exile in
       London), and that all displaced civilians would be repatriated. Other key points of the meeting were
       reaffirmation of the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, and of the division of Germany and Berlin into
       three occupied zones (later expanded to four).
       Germany was to undergo demilitarization and denazification and make reparations, partly in the form of
       forced labor by German prisoners of war and others who would work in agricultural and industrial roles in
       both Eastern and Western Europe after the war. At the same time, Nazi war criminals were to be hunted down
       and brought to justice. Stalin insisted that given the pain and destruction the Germans had visited upon the
       Soviet Union, reparations ought to go to the nation that had suffered the most. Resolution of this issue was
       postponed to a future conference. After Yalta, Eisenhower conferred with Moscow and laid out a plan, adhering
       to the Yalta Agreement, for the exact placement of the postwar occupation zones in Berlin. Eisenhower knew
       the German leaders were preparing to move to another city, making Berlin of only psychlogical significance.
       On April 30, 1945, Hitler and his wife of one day, Eva Braun, committed suicide. Various German commanders
       then began surrendering to Soviet or Allied forces. Hermann Göring surrendered on May 6, and the next day
       the chief of staff of German forces, General Alfred Jodl, unconditionally surrendered all German forces. Victory

in Europe had been achieved.
Advancing Soviet armies had begun the process of liberating the death camps in July 1944, and in January
1945, they freed those held in Auschwitz. In April, U.S. and British units liberated Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen,
and Dachau. Eisenhower and his staff went into the camps on a number of occasions. To make sure the world
became aware of German inhumanity, Eisenhower arranged for American and British reporters to tour the
camps as well.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki

Early in 1945, the Japanese army and navy agreed to adopt the first joint operational plan in their histories.
Operation Ten-go ("heaven") called for suicide attacks by land and air units for defense in the Pacific, and a
month later these attacks were combined with the shukketsu ("bleeding") strategy in the Battle of Iwo Jima.
Throughout the war, the Japanese had believed that high casualties would dishearten U.S. troops, who they felt
could not tolerate suffering and loss. On Iwo Jima, the Japanese sacrificed twenty-one thousand soldiers and
inflicted twenty-six thousand casualties on U.S. Marines (seven thousand were killed and the rest wounded).
But the U.S. troops persisted and again absorbed high casualties as they later captured Okinawa. Japan's
struggle for Okinawa included the use of the island's civilians, resulting in the death of 100,000 and
demonstrating the resolve to be expected from the Japanese in defense of their main islands (Figure 13.18).

The slogan gyokusai ("honorable death"), combined with shukketsu and commitment to the emperor, was
558 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

       exemplified by the kamikaze or suicide pilots, essentially human bombs trying to fend off U.S. naval forces. In
       the face of such near-fanatical defensive efforts, U.S. secretary of war Henry L. Stimson and General George C.
       Marshall, the U.S. Army chief of staff, estimated that an invasion of Japan could cost between 500,000 and one
       million U.S. casualties and last well into 1946. President Truman was briefed on these estimates, and they were
       widely discussed among the military planning circles and staff. Japan's leaders, however, refused to consider
       an unconditional surrender that, among other things, may have led to the emperor's being tried for war
       crimes. They came to the conclusion that an invasion of the home islands was inevitable. Private and secret
       initiatives were floated to persuade the Soviet Union to mediate with the United States and Britain to end the
       war.

       Between July 17 and August 2, 1945, the final Allied summit conference took place at Potsdam, a suburb of
       Berlin. This time, Harry S. Truman replaced the late Franklin Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill was replaced
       by Britain's newly elected prime minister Clement Attlee. Truman was already troubled by Soviet actions in
       Europe. He disliked the concessions Roosevelt had made that allowed the Soviets to install a communist
       government in Poland. He also disapproved of Stalin's plans, made known at the Yalta Conference, to demand
       large reparations from Germany. Truman feared the resulting burden on Germany might lead to another cycle
       of rearmament and aggression.

       After issuing a demand for the unconditional surrender of Japan, the conference turned toward the fate of
       postwar Europe. The Allied leaders agreed to demilitarize Germany and to divide the conquered nation and its
       capital of Berlin into four occupation zones: three in the west to be controlled by Britain, France, and the
       United States, and one in the east for the USSR. An Allied Control Council was created to administer occupied
       Germany, though the choice to make the council's decisions unanimous later proved unrealistic. The German
       economy was to be decentralized and focused on agriculture and nonmilitary industries.

       The debates about reparations stemming from the Yalta Conference were settled with a plan to exchange
       Germany's western industrial production for its eastern agricultural production. In practice, however, this plan
       led to economic policies being instituted and managed by zones rather than for the nation as a whole, creating
       further disunity among the Allies. Finally, a program of denazification for Germany and Austria was confirmed
       that included punishment of war criminals. The settlement of the final borders of Poland was postponed, but
       Britain and the United States agreed to the transfer of designated German territory to Poland.

       Truman had known little about the Manhattan Project before becoming president and now relied on the advice
       of his experts. They shared a widely held faith in the justice of the U.S. cause and accepted technological
       approaches to ending the war. Informed of the success of the Trinity Test while at the conference, Truman
       noted his thinking about using the bomb in his July 25, 1945, diary entry. He favored using it only against
       military targets, not civilian ones:

             This weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10. I have told the secretary of war,
             Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women
             and children. Even if Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless, and fanatic, we as the leader of the world
             for the common welfare cannot drop this terrible bomb on the old capital or the new. He and I are in
             accord. The target will be a purely military one and we will issue a warning statement asking the Japs
             to surrender and save lives. I'm sure they will not do that, but we will have given them the chance. It is
             certainly a good thing for the world that Hitler's crowd or Stalin's did not discover this atomic bomb. It
             seems to be the most terrible thing ever discovered, but it can be made the most useful.

       The bomb was used, first against Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and three days later on Nagasaki, both cities
       populated by civilians including women and children.

       A variety of factors likely influenced Truman in making his decision. The desire to save American lives
       perhaps played the greatest role. The desire to justify the expense of the Manhattan Project also likely
       influenced him. Some have suggested that Truman hoped to demonstrate to the Soviet Union the technological

superiority of the United States. Others believe that a desire for revenge for Pearl Harbor also played a role.
Some have suggested that a long history of anti-Asian sentiment in the United States made the use of the
atomic bomb against Japan seem less horrific than its use against Europeans would have been.

                                                                                                    DUELING VOICES

 Dropping the Atomic Bomb

  When it became clear that the Manhattan Project had been successful, a panel of scientists led by Robert
  Oppenheimer, the project's head, made recommendations about the weapon they had created in a report dated
  June 16, 1945. A month later, physicist Leo Szilard and sixty-nine other scientists and technicians at the
  Manhattan Project's Chicago laboratory petitioned President Truman to use caution when deciding how to deploy
  the bomb.

        The initial use of the new weapon . . . in our opinion, should be such as to promote a satisfactory
        adjustment of our international relations. At the same time, we recognize our obligation to our nation to
        use the weapons to help save American lives in the Japanese war.

        (1) To accomplish these ends we recommend that before the weapons are used not only Britain, but
        also Russia, France, and China be advised that we have made considerable progress in our work on
        atomic weapons, that these may be ready to use during the present war, and that we would welcome
        suggestions as to how we can cooperate in making this development contribute to improved
        international relations.

        (2) The opinions of our scientific colleagues on the initial use of these weapons are not unanimous . . . .
        Those who advocate a purely technical demonstration would wish to outlaw the use of atomic weapons,
        and have feared that if we use the weapons now our position in future negotiations will be prejudiced.
        Others emphasize the opportunity of saving American lives by immediate military use, and believe that
        such use will improve the international prospects . . . . We find ourselves closer to these latter views; we
        can propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war; we see no acceptable
        alternative to direct military use.

        --Recommendations on the Immediate Use of Nuclear Weapons

        The war has to be brought speedily to a successful conclusion and attacks by atomic bombs may very
        well be an effective method of warfare. We feel, however, that such attacks on Japan could not be
        justified, at least not unless the terms which will be imposed after the war on Japan were made public in
        detail and Japan were given an opportunity to surrender.

        If such public announcement gave assurance to the Japanese that they could look forward to a life
        devoted to peaceful pursuits in their homeland and if Japan still refused to surrender our nation might
        then, in certain circumstances, find itself forced to resort to the use of atomic bombs. Such a step,
        however, ought not to be made at any time without seriously considering the moral responsibilities
        which are involved.

        The development of atomic power will provide the nations with new means of destruction. The atomic
        bombs at our disposal represent only the first step in this direction, and there is almost no limit to the
        destructive power which will become available in the course of their future development. Thus a nation
        which sets the precedent of using these newly liberated forces of nature for purposes of destruction
        may have to bear the responsibility of opening the door to an era of devastation on an unimaginable
        scale.

        If after this war a situation is allowed to develop in the world which permits rival powers to be in
        uncontrolled possession of these new means of destruction, the cities of the United States as well as
560 13 · The Causes and Consequences of World War II

               the cities of other nations will be in continuous danger of sudden annihilation. . . .

               The added material strength which this lead gives to the United States brings with it the obligation of
               restraint and if we were to violate this obligation our moral position would be weakened in the eyes of
               the world and in our own eyes. It would then be more difficult for us to live up to our responsibility of
               bringing the unloosened forces of destruction under control.

       Little Boy, as the first atomic bomb was called, was dropped on Hiroshima from the U.S. bomber the Enola Gay.
       Survivors referred to August 6 as "the day of two suns"; the blast was so bright that it burned the shadows of
       victims into walls and concrete. More than seventy thousand people were killed instantly. Immediately
       afterward, the sky turned purple and gray, even black, from the dust and debris suspended in the air.
       Hundreds of wooden and paper houses were ignited. Thousands of shocked and confused people whose flesh
       had burned off began roaming about, almost instinctively moving toward any pool or stream of water. Over the
       following days, months, and even years, people continued to succumb to their wounds and injuries, bringing
       the total deaths to more than 100,000. Three days later, Fat Man, the second bomb, similarly descended upon
       Nagasaki, killing forty thousand Japanese immediately. Including the aftermath, deaths there totaled seventy
       thousand.

       Not everyone was horrified by the thought of the atomic bomb being used against Japan. But lyrics of the

       The song was released in 1945 after the bomb had been dropped.

       Meanwhile, keeping the promise made at Yalta, after the bombing of Hiroshima the Soviets broke their
       nonaggression pact with Japan and invaded Manchukuo and Korea. Japanese defenses there quickly crumbled
       in the face of tens of thousands of casualties, ending any hope that the Soviets might act as an intermediary in
       some negotiated settlement with the Allies. Japan surrendered shortly after.

      The Human Toll

       The end of the war saw the world grapple with the conflict's astronomical human toll. Germany had suffered
       5.5 million military deaths and lost as many as three million civilians. Japan lost 2.1 million military and
       another million civilians. China's military deaths can only be approximated but may have been as high as four
       million, with another sixteen million civilians. The United States and the United Kingdom emerged less
       battered, with 416,000 American and 384,000 British deaths. However, their ally the Soviet Union arguably
       suffered more than any other single country. Soviet military deaths were estimated at 8.8 to 10.7 million, and
       more than thirteen million civilian deaths were attributed to the war. Some of these deaths were the result of
       military actions; other Soviet civilians died of starvation or disease caused by wartime conditions. The German
       and Japanese surrenders ended the combat phase of the war. However, much work was needed to rebuild the
       world as the victors thought it should be.

The right-wing dictatorships in Spain and Portugal, by staying out of the actual conflict, were able to avoid the
reconstructive policies and action of the Allies. But fascism had been dealt a severe defeat in Europe.

The Soviets exacted retribution on the Germans largely by removing and transporting back to the Soviet Union
virtually anything they considered useful to rebuilding their own industrial sector destroyed by the war. Thus,
the Soviet occupation zone, which became the communist satellite of East Germany, was left with little to
sustain itself. The western Allies, wanting relief from the burden of supporting destitute Germans and their
largely destroyed economy, began to rebuild Germany's industries in their occupation zones. Stalin perceived
these efforts as a sign of greed, continued capitalist hostility to socialism, and the West's desire to dominate
the world economy.

Efforts were also made to establish some measure of justice via war crimes trials. In August 1945, Britain, the
Soviet Union, and the United States agreed to create the International Military Tribunal to try Germans
accused of committing war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity. The Nuremberg
Trials sought justice for Germany's crimes against humanity; they lasted through 1946. Twenty-two
individuals and seven Nazi organizations were indicted. Nineteen defendants were convicted and received
sentences ranging from fifteen years in prison to death by hanging. Three of the Nazi organizations were ruled
to be criminal organizations.

There remained the huge task of repatriating all those displaced by the war. Millions of people had been
shuttled around Europe by the Germans as they drew forced labor to Germany and dispatched Jewish people
and others to concentration/death camps. The Soviets demanded the return of all their citizens. The Allies
agreed to the controversial "Operation Keelhaul," whereby people who had cooperated with the Germans
against the Soviets, including Cossacks, Ukrainians, and Russians, were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet
Union with the probability of a harsh and possibly fatal reception. Millions of others were also forcibly moved
back to their "home" nations at the end of the war, such as Germans living in areas now belonging to Poland
who were forced to leave for Germany. The hope was that this would help avoid ethnic tensions that might lead
to another conflict. At the same time, 250,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust languished in camps for
displaced persons because their home countries refused to take them back. About eighty thousand were
eventually able to relocate to the United States, and more than 100,000 settled in the British Mandate of
Palestine.

The Aftermath: Japan

On August 10, 1945, in the wake of the atomic attacks and the Soviet invasion of Manchukuo, Japanese
Emperor Hirohito had informed his Privy Council that he accepted the Potsdam Declaration regarding Japan's
unconditional surrender, and soon thereafter the Allies were informed to that effect. Hirohito himself followed
up on August 15 with the first public broadcast any emperor had ever made to the Japanese people, saying he
would bear the pain of defeat and accept the Allied terms. A month later on September 2, General Yoshijir
Umezu, the army's chief of staff, signed a surrender document aboard the USS Missouri at anchor in Tokyo Bay
(Figure 13.19).

       As supreme commander for the Allied powers, General Douglas MacArthur was ordered to exercise authority
       during the Allied occupation of Japan through the Japanese governmental system, including Emperor
       Hirohito. MacArthur charged the Japanese government to immediately repeal the Peace Preservation Law,
       which allowed for the arrest of anyone perceived to be posing a threat to--or critical of--the Japanese
       government, and to begin open and free discussion of the entire Imperial government and its institutions.
       Political prisoners were released, and the Special Police were disbanded. On New Year's Day 1946, the
       emperor publicly disclaimed his divine status: "The ties between us and our people have always stood upon
       mutual trust and affection. They do not depend upon mere legends and myths. They are not predicated on the
       false conception that the Emperor is divine and that the Japanese people are superior to other races and fated
       to rule the world."
       In Tokyo, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East emerged from the Potsdam Declaration. (Since
       the Soviet Union had not declared war on Japan at that time, it was not a party to the agreement.) The trials
       began in 1946 and lasted until November 1948. Eighteen members of the Japanese military and nine senior
       politicians were indicted. All were found guilty but one, who was found mentally unfit to stand trial; six were
       executed and the rest sentenced to prison.
       For six years, from 1946 to 1952, the United States dominated the occupation of Japan. General MacArthur
       and his occupation authorities partnered energetically in almost all aspects of Japanese politics, economics,
       and society to try to reform and rebuild Japan. The overall goals of the occupation were demilitarization,
       democratization, and the fostering of respect for fundamental human rights. The Constitution imposed by
       MacArthur and his Government Section in 1947 was the sort of fundamental change no single group in Japan
       itself could have effected. The fact that it has survived virtually unchanged suggests that the Japanese
       themselves came to terms with it and bent the system to reflect their habits of mind and politics. The emperor

was made a figurehead, "the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people." Real sovereign power was
vested in the people via the Diet, an elected two-chamber legislature. An extensive Bill of Rights guaranteed
academic freedom, women's suffrage, the right to choose residence, collective bargaining, and full
employment.

Demilitarization was immediately begun, and the Japanese accepted that a realistic appraisal of world
conditions after World War II strongly suggested force was not a good way to protect Japan and secure access
to economic resources. The preamble to the Japanese Constitution begins, "We, the Japanese people, desire
peace for all time." Land reform began to make more small farmers owners of their farms instead of renters,
and union membership was supported in the industrial sector, but many large corporations remained and
were deliberately not broken up. Japan was severely limited militarily; no Japanese army was allowed, nor was
Japan permitted to go to war in the future.

Attempts took place across the globe to achieve some form of just and lasting peace. One glimmer of hope was
the United Nations, an international body agreed to by the Allied leaders during wartime conferences and
finally established in New York City in April 1945. The United Nations was pledged to "save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to
reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and
small . . . to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom."

Judicial actions in both Germany and Japan were the beginning of attempts to define such concepts as
genocide and crimes against humanity, as a way to counter the possibility that the conflict had actually
normalized total war, mass violence, brutalization, and totalitarianism. The war had also brought into stark
view the cruel consequences of racism and racist ideologies. Even liberal democracies could be poisoned by
such thinking, as was revealed in the United States by the groundless displacement of Japanese residents and
nationals and Japanese American citizens.

As another aftermath of the war, women worldwide found themselves enjoying some of the freedoms and
responsibilities of their fuller citizenship and participation in their nation's fortunes. And populations in Africa
and Asia, feeling they had earned liberation from prewar colonialism, began to reach for more self-
determination and national legitimacy. It was widely felt that the struggles and sacrifices of so many could not
and should not have been in vain.

Section Summary

13.1 An Unstable Peace

As the 1930s unfolded, it became clear that peace would not last for long. Japan's advances through China and
its violent attack on Nanjing showed that its military-dominated government would continue to press
aggressively for more territory.

The rise of fascism in Italy and Germany continued unchecked. The Nazis were able to manipulate the
situation to their diplomatic advantage and gain British and French acquiescence to the takeover of Austria
and the Sudetenland (in Czechoslovakia) before any war began. The outbreak of World War II unveiled the Nazi
military juggernaut, with several European countries quickly falling to Nazi control and Britain becoming an
embattled country that sought new support and assurances from the United States. The Japanese attack on the
U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in the Pacific in 1941 made the United States a full participant in the global war.

13.2 Theaters of War

The United States and Great Britain engaged Hitler in actions in North Africa throughout 1942. The Allied
successes there and in Italy helped destabilize Mussolini's fascist government in Rome, and he was removed
from power in 1943. On the eastern front, the Soviet Union fought protracted battles against the Nazis, with
significant losses of civilian and military lives.

The United States continued to move against Japan's holdings throughout the Pacific and was able to retake
numerous islands from the Japanese. These losses, especially at the Battle of Midway, called into question the
military control of the Japanese government. New concerns arose in areas like India, where anti-British
sentiment was growing. For some time, the Nazi government had been working toward the extermination of
the Jewish people and of others it deemed undesirable. The Holocaust claimed the lives of millions of people in

Europe.

13.3 Keeping the Home Fires Burning

The war had massive effects for those on the home front, whose lives changed drastically as rationing and
shortages became commonplace. Many nations had to mobilize their efforts to keep industry running and
materials reaching the troops on the front lines, which brought women into offices and factories in new
numbers. The focus on science and technology brought innovations such as radar, early computers, and
medical advancements into military applications. Not least was the Manhattan Project's work on atomic
energy, which led to the construction of the first nuclear weapons.

13.4 Out of the Ashes

Even before the end of the war, the Allied powers were confident that victory would come. In a series of
meetings, Allied leaders arranged the postwar world they envisioned, including by deciding how Germany
would be divided. In the Pacific theater of war, the showdown between the United States and Japan concluded
with the dropping of the first nuclear bombs, first at Hiroshima and then at Nagasaki. In the aftermath of the
conflict, it was clear just how much had been lost. Tens of millions of people had died. Nazi and Japanese war
criminals were put on trial. The governments of several countries were in shambles. But rebuilding did begin,
in Japan starting with a new constitution and a new focus on demilitarization and human rights.

INTRODUCTION In the period following World War II, leaders like Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev of the
Soviet Union and Mao Zedong of China (Figure 14.1) believed communism would light the way to a bright new
future for humankind. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries regarded
communism as a threat to freedom, instead placing their faith in capitalism and democracy to improve human
life. The ideological differences between these two groups of countries, and the global-scale struggle between
the Soviet Union and the United States for social, economic, technological, and military supremacy, divided the
world into mutually hostile spheres in the half-century following the war. Their antagonism played out in a real
but bloodless conflict known as the Cold War.

14.1 The Cold War Begins

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the origins of the Cold War
  · Analyze the effectiveness of the Truman Doctrine
  · Explain how U.S. foreign policy sought to prevent the spread of communism after World War II
  · Discuss the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact
Following the surrender of Germany in May 1945, the "Big Three" Allied nations of the Soviet Union, the
United Kingdom, and the United States began the massive task of recovering from the European phase of
World War II. However, by no means did they agree on the manner in which to do so, and their differences in
goals and political ideology threatened to plunge the world back into conflict almost as soon as it had emerged
from it.

The Superpowers Divided

In the summer of 1945, the world looked much different from the way it had five years before. Of all the great
powers, only the United States had been relatively unaffected by World War II. Its territory and national
infrastructure remained intact, its economy was strong, and its civilian population had gone unharmed. The
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), while badly bloodied, had also emerged relatively whole; its
immense size and population had spared it the scale of destruction suffered by the rest of Europe. Britain,
though pounded by German air raids, had escaped invasion, but it had been severely weakened by the war and
could no longer be the world leader it had been. It was about to be superseded by the United States and the
Soviet Union, whose ideological differences shaped the postwar world.
Postwar Goals

       the fore. For the United States, the ideal world was one in which democratically governed nations would coexist
       peacefully, enjoying economic prosperity thanks to capitalistic endeavors. In the Soviet Union's vision of the
       future, communism would lead the world's countries to a peaceful, prosperous future, and it would never again
       fear invasion from the lands to its west. The latter goal was the reason Stalin insisted on establishing satellite
       states in Eastern Europe, countries the Soviet Union would control by installing communist, pro-Soviet
       governments within them.

       At the Moscow Conference of 1944, which U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt did not attend, Prime Minister
       Winston Churchill agreed to let Stalin install Soviet-allied communist parties to control the governments of
       Romania and Bulgaria, which had been German allies during the war. In exchange, Stalin promised to leave
       control of the Balkans to the British. By the time the victorious Allies met in Potsdam in the summer of 1945 to
       finalize plans to partition Germany and its capital city of Berlin, Churchill no longer wished Stalin to exercise
       so much power in Eastern Europe. He warned the new U.S. president, Harry Truman, who was unaware of
       what had been agreed to at the Moscow Conference, of the danger of allowing the Soviets to control the region.
       But Stalin then consolidated his grip on Eastern Europe by placing a pro-Soviet government in power in
       Poland.

       In March 1946, in a speech in Fulton, Missouri, Churchill warned his audience that "an iron curtain" had cut
       Europe in two, trapping half the continent under Soviet domination. This division of the world into United
       States-allied and Soviet-allied halves characterized the Cold War, a contest for ideological, social, economic,
       technological, and military supremacy that lasted until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The war was
       "cold" because it did not include actual fighting between U.S. and Soviet forces. (A "hot" war is a conflict in
       which countries engage in armed conflict with one another.)

       The splintering of Europe that Churchill described deepened in 1948, when a government composed of both
       communists and non-communists in Czechoslovakia was toppled and replaced by an all-communist
       government loyal to Moscow. In 1949, Hungary also came under the control of a communist party closely allied
       with the Soviet Union.

       The chief strategy of the United States in the Cold War was containment--an effort to confine Soviet influence
       to Eastern Europe. Containment was first mentioned by George F. Kennan, a U.S. diplomat stationed in
       Moscow, in a message to the State Department known as the Long Telegram. Kennan described the Soviet
       government as paranoid and committed to a war against capitalism. Soviet leaders, he believed, could not be
       moved by reason and understood only force. Their attempts to spread communism must thus be met with
       strong resistance.

       The foreign policy goals of the Soviet Union following World War II were directly opposed to those of the United
       States. The USSR sought to protect itself and bolster its economy by strengthening its control over the
       communist states of Eastern Europe. It also encouraged communist revolution in other countries and
       maintained close ties with communist parties throughout the world. The Soviet Union regarded itself as the
       chief opponent of European and U.S. imperialism, and in this role, it supported independence movements in
       colonies in Asia and Africa. To the Soviet leadership, the United States was an aggressor nation bent upon
       world domination, and the spread of communism reduced the threat of future wars. To protect its own
       interests and those of its allies, the Soviet Union needed to be militarily and technologically superior.

       The Truman Doctrine

       The first test of U.S. resolve to counter the forces of communism came in 1947 in an unexpected place--Greece.

During World War II, resistance to the German army occupying Greece had come from both supporters of the
country's Communist Party and loyalists of its monarchical government. In 1944, shortly after the withdrawal
of the Germans, the occupying British forces and Prime Minister George Papandreou, who had returned from
exile, jointly called for the disarmament of these resistance groups, and violence erupted. In 1946, following
the triumph of monarchists in an election the Greek communists boycotted, civil war broke out. Communist
forces sought the overthrow of King George II and his government (Figure 14.4). To prevent this, Britain
provided the government with economic and military assistance, an extension of the aid it had given during
the war. In 1947, however, Britain announced that it would no longer do so, most likely because it was
experiencing economic problems.

The events in Greece worried the U.S. government. Neighboring Turkey was regarded as the gateway to the
Middle East and its crucial supplies of petroleum, upon which Western industry and transportation depended.
Truman feared that, should Greece become a communist country, a communist uprising might occur in
neighboring Turkey as well. This belief--that the neighbors of communist countries would in turn become
communist themselves--is known as the domino theory.
Both the United Kingdom and the United States were wary of Soviet activity in this region. In 1946, the Soviet
Union had demanded that Turkey allow it to take shipping through Turkish-controlled straits from the Black
Sea to the Mediterranean. When Turkey refused, the Soviets increased their naval presence in the Black Sea
and sent troops to the Balkans. The Soviet Union backed down and withdrew its forces when the U.S. bolstered
its own naval presence in the region.
576 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       The showdown in Turkey was the second time the postwar Soviet Union had found itself in conflict with its
       former allies. Earlier it had violated an agreement to withdraw from Iran, which it had occupied along with the
       British during World War II, by an agreed-upon date the British had honored. Truman now feared the Greek
       communists were not acting alone and that the Soviet Union was active in the country.

       However, Truman was mistaken in assuming all communists acted under the direction of the Soviet Union.
       The communist governments of Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia extended aid to the Greek communists, but
       most evidence indicates that the Soviet Union did not. The Soviets were largely uninterested in Greece, and at
       the Moscow Conference of 1944, Stalin had given control of Greece to Britain in exchange for the concessions
       that allowed him to decide the fate of Romania and Bulgaria. There is little to suggest that Stalin violated this
       agreement about Greece--until the United States got involved. Once the fate of Greece became of interest to
       Truman, Stalin took note of it as well.

       On March 12, 1947, Truman addressed Congress and requested aid for the governments of Greece and Turkey.
       He framed the appeal as part of the struggle against communism and argued that it was the duty of the United
       States to oppose "totalitarian regimes." Congress approved his request for $400 million (approximately $5
       billion in today's money). The president's pledge to help "free peoples" resist communist expansion, a promise
       that became known as the Truman Doctrine, formed the basis of U.S. foreign policy throughout the Cold War.
       Following the proclamation of the Truman Doctrine, Stalin channeled material support for the civil war to
       Greece's communists, but covertly.

       The Marshall Plan

       The U.S. effort to combat the expansion of communism also led to the creation of the European Recovery
       Program, named the Marshall Plan for Secretary of State George C. Marshall. In 1947, Marshall called for
       economic assistance to rebuild postwar Europe. Realizing the attractions of communism to impoverished,
       war-ravaged Europeans, Congress approved the Economic Cooperation Act in 1948 to pump an eventual total
       of $12 billion into Europe's economy (about $147 billion today). The funds were vital in assisting Western
       Europe as a whole to rebuild their infrastructure and restore their industrial capacity. Because necessary
       materials often needed to be purchased from the United States, aid given through the Marshall Plan also
       helped ensure that the U.S. economy did not slide into an economic depression now that the war had ended.

       U.S. aid was offered to all European nations, including Germany and the Soviet Union. Stalin, however, rejected
       it and forbade Eastern Europe's communist-governed states within the Soviet sphere of influence to accept it.
       Instead, the USSR proposed the Molotov Plan, which gave aid to and established trade agreements with the
       communist nations of Eastern Europe: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet
       zone in Germany that later became the German Democratic Republic, commonly known as East Germany.
       Finally, in 1949, the United States developed the Point Four Program to provide technical assistance to
       industrializing countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia for improving their standard of living.

      Western and Eastern Blocs

       The tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union that had built up slowly through the later 1940s
       came to a head in 1948. Believing a strong Germany was vital to Europe's economic recovery and a necessary
       bulwark against the spread of communism, the United States, Britain, and France planned to reunify the three
       zones of Germany they had occupied since the end of World War II. United, these zones would dwarf the Soviet
       zone in size, population, and wealth and, by sharing a single currency, play a major role in Europe's postwar
       economy.

       The Soviet Union hoped to keep Germany disunited and weak and thus objected. In March 1948, it withdrew
       from the Allied Control Council that coordinated Allied actions in Germany. In June, the United Kingdom and
       the United States introduced a new currency, the Deutschemark, into their zones as well as into the western
       portions of Berlin they controlled, in order to dispense Marshall Plan funds. Infuriated, the Soviet Union cut off
       all ground routes into West Berlin. No food or fuel could enter the city by road, railroad, or canal. The Soviets

planned to starve the Western Allies out, forcing them to abandon their sections of Berlin and thus their
toehold within the Soviet zone.
Realizing that air was their only way around the blockade, the United Kingdom and the United States swiftly
formulated plans to supply the besieged city by plane. For nearly a year, they carried out the Berlin Airlift, an
extensive operation that at one point had a British or U.S. plane taking off from Berlin's Tempelhof Airport
every forty-five seconds (Figure 14.5). Recognizing they could not defeat the resolve of the Western Allies, the
Soviets ended the blockade in May 1949. Two weeks later, the Western Allies unified their occupation zones to
form the new country of the Federal Republic of Germany, usually referred to as West Germany, with the city of
Bonn as its capital.

The Western Allies then took another step to guard against potential Soviet aggression. In 1948, Belgium,
France, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom had signed the Treaty of Brussels, forming a
military alliance for purposes of protection against the Soviet Union. In 1949, shortly before the Berlin
blockade ended, the United States joined those nations as well as Canada, Portugal, Italy, Denmark, Norway,
and Iceland to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an alliance for military assistance and
mutual defense. Should one of the member nations be attacked, the others agreed to come to its aid. The
capitalist democratic countries that joined NATO formed a bloc, a group of countries united for a common
purpose, that became known as the Western Bloc. The Western Bloc opposed communist expansion in Europe
by the countries of the Eastern Bloc, composed of the Soviet Union and its allies.
In 1955, when West Germany also joined NATO, the Soviet Union formed a military and political alliance of its
own, the Warsaw Treaty Organization or the Warsaw Pact. Its other members were the communist nations of
Eastern Europe: Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the German Democratic
Republic (East Germany), formerly the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviets regarded the pact as a vital defense
578 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       against a united Western Europe and resurgent Germany. NATO and the Warsaw Pact represented the nations
       on opposite sides of the Iron Curtain and hardened the lines that had been drawn between them (Figure 14.6).
       The Western and Eastern Blocs soon faced off against one another, not only in Europe but in the rest of the
       world as well.

       FIGURE 14.6 The Cold War in Europe. After West Germany joined NATO in 1955, the Soviet Union and other nations

      Cold War Strategies

       The Cold War between West and East was fought on many fronts with many strategies. Both sides provided aid
       and technical assistance to countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, many of which had been European
       colonies until the end of World War II. Through such aid, the United States hoped to contain the spread of
       communism by depriving countries of an economic reason for aligning themselves with the Soviet Union.
       Communism was attractive to many poor people. It promised that a nation's wealth would be used to provide
       for all its citizens, and under the Soviet system, people were provided with jobs, housing, education, health
       care, and public transportation. Although the standard of living was lower than in the West, for poor people
       who lived with the constant threat of hunger and homelessness and saw no chance of improving their
       situation, communism was an attractive alternative.
       Propaganda in the form of literature, visual imagery, and films was also used by each side to shore up support
       for its policies and political ideology, and to damage the credibility and prestige of the other side. In 1950, the
       U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe began broadcasting news to the countries of the Eastern Bloc, and in 1953,
       Radio Liberty began broadcasting to the Soviet Union. Radio Free Europe and the Free Europe Committee, an
       organization of American business executives and lawyers established by the U.S. government, printed leaflets

and posters touting the superiority of life in democratic, capitalist countries and dropped them from weather
balloons over East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary.

Soviet propaganda stressed the USSR's desire for world peace and praised the communist ideals of a classless
society in which people were treated equally regardless of race or gender. This message had a strong appeal for
people in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Some African Americans, confronted by racism and segregation in
the United States, were also attracted by these promises. Indeed, opponents of the civil rights movement in the
United States often denounced it as communist in nature.

Sometimes propaganda took the form of athletic competitions in which each side used its swimmers, runners,
weightlifters, and gymnasts to display the superiority of its system. Sports and news broadcasts kept a close
watch on the number of medals won by U.S. and Soviet athletes during Olympic competitions. At other times,
cultural exchanges took place. Soviet ballet dancers toured the United States, while American jazz musicians
and symphony orchestras visited Eastern Bloc countries.

                                                                                                BEYOND THE BOOK

 Cold War Propaganda

  Both the United States and the Soviet Union used propaganda to convince their own citizens as well as those of
  the other country that their way of life was superior. U.S. propaganda touted the benefits of capitalism and
  democracy and warned of the lack of freedom under communism. The Soviet Union boasted of the productivity of
  its citizens and ridiculed the softness of capitalists. Soviet propaganda also routinely invoked the lack of freedom
  for people of color in the United States.

  Following are two propaganda cartoons. The first is an American video called Make Mine Freedom
  (https://openstax.org/l/77MakeMineFree) that was made in 1948.

  View multimedia content (https://openstax.org/books/world-history-volume-2/pages/14-1-the-cold-war-begins)
  In it, viewers are warned about the dangers of "ism," which listeners in the United States would understand to
  mean "communism." Please note that the video contains racist imagery, as did many American cartoons from
  this time period. The salesman peddling "communism" to gullible Americans is wearing a zoot suit, a style of
  dress associated with men of color.

  The second video is a Soviet cartoon called The Millionaire (https://openstax.org/l/77Millionaire) that portrays the
  behavior of the wealthy in the United States.

  As you watch the videos, look for the claims each side makes about the other.

        States?

Both sides highlighted their ingenuity and technological achievements. At a 1959 exhibition in Moscow, U.S.
vice president Richard Nixon proudly showed off American technology to Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev in
the form of a model kitchen. Khrushchev's response to the labor-saving gadgetry on display was to inquire
whether American families also had machines to save them the effort of putting food in their mouths and
swallowing it. The two countries competed to dominate space as well. In 1957, the United States suffered a
serious blow to its pride when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first satellite (Figure 14.7). In response,
in 1958 President Dwight D. Eisenhower called on Congress to establish an agency to explore space. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established that year. In 1961 the Soviet Union
580 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       sent the first astronaut into space. In 1969 the United States put the first humans on the surface of the moon.

       Espionage was another important tool, carried out by the United States through the Central Intelligence
       Agency (CIA) formed in 1947, and by the USSR with its spy agency the KGB. Besides surveilling the other
       nation, these agencies also plotted, assisted in, and carried out acts of sabotage and the assassination of those
       deemed enemies of their country. Both the CIA and the KGB fomented discontent in foreign nations as well,
       trained fighting forces, and encouraged revolution and insurgency to topple foreign governments and install
       leaders who would be friendly to their respective countries. The CIA, for example, trained Cuban insurgents
       with the goal of overthrowing the Caribbean island's communist government under Fidel Castro in 1961.
       Similarly, the KGB gave assistance to Vietnamese communists attempting to defeat the government of South
       Vietnam during the Vietnam War.
       The most dangerous venue for competition, however, and the two sides' chief means of reining in aggression
       on the part of the other, was the stockpiling of massive nuclear arsenals. In 1949, the Soviet Union detonated
       an atomic bomb, ending the U.S. monopoly on nuclear weapons. In 1952 the United States took the next step,
       one opposed by some of the same atomic scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project during World
       War II, and developed the hydrogen bomb, testing it on the Pacific atoll of Eniwetok in 1952. This missile was
       one thousand times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. U.S. development of such a weapon
       meant the Soviet Union needed to do the same.
       In the 1950s, both the United States and the USSR developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) as well.
       Now missiles armed with nuclear warheads could be launched from within the home country's own territory
       or within the borders of satellite nations; an air force capable of intercepting bomb-bearing planes was no

longer sufficient to protect against nuclear attack. Although countries in both the Western and Eastern Blocs
prepared for potential war by creating shelters to protect citizens in the event of nuclear war, neither side put
great faith in its ability to emerge victorious. Both the United States and the USSR quickly came to believe that
the key to survival lay in building an immense retaliatory capacity, the ability to unleash devastation so great
that the other side would never detonate the first bomb for fear of its own annihilation. In the United States,
this defense policy came to be referred to as "mutually assured destruction" (MAD). Should these nuclear
stockpiles prove unsuccessful at deterring a conflict, the large military forces the rivals built up during the
Cold War, along with billions of dollars' worth of battleships, submarines, and fighter jets, ensured they
possessed the capacity to fight a conventional war as well.

14.2 The Spread of Communism

  · Explain how China became a communist nation in 1949
  · Describe how the Korean War began
  · Explain why the United States took part in the wars in Indochina
  · Discuss the Great Leap Forward and the Chinese Cultural Revolution

In the immediate postwar period, Europe was the focus of U.S. anti-communist anxiety. The United States
expended billions of dollars in Marshall Plan aid to stave off the expansion of communism there. It was in Asia,
however, that the policy of containment was most strongly challenged.

Chinese Revolution

Since the 1920s, two groups had contested for control of China: the Guomindang (GMD) or Nationalist Party,
and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). During World War II, the GMD, led by Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi)
had attempted to fight the Japanese from their wartime capital in Chongqing, while the CCP led by Mao Zedong
had watched from their base in Yan'an, a town in northern Shaanxi Province.1 With the exception of a brief
period of truce between the two parties, the CCP and the GMD fought with one another as well.

After the surrender of Japan, the United States had attempted to broker a peace between the Guomindang and
the CCP that it hoped would lead to a stable, unified China. Early efforts were successful, and an agreement was
reached to create a constitutional government in China with parliamentary rule. Attempts by Chiang to enlarge
the role of the GMD led the agreement to collapse, however, and both sides resumed battle. The Soviet Union
covertly provided support for Mao and the CCP, and the United States assisted Chiang and the Nationalists.

At first the GMD seemed certain to win. Its forces greatly outnumbered the CCP's, and it also had more money
and controlled China's major cities. By 1947, however, the tide had begun to turn. Despite its seeming
advantages, the GMD was unpopular among much of the population. One reason was that after the war, the
factories, homes, and businesses the Japanese had seized from Chinese owners came under the Nationalists'
control and remained there, alienating the urban middle class that had once supported them. In addition, the
Nationalists refused to reopen many of these factories and businesses, worsening the postwar unemployment
problem and driving urban workers, who already favored the communists, even further into the arms of the
CCP. Ruinous hyperinflation, which the GMD was unable to control, added to the strains of urban life. Enlisted
members of the Nationalist army were often underfed and scorned by their officers, and many ran away or
defected to the CCP. In the countryside too, Chiang's forces received little help from peasants, who
remembered the onerous taxes the GMD had imposed on them during World War II.

In contrast, CCP forces had been winning over the ordinary Chinese person. They pursued a vigorous policy of

       land reform, lowering rents and taxes and encouraging landless peasants in the areas they controlled to
       deprive landlords and wealthy peasants of their property. In areas where most peasants already owned land
       and rents were low, the CCP helped create stability by pursuing the bandits who preyed on them. Furthermore,
       CCP forces were disciplined and were instructed not to abuse people. Even Chinese people who did not support
       them could not help but notice that they were better managers than the Nationalists.
       In 1949, the CCP's People's Liberation Army decisively defeated the forces of the GMD, who retreated to the
       island of Taiwan. On October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China

       CCP's government as legitimate and maintained that Nationalist-led Taiwan was the "real" China. Mao was
       undeterred. He pledged industrial development, universal education, equality between the sexes, land reforms
       for peasants, and civil liberties for all, including freedom of expression. Mao and the CCP moved quickly to
       enact their promises, beginning immediately on the task of giving peasants ownership of the land they worked.

       Among the people most affected by the establishment of the PRC were the inhabitants of Tibet. Tibet had been
       claimed as Chinese territory by the Qing as well as earlier dynasties, but it had gained its independence with
       the fall of the Qing and the establishment of the Republic of China in January 1912. In 1949, the government of
       Tibet informed Mao that it had no intention of being made part of China again. Its attempts to negotiate
       independence failed, however, and in October 1950 the PRC invaded, swiftly overwhelming Tibet's small,
       poorly trained army. In 1951, representatives of the PRC and the Tibetan government signed the Seventeen
       Point Agreement making the region once again part of China, an event described by the CCP as the "liberation
       of Tibet." In 1959, the Dalai Lama, the ruler of Tibet and leader of Tibetan Buddhism, fled to India with other
       members of the Tibetan government, who maintained that the agreement with China had been made under
       duress. In 1965 Tibet became an Autonomous Region of China, which gave it a greater degree of self-
       government.
       Along with making changes in China's domestic policy, Mao also plotted a new course for China in foreign
       policy. In February 1950, the PRC and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance
       and Mutual Assistance. Under its terms, they were to combat any renewed Japanese aggression, work to
       advance their mutual interests, and refrain from entering into any alliances that were hostile to the other

party. All this was part of China's new "Lean to One Side" foreign policy position, in which the country would
favor socialist nations and assist those seeking to free themselves from control by imperialist powers. China
soon found its new commitments tested by the need to support a fellow communist nation and counter a
threat to its own borders in Korea.

The Two Koreas

On August 15, 1945, the nation of Korea, which had been occupied by Japan during World War II and had been
a Japanese colony for many years before that, was divided in half at the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude. The
United States assumed responsibility for disarming the southern part of the Korean peninsula, and the Soviet
Union took on the task of disarming the northern half. At the Moscow Conference held in December 1945, the
United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union agreed that they and China would jointly govern
Korea for a period of five years, after which it would be reunified and given its independence. The Korean
people's opposition to the division of their nation and its subjection to foreign rule was ignored.

Not long after the Moscow Conference, talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on how best to
reunify Korea broke down. The two sides were too far apart ideologically, so in 1947 the United States handed
the problem of Korean reunification over to the United Nations (UN). The UN General Assembly called for
elections to be held in Korea, and a Temporary Commission on Korea was formed.

In the years since the original division of the nation, however, North Korea's Communist Party, supported by
the Soviet Union, had grown in power and now proved unwilling to relinquish it. North Korea therefore refused
to participate in the election. Given this opposition, in May 1948 elections to a Constitutional Assembly were
held only in South Korea. A constitution was drafted, and the authoritarian anti-communist Syngman Rhee
was elected president in July. In August, Rhee proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of Korea (ROK).
Ten days later elections were held in North Korea, and a separate government for the new Democratic People's
Republic of Korea was established with communist Kim Il-sung as its leader.

With the country now seemingly permanently divided and troops wanted elsewhere, the Soviet Union
withdrew its forces from Korea, and the United States moved most of its troops out as well. Without the forces
of the two superpowers, which had each wished to avoid provoking the other, border clashes occurred between
North and South Korean troops from 1948 to 1950. North Korean forces hoped to encourage uprisings by
communists in the South, and South Korean forces fought to keep Northern troops out to prevent the
overthrow of the South's government.

On June 25, 1950, the Korean People's Army (KPA) of North Korea invaded South Korea, confident of welcome.
The ROK troops were unable to halt their advance, and within two days Seoul, the capital of South Korea, had
fallen. The United States was taken by surprise. South Korea was not considered of vital importance to U.S.
security. However, Japan was, and President Truman, in keeping with the domino theory, believed a stable
non-communist Korea was necessary to protect Japan. Unwilling to see another Asian country fall to
communism, he also feared U.S. reluctance to respond would send a signal to the Soviet Union that it was free
to act aggressively in Europe, the area of greatest U.S. interest. Accordingly, Truman approached the United
Nations asking for a condemnation of North Korea's actions and requesting the assistance of member nations
in South Korea's defense.

The UN Security Council responded quickly. It condemned North Korea's invasion of South Korea, and after a
brief debate, on June 27 it issued Resolution 83, calling on the UN's members to resist North Korean
aggression. The Security Council's actions could have been prevented by a veto of one its five permanent
members: China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, since the
Nationalists' loss in the Chinese civil war, the United States had insisted that China's seat on the council
belonged to Taiwan, not to the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union had boycotted the council's
meetings in protest. It was thus unable to stop the resolution from passing.

The United States suspected the invasion of South Korea had been a ploy by the Soviets to test the U.S.
584 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       response to an act of armed communist aggression. But Stalin had in fact warned Kim against it. Unwilling to
       start a war with the United States in Asia, he advised Kim to seek assistance not from Moscow but from Mao,
       whose CCP forces North Korea had aided in the Chinese civil war. Thus, while the United States immediately
       dispatched air and naval forces to Korea, the Soviet Union sent nothing. Initially Kim did not need assistance,
       though, and North Korean troops swiftly overran nearly the entire Korean peninsula, with ROK, UN, and U.S.
       forces clinging to the area around the port of Pusan in the south (Figure 14.9).

       North and South in May 1950, the month before the Korean War began. (b) By September the North Korean army
       had forced South Korean, UN, and U.S. troops to retreat to the far southeastern part of the peninsula. (credit a:

       The situation was reversed in September 1950 when U.S. troops led by General Douglas MacArthur landed
       behind KPA lines at Incheon. Seoul was swiftly retaken, and Rhee returned to power. With his original objective
       met, MacArthur was given a new goal: to reunify Korea under Rhee's control if possible--and if the attempt did
       not lead to Chinese or Soviet intervention. Despite a warning by China that its forces would enter the war
       should the thirty-eighth parallel be crossed, MacArthur's forces, with permission from the UN, did just that,
       chasing KPA troops northward toward the Yalu River, North Korea's border with China.
       Although not all prominent members of the Chinese Communist Party approved of committing troops to a war
       in Korea, Mao favored sending aid to Kim. Chinese forces had been gathering with the intention of invading
       Taiwan and defeating the Nationalist government there, but when the United States moved its Seventh Fleet
       into the straits between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, China's opportunity was lost. Its forces that might
       otherwise have gone to Taiwan now entered the fray in Korea, crossing the Yalu River on October 19, 1950. By
       December, Chinese and North Korean forces had sent UN and U.S. troops into retreat, back across the thirty-
       eighth parallel into South Korea. A cease-fire proposed by the UN was rejected by the Chinese forces, and
       fighting raged through the harsh Korean winter.
       By July 1951, the war had turned into a deadly stalemate near where it began, along the thirty-eighth parallel.
       Both sides, exhausted, began to discuss peace on July 10. Negotiations dragged on for two years as the two

sides fought to gain as much territory as possible before a cease-fire was finally proclaimed. On July 27, 1953,
the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. To prevent the recurrence of hostilities, a Korean Demilitarized
Zone was established, roughly along the thirty-eighth parallel, to be patrolled by North and South Korean
forces, and U.S. troops remained in South Korea as a deterrent to future North Korean aggression.

Like many of the proxy wars of the Cold War, in which the troops of nations allied with the United States and
the Soviet Union faced off against one another rather than risk direct conflict between the superpowers, the
Korean War was futile. Approximately three million people died in the three-year conflict, most of them
Korean civilians who either were caught in the crossfire or became victims of starvation and disease, and all
Korea's cities lay in ruins. No territory was gained by either side, and no political transformation occurred in
either the North or the South. The country remained divided, with North Korea adopting an isolationist policy
that left it cut off from the West.

China also suffered as a result of the Korean War. Now regarded by the United States and Western Europe as an
aggressor nation, it too found itself isolated and dependent on the Soviet Union for assistance. In the United
States, the outbreak of the war had pushed President Truman to adopt the policy recommended by the State
Department in NSC-68, a document that, among other things, called for increased spending on defense.
Although Truman had initially been reluctant to do so, the need to confront the Chinese forces on the Korean
peninsula led him to more than triple U.S. defense spending. Korea had convinced the country of the need to
always possess the capability to do battle with communist forces.

China's actions in Korea also bolstered U.S. resolve both to protect the Nationalist government in Taiwan and
to act decisively to stop the spread of communism in Asia. In 1954, the United States joined Britain, France,
Thailand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand to form the Southeast Asia Treaty
Organization (SEATO) to prevent the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia. The organization had no
capacity to mobilize troops, however, and focused largely on trying to improve standards of living in the region,
in the hope of making communism less attractive.

Alarmed by the creation of SEATO, in September 1958 the PRC began to bombard Jinmen (Quemoy), Mazu
(Matsu), and Dachen, islands off the coast of China that Taiwan claimed as territory belonging to the
Nationalists, in what was called the First Taiwan Strait Crisis. Although the United States had no wish to engage
in war with the PRC, the attacks on the islands led it to sign a Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan, assuring the
nation of U.S. support in the event of war with China. In 1958, the PRC once again bombarded Jinmen and
Mazu, sparking the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. When the United States began to supply the Nationalist troops
stationed on the islands, the bombardment ended. The situation was not fully resolved until the 1970s, when
the United States and the PRC had established more peaceful relations with one another.

Southeast Asia

The lessons of Korea also strengthened the U.S. commitment to oppose the spread of communism in Vietnam.
Following the end of World War II, France wished to reclaim control of Vietnam, which had been its colony
before being seized by Japan in 1940. However, the Vietnamese nationalist group the Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi
Minh, wished to seize the opportunity of Japan's surrender to proclaim their country's independence. The Viet
Minh had fought the Japanese during World War II and had often assisted the U.S. military. Ho Chi Minh fully
expected that the United States would support them.

                                                                                           IN THEIR OWN WORDS

 Ho Chi Minh Proclaims Independence

  On September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed Vietnam's freedom from French rule. In his speech, excerpts of
  which follow, he stated a long list of grievances of the Vietnamese people against the French colonialists and
  argued that the Vietnamese people should be free to rule themselves:
586 14 · Cold War Conflicts

               In the autumn of 1940, when the Japanese fascists violated Indochina's territory to establish new
               bases in their fight against the Allies, the French imperialists went down on their bended knees and
               handed over our country to them. Thus, from that date, our people were subjected to the double yoke of
               the French and the Japanese. Their sufferings and miseries increased. The result was that, from the end
               of last year to the beginning of this year, from Qung Tr Province to northern Vietnam, more than two
               million of our fellow citizens died from starvation.

               On March 9 [1945], the French troops were disarmed by the Japanese. The French colonialists either
               fled or surrendered, showing that not only were they incapable of "protecting" us, but that, in the span
               of five years, they had twice sold our country to the Japanese.

               [. . .]

               For these reasons, we, the members of the Provisional Government, representing the whole Vietnamese
               people, declare that from now on we break off all relations of a colonial character with France; we repeal
               all the international obligation that France has so far subscribed to on behalf of Viet-Nam, and we
               abolish all the special rights the French have unlawfully acquired in our Fatherland.

               The whole Vietnamese people, animated by a common purpose, are determined to fight to the bitter
               end against any attempt by the French colonialists to reconquer the country.

               We are convinced that the Allied nations, which at Tehran and San Francisco have acknowledged the
               principles of self-determination and equality of nations, will not refuse to acknowledge the
               independence of Vietnam.

               A people who have courageously opposed French domination for more than eighty years, a people who
               have fought side by side with the Allies against the fascists during these last years, such a people must
               be free and independent!

               --Ho Chi Minh, Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

           · What arguments does Ho Chi Minh make for Vietnam being an independent country?
           · Why does he believe the Allies will support him?

       Members of the U.S. military who had worked with Ho liked and respected him. However, while he was
       primarily a nationalist and no one questioned his patriotism, he was also a communist. Wanting to stand firm
       against what it saw as Soviet-directed communist expansion, the United States also wished to support its ally
       France, whose help it believed it needed to prevent the spread of communism in Europe. Thus, as the First
       Indochina War raged between French troops and the supporters of Ho Chi Minh, the United States assumed
       most of France's financial burden for the war. China and the Soviet Union gave assistance to Ho's forces.

       Following its defeat in 1954 at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, France granted independence to Vietnam, Laos, and
       Cambodia. According to the Geneva Accords, the peace treaty ending the war, Vietnam was divided along the
       seventeenth parallel of latitude with the assumption that, following national elections in 1956, it would be
       reunified (Figure 14.10). Ho Chi Minh governed the North and was expected to be the popular candidate in
       both North and South. The South was governed by a figurehead, the emperor Bao Dai, and his prime minister,
       Ngo Dinh Diem.2 Diem, a strong anti-communist, came from a family of wealthy Roman Catholics in a country
       where most people were poor and Buddhist. Before the elections, approximately one million Vietnamese
       Catholics from the North moved to the South, fleeing communist rule and bolstering support for Diem, who
       was backed by the United States. But he remained unpopular with the majority of Vietnamese people.

         2 Vietnamese names are written with the family name first. The given name comes last. Ngo Dinh Diem is usually referred to by
         historians by his given name Diem instead of his surname Ngo in order to differentiate him from his brothers Ngo Dinh Thuc and
         Ngo Dinh Nhu, who also played an important political role in Vietnam.

Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). North and South Vietnam were to be reunified following national elections.

Ngo Dinh Diem had no intention of relinquishing power, however; he argued that South Vietnam had not
signed the Geneva Accords and so was not bound by them. The United States, as a SEATO member and
knowing that Ho Chi Minh would easily win the majority of the vote in both North and South, supported Diem's
position. In 1955, well before any elections could take place, a referendum was held in South Vietnam instead.
The rigged results revealed that Diem was favored by more than 98 percent of voters, and he proclaimed
himself president. In reality, he was a ruthless politician who allowed no opposition and used the military to
attack South Vietnamese Buddhists and students who protested his rule. Influenced by his brother Ngo Dinh
Thuc, the archbishop of the city of Hue, Diem forbade the flying of the Buddhist flag. His regime also
redistributed land taken from Buddhist peasants to Catholic ones and dispensed more aid to Catholics. In
1963, Buddhist monks in South Vietnam engaged in several acts of self-immolation, setting themselves on fire
in public places to draw attention to the abuses of Diem's brutal and corrupt regime. When foreign journalists
questioned why the monks felt the need to engage in such dramatic protest, Diem's sister-in-law and South
Vietnam's unofficial First Lady, Madame Nhu, compared the suicides to "barbecues."
The Second Indochina War, sometimes simply called the Vietnam War, began in 1959 when the North
Vietnamese Communist Party, seeking to unify the country under communist rule, called for a "people's war"
against the government of South Vietnam. North Vietnam received support from both China and the Soviet
Union. Also helping the North was a group of South Vietnamese communists, many of whom had relocated to
North Vietnam following the Geneva Accords. These men and women officially formed the National Liberation
588 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       Front (NLF) in North Vietnam in 1960. Popularly known as the Viet Cong, the NLF returned to the South to
       organize peasants and begin an insurgency against the government of South Vietnam and the United States.
       U.S. president John F. Kennedy responded by continuing to do what his predecessors had done: he sent money
       and advisers to the South Vietnamese government but refused to commit ground troops.

      The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution

       Mao Zedong wanted China to chart the direction that communism took in Asia, just as the Soviet Union
       determined its direction in Europe. To do so, however, China needed to be much more powerful than it was in
       1949, when the CCP declared the foundation of the People's Republic and the Nationalists fled. In imitation of
       the Soviet model, Mao instituted a Five-Year Plan in China in 1953 and embarked on nearly seven hundred
       industrial projects, more than one hundred with the assistance of the Soviet Union. He also began the
       collectivization of agriculture by forcing peasants to labor together on state-owned farms instead of tending to
       farms worked by individual families. The plan was largely successful in terms of industrial development, and
       China's steelmaking, coal mining, and machine- and cement-producing capacity all increased.
       Although the first Five-Year Plan was successful, the second Five-Year Plan proved a disaster. This plan, also
       known as the Great Leap Forward, began in 1958. Mao, inspired by the Soviet Union's plans to overtake the
       United States in industrial capacity, proclaimed that China would surpass the United Kingdom. To that end,
       agricultural production was to increase at the same time as industrial production, and the proceeds of
       agriculture would fund industry. Collectivization efforts were intensified, and by the end of 1958 more than
       twenty-five thousand communes had been created, each consisting of several thousand families on average.
       Communes were large units of production. Members worked together to grow crops in warm months and build
       construction projects during the winter. Food was prepared in communal kitchens, and everyone ate together
       in communal dining halls. Communes also operated schools and hospitals for their members. All tools,
       livestock, food, and other valuable items belonged to the commune as a whole instead of to individuals or
       families, and the commune's leaders determined what work each member would do. Grain produced by
       communes in the countryside fed city dwellers and industrial workers. Encouraged to grow ever more,
       communes began to exaggerate their grain production levels to win political favor. Even as they strove to grow
       more food, laborers were also ordered to engage in extra projects like dam construction.
       Farm laborers were also ordered to produce steel in backyard furnaces hastily built in the countryside (Figure
       14.11). Some were assigned to steel production exclusively, but others who worked in the fields by day were
       often forced to tend the furnaces at night. To meet quotas, they stripped the countryside of wood and burned
       their own furniture to fuel the furnaces. In the end, the steel produced was of such low quality that it was
       worthless.

encouraged to build small furnaces to produce steel that often proved worthless. (credit: modification of work

The requisitioning of grain to feed the cities combined with bad weather and the use of farm labor for
industrial projects to produce disaster in rural China. In some areas, floods and locust swarms destroyed
crops. In others, too much of the harvest was diverted to the cities to leave enough for the peasants to eat.
Famine set in, and people ate bark, leaves, and clay. Some Chinese historians place the death toll at five
million, while Western historians believe thirty to fifty million people died between 1959 and 1961.
The stupendous failure of the Great Leap Forward stunned Mao. He turned to other members of the CCP, Zhou
Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and Liu Shaoqi, to rectify the situation and allowed them to largely assume day-to-day
control of China. Deng especially began to reverse some of Mao's more damaging policies by, for example,
allowing peasants to sell grain surpluses. Given positive incentives to produce more food, the peasants did so,
alleviating food shortages. Mao was sensitive to failure, however, and resented the successes of Zhou, Deng,
and Liu. When Marshall Peng Dehuai, the Minister of Defense and a longtime associate of Mao, criticized his
handling of the Great Leap Forward, Mao dismissed him from his position and replaced him with Lin Biao.
In 1966, Mao abruptly warned that "revisionists" were seeking to alter the direction of the CCP. He called on
the younger generation of Chinese people--high school and university students and young factory workers--to
engage in "class struggle" and save the revolution. In July 1966 he launched the event known as the Chinese
Cultural Revolution. Students organized themselves into groups of "Red Guards," guided by quotations of Mao
that Lin Biao had gathered and published in a "Little Red Book."
In August 1966, millions of Red Guards rallied in Beijing as Mao and Lin Biao encouraged them to purge the
country of "bourgeois" elements by attacking the "Four Olds": old customs, old culture, old habits, and old
ideas. Red Guards then attacked and killed their teachers and school administrators. At one school, students
beat the gardener to death because he tended the lawn, a bourgeois concern. Provided with food and lodging at
590 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       government expense, Red Guards rampaged through the country, destroying books, works of art, temples,
       monasteries, tombs, and historical sites. They beat people and forced them to confess to having bourgeois
       thoughts. No one knows how many were killed during the Cultural Revolution; it may have been as many as
       two million.

       Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, who displayed insufficient revolutionary fervor, were removed from positions
       of power. In 1968, the Red Guards were themselves dismissed as Mao sought to curb their power. They were
       sent to the countryside along with other urban youth to learn from the peasants. In 1969, Lin Biao was named
       Mao's successor. Two years later, Lin died in a plane crash while attempting to flee to the Soviet Union. He may
       have feared that Mao suspected him of plotting against him and planned to punish him.

       As the Soviet Union and the United States struggled for supremacy, they sought to attract the support of the
       world's nations by offering financial aid, military support, and technical advice. Many countries were willing to
       align with one side or the other for a variety of reasons, sometimes ideological but often not. Some nations,
       however, resisted being drawn into either camp.

      Yugoslavia

       In the aftermath of World War II, the nations of Europe speedily aligned themselves with either the Western or
       the Eastern Bloc, with one exception: Yugoslavia. In 1942, communist partisans who had fought the Axis
       powers on behalf of the People's Liberation Front formed a government, the Anti-Fascist Council for the
       National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ). When Italian forces evacuated Yugoslavia in 1943, AVNOJ assumed
       control of the territory and established the state of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. The partisans' leader, Josip
       Broz Tito, was named prime minister. In 1945, Yugoslavia's monarchy was abolished, and Tito was recognized
       as the leader of the country. This result was confirmed by a nationwide election held shortly thereafter.

       Yugoslavia was a communist state from the beginning and was one of the founders of the Cominform, the
       Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, in 1947. Cominform's purpose was to give
       direction to the communist governments of Europe after World War II so that they might coordinate their
       efforts to oppose anti-communist activity in the rest of Europe. The Soviet Union would be at the fore,
       providing guidance for the others.

       Tito and Stalin clashed early on, however. Tito wished to incorporate within Yugoslavia the countries of
       Bulgaria and Albania, as well as parts of Greece, Italy, and Austria. Stalin opposed Yugoslavia's claims,
       believing them to be unreasonable and likely to cause trouble with Western Europe. Yugoslavia also aided the
       Greek communists in their civil war, which Stalin opposed as well, again believing the West would be angered

by it. Tito, for his part, refused to accept a secondary position for Yugoslavia. Unlike the other members of the
Eastern Bloc, Yugoslavia had liberated itself from the Axis without Soviet assistance. Thus, Tito believed it
should be treated by the Soviet Union as an equal, not as a satellite state to which it gave orders.

In 1948 Cominform expelled Yugoslavia. For assistance Tito turned to the United States, which helped
Yugoslavia survive despite its inability to trade with its Eastern Bloc neighbors. Tito, however, was equally
concerned about becoming a puppet of the United States, and during the 1950s and 1960s, Yugoslavia became
economically self-sufficient and traded with members of both the Western and Eastern Blocs. In 1960, Tito
spoke before the General Assembly of the United Nations and called upon "non-bloc countries" to unite to
achieve common goals of decolonization, disarmament, bans on nuclear testing, and equality of economic
development.

The Bandung Conference and Indonesia

Among European nations, Yugoslavia's refusal to become a member of either the Western or the Eastern Bloc
made it an exception. But a desire to plot a middle path between the superpowers was common in former
colonies or protectorates of European powers, especially in South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

In April 1955 representatives from twenty-nine such countries in Asia and Africa gathered at a conference in
Bandung, Indonesia. Their goal was to be able to rely on one another as they strove to industrialize and avoid
the need to turn to Europe, the United States, or the Soviet Union for assistance. This aim formed the basis for
the Non-Aligned Movement, an attempt by newly independent nations to stay out of the orbit of either the
Western or the Eastern Bloc.

Indonesia assumed a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement. An anti-Dutch independence campaign had
developed there before World War II, and in August 1945 two of its leaders, Mohammad Hatta and Kusno
Sosrodihardjo, known as Sukarno, proclaimed independence for Indonesia, a status that became official in
1949. Sukarno, on becoming president, stressed that the nation wished to remain neutral in foreign affairs.

Both the United States and the Soviet Union desired Indonesia as an ally. It was a country with a large
population, oil deposits, and a strategically advantageous geographical position. Both sides believed
Indonesia's future path--communist or democratic--would greatly influence the other nations of Asia.
Accordingly, both courted Sukarno, and Sukarno accepted aid from both. In his eyes, so long as he did not
allow either superpower to determine Indonesia's affairs, his country was neutral.

In 1956, Sukarno visited China and was impressed by what Mao Zedong had been able to achieve. Believing
Mao's ability to centralize power lay at the heart of China's success, upon his return to Indonesia, Sukarno
established a National Council made up of representatives of larger social groups, such as peasants and
workers, to reach decisions by consensus rather than by voting. In the new "Guided Democracy" he
established in 1959, the consensus of the nation would be expressed through the president instead of the
legislature. To shore up his autocratic authority, Sukarno turned to both the Indonesian Communist Party and
the conservative armed forces. His goal was the creation of an Indonesian state based on what he called
NASAKOM, an acronym standing for nationalism, religion, and communism.

By 1964 Sukarno had abandoned all pretense of neutrality and sought alliances with communist countries
while encouraging anti-United States sentiment in Indonesia. In 1965, Suharto, a general in the Indonesian
military, claimed that Indonesian communists had sought to subvert the government by plotting to kill
Sukarno. Suharto's subsequent destruction of Indonesia's communists, carried out with the aid of the CIA, may
have cost the lives of some one million people (Figure 14.12). In 1967, Suharto removed Sukarno from office
and assumed dictatorial powers.

      India

       Like Indonesia, India sought to plot its own path and remain free of the entangling alliances of the Cold War,
       and it was also one of the initiators of the Non-Aligned Movement. In 1947, the United Kingdom granted India
       its independence. Anti-British protests had rocked India throughout 1946, and, exhausted from fighting World
       War II, Britain could no longer afford to maintain control over its colony. In addition, although the United
       Kingdom had sufficient troops there, the majority were Indian, and it was uncertain where their loyalties lay.
       Indeed, in 1946 Indians in the British Navy had mutinied throughout the country. Finally, the United
       Kingdom's greatest ally and creditor, the United States, pressured the nation to grant India its independence,
       as the United States had given independence to the Philippines following the war.
       The announcement that the British would be withdrawing sparked waves of religious violence throughout the
       nation. Much of it was caused by a dispute over what an independent India would consist of. Hindus in the
       Indian National Congress called for the maintenance of a single, unified India. Muslims, however, feared that
       the Hindu majority would dominate the government to their detriment, and many were reluctant to agree to
       such a situation. A compromise was reached, and at midnight on August 15, 1947, when India achieved its
       independence, the region of Pakistan, home to a Muslim majority, became an independent nation as well.

                                                                                 THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT

        Kashmir

         In August 1947, when India became independent of the United Kingdom and Pakistan was established as a
         separate nation, the status of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir (usually referred to simply as Kashmir) was
         in question. India wished to retain control of it, but because the state had a largely Muslim population, Pakistan
         lay claim to it; thus, India and Pakistan went to war. Peace was established when the United Nations intervened,
         and Kashmir remained part of India. In 1965, war broke out again when Pakistan tried to seize the Indian state
         by force. As a result of negotiations mediated by the Soviet Union, both sides withdrew their forces from the
         region. War erupted a third time in 1971, and fighting broke out yet again in 1999.
         Between 2016 and 2018, Kashmiri separatists launched a series of attacks on Indian security forces, with India
         placing the blame on Pakistan as the instigator of the violence. In 2019, following a suicide attack on an Indian
         army convoy by militants based in Pakistan, the government of India revoked Article 370 of its constitution,
         which had granted Kashmir a degree of autonomy. In February 2021, a cease-fire agreement was reached
         between India and Pakistan, and peace returned to the region as local tourists, unable to vacation abroad
         because of the COVID-19 pandemic, flocked to the mountainous region to enjoy winter sports.

    · How might the continuing tension in the region represent a new kind of Cold War?

India's geographic location, bordering both the Soviet Union and China, made it of great interest to the West.
The United Kingdom continued to trade with India, supply it with weapons, and train its military officers.
India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, wished to maintain his distance from the United States,
however. He was sympathetic to socialism and had visited the Soviet Union. He recognized the People's
Republic of China and opposed the U.S. refusal to allow the PRC to hold China's seat on the UN Security
Council. He was also suspicious of U.S. intentions toward India, given the government's treatment of its own
citizens of color. Nevertheless, Nehru accepted aid from the United States in the 1950s, just as he did from the
Soviet Union.

In 1950, India's relationship with China changed when China established border posts in Tibet to demarcate
its territory, including land India claimed. India and China sought to maintain an amicable relationship and
even signed a treaty affirming the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in 1954. But when Tibet's leader, the
Fourteenth Dalai Lama, sought protection in India after fleeing Tibet during an anti-Chinese uprising in 1959,
India's support for him angered China. In 1962, a confrontation along the disputed border with Tibet led to war
between the two countries. The United States aided India, and while the Soviet Union officially remained
neutral, it also continued to provide funds and technology to India. This decision deepened a divide that was
already growing between the USSR and China.

Egypt and the Middle East

Before World War II, the United States had demonstrated relatively little concern for the Middle East, which fell
largely under British control. Following the war, however, problems in the region, some of which stemmed
from British policies and actions, threatened to move Arab and Iranian leaders closer to the Soviet Union. This
possibility alarmed the United States and led to attempts to forge relationships with Middle Eastern
governments. The nations that proved of greatest interest were Iran, Egypt, and the newly formed state of
Israel.

Iran first became a place of concern to the United States immediately following World War II, when the Soviet
Union proved reluctant to end its occupation of the country. Following the war, the United Kingdom had
resumed its activities in the region, which largely consisted of drilling for oil. In 1951, Mohammad Mossadegh,
an Iranian nationalist, became the country's prime minister and moved to nationalize the oil fields belonging
to British companies. This action led to protests by the United Kingdom and by pro-Western Iranian elites who
supported British interests. In 1952, Iran's monarch, the pro-Western shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, removed
Mossadegh from power. He was forced to reinstate him, however, following massive popular protests.

Mossadegh's actions convinced both the United Kingdom and the United States that he favored communism
and might ally Iran with the Soviet Union, with which it shared a border. Although it is unlikely he intended to
make Iran a satellite state of the Soviet Union, British arguments that this was the case convinced the United
States to take action. In August 1953, a coup plotted by the CIA and Iran's military, which supported the Shah,
removed Mossadegh from power again. He was arrested and imprisoned.

British actions laid the groundwork for another conflict in the Middle East following World War II. In 1917,
Britain's foreign secretary Arthur James Balfour had declared that Britain would support the establishment of
a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Throughout the 1930s, Jewish people from Europe had streamed to the
region, and as their numbers increased, so did violence between them and Arabs, who demanded an end to
Jewish immigration and the creation of an independent Arab state. Following the end of World War II, as
Jewish survivors of the Holocaust sought refuge in Palestine, the British government requested that the United
Nations resolve the issue. In 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine visited the region and
594 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       recommended that it be divided into a Jewish state and an Arab state (Figure 14.13). The city of Jerusalem,
       sacred to both groups, was to be placed under an "international trusteeship." In November 1947, the UN
       General Assembly adopted the committee's suggestion with the passage of Resolution 181.

       FIGURE 14.13 UN Partition Plan for Palestine. The UN's 1947 plan to partition Palestine divided it into Jewish and
       Arab sectors. Jewish people would control most of the coast and the southern part of the country. The Arab sectors
       were divided from one another by large areas of Jewish settlement. (credit: "UN 1947 partition plan for Palestine"

       The UN resolution led to civil war in Palestine. The British withdrew from the region in May, leaving Jewish
       people and Palestinian Arabs, assisted by Arabs from elsewhere in the Middle East who had organized
       themselves as the Arab Liberation Army, to battle it out. About 250,000 Palestinian Arabs fled Jewish-
       controlled areas. On May 14, 1948, as the last British forces left the region, David Ben-Gurion, the leader of the
       Jewish settlement in Palestine, announced the founding of the nation of Israel (Figure 14.14).

state of Israel in 1948. (credit: "Declaration of State of Israel 1948" by Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Wikimedia

Both the United States and the Soviet Union officially recognized the new state. Israel's Arab neighbors did not,
and they proclaimed that Arabs within Israel had a right to self-determination. On the evening of May 14, an air
attack on the Israeli city of Tel-Aviv began, and the next day forces from Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and
Transjordan (now called Jordan) invaded the country. The First Arab-Israeli War lasted ten months, with Israel
emerging victorious in March 1949. Not only had it defended its existence, but it had also gained control of
much of the territory the 1947 UN committee had recommended reserving for Arab settlement. Hundreds of
thousands of Arabs left Palestine--now part of Israel--for neighboring countries.
The better-armed Arab nations' loss to Israel came as a shock to many in the Arab world. In Egypt, the Free
Officers Movement, a group of mostly junior officers from middle-class backgrounds, criticized their
government for its failure. One officer, Gamal Abdel Nasser, blamed the defeat on government corruption and
quickly rose to prominence. Like others in the movement, Nasser was a nationalist who wished to end the
United Kingdom's influence over its former protectorate of Egypt. On July 23, 1952, he led a group of army
officers in a coup that deposed Egypt's luxury-loving King Farouk and assumed control of the nation (Figure
14.15).

       Among Farouk's flaws had been his reliance on an informal cabinet composed largely of non-Egyptians, one of
       whom had sold defective rifles to the Egyptian military during the war with Israel. Although they were not the
       reason for Egypt's loss, they became a symbol of the weak, corrupt nature of Farouk's government. The
       rebellious officers instituted a constitution that made Egypt a secular state and embarked on a program of land
       reform. Egypt's new leaders also acted to end British influence in their nation; in separate agreements, the
       United Kingdom agreed to give up its rule in Sudan and evacuate its forces from the Suez Canal zone by 1956,
       years before required by an existing treaty.
       As well as weakening British power in the Middle East, Nasser, who became prime minister of Egypt in 1954,
       wished to make his country the leader of the Arab world, a position also sought by Iraq. In 1955, the United
       Kingdom signed the Baghdad Pact, which created the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) and joined Iraq,
       Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan in a military alliance that seemed to thwart both of Nasser's goals. Nasser perceived
       this as a signal that the West wished to promote Iraq instead of Egypt as the leader of the Arab nations.
       Seeking to erode both Israeli and Western interests, Nasser sponsored cross-border attacks on Israel by
       Palestinian Arab guerrilla fighters, refugees from Israel living in Egypt, and gave support to Algerian rebels
       attempting to throw off French rule. The United States had sought friendly relations with Nasser, partly to
       prevent him from turning to the Soviet Union and partly to gain supremacy over the United Kingdom in the
       region. However, when he refused to promise that U.S. weapons would not be used to attack Israel, the United
       States refused to arm Egypt and, in July 1956, withdrew its promise of aid to build the Aswan Dam across the
       Nile. Accordingly, Nasser turned to the Eastern Bloc. Czechoslovakia supplied the arms, and the Soviet Union
       later funded the construction of the dam.
       On July 26, 1956, Nasser, who had been elected president of Egypt the month before, nationalized the Suez
       Canal and immediately closed it to Israeli shipping. On October 29, Israel invaded Egypt, and on November 5,
       Britain and France did as well, touching off the Suez Crisis. The United Nations passed a resolution calling for a
       cease-fire, and both the United States and the Soviet Union demanded an immediate end to the invasion. The
       Soviet Union threatened to send troops to Egypt and to attack London. U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower,
       anxious not to give the Soviets an excuse to intervene, threatened to impose economic sanctions on France,
       Israel, and the United Kingdom if they did not comply. All three withdrew, but Israel did so with the guarantee

that it would be allowed to use the Straits of Tiran to send shipping through the canal. A UN peacekeeping force
was left in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula to guard the border with Israel.

The Suez Crisis changed the U.S. role in the Middle East. After having had little involvement in the area, the
United States now realized that Soviet involvement there was possible. Wishing to prevent this, in 1957
Eisenhower proclaimed the Eisenhower Doctrine, by which the United States would use its military strength to
defend Middle Eastern governments in danger of being overthrown by the forces of "International
Communism." The United States also extended financial and military aid to the governments of friendly
countries such as Lebanon.

The withdrawal of Israel and the Western powers from Egypt augmented Nasser's status as self-proclaimed
leader of the Arab world and brought him closer to forging the pan-Arab state he desired. In 1958, he took
another step toward that reality when Egypt joined Syria to create the United Arab Republic. The previous year,
Turkey, fearing that its neighbor Syria was about to experience a communist takeover, had gathered troops
along the Syrian border. When the Soviet Union announced its support for Syria in the event of a Turkish
invasion, the U.S. had pledged support for Turkey. Although crisis was averted when Turkey withdrew its
troops, Syria proposed a union with Egypt to protect itself from interference by other countries and from the
increasing power of the Syrian Communist Party. The two nations separated after a coup in Syria in 1961.

In 1958, the United States enforced the Eisenhower Doctrine by sending nearly fifteen thousand troops to
Lebanon at the request of its Christian president, Camille Chamoun, to protect his government from political
opponents, some of whom were pro-communist. Opposition was led by Lebanon's Sunni Muslim majority, who
had supported Lebanon's joining the United Arab Republic when Chamoun had refused to do so. U.S. forces
remained in Lebanon for three months while Chamoun finished his term. This diversion of U.S. attention
convinced China that it could resume bombing Jinmen and Mazu without risking a response, precipitating the
Second Taiwan Strait Crisis.

Although relative peace had returned to the region following the end of the Suez Crisis, also called the Second
Arab-Israeli War, Palestinian guerrillas continued to strike at Israel from bases in Egypt and Syria. Often their
targets were civilians, and tensions remained high. In April 1967, following air battles between Israeli and
Syrian pilots, Egypt, under the false belief that Israel was preparing to invade Syria, removed the UN
peacekeeping force from the Sinai Peninsula and amassed troops there. On May 22, Egypt closed the Straits of
Tiran to Israeli shipping, which Israel considered an act of war.

On June 5, Israel began the Third Arab-Israeli War by launching a preemptive strike on Egypt, invading the
country by land at the same time that it destroyed virtually the entire Egyptian air force. Attempted attacks by
Jordan and Syria were fended off, and Israel seized territory from these nations as well as from Egypt. The
fighting ended nearly as soon as it had begun, earning the conflict the title of the Six-Day War. Israel had
gained control of the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank (of the Jordan River) from
Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria, greatly enhancing the size of its territory.

The Israeli victory in 1967 did not end the conflict, and air attacks, shelling, and guerrilla fighting between
Egypt and Israel continued for several years. Following Nasser's death in 1970, the new president, Anwar
Sadat, wished to put a decisive end to the conflict while also reversing the territorial losses suffered by the
Arab states in 1967. Although Nasser had moved Egypt more deeply into the Soviet camp over the years, in
1972 Sadat expelled the Soviet advisers. He also began talks with the United States, Israel's chief ally, with the
intent of resolving Arab-Israeli hostilities for good. However, Sadat did not want peace to be made until Egypt
had regained control of the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip. On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria, which
sought the return of the Golan Heights, launched a surprise attack on Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of
the Jewish religious calendar, when many Israeli soldiers were off duty. Once again, Israel was victorious. A
cease-fire imposed by the United Nations began on October 25. Israel had not lost any of the conquered
territory, and in subsequent years Sadat was forced to engage in more peaceful efforts to seek the return of
Egyptian lands.

         · Explain the reasons for Soviet intervention in Warsaw Pact nations in the 1950s and 1960s
         · Describe U.S. efforts to contain the spread of communism in Latin America and Asia
         · Explain the cause of the Sino-Soviet split
         · Discuss decolonization movements in Africa

       The potential for conflict between the United States and the forces of communism was not limited to East Asia.
       Although this part of the world held the greatest risk of strife, and indeed several proxy wars were fought there
       in the decades following World War II, the contest between the United States and the Soviet Union spread to all
       parts of the globe.

      Tensions in Europe

       Joseph Stalin died in 1953. He was replaced as leader of the Soviet Union, briefly by Georgy Malenkov and then
       by Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev was as ardent an opponent of the Western Bloc as Stalin had ever been,
       bragging at one meeting that communism would "bury" capitalism, but he also favored a new attitude toward
       the United States and a new direction for the Soviet Union. In February 1956, at the Twentieth Congress of the
       Soviet Communist Party, Khrushchev denounced the late Stalin and accused him of crimes against the Soviet
       people. He then embarked on an aggressive process of de-Stalinization, changing Stalin-era policies such as
       censorship of the arts, releasing many whom Stalin had jailed for political reasons, dissolving the special
       tribunals that had convicted them, removing Stalin's name from public buildings, and taking monuments to
       him down.

       In the Eastern Bloc countries, this signaled the beginning of a political thaw. In June 1956, workers in the
       Polish city of Poznan rioted to protest food shortages and poor housing along with other grievances. In the
       autumn, protests began in other cities as well. They had a distinctly nationalistic character and called for such
       changes as the expulsion of the Soviet army from Poland and the removal of Russian language classes from
       Polish schools' curricula. In October, Wladyslaw Gomulka, who called for governmental reforms, was made the
       leader of the Polish Communist Party and thus the leader of Poland.

       Alarmed by the possibility of reforms that might remove Poland from the Eastern Bloc, Khrushchev mobilized
       Soviet troops in Poland and marched them toward Warsaw even as he flew there in person. After Gomulka
       assured Khrushchev that he had no intention of ending communism or Poland's relationship with the Soviet
       Union, Khrushchev agreed that reforms could take place. Accordingly, the collectivization of Polish agriculture
       was ended, Soviet advisers were sent home, political prisoners were released, and greater freedom was given
       to the Roman Catholic Church.

       The success of the Poles inspired others. On October 23, 1956, students marched through the streets of
       Budapest, Hungary, demanding among other things the removal of Stalinist symbols, improvements in wages,
       economic reforms, and the removal of Soviet troops from the country. The State Security Police opened fire on
       students who gathered outside the main radio station to read their demands on the air, and several were killed.
       An uprising began, with angry citizens fighting both the police and Soviet troops. As protesters attacked the
       parliament building, Ern Ger, the head of the ruling Hungarian Working People's Party and leader of the
       country, fled along with his prime minister, András Hegedüs. Imre Nagy, a reformer, took office as prime
       minister. Unlike Gomulka, Nagy did not wish to institute internal reforms while otherwise remaining loyal to

Moscow. On October 28, he called for a cease-fire, dissolved the State Security Police, and demanded that
Soviet troops leave Budapest. On November 1, Nagy announced that Hungary was no longer a member of the
Warsaw Pact and would remain neutral in international affairs.

Three days later, Soviet forces entered Hungary to join those the USSR had been on the point of withdrawing
until Nagy's announcement. Khrushchev may have feared that Nagy's declaration of Hungarian neutrality
threatened the security of the Soviet Union. He may also have wished to demonstrate his resolve to more
conservative communists and to the leaders of the other Soviet states. Some argue that the Western Bloc's
failure to intervene emboldened him. The uprising came to an end on November 10 after about 2,500
Hungarians had been killed, and the communist government was reestablished under János Kádár.
Approximately twenty thousand Hungarians were arrested and another 200,000 fled the country. Soviet troops
were permanently stationed in Hungary, and Nagy was tried and executed in 1958.

The United States did not become involved in the events in Hungary, a decision Khrushchev later mocked.
However, despite not wishing a confrontation with the Soviets, the United States soon found it could not ignore
Khrushchev's ultimatum regarding Berlin. In 1958 and again in 1961, Khrushchev demanded that Britain,
France, and the United States leave West Berlin, demands that went unheeded. The capitalist part of the old
German capital was a thorn in Khrushchev's side. Not only did its prosperity arouse discontent among the
residents of the communist eastern districts, but the openness allowed there enabled many people from East
Germany--and elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc--to escape to freedom.

On the evening of August 12-13, 1961, East German troops erected a barbed wire fence to divide the western
part of Berlin from the eastern. In the days that followed, cement walls went up as well to stop the free passage
from east to west. On October 22, a dispute erupted between the United States and the Soviet Union regarding
the free passage of U.S. government employees between East and West Berlin. The United States maintained
that, in keeping with agreements reached at Potsdam at the end of World War II, members of the Allies could
travel freely throughout Berlin. To test the Soviets' commitment to abide by this agreement, the U.S. began to
send cars carrying U.S. officials across the dividing line to see if they would be stopped. If they were, U.S.
troops, sometimes riding in tanks, then accompanied them across.

On October 27, the USSR responded by sending some of its own tanks to the entrance to East Berlin. U.S. and
Soviet tanks aimed their guns at one another. A fight was narrowly averted when Kennedy and Khrushchev
agreed to remove their tanks at the same time.

The Berlin Wall separated the residents of East and West Berlin from 1961 until it was destroyed in 1989.
While it stood, it provided a canvas for the people of West Berlin to record their whims and fantasies as well as
political messages. This website shows photographs of the Berlin Wall and its art (https://openstax.org/l/

Tensions flared in Europe yet again in 1968 when Czechoslovakia, like Poland and Hungary before it, sought to
loosen its ties to the Soviet Union. Early in the year, the country's conservative leader Antonín Novotný was
replaced by Alexander Dubcek. Dubcek instituted economic reforms and ended government censorship. As
Czechs called for even greater reforms, the Soviet Union became alarmed, as it had in Poland and Hungary in
1956. Fearing that changes in Czechoslovakia would stimulate calls for reform elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc or
in the Soviet republics themselves--and confident the United States would not intervene, just as it had failed to
do before--the new Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev ordered an invasion of Czechoslovakia on August 20, 1968.
By early 1969, resistance had largely disappeared, and the Soviet Union replaced Dubcek with the
conservative Gustáv Husák, who reversed Dubcek's reforms. Censorship was restored, and government control
increased again. For the Soviets, this was a successful application of the Brezhnev Doctrine, the pledge to assist
communist governments in danger of being overthrown.

      Tensions in Latin America

       In the 1930s and 1940s, the United States had exercised a "Good Neighbor Policy" toward other nations of the
       Western Hemisphere, refraining from intervening in their affairs. The desire to contain communist expansion,
       however, led Washington to take a much more interventionist approach in Latin America and the Caribbean in
       the 1950s and 1960s. In 1944, an uprising in Guatemala ousted the military dictator Jorge Ubico, who had held
       power since 1931. Philosophy professor Juan José Arévalo became the country's first democratically elected
       president in 1945. He was succeeded in office in 1951 by Jacobo Árbenz, who began a program of land reform
       in the desperately poor country. Árbenz also legalized the Guatemalan Party of Labor, a communist labor
       union. In the eyes of the United States, Guatemala seemed to be drifting toward communism (Figure 14.16).

       FIGURE 14.16 Land and Freedom. A 1952 poster promises Guatemalan peasants "land and freedom" along with
       the agrarian reforms promoted by Jacobo Árbenz. Árbenz's plans led U.S. officials to fear he would align Guatemala
       with the Eastern Bloc. (credit: "Reforma Agraria de Guatemala" by Fotos antiguas de Guatemala/Wikimedia
       Commons, Public Domain)
       This view of the matter was encouraged by the United Fruit Company, a U.S. company that owned plantations
       throughout Central America, where it grew bananas for the American market. As the single largest landowner
       in Guatemala, United Fruit was resistant to any forces that might limit its access to land. Thus, Árbenz's land
       redistribution plans threatened its interests, and his support for the Guatemalan Party of Labor also promised
       to undermine the company's control over its employees.
       United Fruit convinced first the Truman administration and then the Eisenhower administration to remove
       Árbenz from power. Eisenhower was a strong anti-communist, as were his secretary of state John Foster Dulles
       and the head of the CIA Allen Dulles, John's brother. The Dulles brothers were also closely connected to the
       United Fruit Company. In 1954, forces led by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas but armed and trained by the CIA
       removed Árbenz from power. Upon taking office, Armas instituted a military dictatorship, outlawed the

political opposition, and began to attack the power of the unions.
It is unlikely that Árbenz sought to place Guatemala within the Eastern Bloc. Soviet influence was active
elsewhere in Latin America, however. In 1952, Fulgencio Batista seized power in Cuba in a military coup.
Batista, who was financially supported by the U.S. government, held tight control over the island nation and
used secret police to silence his opponents, often by means of torture and murder. He wielded his political
power to protect the interests of wealthy Cubans and large landowners, among whom were many U.S.
executives who controlled Cuba's sugar industry.
Opposition to Batista was led by a young lawyer and activist named Fidel Castro and his brother Raul. When
Fidel Castro failed to remove Batista from power legally by challenging the constitutionality of Batista's seizure
of power, he and his brother began to organize members of Cuba's disgruntled working class. The revolution
against Batista began on July 26, 1953, with unsuccessful attacks on military bases in Santiago and Bayamo
that culminated in the capture of the Castro brothers. Released from prison two years later, they retreated to
Mexico where they joined other Cuban exiles and a young Argentine named Ernesto "Che" Guevara to train
and plot their return to Cuba.
In 1956, Fidel Castro and his followers returned to Cuba and led the 26th of July Movement (named for their
first failed attempt to topple Batista's government) in attacks on the Cuban government. After two years of
fighting, Castro's rebels were successful, and on December 31, 1958, Fulgencio Batista fled to the Dominican
Republic. On January 2, 1959, the military commander guarding Havana ordered his soldiers to lay down their
weapons, and the revolutionaries entered the capital in triumph (Figure 14.17).

At first the United States recognized Cuba's new government. Fidel Castro was interviewed on the popular
American television program The Ed Sullivan Show a few days after his forces proved victorious, and Castro
himself visited the United States to request aid in developing his country. In an address before the United
Nations, he placed Cuba in the non-aligned camp; when asked, he insisted he was not a communist.
Despite these protestations, Castro worried the U.S. government. He began a program of land reform and
602 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       forbade foreign ownership of land. He appointed communists, including Che Guevara, to important
       government positions. In August 1960, he began to nationalize foreign companies in Cuba, including many
       owned by U.S. citizens. Many wealthy and middle-class Cubans left the country; a large number relocated to
       the United States, only about ninety miles away. The United States, now convinced of Castro's communist
       leanings, imposed economic sanctions on Cuba. If the island were allowed to become communist, Washington
       feared, communism would spread elsewhere in Latin America. Denied U.S. assistance, Castro turned to the
       Soviet Union for help.
       The United States was reluctant to take aggressive action against Cuba for fear of moving Castro closer to the
       Soviets. However, the CIA trained Cuban exiles in Florida who had formed the Democratic Revolutionary Front.
       Their goal was to launch an invasion of Cuba that, they believed, would spark a popular uprising and the
       overthrow of the Castro government. By assisting the Democratic Revolutionary Front, the United States hoped
       to achieve the goal of defeating Castro without committing American troops.
       On the night of April 17, 1961, the long-awaited Bay of Pigs invasion began, named for the spot where the
       invaders were to come ashore. It ended in disaster. Although they quickly overcame a local militia force, the
       invaders could not hold out against the Cuban Army, anticipated air support from the United States failed to
       materialize, and the invaders surrendered three days later. The United States was humiliated, and far from
       weakening Castro, its aggressive actions may actually have increased support for the revolution and
       strengthened nationalistic fervor among the Cuban people. The failed invasion also led Castro to seek
       protection from the Soviet Union.
       Cuba had been of little interest to the Soviets until now. But by protecting it from U.S. threats, the Soviet Union
       stood to gain increased status in the region while also thwarting its Cold War rival. Indeed, failure to protect
       Cuba, Khrushchev feared, would send a message to other revolutionaries in Latin America that the Soviets
       were unable to protect them from U.S. aggression too. Accordingly, in 1962, the Soviet Union armed Cuba with
       nuclear missiles, and the construction of missile launch facilities on the island began that summer.
       Photographs taken by a U-2 surveillance plane alerted the U.S. government to the presence of the missiles,
       aimed at the United States. After convening the National Security Council in October 1962, President Kennedy
       weighed his options. Although the U.S. military suggested an invasion of Cuba, he feared that would lead the
       Soviets to attack Berlin in retaliation. He could not allow the Soviet action to go unchallenged, however; to do
       so would make the United States--and Kennedy personally--seem weak.
       On October 22, Kennedy ordered the navy to form a blockade around Cuba to intercept Soviet ships delivering
       additional missiles. He informed the world of this "quarantine," avoiding the word "blockade" because under
       international law a blockade could be considered an act of war. U.S. forces around the world were placed on
       high alert, and U.S. planes flew low over Cuba in preparation for a potential invasion, the only option for
       removing the missiles if the Soviets did not back down. On the island below, Soviet technicians continued the
       missiles' installation (Figure 14.18).

FIGURE 14.18 Soviet Missiles in Cuba. A photograph taken by a U.S. U-2 spy plane in 1962 clearly reveals evidence
of the means to assemble Soviet missiles in Cuba. (credit: "Cuba Missiles Crisis U-2 photo" by The John F. Kennedy
Presidential Library and Museum /Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
The world held its breath. For ten days people pondered the possibility of nuclear war as the incident, which
came to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, dragged on. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev refused to retreat.
A number of incidents occurred that might each have begun a nuclear conflict. A U-2 spy plane flying over
Cuba to monitor the missile installation was shot down and its pilot killed, but Kennedy refrained from acting.
Another U-2 mistakenly flew over the Soviet Union's east coast, causing Soviet fighters to take off to intercept
it, which in turn led U.S. fighters to take flight. The U.S. Navy dropped a depth charge on a Soviet submarine.
The submarine had been maintaining radio silence and was unaware of the events taking place on the surface.
Believing a war had started, two of the three officers on board wanted to launch a nuclear warhead, but the
third officer, whose consent was needed, refused to allow them to do so.
Earlier that year, the United States had placed missiles in Turkey. Khrushchev was angered, but now he offered
Kennedy a way out of the Cuban stalemate: if the missiles in Turkey were removed, those in Cuba would be too.
Kennedy accepted the offer. The dismantling of the Cuban missiles began, and on November 2, 1962, Kennedy
informed the world of Soviet compliance. On November 20, the blockade ended; in April 1963, the United
States removed its missiles from Turkey, though over the protests of the Turkish government.
Following the standoff, a direct telephone hotline was established between Washington and Moscow to enable
instant communications between the leaders of the two rival nations. The dangers of nuclear war did not
necessarily diminish, however. Thwarted in their attempt to place nuclear missiles in Cuba, the Soviets
focused on the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, which could strike the United States from
Europe. The United States also continued to develop its weaponry.
In China, Mao Zedong had criticized the Soviets for being insufficiently supportive of socialist revolution
604 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       around the world. So Khrushchev's willingness to back down when confronted by the United States and to
       seemingly abandon Cuba gave credence to Mao's claims. It also improved Mao's position within the Chinese
       Communist Party. He had found himself locked in a struggle with other CCP members, who favored closer
       relations with the Soviet Union because of the economic and technological expertise it could provide. The
       humiliation of the Soviets now weakened the position of those members, such as Liu Shaoqi and Deng
       Xiaoping. Conversely, Khrushchev's power was seriously damaged by the Cuban Missile Crisis, and two years
       later he was forced from office.

       Although the United States achieved its goal of removing Soviet missiles from Cuba, Castro's government
       nevertheless remained in power. Communist parties were also strong in other parts of Latin America. In 1961,
       Rafael Trujillo, the anti-communist dictator of the Dominican Republic, was assassinated and replaced by the
       liberal reformer Juan Bosch, who was himself overthrown by the Dominican army in 1963. On April 24, 1965,
       liberal Dominican army officers rose up in revolt in an attempt to return Bosch to power. Four days later,
       twenty-two thousand U.S. troops invaded in order to prevent a communist takeover, as President Lyndon
       Johnson claimed. They placed a conservative government in power.

       In Chile, Salvador Allende, the candidate of a socialist-communist coalition party called Popular Unity, was
       elected president in three consecutive presidential elections in 1958, 1964, and 1970. The CIA worked with the
       Chilean army to engineer a coup, and in September 1973, Allende and thousands of his supporters were killed.
       The leader of the coup General Agosto Pinochet became Chile's president and ruled as a dictator until 1990.
       The CIA also trained and funded the right-wing Contras to fight against the Sandinista National Liberation
       Front, which came to power in Nicaragua after overthrowing the dictatorial president Anastasio Somoza
       Debayle. The Sandinistas received support from the Soviet Union and Cuba.

      Tensions in Asia

       Though its interventions in Latin America were confounded by Castro's Cuba and popular support for
       communist parties in other Central and South American countries, the United States continued to try to
       prevent the spread of communism, notably in Southeast Asia.

       Escalation in Vietnam

       In the summer of 1963, South Vietnamese generals, disgusted by the corruption of Ngo Dinh Diem's regime
       and realizing his unpopularity was hampering their fight against North Vietnam and the Viet Cong,
       assassinated Diem and his brother Nhu. Though greeted with jubilation by most South Vietnamese, the killings
       did not lead to the creation of a democratic government. The country was afterward governed by a succession
       of leaders; none were effective or earned the loyalty of the population. All were maintained in power by the
       United States, which proved willing to support any politician promising to take a hard line against communism
       and continue the war against North Vietnam.

       The U.S. role in the Vietnam War intensified in 1964. In early August, U.S. ships stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin
       off the coast of North Vietnam reported they had come under attack. A crew member on duty believed he saw
       signs of a North Vietnamese torpedo strike on his sonar. Despite the fact that there was no other evidence to
       support the claim and the incident most likely did not take place, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin
       Resolution on August 7, 1964. The resolution gave President Lyndon Johnson permission to retaliate against
       North Vietnamese attacks and to act first to defend U.S. lives.

       The situation in Vietnam swiftly escalated. In 1965, Johnson committed U.S. ground forces and began the
       bombing of the North. Troops from other nations, including Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and South
       Korea, assisted in the fighting. The guerrilla war fought by the Viet Cong confounded U.S. troops, who came to
       see every Vietnamese peasant as a potential enemy. They relocated South Vietnamese farmers and burned
       their villages in an attempt to deny their opponents sources of support.

       In early 1968, however, a series of coordinated Viet Cong attacks that struck cities and military installations

throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday of Tet called into question the success of the U.S.
efforts. Although North Vietnamese officials later admitted the Viet Cong had suffered serious losses during the
Tet Offensive, in the immediate aftermath it seemed as though the United States and South Vietnam were no
closer to defeating North Vietnam than they had ever been. Many in the United States had already begun to
question the military's involvement in Vietnam and to call for the withdrawal of troops. Their opposition grew
even more intense following the revelation in 1969 that U.S. troops had massacred unarmed peasants in the
village of My Lai the year before.

By the early 1970s, the United States was seeking a way to escape the situation in Vietnam. President Richard
Nixon did not wish to simply withdraw, however. Instead, a peace agreement would have to be reached. North
Vietnam had been reluctant to negotiate on U.S. terms, but damage to the relationship between two of its
supporters, China and the Soviet Union, had threatened to isolate it and made it more amenable to seeking
peace.

The Sino-Soviet Split

China and the Soviet Union had once been firm allies. The Soviet Union had supported the Chinese Communist
Party since its founding and had signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in 1950. It
had given China both money and valuable technical assistance as the latter sought to build its industrial
capacity. However, because Mao had greatly admired Stalin, he disapproved of Khrushchev's 1956
denunciation of him. He also believed that as China's leader since 1949, he had "seniority" over Khrushchev, in
power only since 1953. In Mao's eyes, he himself, not Khrushchev, should be the leader of world communism.

The "Sino-Soviet split" widened when Khrushchev, fearing Mao's insistence on attacking Taiwan might
provoke war with the United States, refused to provide China with nuclear weapons. Khrushchev's actions
were representative of Mao's chief criticism of the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin. The Soviets, Mao
believed, had become too comfortable as leaders of the communist world and were no longer willing to risk
confrontation with the United States or other imperialist powers if this would jeopardize their position. The
USSR was doing too little, in the eyes of China, to support decolonization struggles in Africa and Asia and wars
of independence. Indeed, far from being anti-imperialist, the Soviets had created their own empire in Europe.
Other issues contributed to the rift. In the clash between India and China in 1962, for example, the USSR
supported India; in 1969, Soviet and Chinese forces clashed in a dispute over their shared border. In the late
1960s, China cut back its financing of North Vietnam's war against the South, and North Vietnam turned to the
Soviet Union to fill the gap.

The United States was eager to capitalize on the Sino-Soviet split in hopes of securing several advantages. In
1972 Nixon visited China, the first sitting U.S. president to do so, and met with Mao. This effort to improve U.S.
relations with China threatened to isolate the Soviet Union, so in turn the Soviets agreed to hold a Moscow
Summit meeting between Brezhnev and Nixon in May 1972. The United States then used the Soviet desire for
closer relations to exert pressure on North Vietnam. In March 1972, after the North launched an offensive
against the South, Nixon threatened to call off the Moscow Summit if the Soviets did not force North Vietnam to
the peace table.

In the end, the United States' efforts to extricate itself from the war were successful. At the peace talks in Paris,
North Vietnam and the United States agreed to the U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam in 1973. The war
continued until 1975, however, when North Vietnam defeated South Vietnam, and the country was reunified
under a communist government. All told, the war had cost the lives of more than one million people.

Genocide in Cambodia

Although peace came to Vietnam in 1975, in neighboring Cambodia a nightmare was just beginning.
Throughout much of the war in Vietnam, Cambodia had been neutral. In 1970, however, its ruler Prince
Sihanouk was deposed by one of his generals, Lon Nol, who favored the United States. Sihanouk then allied
himself with the Cambodian communist group, the Khmer Rouge. In 1975, after years of fighting, the Khmer
606 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       Rouge overthrew the government of Lon Nol.

       Under the rule of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader and an admirer of Mao Zedong, Cambodia embarked on a
       program to rebuild itself as the perfect communist state. The Khmer Rouge seized private property and forced
       city dwellers to relocate to the countryside. The population was made to labor in work camps and on collective
       farms, and some died as a result of disease and starvation. Those who were unable to work were killed. The
       Khmer Rouge also carried out a deliberate campaign of extermination against professionals, intellectuals
       (which could mean anyone who wore glasses), Christians, Muslims, Buddhist monks, and people of Chinese,
       Thai, and Vietnamese ancestry. By the time the killing ended with the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam in
       1978, some three million people, approximately one-quarter of Cambodia's population, had died.

       Although Southeast Asia remained mired in violence and turmoil, in the West there were new hopes for peace
       as the Cold War showed signs of thawing. At the 1972 Moscow Summit, the United States and the USSR signed
       the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty (SALT), a mutual agreement to restrict the development of antiballistic
       missiles meant to destroy incoming warheads, thus rendering useless the defense strategy of mutually assured
       destruction. This marked the beginning of a period of détente, a relaxation of tensions between the United
       States and the Soviet Union that included trade agreements and additional arms-reduction talks. In 1975, the
       United States and the Soviet Union, along with Canada and all the countries of Europe, except for Albania,
       signed the Helsinki Accords. The United States and its allies pledged to respect the borders of Eastern Bloc
       countries and to refrain from intervening in their internal affairs. The Soviet Union promised to respect
       human rights.

      Decolonization in Africa in the Shadow of the Cold War

       Like the Vietnamese, the peoples of Africa also wished to shake off Western control following World War II. The
       Atlantic Charter, a 1941 agreement by the United Kingdom and the United States regarding their shared goals
       for the postwar world, had promised self-determination for all, and African countries wanted to make this a
       reality. In October 1945, the Fifth Pan-African Congress assembled in Manchester, England. Delegates from
       Europe's African colonies as well as from the Caribbean, the United States, India, Sri Lanka, and Central
       America called for an end to colonialism.

       European colonial powers were not of the same mind. Following the devastation of World War II, some
       regarded the natural resources and markets of African colonies essential to rebuilding their damaged
       economies. For example, the new constitution granted to Britain's colony of Gold Coast (Ghana) in 1946
       reflected the desire of the United Kingdom, like other colonial powers, to retain control over its African
       possessions. Although Africans were given additional opportunities to elect the members of a Legislative
       Council, the council had only advisory capacity. All real power was held by the colony's appointed governor.

       In August 1947, Ghanaians formed the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), which called on the United
       Kingdom to make the colony self-governing. Among the founding members of the UGCC was Kwame Nkrumah.
       In January 1948, Nkrumah and another member of the UGCC addressed a group of Ghanaian ex-service
       members. Like many in the Gold Coast, they were angry over the government's failure to address problems
       such as unemployment and inflation and planned to petition the governor. When riots broke out in the colony a
       few days later, the government blamed the UGCC and arrested several of its members, including Nkrumah. In
       1949, Nkrumah founded his own political party, the Convention People's Party, and in January 1950 he called
       on his followers to begin a general strike to force the British to allow the drafting of a new constitution. He was
       jailed again and was in prison when he was elected to office in 1951, in the first election in Africa in which
       universal suffrage was allowed. Nkrumah became Ghana's prime minister, and on March 6, 1957, Ghana
       received its independence.

       Following Ghana, other British colonies also won their independence. In 1944, the Kenya African Union (KAU)
       was founded to call for Kenya's liberation from British rule, and in 1947 Jomo Kenyatta assumed its leadership.

profitable coffee plantations and controlled more land than did Black Africans. In 1952, a group called the
Kenya Land and Freedom Army, popularly known as the Mau Mau, began to fight for independence.

The Mau Mau, a nationalist movement among the Kikuyu people, espoused violence as a means to their goal.
To spread fear, they attacked civilians, both White and Black, burning people to death or killing them with
machetes. Africans who remained loyal to the British government were targeted. In response, the United
Kingdom banned all Kenyan political parties, including the KAU that did not advocate violence, and struck
back at the Mau Mau. Thousands were sent to internment camps. Entire villages were forcibly resettled in new
areas, ostensibly to protect them from the Mau Mau. Innocent civilians were killed by forces employed by the
British government. By 1956, the uprising had largely been brought to an end. In 1960, the United Kingdom
began talks to discuss Kenyan independence, which was granted in 1963. Kenyatta became the country's
prime minister.

 Violence in Kenya

  Kenya was one of many British colonies that sought independence following World War II. There, as in other
  places in Africa, people were divided over the best means to achieve it. Some, like Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta,
  proposed a peaceful solution. Others, like the members of the Mau Mau, endorsed violence. The attitudes of the
  two sides are contrasted in the following speech Kenyatta gave in 1952 and in a Mau Mau oath from the same
  period.

        I want you to know the purpose of K.A.U. [Kenya African Union]. It is the biggest purpose the African
        has. It involves every African in Kenya and it is their mouthpiece which asks for freedom. K.A.U. is you
        and you are the K.A.U. If we unite now, each and every one of us, and each tribe to another, we will
        cause the implementation in this country of that which the European calls democracy. True democracy
        has no colour distinction. It does not choose between black and white . . . . We are not worried that
        other races are here with us in our country, but we insist that we are the leaders here, and what we want
        we insist we get. We want our cattle to get fat on our land so that our children grow up in prosperity; we
        do not want that fat removed to feed others. . . .

        Our country today is in a bad state for its land is full of fools--and fools in a country delay the
        independence of its people. K.A.U. seeks to remedy this situation and I tell you now it despises thieving,
        robbery and murder for these practices ruin our country. I say this because if one man steals, or two
        men steal, there are people sitting close by lapping up information, who say the whole tribe is bad
        because a theft has been committed. Those people are wrecking our chances of advancement. They will
        prevent us getting freedom. If I have my own way, let me tell you I would butcher the criminal, and
        there are more criminals than one in more senses than one. . . .

        K.A.U. is not a fighting union that uses fists and weapons. If any of you here think that force is good, I do
        not agree with you. I do not want people to accuse us falsely--that we steal and that we are Mau Mau. I
        pray to you that we join hands for freedom and freedom means abolishing criminality.

        --Jomo Kenyatta, "Speech at the African Union Meeting"

        I swear before God and before the people who are here that

        I have today become a soldier of Gikuyu and Mumbi and I will from now onwards fight the real fight for
        the land and freedom of our country till we get it or till my last drop of blood. Today I have set my first
        step as a warrior and I will never retreat.

        And if I ever retreat

               -- Donald L. Barnett and Karari Njama, "The Mau Mau Warrior Oath"

           · What parts of the Mau Mau oath would Jomo Kenyatta dislike? Are there parts he might be willing to take
               himself?

           · Why does Kenyatta reject the tactics of the Mau Mau?

       Nationalism and the desire for independence were powerful in the colonies of other European countries as
       well. Some imperial powers attempted moderate changes at first. In 1946, for example, France proposed
       sweeping reforms for its African colonies. It ended forced labor and racially discriminatory practices and
       allowed for a degree of self-rule. It did not offer independence, but that was what France's African subjects
       most wanted and fought for. From 1947 to 1949, the Malagasy Revolt raged in Madagascar, costing thousands
       of lives. Violence brought an end to colonialism in Cameroon in 1957 as well. In Algeria, warfare lasted from
       1954 to 1962, when France granted independence, and more than one million people of European descent
       departed the country.

       In the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Cold War tensions contributed to the
       violence. When in 1960 Belgium promised the Congolese independence in thirty years, nationalist groups such
       as the Congolese National Movement and the Alliance of Bakongo responded that they wanted it immediately.
       Black Congolese held protests that often ended in riots, and they refused to pay taxes. Alarmed, many White
       residents started citizens' militias and attacked Black residents. Realizing the strength of the nationalist
       protest, the government of Belgium agreed to grant Congo its independence on June 30, 1960.

       This did not end the violence, however. When Émile Janssens, the White commander of the Force Publique, the
       Belgian Congo's security force, made clear to Black troops a few days after independence that White officers
       would remain in charge, soldiers mutinied. Patrice Lamumba, the leader of the Congolese National Movement
       who had been elected prime minister, replaced Janssens with a Black commander of the renamed National
       Congolese Army and promoted Black soldiers. This was not enough to end the mutiny, however. White people
       were attacked across the country, and Belgian forces invaded to protect them.

       In the midst of the chaos, Congo's mineral-rich southern province of Katanga seceded and proclaimed its
       independence. Lamumba appealed to the UN, which had sent peacekeeping forces to restore order, to end
       Katanga's secession. The UN refused, however, claiming secession was an internal political matter with which
       it should not interfere. Lamumba then asked the United States for help, but his request was denied. Finally, he
       turned to the Soviet Union, which provided weapons and military advisers. Lamumba's acceptance of Soviet
       support branded him a communist in Western eyes. Taking advantage of the chaos, Colonel Joseph-Désiré

Mobutu (Mobutu Sese Seko), the new head of the security force, put Lamumba under house arrest and placed
Joseph Kasa-Vubu, the leader of the Alliance of Bakongo, in charge of the government. Lamumba was
subsequently killed by Katangese troops with the knowledge and support of the CIA, which provided both
money and weapons to Mobutu and Kasa-Vubu.

British politicians, observing the strength of nationalist fervor not only in Kenya but also in other colonies, and
fearing more violence like that experienced in Congo, moved quickly to liberate British colonies in Africa, the
Caribbean, and Asia. In 1960, Harold Macmillan, the British prime minister, visited Africa and delivered a
speech called "The Wind of Change." The wind of change was sweeping Africa, Macmillan declared, and the
time of liberation had come, even though White Britons might not want it.

Unlike Britain, France, and Belgium, Portugal steadfastly refused to relinquish its colonies. The nationalistic,
quasi-fascist government of the Second Portuguese Republic that had first come to power in 1933 regarded
them as part of Portugal and considered Portugal to be a guarantor of order and civilization in Africa. A variety
of independence movements sprang up in Angola, Portuguese Guinea (now called Guinea-Bissau), and
Mozambique, just as they did elsewhere in Africa. Some groups sought to establish self-government along the
lines of Western democracies, while others favored the creation of a communist system. In Angola, Portuguese
troops battled the National Liberation Front (FNLA), a largely rural organization comprising Bakongo people,
the Marxist People's Movement of Liberation of Angola (MPLA), a largely urban group, and the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), a rural group made up principally of Ovimbundu people. In
Mozambique, the Marxist Mozambique Liberation Front fought for independence. The African Party for the
Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde, another Marxist organization, led the liberation struggle in Guinea-
Bissau.

The Cold War intruded upon the battle in the Portuguese colonies. The Soviet Union, China, Romania, Cuba,
and Yugoslavia all provided aid to the various independence groups. The United States did not because
Portugal was a fellow NATO member. In 1974, leftist military officers in Portugal overthrew the government of
the Second Portuguese Republic and established a democratic government. The new government ended the
war with the African colonies by granting independence to Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique along
with Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe, islands off the African coast. Independence did not bring an end
to the violence, however. In 1975, civil war broke in Angola for control of the country. The United States
provided support for UNITA and FNLA in their struggle against the MPLA.

Violence also erupted in the former British colony of Rhodesia (now called Zimbabwe). Rejecting the British
government's plans for majority rule in its former colonies, White residents, unwilling to submit to a
government controlled by Black Rhodesians, proclaimed independence from the United Kingdom in 1965 with
Ian Smith as prime minister, a move that Britain opposed. Civil war broke out between the White government
and two Black nationalist groups, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) led by Joshua Nkomo, and the
Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) led by Robert Mugabe. The Soviet Union lent support to ZAPU, and
China to ZANU. Eventually an agreement was reached among all three parties, and the United Kingdom
officially recognized Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. Robert Mugabe became prime minister, and
thousands of Nkomo's followers were tortured, imprisoned, or killed until he and Mugabe combined their
political parties in 1987.

Similar to the situation in Rhodesia, Black Africans in South Africa struggled for independence not against a
European power but against White Africans. In 1909, the British Cape Colony, Natal, and the Boer republics of
Transvaal and the Orange Free State had been combined to form a self-governing dominion within the British
Empire. Only the White minority had been allowed to rule, however, and the contest for power had been
between Whites of British and Afrikaner (Dutch) descent. Laws denied Black Africans the right to vote and
prevented them from laying claim to most of the country's land. They were denied the right to live in some
parts of the country, and many were forcibly removed to "homelands" apart from Whites. In 1948,
discriminatory practices and racial segregation were formalized in a system called apartheid. In 1950, South
610 14 · Cold War Conflicts

       Africa's legislature passed the Suppression of Communism Act, which banned not only the anti-apartheid
       South African Communist Party but also any actions to end racially discriminatory practices. Thus, when in
       1960 the United Kingdom allowed South Africans to vote on whether to remain a dominion, the majority of the
       population could not participate. In 1961, South Africa officially became a republic, but the true liberation
       movement was still underway.

       From its very beginning, groups such as the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist Congress
       (PAC) had fought apartheid, with peaceful protest at first. However, following the killing of peaceful protesters
       in the Black township of Sharpeville and the banning of the ANC and PAC, both in 1960, anti-apartheid
       activists began to employ sabotage and attacks on police and military targets, along with more peaceful tactics
       like strikes. In 1976, protests erupted in Black townships against a new law requiring Black African students to
       learn Afrikaans (the language spoken by South Africa's Dutch colonizers). In the township of Soweto, the police
       opened fire on schoolchildren, killing more than one hundred. Over the course of decades, thousands of
       activists were arrested and imprisoned, including Nelson Mandela, a leader of the ANC, and many were
       executed. By the 1980s, however, continued opposition to apartheid, economic sanctions imposed by foreign
       countries, boycotts of South African businesses, and international condemnation had begun to have an effect.
       In 1991, South Africa officially ended the policy of apartheid; in 1994, the first elections were held in which all
       South Africans could vote regardless of race. The ANC swept to victory, and the new National Assembly elected
       Nelson Mandela president.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:
         · Explain why the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc collapsed
         · Discuss the effects of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe
         · Describe the changes made by Deng Xiaoping in China in the 1970s and 1980s

       At the beginning of the Cold War, ideological differences between the Soviet Union and the United States
       seemed insurmountable. The enmity between the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc resulted in conflicts
       around the globe that cost the lives of millions of people. Millions also died in China's pursuit of the ideal
       communist society. Nuclear weapons that threatened the very existence of the human species were stockpiled
       in preparation for a war that neither side wanted. A world that was not so deeply divided seemed unimaginable
       to many. However, the Cold War lasted less than fifty years.

      The Collapse of Communism: The Eastern Bloc

       The Cold War had begun in Greece, an unlikely place. Its last shot was also fired in an unlikely
       place--Afghanistan, the site of the final proxy war waged between the allies of the Soviet Union and those of the
       United States.

       In 1973, the nationalist Mohammad Sardar Daoud Khan, once the prime minister of Afghanistan from 1953 to
       1963, came to power again in that country after deposing its king. He was originally backed by the communist
       People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), which received support from the Soviet Union. Not all
       factions of the PDPA supported Daoud, however. When he failed to reconcile the factions and realized he was
       losing the support of PDPA members who had helped him to power, he turned to the United States for support.
       He wished to free Afghanistan from dependence on the Soviet Union, which had extended assistance to the
       country in the past, and he reasoned that the United States would help. He also sought closer relations with
       U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Iran and expelled Soviet military and economic advisers from the country.

       In 1978, Daoud was overthrown and killed by one of the PDPA factions. As the victors sought to eliminate their
       enemies, a group of Islamic fundamentalists who opposed secular and Western influences on Islamic societies
       and endorsed strict codes of behavior fought back against government attempts to spread communism to

tribal areas. When it became clear that the PDPA leader favored by Moscow could not maintain control of the
country and a pro-U.S. rival was gaining ascendancy, the Soviet Union sent ground troops to invade
Afghanistan in December 1979.

President Jimmy Carter protested the Soviet incursion and imposed economic sanctions. The United States
also continued arming the Islamist enemies of the pro-Soviet Afghan regime, a policy it had been following for
some time. These Islamist insurgents, called the mujahideen (Arabic for Muslims who battle non-Muslims on
behalf of Islam), regarded the Afghan government and the Soviet Union as enemies of religion and waged a
guerrilla war against them. The Soviet Union fought the various groups of mujahideen for ten years without
coming close to victory. It spent the equivalent of billions of dollars and lost some fifteen thousand soldiers.
About two million Afghans were killed.

Among the groups of mujahideen who fought the Soviets were young men from the Pashtun tribe who had
studied at Islamic religious schools in Pakistan. They were supported by both the CIA and its Pakistani
equivalent, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, and were called the Taliban (meaning "student" in the
Pashtun tribal language of Pashto). Following the withdrawal of the Soviets, various groups of mujahideen
battled for control of Afghanistan, with the Taliban eventually emerging victorious. The stability and order
their rule offered was welcomed by many Afghans after the long years of chaos.

Although the United States offered the mujahideen support to combat the Soviets in Afghanistan, it found itself
the enemy of another group of Islamic fundamentalists, this time in Iran. Since the 1950s, the United States
had provided funds and weapons to the leader of Iran, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. With U.S. aid, the Shah
had built one of the largest armies in the Middle East and SAVAK, one of the most feared secret police forces.
He allowed no dissent, and the secret police spied upon, arrested, and tortured anyone suspected of opposing
him. The Shah's efforts to modernize and Westernize Iran by granting women the right to vote, outlawing their
wearing of veils, and providing them equal opportunities for education angered many traditionalist Muslim
religious leaders. They also disliked the messages contained in the Western movies and music the Shah had
allowed into Iran. In contrast, although liberal Iranians approved of these actions, they disliked the lack of
political freedom. Nearly all Iranians resented the enormous wealth the Shah and his closest friends had
amassed as a result of U.S. assistance. The Shah had few supporters.

One of his most outspoken critics was the Shiite religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Despite being
repeatedly arrested, Khomeini continued to criticize both the Shah and his patron, the U.S. government. In
1964, Khomeini was expelled from Iran. This did not end his influence, however, and tape-recorded messages
from him encouraging opposition to the Shah were smuggled into the country. Beginning in 1977, Khomeini
exhorted Iranians to go on strike and refuse to pay their taxes. In 1978, waves of protests and strikes by
government and oil industry workers were punished with attacks by government forces. Each was followed by
a larger wave of protest.

On January 16, 1979, the Shah and his family fled the country, and two weeks later Ayatollah Khomeini
returned. He was greeted enthusiastically by the vast majority of Iranians, and in mid-February 1979, Shapur
Bakhtiar, the prime minister appointed by the Shah, was replaced by Mehdi Bazargan, selected by Khomeini.
In December 1979, the Iranian people voted to adopt a constitution making the country an Islamic republic.
Islam became the nation's official religion, and the constitution ordained that all laws passed must conform to
Islamic law.

On October 22, 1979, the Shah entered the United States for medical treatment. Many Iranians feared this
meant Washington was about to take steps to return him to power. On November 4, Iranian students stormed
the U.S. embassy in the Iranian capital of Tehran and took its staff and Marine guards hostage, demanding the
Shah be returned to Iran for trial and execution (Figure 14.19). Their actions were widely supported within
Iran, including by Khomeini, which led the moderate prime minister to resign. Although female and African
American hostages were released within a few days, the others were held for 444 days, to be set free on
January 20, 1981, the day President Carter left office.

       Fearing that Iraqi Shiites would be radicalized by events in neighboring Iran, the Sunni-dominated
       government of Iraq, controlled by the socialist Ba'ath Party, sent its troops to invade Iran. Iraq also hoped to
       resolve long-standing border disputes between the two nations and replace Iran as the dominant nation in the
       region, which had not been possible when Iran was receiving U.S. military and economic support. The United
       States provided economic and technological support to Iraq. The Iran-Iraq war ended in August 1988 with a
       cease-fire arranged by the United Nations and no real gains by either side.
       Despite its support of Iraq in its war against Iran, the chief concern of the United States in the 1980s was not
       violence in the Middle East but the destruction of communism. Jimmy Carter was followed in office by
       President Ronald Reagan, who considered the Soviet Union an "evil empire" and vowed to eliminate
       communism. He believed the United States should negotiate with the Soviets to ensure world peace but should
       do so from a position of strength. To this end, he ordered a buildup of the country's abilities to fight both a
       conventional and a nuclear war. His successor in office, George H.W. Bush, continued those efforts.

                                                                                                  IN THEIR OWN WORDS
        An "Evil Empire"

         In a speech delivered in March 1983, President Ronald Reagan called for peace with the Soviet Union but on U.S.
         terms. Specifically, Reagan said he would not agree to arms limitation talks until the United States was equal to
         the Soviet Union in military capacity. In his speech, he described the contest between the two countries as one
         between good and evil.

               I intend to do everything I can to persuade [the Soviet Union] of our peaceful intent. [. . .]
               At the same time, however, they must be made to understand: we will never compromise our principles
               and standards. We will never give away our freedom. We will never abandon our belief in God. [. . .]
               Yes, let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness--pray they will
               discover the joy of knowing God. But until they do, let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy
               of the State, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination of all
               peoples on the earth, they are the focus of evil in the modern world. [. . .]

        Like other dictators before them, they're always making "their final territorial demand," some would
        have us accept them at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses. But if
        history teaches anything, it teaches that simpleminded appeasement or wishful thinking about our
        adversaries is folly. It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering of our freedom.

        --Ronald Reagan, "Evil Empire Speech"

    · Why does Reagan use religious language? What effect does this have?
    · To what other country is he comparing the Soviet Union when he talks about "simple-minded

        appeasement"? Do you think this is a good comparison? Why or why not?

When the new leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power in 1985, discontent was
simmering in the Soviet Union and in the countries of Eastern Europe. Shortages of food and other goods were
making people angry. In Poland in 1980, shipyard workers under the leadership of labor activist Lech Walsa
formed a trade union and went on strike to protest government policies. Within a year, one-third of Poland's
population had joined the Solidarity union. The Polish government tried to suppress the movement and
banned the union, but its ten million members could not be silenced. Pope John Paul II, himself a Pole and an
opponent of communism, called upon the Polish church to support the workers.

Gorbachev realized the need for reform in the Soviet Union. The country simply could not afford to both
compete militarily with the United States and provide its citizens what they needed to lead decent lives.
Gorbachev thus willingly entered into arms limitation talks with Reagan. He also began a program of
perestroika, a "restructuring" of the Soviet state and economy. He cut military spending and encouraged the
beginnings of private enterprise. As part of his reform efforts, Gorbachev also encouraged glasnost or
openness, allowing those who were angry to be critical of the government.

Changes in the Soviet Union mirrored changes taking place elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc. In 1988, protests
broke out again in Poland, and strikes swept the country. The Polish government was forced to negotiate with
Solidarity leaders and make concessions to them, including free elections for some government offices. In
1989, Hungary and East Germany opened their borders, allowing their citizens to come and go freely. Berliners
climbed atop the wall that divided their city and began to tear it down. People in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia
called for changes in their government as well. Soviet tanks did not roll through the streets, and troops did not
arrest or fire upon protesters. Gorbachev informed other members of the Soviet government that he did not
intend to use military might to maintain control of Eastern Europe. In 1990, Germany was reunified, and the
capital was returned to Berlin.

But the reforms Gorbachev initiated to save the Soviet Union eventually tore it apart. The Soviet republics also
wanted their independence. Advocates of reform and democracy pushed for greater change. Not everyone in
the Soviet Union was pleased by the reforms taking place, though. In August 1991, conservative members of
the Communist Party attempted to remove Gorbachev from power, only to be foiled by the actions of Boris
Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic. Acting together, Yeltsin and the presidents of the Soviet republics
of Belarus and Ukraine voted in December 1991 to dissolve the Soviet Union. The Cold War was at an end.

Ironically, the collapse of the Eastern Bloc also meant the demise of Yugoslavia, which had tried so hard to
stand apart from it. The need to present a united front to the Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact nations
had served as a powerful glue binding together the many disparate ethnic groups and states that comprised
Yugoslavia. Had Tito lived, the country might have remained unified for a while longer, but he died in May
1980. In 1991 the states of Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina declared their independence from
Yugoslavia. When Serbian minorities in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albanians in the Serbian
province of Kosovo attempted to proclaim their independence from these larger states, violence broke out.

      The Retreat of Communism: China

       The excesses of the Cultural Revolution in China spelled the end of both Mao Zedong's power and, ironically,
       the Chinese Revolution. By the time of Lin Biao's death in 1971, China had suffered badly. The economy was in
       shambles. The government had difficulty fulfilling basic functions. As Mao retreated into depression and ill
       health, his role was increasingly taken over by "The Gang of Four," consisting of Mao's wife Jiang Qing, his
       chosen successor Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan. However, they were primarily
       concerned with ensuring ideological purity and the continuation of "revolutionary" political thought. Crucial
       matters such as the economy were left in the hands of Premier Zhou Enlai.
       Zhou, however, was dying of cancer and needed help, so with Mao's permission he returned Deng Xiaoping to
       power to assist him (Figure 14.20). Zhou and Deng managed the government and the economy, with more of
       the work falling to Deng as Zhou withdrew from public life. Following Zhou's death in January 1976, the Gang
       of Four managed to oust Deng Xiaoping from power once more, but this time he did not remain away for long.

       Following Mao's death on September 9, 1976, his successor Hua Guofeng had the Gang of Four arrested and
       Deng returned to power. Deng was made vice premier in 1977 and used his position to reverse the mistakes of
       the Cultural Revolution. In 1978, he replaced Hua as leader of China and argued that the country needed to
       focus on modernizing and building its economy instead of continuing to pursue revolution by following the

teachings of Mao. He instituted a policy of Boluan Fanzheng ("correct the wrong/return to normal"), in which
the reputations of those imprisoned were "rehabilitated," and those still alive were returned to power. The
Chinese system of higher education returned to normal as Deng reinstated entrance examinations, which had
been suspended during the Cultural Revolution. He declared that scientists and intellectuals were deserving of
respect because modernization could not proceed without their contributions.

Deng also instituted a sweeping set of economic reforms based on the "Four Modernizations" of agriculture,
industry, defense, and science and technology. Collective farms were broken up and entrepreneurs
encouraged to start their own businesses. The country was opened to foreign investment, and foreign
companies were invited to open Chinese branches. In the 1980s and 1990s, a few elements of capitalism were
introduced. Private management of many state industries was allowed, and although the largest remained
under government control, people's incomes and the Chinese standard of living swiftly improved. Along with
economic changes, alterations took place in foreign policy. In the 1980s, China decreased its support for
revolutionary activity in other countries, with some exceptions, such as its support for anti-Soviet forces in
Afghanistan and for Cambodians fighting the Vietnamese invasion. Beginning in the late 1980s, relations with
the Soviet Union also began to improve, and trade between the USSR and China increased.

In 1980, Deng called for political reform as well. He criticized the cumbersome Chinese bureaucracy and
called for term limits on political positions and a redrafting of the constitution. However, he had no intention of
allowing opposition to the rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 1986, university students began a
series of protests in major Chinese cities. The government suppressed their actions, but in 1989 protests broke
out again.

Beginning on April 17, students in Beijing gathered at Tiananmen Square to mourn the recent death of party
official Hu Yaobang, who had supported them. Influenced by Western media, they called for democratic
reform, an end to government censorship, greater rights to protest, and more money for education. They and
other protesters also decried corruption in the CCP and what they perceived as mismanagement of China's
economy. Reforms had improved life for farmers, but industrial workers and urban dwellers had not benefited.
In the coming weeks, some students marched through the streets in angry protest, while others refused to
abandon the square. On the evening of June 3, 1989, tanks entered Beijing, and over the next several days
armed troops and tanks cleared the square, killing anywhere from several hundred to several thousand
people. On June 9, Deng denounced the students for attempting to overthrow the government. In other Chinese
cities, the protests ended peacefully.

Section Summary

14.1 The Cold War Begins

Following World War II, the two remaining superpowers--the United States and the Soviet Union--entered the
Cold War, an ideological contest in which each side competed for supremacy through the use of economic aid,
military assistance, technology, and propaganda. U.S. foreign policy was focused on containment, preventing
the influence of the Soviet Union and the ideology of communism from spreading beyond Eastern Europe. A
major test of each nation's resolve to defeat the other came with the Soviet Union's blockade of West Berlin in
1948-1949. The United States emerged victorious and with its Western Bloc allies formed the mutual defense
organization known as NATO. The Soviet Union responded by forming the Warsaw Pact with the Eastern Bloc
countries of Eastern Europe.

14.2 The Spread of Communism

In 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Mao Zedong defeated the Guomindang (GMD, the
Nationalists) led by Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) and founded the People's Republic of China, which the
United States refused to recognize. Communism spread elsewhere in Asia as well. In 1950, the communist
leader of North Korea invaded South Korea and called on the Chinese to help him defeat South Korean and UN
forces led by the United States. Communists also assumed power in North Vietnam after Vietnam was divided
following a war of independence with France. The United States, in an effort to stop the further spread of

communism, supported South Vietnam as it had South Korea, while China and the Soviet Union gave aid to
North Vietnam. Within China itself, people struggled to industrialize the nation under Mao. Many died in the
resulting famine and in the Cultural Revolution that followed.

14.3 The Non-Aligned Movement

Not all nations chose to align themselves with the United States or the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In
Europe, Yugoslavia chose to remain outside the Soviet orbit even though it was a communist country. Many
former European colonies became members of the Non-Aligned Movement, which sought to find a path to
development that did not require becoming a satellite of either of the superpowers. Among the leaders of this
movement were Indonesia, India, and Egypt, which still all found themselves accepting aid from the United
States, the USSR, or both. Egypt, however, was drawn closer to the Soviet Union because of Western support for
Israel and the belief that Western powers were thwarting its plans to become the leader of the Arab world.

14.4 Global Tensions and Decolonization

The Cold War was marked by global tensions. In Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, Soviet satellite states in the
Eastern Bloc tested Moscow's resolve to maintain control as their citizens pushed for greater freedoms and an
end to Soviet domination. Rebellions in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia were quickly crushed by the
USSR. The United States attempted to stem the tide of communist expansion in both Latin America and Asia as
it intervened in Guatemala, Cuba, and Vietnam. At times, as in Berlin in 1961 and Cuba in 1962, the United
States came perilously close to military conflict with the Soviet Union. By the late 1960s, however, a split
between the USSR and China gave the United States greater opportunities to maneuver on the world stage. As
the Western and Eastern Blocs faced off against one another in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, in Africa the
inhabitants of British, French, Belgian, and Portuguese colonies were fighting for their independence.

14.5 A New World Order

In the 1980s, communism began to loosen its grip on parts of the world in which it had once been dominant.
The Soviet Union found itself divided by the need to provide for its citizens at home, maintain control over its
satellite states in Eastern Europe, fight a war in Afghanistan, and respond to the buildup of nuclear and
conventional weapons that took place during the administrations of U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and George
H.W. Bush. Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to strengthen the Soviet Union through perestroika and glasnost
proved unsuccessful. When the Warsaw Pact nations sought independence in the late 1980s, the Soviet Union
was unable to respond as it once had, and faced with liberation movements in its own republics, the USSR
disbanded in 1991. Although China did not turn its back on communism, the death of Mao allowed Deng to
institute reforms that introduced elements of capitalism to the Chinese economy.

INTRODUCTION Few symbols of global trade and Americanization abroad have been as powerful as Coca-Cola
(Figure 15.1). Though it is the most widely consumed soft drink in the world, its conquest of the globe has not
been without controversy. Coca-Cola bottlers were accused of interfering with labor union organization in
South America in the 1990s, and in 2014, the company was forced to close a bottling plant in northern India
that was depriving farmers of water. Today, although Coca-Cola is making an effort to restore the water that it
uses in places like India and South Africa, some critics claim that it still uses more than it replenishes. Coke is
an apt symbol of the interconnectedness of our contemporary world and the challenges it presents. Many
people enjoy the benefits that come with an increasingly globalized economy, but many have also been harmed
in the process.

     15.1 A Global Economy

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how trade agreements and attempts to regulate world trade have shaped the global economy
             since the 1990s

         · Analyze the way multinational corporations have affected politics, workers, and the environment in
             developing nations

         · Discuss the way globalization has affected workers around the world
       In many ways, World Wars I and II were only temporary interruptions in a centuries-long process of global
       integration. This process is often called globalization, the interconnectedness of societies and economies
       throughout the world as a result of trade, technology, and the adoption and sharing of elements of culture.
       Globalization facilitates the movement of goods, people, technologies, and ideas across international borders.
       Historians of globalization note that it has a very long history. In the days of the Roman Empire and the Han
       dynasty, Europeans and Asians were connected to one another through trade along the Silk Roads. In the
       fourteenth century, the Black Death spread from Asia to Europe and North Africa, killing people on all three
       continents. With the European colonization of the Americas in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and British
       colonization of Australia, all of the world's inhabited continents became enmeshed in exchanges of peoples,
       products, and ideas that increased in the nineteenth century as the result of both technological developments
       and the imperialist impulses of industrialized nations. Only the world wars of the twentieth century brought a

temporary halt to these exchanges. Furthermore, once the world wars were over, globalization not only
resumed its pre-World War I trajectory but even gained speed, despite the Cold War and decolonization efforts
in Asia and Africa. As the Cold War came to a close, the United States and increasingly powerful corporations
ensured that capitalism and free-market economics would dominate the globe.

Global Trade

Even during the Cold War and decolonization, economic development and industrialization continued around
the world. Japan and West Germany, destroyed and defeated in the 1940s, were striking examples. Each dove
headlong into postwar rebuilding efforts that paid huge dividends. They invested heavily in their economies
and saw industrial production and economic growth skyrocket over the 1950s and 1960s. By 1970, both had
become economic powerhouses in their regions.

Similar, but smaller, economic miracles occurred in other places, especially in Europe. Spain underwent a
period of spectacular growth fueled by imported technology, government funding, and increased tourism and
industrialization in the 1960s. Italy began even earlier. By the early 1960s, its annual gross domestic product
(GDP) growth--the increase in value of all the goods and services the country was producing--had peaked at
just over 8 percent. France bounced back from the war years with a rise in population and an impressive new
consumer culture that became accustomed to a high standard of living and access to modern conveniences
like automobiles, televisions, and household appliances. Comparable growth occurred in Belgium, Greece, and
the Netherlands.

Contributing to this postwar economic growth was the emergence of regional economic cooperation in
Western Europe. The process began with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in
1951. The original member countries of the ECSC were West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium,
and Luxembourg. To both foster economic integration and preserve the peace, these member states agreed to
break down trade barriers between them by creating a common market in steel and coal. Across the six
countries, these products were allowed to flow without restrictions, like customs duties.

The success of the ECSC eventually paved the way for further economic integration in Europe with the
formation of the European Economic Community (EEC), also called the Common Market, in 1957. The EEC
used the economic-cooperation model developed by the ECSC and greatly expanded it to remove trading and
investment restrictions across its member states, far beyond just coal and steel. While generally successful,
the EEC's efforts at economic integration occasionally met resistance. Farmers who stood to lose economically
protested the way it opened national markets to agricultural products produced more cheaply in other
countries and sought protectionist policies. Yet despite these protests and concerns, the EEC continued to
expand.

Although Britain supported the EEC's economic goals, it was initially not interested in the political cooperation
the group represented. When it did signal its desire to join, Britain wanted special protections for its
agriculture and other exceptions for its Commonwealth connections, such as Canada. This meant negotiating
with France, then the EEC's most powerful member. Since decisions at that time were made unanimously and
member countries had the power to unilaterally veto, France's approval was crucial. President Charles de
Gaulle of France did not approve, however, and he cut off negotiations with Britain in 1960. Over the next
several years, Britain officially applied for EEC membership twice: in 1961 and again in 1967. Both times de
Gaulle worried that admitting Britain, with its strong ties to the United States, would transform the
organization into an Atlantic community controlled by Washington. Britain was admitted in 1973 (along with
Denmark and Ireland), when de Gaulle was no longer president of France. But many in the United Kingdom
had wanted to stay out, especially those in the Conservative Party. It took a UK referendum in 1975 to confirm
the country's EEC membership.

        Charles de Gaulle Vetoes British Admission to the EEC

         In January 1963, French president Charles de Gaulle made the following statement at a press conference
         explaining his opposition to Britain's application to join the EEC or Common Market:

               England in effect is insular, she is maritime, she is linked through her exchanges, her markets, her
               supply lines to the most diverse and often the most distant countries; she pursues essentially industrial
               and commercial activities, and only slight agricultural ones. She has in all her doings very marked and
               very original habits and traditions. [. . .]

               One might sometimes have believed that our English friends, in posing their candidature to the Common
               Market, were agreeing to transform themselves to the point of applying all the conditions which are
               accepted and practised by the Six [the six founding members: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the
               Netherlands, and West Germany]. But the question, to know whether Great Britain can now place
               herself like the Continent and with it inside a tariff which is genuinely common, to renounce all
               Commonwealth preferences, to cease any pretence that her agriculture be privileged, and, more than
               that, to treat her engagements with other countries of the free trade area as null and void--that question
               is the whole question. [. . .]

               Further, this community, increasing in such fashion, would see itself faced with problems of economic
               relations with all kinds of other States, and first with the United States. It is to be foreseen that the
               cohesion of its members, who would be very numerous and diverse, would not endure for long, and that
               ultimately it would appear as a colossal Atlantic community under American dependence and direction,
               and which would quickly have absorbed the community of Europe.

               It is a hypothesis which in the eyes of some can be perfectly justified, but it is not at all what France is
               doing or wanted to do--and which is a properly European construction.

               Yet it is possible that one day England might manage to transform herself sufficiently to become part of
               the European community, without restriction, without reserve and preference for anything whatsoever;
               and in this case the Six would open the door to her and France would raise no obstacle, although
               obviously England's simple participation in the community would considerably change its nature and its
               volume.

       By 1993, the EEC had been integrated into the newly created European Union (EU), which had grown to fifteen
       member states by 1995 and in 2022 included twenty-seven member states (Figure 15.3). The EU was
       conceived as a single market for the free movement of goods, services, money, and people. Citizens of member
       countries can freely move to other EU countries and legally work there, just as they can in their own country. In
       1999, the EU introduced its own currency, the euro. Initially used only for commercial and financial
       transactions in eleven of the EU countries, euro notes and coins had become the legal currency in the majority
       of EU countries by the start of 2002. The euro was not universally adopted by member states, though. The
       United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, and a few others kept their own currencies. The adoption of the euro was
       swiftly followed by a major expansion of the EU to include several Central and Eastern European countries

including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.

In 2016, however, 52 percent of the citizens of the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, and Britain officially
cut its ties with the organization, its largest trading partner, on January 31, 2020. Some EU opponents in the
United Kingdom had claimed the group was economically dysfunctional, especially after the recession of 2008,
and that it reduced British sovereignty. Many also disliked the fact that its membership in the EU made it
easier for people from elsewhere in Europe, including recent immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, to
enter Britain. Those who wanted to stay argued that leaving would hurt British trade with Europe and make
Britain poorer. Some also argued that losing the trade advantages that came with belonging to the EU could
result in shortages in stores and more expensive products.

The breakup, colloquially known as "Brexit," was hardly amicable. In Britain, many who supported staying in
the EU were shocked by the decision and demanded a re-vote, though none was taken. In Europe, the
European Parliament, the EU's legislative body, was angry that Brexit might threaten the entire EU project. To
show its displeasure and possibly to deter any other member states from leaving, the European Parliament
wanted the separation to be as painful for the United Kingdom as possible, and many member countries
supported this hardline stance. In today's post-Brexit world, there are new regulations on British goods
entering the EU and no automatic recognition of British professional licenses in the EU. Britons seeking to
make long-term stays in EU countries now must apply for visas.

Among the forces driving European economic integration was a desire for Europe to be more independent of
the United States. This wish was understandable given the massive economic and political power the United
States began wielding after World War II. Not only did the United States possess a huge military force with a
626 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       global reach and growing installations in Europe and beyond, but its economic strength was the envy of the
       world. Having experienced the Great Depression in the years before the war, the United States emerged after it
       as an economic powerhouse with a highly developed industrial sector. More importantly, with the exception of
       the attack on Pearl Harbor, it had avoided the wartime destruction experienced in Europe and Asia. As a result,
       not only was it able to provide funds to war-torn nations to rebuild their economies and their infrastructure as
       part of the Marshall Plan, but U.S.-manufactured goods also flooded into markets around the world. By 1960,
       U.S. GDP had grown to $543 billion a year (in current dollars). By comparison, the United Kingdom had the
       second-largest economy with a GDP of $73 billion (in current dollars).
       The economic might of the United States brought unprecedented growth and a rise in the population's
       standard of living in the decades after the war. With ready access to well-paying industrial jobs, the middle
       class boomed in the 1950s and 1960s. Their buying having been restrained during the war years because of
       the rationing of goods, consumers were eager to use their wartime savings to purchase new automobiles,
       televisions, household appliances, and suburban homes. Many enjoyed steady employment with new union-
       won benefits like weekends off and paid vacations. They also began sending their children to college in ever-
       greater numbers. By 1960, about 3.6 million young students were enrolled in higher education, an increase of
       140 percent over the previous two decades. For many, access to higher education was the gateway to the
       middle or upper class.
       By the 1970s, the U.S. economy began to cool, partially because of domestic inflation and increased
       competition from abroad. Oil embargoes by Arab nations belonging to the Organization of the Petroleum
       Exporting Countries, in retaliation for U.S. support of Israel during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and a general
       strategy by oil-producing nations to raise their prices, further stressed the economy by creating gas shortages
       for consumers. Other countries that had supported Israel, such as the Netherlands, also suffered from the
       embargo. Once dominant in most major industrial sectors, including the production of steel and automobiles,
       around the world, by the end of the 1970s, U.S. manufacturers were suffering as a result of competition from
       Japan and Western Europe. This reality led to a number of difficult economic transformations in the United
       States. But it also encouraged some national leaders to seek regional international economic integration along
       lines similar to Western Europe's achievement. Beginning in the 1980s, the United States and Canada entered
       into negotiations to create their own regional free-trading zone. This made sense because Canada not only
       shared a long border with the United States but was also its largest trading partner. In 1988, the two countries
       agreed to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (Canada-US FTA), which eliminated barriers to the
       movement of goods and services between the two.
       Almost immediately, Mexico signaled its interest in creating a similar free trade agreement with the United
       States. U.S. president Ronald Reagan had floated the concept during his 1980 election campaign. But
       successful completion of the Canada-US FTA convinced Mexican leaders that the time was ripe to act on the
       idea. Ultimately, Canada joined the plan with Mexico as well, and by the end of 1992, all three countries had
       signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (Figure 15.4). The intent of NAFTA was to reduce
       trade barriers and allow goods to flow freely among the three countries. Despite considerable resistance within
       the United States, largely from industrial workers who feared their factories and jobs would be relocated to
       Mexico where wages were far lower, the agreement was ratified by all three countries and went into effect in
       1994.

The creation of Canada-US FTA and later NAFTA represented an important policy shift for the United States.
Until the early 1980s, the country had largely avoided limited regional trading deals, preferring instead to seek
comprehensive global agreements. Such efforts had begun relatively soon after World War II in the form of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed in 1947 by twenty-three countries. Initially
conceived as a way to reinforce other postwar economic recovery efforts, GATT was designed to prevent the
reemergence of prewar-style trade barriers, to lower trade barriers overall, and to create a system for
arbitrating international trade disputes. Since its initial acceptance in 1947, GATT has undergone a number of
revisions, completed in sessions referred to as rounds, to promote free trade and international investments.
In 1995, at the Uruguay Round, GATT transformed itself into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and cleared
the path for free trade among 123 countries. Like GATT, the intent of the WTO was to support international
trade, reduce trade barriers, and resolve trade disputes between countries. Unlike GATT, however, the WTO is
not a free trade agreement. Rather, it is an organization that ensures nondiscriminatory trade between WTO
countries. This means that trade barriers are allowed, but they must apply equally to all members. Many
observers saw the creation of the WTO as a triumph of globalization, or the emergence of a single integrated
global economy. China joined in 2001, a clear sign of its integration into global market systems.
Because the WTO is regarded as a major force for globalization, its meetings often attract protestors who
oppose corporate power and the economic, political, and cultural influence of wealthy nations in the developed
world on less-developed nations. In 1999, in Seattle, Washington, a diverse group of students, labor union
representatives, environmentalists, and activists of many kinds protested the abuses associated with
globalization. Police confronted activists staging marches and sit-ins with rubber bullets and tear gas, and
trade talks ground to a halt. Meetings of the WTO continue to attract protestors.
As the creation of the EU and NAFTA demonstrate, the signing of international trade agreements like GATT,
which was ratified by countries on six continents, did not prevent regions from establishing their own free
trade blocs like MERCOSUR, the South American trading bloc created in 1991. Nor have such blocs been
confined to the West. The most notable to emerge in Asia are the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) (Figure 15.5).
628 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       ASEAN had its beginnings in the 1960s when Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand
       agreed to cooperate economically to foster regional development and resist the expansion of communism in
       Asia. Largely successful, the organization expanded in the 1980s and 1990s to include more countries. By the
       early 2000s, it was openly advocating the creation of EU-style integration in the area.
       APEC, launched in 1989, was in many ways a response to the growth of regional trading blocs like ASEAN and
       the EEC. Initially composed of twelve Asia-Pacific countries including Australia, the United States, South
       Korea, and Singapore, it has since grown to include Mexico, China, Chile, Russia, and more. It promotes free
       trade and international economic cooperation among its members.

      Multinationals and the Push to Privatize

       The growing global economic integration represented by the rise of the WTO and regional trading blocs
       opened new opportunities for multinational corporations to extend their reach and influence around the
       world. A multinational corporation, or MNC, is a corporate business entity that controls the production of
       goods and services in multiple countries. MNCs are not new. Some, like the British East India Company and the
       Hudson's Bay Company, exerted great influence during Europe's imperial expansion in the early modern and
       modern periods. But with globalization and improvements in transportation and communication technology,
       MNCs have thrived, especially since the 1950s. They have used their growing wealth to lobby governments to
       create conditions favorable to their operation, enabling them to become even more powerful.
       Multinationals have also benefited greatly from the lowering of trading barriers around the world. These
       developments have encouraged major automobile manufacturers like Volkswagen, Toyota, Chevrolet, Kia, and
       Nissan to build and operate assembly plants in Mexico, for example, where workers are paid lower wages than
       they are in countries like Germany, Japan, South Korea, or the United States. This translates to significant cost
       savings and thus higher profits for them. And because Mexico is part of a free trade bloc with the United States

                                                                                                                                                          15.1 · A Global Economy 629

and Canada, cars made there can be exported for sale in the United States or Canada without the need to pay
tariffs.
Supporters of MNCs claim that the benefits for workers in this arrangement are also substantial. They get
access to well-paying and reliable industrial jobs not available before, and their paychecks flow into the local
community and contribute to a general rise in the standard of living. The companies themselves invest in local
infrastructure like roads, powerlines, and factories, and their presence often helps expand support industries
like restaurants that cater to workers and shipping companies that employ them to move their goods.
Technology spillovers also occur when MNCs either help to develop necessary job skills in local workers or
introduce new technologies that ultimately become available to domestic industries in the host country.
Finally, MNCs that focus on retail and establish branches in other countries, such as Walmart, Aldi, Costco,
Carrefour, Ikea, and many more, provide access to high-quality consumer goods like clothing, appliances, and
electronics at competitive prices, raising the standard of living in the countries where they operate (Figure
15.6).

branches in twenty different countries. This Aldi store is in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. (credit: "Aldi in Bethlehem, PA

There are drawbacks, however. Critics of MNCs note that while workers may be paid more than they could earn
working for local businesses, they are still paid far less than the multinational can afford. Workers are often
prevented from forming unions and forced to work long hours in unsafe environments. Furthermore, many
multinationals are based in developed countries, mostly in the West, and they tend to express the interests and
cultural norms of those countries. This bias has sometimes led to accusations of neocolonialism (the use of
economic, political, or cultural power by developed countries to influence or control less-developed countries),
particularly for the way MNCs have helped accelerate the homogenization of cultures around the world by
exporting not only goods from the West but also ideas and behaviors.

One such idea is that countries should encourage the privatization of public services like utilities,
transportation systems, and postal services. Privatization means delegating these services to mostly private
companies that operate to earn a profit rather than such services being delivered by arms of the government.
Organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have pushed for privatization as
a way to make these public services more efficient. The World Bank is an international organization that offers
630 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       financing and support to developing countries seeking to improve their economies. Founded in 1944 to rebuild
       countries after World War II, it later shifted its focus to global development. The IMF, also created in 1944,
       promotes global monetary stability by helping countries improve their economies with fiscal plans and
       sometimes loans. In exchange, it requires countries to adopt plans that often include privatizing public
       services and paying off their debts.

       In some places, this privatization process has been successful. For decades after independence, for instance,
       India employed a mixed-economy strategy, with a combination of free-market policies and heavy intervention
       by the government. The result, however, was that a large part of the public sector operated under cumbersome
       bureaucratic controls that critics complained slowed economic growth. Beginning in the 1990s, new
       leadership in India began pursuing economic liberalization by privatizing aspects of its large public sector
       including airlines, shipbuilding, telecommunications, electric power, and heavy industry. As expected, these
       efforts increased productivity and efficiency, but the public often was confronted by higher prices and loss of
       access to services.

       The World Bank made similar efforts across Latin America. Some view privatization there as largely
       successful, noting that as the number of state-owned industries declined, the profitability and efficiency of the
       privatized companies increased. But sometimes, as in Bolivia, privatization came at considerable cost. In
       1999, the Bechtel Corporation, a U.S.-based multinational, was awarded a contract by the Bolivian city of
       Cochabamba to improve the efficiency of the city's water delivery system. By January 2000, however, water
       delivery in Cochabamba had actually become worse. Service rates increased even for people who did not
       receive any water at all. This result led to large and sometimes violent protests later known as the Cochabamba
       Water War. The Bolivian government sided with the protestors, expelled Bechtel, and passed the Bolivian
       Water Law in April 2000. Water in Bolivia was no longer privatized. In the aftermath of the protests, which drew
       international media attention, the World Bank promised to study and revise its procedures and
       recommendations.

       Multinationals have been crucial in the emergence of modern China as an economic powerhouse. Starting in
       the 1970s under Deng Xiaoping, the country began to pursue a market-based growth strategy, adopting some
       of the tools of capitalist economies without ending its Communist system. These economic changes,
       sometimes called the "Opening of China," vastly changed the country's role in the world's economy and
       improved a new generation's prospects for a higher standard of living. Factories constructed for MNCs in
       coastal cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen were filled with workers from the Chinese countryside.
       Large ships stacked high with Chinese factory-made products crossed the Pacific and Indian Oceans and
       passed through the Suez and Panama Canals. With the world's largest population, China holds its largest group
       of consumers. In 2001 it joined the WTO, and in 2010 it became the world's second-largest economy, after the
       United States. As of 2022, China's economy was predicted to become the world's largest in 2030.

      Exporting Culture

       Besides promoting controversial ideas like privatization, MNCs, many of which are headquartered in the
       United States, also are responsible for exporting elements of western culture, especially popular culture.
       Although many people around the world enjoy such things as western fashions, movies and television shows,
       popular music, and fast food, other people fear that such influences harm local cultures and contribute to the
       Americanization (and homogenization) of the world.

       Few countries have been as culturally influential as the United States, thanks to its global dominance after
       World War II. U.S. troops at military bases around the world were often the first to expose their hosts in Europe
       and Asia to American traditions, sports, and norms. Consumers around the world purchased a wide range of
       "Made in USA" products, including Coca-Cola, Levi's jeans, and Hollywood movies, which, along with American
       music, helped to spread the American dialect of the English language.

       Some early Americanization efforts were intentional, such as in Germany and Japan where the goal was to lay

a foundation for U.S.-style democracy by projecting ideas like freedom and affluence via popular culture.
These ideas were also attractive in South Korea and South Vietnam. Typically, young people patronized fast-
food restaurants like McDonald's and Pizza Hut, purchased blue jeans and T-shirts, watched American
television shows, and sought out recordings of the latest popular music.
The popularity of American culture led many countries to fear the loss of their own unique cultural
characteristics and the weakening of their domestic industries. Brazil, Greece, Spain, South Korea, and others
imposed screen quotas, limiting the hours theaters could show foreign movies. In 1993, France forced the
nation's radio stations to allocate 40 percent of their airtime to exclusively French music.
Hollywood movies and American recording artists are still major players, but in the twenty-first century,
diversity has returned to the global stage. Japanese anime and manga have become global phenomena. South
Korean K-pop bands like BTS, iKon, and Got7 have gained audiences in the United States, Europe, and across
Asia (Figure 15.7). In 2021, the Korean-made serial thriller Squid Game became the most-watched Netflix
show of all time. Korean television dramas are also very popular in Southeast Asian countries like the
Philippines. Korean popular culture borrows American cultural styles but invigorates them with distinctly
Korean elements. For example, K-pop, with its large groups and flashy choreographed dancing, was clearly
influenced by hip-hop. K-pop itself is thus a potent reminder that globalization is often the product of cultural
sharing rather than a one-directional flow of cultural norms.

Winners and Losers in a Globalizing World

While it is tempting to see globalization and the rise of MNCs as generally benefiting the people of developed
countries, the reality is more complex. Improvements in transportation and MNCs' use of labor resources in
countries around the world have sometimes harmed workers in developed countries like the United States.
Supporters of NAFTA, for example, argued that the United States would benefit from reduced trade barriers,
lower prices for agricultural goods from Mexico, and newly available jobs for lower-wage workers. Opponents,
however, recognized that the groups hardest hit by transformations in the labor market would be those least
able to withstand the damage, mainly working-class manufacturing workers in the United States and Canada.
Both sets of predictions proved accurate.
After NAFTA was implemented in 1994, trade and development across the three participating countries
surged. Trade across the U.S.-Mexico border surpassed $480 billion by 2015, an inflation-adjusted increase of
465 percent over the pre-NAFTA total. A similar, if smaller, increase occurred in U.S.-Canadian trade during
632 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       the same time. In Mexico, per capita GDP grew by more than 24 percent, topping $9,500. Even more
       impressive growth occurred in Canada and the United States.
       But between 1993 and 2021, the United States lost nearly eighteen million manufacturing jobs when some
       companies found it more profitable to relocate to Mexico. Not all these job losses can be attributed to NAFTA,
       but many can, as manufacturing that otherwise would have taken place in the United States was moved to
       maquiladoras, factories in Mexico along the U.S. border that employ people for low wages. Maquiladoras often
       receive materials from U.S. manufacturers, transform them into finished products, and then ship them back to
       the United States for the manufacturers to use. After the passage of NAFTA, U.S. car manufacturers began to
       make use of parts produced inexpensively in Mexico that would have been much more expensive had they
       been produced in the United States. For example, in 2015, Brake Parts Inc. moved its operations from
       California to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and almost three hundred U.S. workers lost their jobs in the process.
       Workers in the automobile industry, once the backbone of the U.S. industrial sector, suffered as jobs and
       automotive plants were relocated to Mexico. Some economists, however, argue that the use of inexpensive
       parts produced in maquiladoras allowed the U.S. automobile industry to survive. Jobs in the clothing industry
       also declined 85 percent. There were simply fewer obvious advantages to keeping such jobs in the United
       States.
       Economists say the loss of manufacturing jobs was less a result of NAFTA than of other structural economic
       changes in the United States, such as automation. And while many U.S. workers lost their jobs as a result of
       NAFTA, millions of others found work in industries that produced goods for sale in Mexico. Nevertheless, the
       impression that NAFTA and globalization have brought poverty and misery to the working class in the United
       States remains strong and has influenced the nation's politics since the 1990s. Responding to these beliefs, in
       2017, President Donald Trump instigated a renegotiation of NAFTA, creating the United States-Mexico-Canada
       Agreement (USMCA). The USMCA included strong property rights protections, compelled Canada to open its
       dairy market more broadly, and required that workers in the automotive sector in all three countries be paid
       competitive wages. The agreement replaced NAFTA and went into effect in 2020.
       The complaints that arose during the NAFTA debates had been voiced for decades. Since the 1970s, many in
       the United States had argued that globalization allowed Japan, its enemy during World War II, to race ahead
       and outcompete domestic manufacturers. By the 1980s, Japan was exporting a huge volume of consumer
       electronics and automobiles into the U.S. market. Its economic resurgence created a massive trade deficit (the
       difference in value between what a country imports and what it exports) in the United States and rising
       concerns about its global competitiveness.
       Political figures like Walter Mondale, the 1984 Democratic Party nominee for president, called the trade deficit
       a threat to the United States and spoke in dire terms about an emerging global trade war. Many others drew
       connections between Japan's economic rise and growing unemployment in the United States. Auto workers
       were especially vocal, declaring that Japan was using unfair practices and artificially limiting the number of
       American cars that could be sold in Japan (Figure 15.8). While the reality was more complicated, politicians
       were primed to respond with tough talk and reforms. In 1981, President Reagan pressured Japan to limit the
       number of cars it exported to the United States. The United States also made efforts to limit the importation of
       foreign steel and semiconductors for the same reasons.

By the start of the 1990s, Japan's economic engine was starting to cool, and so were American concerns about
Japanese dominance. However, companies in the developed world faced challenges rooted in the high cost of
living and resulting high wages they had to pay to their employees. Globalization offered a solution in the form
of outsourcing and offshoring. Outsourcing occurs when a company hires an outside firm, sometimes abroad,
to perform tasks it used to perform internally, like accounting, payroll, human resources, and data processing
services. Offshoring occurs when a company continues to conduct its own operations but physically moves
them overseas to access cheaper labor markets. Outsourcing and offshoring were hardly new in the 1990s. But
with globalization, trade agreements like NAFTA, and the ability to ship goods around the world, they became a
major cost-savings option for large companies. Trade agreements like NAFTA made it possible to build plants
in Mexico and still sell the products they produced in the United States. Companies could also offshore some of
their operations to countries in Asia where labor was much cheaper.
Those hired overseas experienced their own problems, however, because outsourcing often led to the rise of
sweatshops, factories where poorly paid workers labor in dangerous environments. Images of women and
children in horrific working conditions in Central America, India, and Southeast Asia circulated around the
developed world in the 1990s as examples of the consequences of outsourcing. Major MNCs like Nike, Gap,
Forever 21, Walmart, Victoria's Secret, and others have been harshly criticized for using sweatshops to
produce their shoes and clothing lines. In 2013, the plight of sweatshop workers gained widespread attention
when a building called Rana Plaza, a large complex of garment factories in Bangladesh, collapsed, killing 1,134
and injuring another 2,500 of the low-wage workers who made clothing for luxury brands like Gucci, Versace,
and Moncler. The disaster led to a massive protest in Bangladesh demanding better wages and reforms. In the
aftermath, studies and inspections of similar factories revealed that almost none had adequate safety
infrastructure in place.

                                                                           THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT

 Sweatshops and Factory Safety: Then and Now

  On March 25, 1911, a fire started at the Triangle shirtwaist factory in New York City that caused the deaths of
  146 workers, most of them immigrant women and girls of Italian or Jewish heritage. It was soon discovered that
  the factory had poor safety features, and the doors were locked during the workday, making it impossible for the
  workers to flee.
  News of the tragedy spread quickly in New York and around the country. Government corruption, which was
634 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

         widely reported, had allowed the factory to continue operating despite its poor conditions and safety
         deficiencies. In the end, the tragedy led to massive protests in New York. The city even set up a Factory
         Investigating Commission to prevent such events from happening again.

         Just over a century later in Bangladesh, a similar tragedy occurred. On April 24, 2013, the Rana Plaza building
         collapsed, killing 1,134 workers and injuring thousands of others. The owners of the garment factories housed in
         the building knew it had structural problems but still demanded that employees continue to work or lose their
         jobs.

         A massive public outcry in Bangladesh followed the building's collapse. People were outraged by the disaster and
         by the fact that the workers made some of the lowest wages in the world sewing garments for major
         multinational companies. The public demanded that the families be compensated and those responsible be
         prosecuted, leading many of the garment companies to donate money to the families of those lost. The disaster
         also inspired a public movement to make the garment industry in Bangladesh more transparent.

       The multinational technology company Apple Inc. has faced intense criticism in recent years for its use of
       foreign-owned sweatshops in Asia. Since the early 2000s, reports of sprawling factories with hundreds of
       thousands of workers assembling iPhones have made the news and led to a public-relations nightmare for the
       company. Investigative journalists have revealed that workers suffer a pattern of harsh and humiliating
       punishments, fines, physical assaults, and withheld wages. In some instances, conditions in the factories have
       pushed assembly-line workers to commit suicide rather than continue. Apple has insisted it takes all such
       accusations seriously and has tried to end relationships with such assembly plants, but those familiar with the
       problems have complained that little progress has been made.

       Even when MNCs commit to providing a safe working environment and fair wages abroad, the practice of
       subcontracting often makes this impossible to guarantee. Foreign companies to whom multinationals send
       work often distribute it among a number of smaller companies that may also subcontract it, in turn. It is
       sometimes difficult for MNCs to know exactly where their goods are actually produced and thus to enforce
       rules about wages and working conditions.

       Multinationals have harmed the countries in which they operate in other ways as well, including deforestation
       and the depletion of clean, drinkable water. They are also major producers of greenhouse gases and
       responsible for air pollution and the dumping of toxic waste. MNCs leave little in the way of profit in the
       countries they exploit, so funds are often lacking to repair or mitigate the damage they do.

       The desire for a better life and opportunities in the developed world has led many in the developing world to
       migrate. Millions of immigrants from Mexico and other parts of Latin America have made their way into the
       United States over the last few decades. They typically find low-paid labor harvesting crops, cleaning homes,
       and serving as caretakers for children. In these jobs, they serve an important role in the U.S. economy, often
       doing work domestic workers are unwilling to do. Many entered the country illegally and live and work in the

shadows to avoid deportation. This makes them vulnerable to abuse, and they are sometimes preyed on by
human traffickers and unscrupulous employers. The United States is not the only country where this dynamic
occurs. Saudi Arabia, for example, depends heavily on foreign workers to fill jobs Saudi Arabian citizens are
reluctant to take, such as caretaker or domestic servant. Some workers have reported physical and emotional
abuse to international human rights watchdog organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
International. Being immigrants, they often have little access to relief from the country's justice system.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain the reasons for the rise of environmentalism around the world
  · Identify ways in which environmental groups have faced resistance
  · Describe the ways in which the global community has attempted to address environmental issues
      like climate change

While concern for the Earth and anxiety about the negative effects humans have wrought is hardly new, the
modern environmental movement, with its characteristic public activism, has roots in nineteenth-century
reactions to industrialization. Writers of that time, like George Perkins Marsh, John Ruskin, Octavia Hill, and
many others, expressed a romantic view of nature that contrasted sharply with the industrial transformations
they witnessed around them. Their ideas gave birth to preservation efforts and the creation of national parks,
first in the United States and later in Australia, South Africa, India, and nations in Europe. Environmental
concern has only grown stronger as societies around the world must now grapple with the enormous and
ongoing consequences of increasing industrialization, manifested particularly in the global threat of climate
change.

The Rise of Environmentalism

In the post-World War II period, as the United States and Europe experienced unprecedented economic
growth and a rapidly rising standard of living, anxiety regarding the condition of the environment rose to the
surface and gained political significance. In the developed West, members of the generation reaching maturity
in the 1960s occasionally struggled with their affluence and the recognition that it came with disastrous
environmental consequences. These consequences were not limited to the developed world. In the 1950s and
1960s, as part of the Green Revolution, agricultural scientists developed new high-yielding varieties of rice and
wheat and synthetic fertilizers and pesticides that increased food production in both the developed and the
developing world. The result was that millions were saved from hunger, and infant mortality in developing
nations decreased. Scientist Norman Borlaug, who was considered largely responsible for the Green
Revolution, received a Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work. Such benefits, however, came with a heavy price
tag, in many ways. Small farmers had to borrow money to purchase the new high-yielding seeds, fertilizers,
and pesticides, and many found themselves deeply in debt. Reliance on the new varieties of crops reduced
biodiversity, and chemical fertilizers and pesticides polluted the soil and water.

In 1962, Rachel Carson published her bestselling book Silent Spring, which railed against the proliferation of
dangerous pesticides like DDT (Figure 15.9). Carson drew connections between the political power of the
chemical industry and the many adverse effects of chemicals that made their way into food supplies and
human bodies. Though strongly condemned by large chemical companies, the book was undeniably
influential. It was a finalist for the National Book Awards for nonfiction, and its ideas inspired a generation of
young activists. In 1972, the use of DDT in U.S. agriculture was banned.

       Letters and posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. (credit: "Rachel Carson, author of Silent
       Spring. Official photo as FWS employee. c. 1940" by USFWS National Digital Library/Wikimedia Commons, CC0 1.0)
       Carson's book tapped into the growing anxiety of many who felt the economic growth from which they
       benefited was environmentally unsustainable. These fears were confirmed by a series of ecological disasters
       that galvanized public attention. They included the 1958 Niger Delta oil spill in Nigeria, the 1962 start of the
       Centralia mine fire in Pennsylvania (which is still burning), the 1967 Torrey Canyon oil spill in the United
       Kingdom, the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio, and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. By the 1970s,
       environmental concerns had translated into political action. In April 1970, approximately twenty million
       people in the United States participated in the world's first Earth Day celebration, a grassroots movement
       intended to raise public awareness about the environment (Figure 15.10).

In 1972, scientist Donella Meadows and others from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a
report called The Limits to Growth, which used computer models to predict that humanity would soon reach
absolute limits on its use of resources, with disastrous consequences. The report had been commissioned by
the Club of Rome, a nonprofit group of scientists, economists, and other intellectuals founded in 1968 to
address global problems like pollution and environmental degradation. The Limits to Growth circulated widely
and reinforced public concerns about a widespread environmental crisis on Earth.
Over the next decade, green parties, political parties organized around environmental concerns, proliferated
in countries around Europe, proving popular with the young and highly educated. Some green party founders,
such as Petra Kelly of the German Green Party, had studied in the United States and were influenced by its
environmental movement. By the 1990s, there were green parties in almost every country in Europe and also
in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and New Zealand.
One of the factors motivating green parties in Europe was growing concern about nuclear technology.
Following the 1951 creation of the first nuclear reactor for producing energy, nuclear power plants became
common in the United States, Europe, and the Soviet Union. Once hailed as a cleaner alternative to polluting
coal-burning power, nuclear energy began to stall as environmentally conscious populations around the world
voiced concerns about its potential dangers. News of the partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island nuclear
reactor in Pennsylvania in 1979 gave new vigor to the already strong antinuclear movement.
Still considered the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, the Three Mile Island disaster released radioactive
gases through the plant and into the surrounding area. After news of it reached the public, more than 100,000
residents fled the area. Despite President Jimmy Carter's efforts to calm the public, the event shattered the
country's belief that such plants could be operated safely. Just a few years later, in 1986, an accident at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union, resulted in the single
largest uncontrolled radioactive release ever recorded. Although the Soviet Union reported that only thirty-one
people died as a direct result of the accident, more than 200,000 had to be resettled in the wake of the disaster,
638 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       and in 2005 the United Nations estimated that another four thousand could still die as a result of exposure to
       radiation released in Chernobyl. The area around Chernobyl was declared off limits, and the Soviet Union
       suffered irreparable harm to its reputation as a competent and technologically advanced superpower.

                                                                                                  IN THEIR OWN WORDS
        Voices from Chernobyl

         The 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) required the creation of an
         "exclusion zone" of towns, villages, forests, and farms that had to be abandoned due to radioactive
         contamination (Figure 15.11). However, the Soviet government minimized information about the crisis to reduce
         its embarrassment and maintain an image of technical dominance. Decades later, we can glimpse what people
         were thinking and doing at the time.

         background) led to the abandonment of the city of Pripyat (foreground). (credit: modification of work "View of

               At that time my notions of nuclear power stations were utterly idyllic. At school and at the university
               we'd been taught that this was a magical factory that made `energy out of nothing,' where people in
               white robes sat and pushed buttons. Chernobyl blew up when we weren't prepared. And also there
               wasn't any information. We got stacks of paper marked `Top Secret.' `Reports of the accident: secret;'
               `Results of medical observations: secret;' `Reports about the radioactive exposure of personnel involved
               in the liquidation of the accident: secret.' And so on. There were rumors: someone read in some paper,
               someone heard, someone said . . . . Some people listened to what was being said in the West, they were
               the only ones talking about what pills to take and how to take them. But most often the reaction was:
               our enemies are celebrating, but we still have it better.

               Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I'd seen documentary footage. It's frightening, but understandable: atomic
               warfare, the explosion's radius. I could even imagine it. But what happened to us didn't fit into my

               world, can crawl in and enter you. I remember a conversation with this scientist: `This is for thousands
               of years,' he explained. `The decomposition of uranium: that's 238 half-lives. Translated into time: that's

It was also in the 1980s that scientists first detected the existence of an "ozone hole" over Antarctica. The
ozone layer is a portion of the Earth's upper atmosphere with especially high concentrations of ozone
molecules (Figure 15.12). It serves to block much of the potentially harmful solar radiation the Earth naturally
receives from the sun and thus is essential for life on this planet as we know it. The news that this layer had a
hole--an area severely depleted by the use of manufactured chemicals in common consumer items like
aerosols, refrigerants, and food packaging--startled the public. Some environmentalists predicted an
apocalyptic near-future in which billions would die of skin cancer caused by the sun, and the Earth's surface
would become unlivable.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, people also became concerned about the plight of the environmentally
invaluable Amazon rainforest. The movement known as Save the Rainforest brought professional
environmentalists and concerned citizens together to raise awareness about deforestation. Brazil's extensive
rainforests had been under threat since the 1960s, when cattle ranchers and others began clearing thousands
of acres of pristine forest. Until the 1980s, few people had paid much attention. But concerns rose in wealthy
countries about the harm done by major beef producers and other multinational corporations to the people
and resources in developing countries, including by eliminating the "lungs of the planet" (trees that produce
oxygen and absorb the carbon dioxide created by industrial processes), and more people began to take notice.
Environmentalists stressed the rainforest's unique biodiversity and warned of the consequences of destroying
the sole source of potentially world-changing drugs and species of animals found nowhere else on earth.
640 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       Anthropologists and Indigenous activists spoke of the effect on Indigenous peoples who lived and hunted in
       the rainforest and were threatened with loss of both home and livelihood. These warnings merged with
       developed countries' anxieties about overconsumption and living beyond their means. The result was the Save
       the Rainforest campaign. By 1991, the effort had borne fruit, and deforestation in the Amazon had declined to
       one of the lowest recorded rates. Between 2005 and 2010, Brazil managed to reduce the destruction, but
       millions of hectares are still being cleared each year.

       It was also during the late 1980s that much of the world was first introduced to the concept of global warming,
       the general rise in Earth's temperature that scientists have observed over approximately the last two hundred
       years. The consensus is that this warming is the result of a steady increase in fossil-fuel burning since the start
       of the Industrial Revolution. The process has contributed to a rise in greenhouse gas levels, which trap yet
       more heat within the Earth's atmosphere. Global warming is just one aspect of climate change, a broader
       phenomenon that includes changes in temperature, weather, storm activity, wind patterns, sea levels, and
       other influences on the planet.

       Both global warming and climate change present enormous challenges for the future. Rising sea levels may
       make some large coastal cities around the world unlivable. Stronger storms, floods, and more intense heat can
       make life unbearable in entire regions. Extreme weather events like hurricanes, heat waves, and forest fires
       caused by drought and high temperatures may kill and injure thousands and cause billions of dollars in
       property losses. Hotter, wetter conditions may encourage the breeding of insects that spread infectious
       diseases like malaria and West Nile virus. These changes in turn will likely lead to worldwide problems. The
       World Bank estimates that more than 200 million people could become climate refugees, people forced to flee
       their homes to find livable climates in other areas, over the next few decades.

      Environmentalism Today

       Many of the most outspoken proponents of environmentalism and policies to curb fossil-fuel use have come
       from the United States and developed countries in Europe. Some of their anxieties about the state of the
       environment are a product of their own affluence and the sense that it is unsustainable. Yet frequently their
       environmental concerns have clashed with the interests of developing countries, which are largely geared
       toward growth. Concerns about the Amazon rainforest is one example of this dynamic.

       The depletion of the rainforest was largely the result of the expansion of cattle ranching and later of farming in
       the Amazon River basin. When rainforest trees are removed for these purposes, the greenhouse gas carbon
       dioxide (CO2) is released, contributing to global warming. Ranching also contributes to a rise in methane,
       another greenhouse gas, produced by the cattle themselves. While environmentalists in the United States and
       Europe viewed with horror the increase of greenhouse gases and the loss of animal habitats, plants, and trees,
       the clearing of land brought economic opportunities for many Brazilians. It created jobs for poor workers,
       produced lumber for construction, and opened space for ranchers to graze cattle and farmers to grow crops
       that could be consumed domestically or exported for profit.

       Debates about whether these outcomes are positive or negative reflect the fact that developed countries have
       mostly freed themselves from concerns about survival. They are able now to focus on sustainability, while
       developing countries like Brazil must exploit their natural resources to get by and improve their economic
       position. Between 1990 and 2019, China's coal consumption increased nearly four times. Its energy needs
       have become enormous as China has industrialized and its citizens have experienced a rising standard of
       living. While the Chinese are not immune to criticisms about high coal consumption, which emits greenhouses

gases and contributes to global warming, their policies suggest their larger concern is maintaining their
country's continued growth and development.
Groups like Greenpeace, an environmental organization founded in 1971, sometimes express dismay about
such perspectives. For example, in the 1970s, Greenpeace and other environmental groups pushed for a ban
on seal hunting around the world, calling it unsustainable and cruel to the animals. However, many in Canada
and other arctic regions depend on sealing for their livelihoods. They felt Greenpeace and other
environmentalists undermined their industry and hampered their efforts to provide for their families. They
resented being portrayed as unfeeling killers by organizations that appeared to know little about their lives.
A similar conflict erupted in the forests of the Pacific Northwest in the 1980s as environmentalists ramped up
protests against logging in order to preserve the spotted owl, a threatened species indigenous to states like
Washington and Oregon (Figure 15.13). (Threatened species are those the government identifies as likely to
soon be endangered.) The tens of thousands of loggers who depended on the industry to survive complained
that while the environmental concerns were real, their livelihoods should take priority over the survival of an
individual species. The conflict became known as the Timber Wars and gained enormous media attention in
the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the U.S. government sought a compromise in the Northwest Forest
Plan of 1994, which restricted forest exploitation and satisfied neither group.

The Global Response to Climate Change

Countries from around the world have regularly tried to address environmental problems together. The
Montreal Protocol of 1987 was a global agreement to ban and phase out specific chemicals in industrial and
consumer products in the expectation that natural processes would restore the Earth's ozone layer. The accord
went into effect almost immediately, and the ozone layer has been steadily recovering ever since. Scientists
anticipate that it will be fully healed by 2070, if not earlier.
At the United Nations in 1989, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom gave an urgent
warning about the environment and especially climate change. She called for the world to embrace nuclear
642 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       power as a substitute for coal-burning power plants, but she acknowledged that the increasingly influential
       green party movement remained firmly committed to preventing the proliferation of nuclear technology.
       Thatcher's speech marked a global acknowledgment that warming and climate change were pressing
       problems requiring international solutions. Given the success of the Montreal Protocol, she suggested a similar
       solution to climate change, but it met with resistance from the United States. President Reagan and Thatcher
       had both risen to power by embracing neoliberal economic policies, which call for market-oriented
       approaches and a rollback of regulation. Reagan remained largely unmoved even as Dr. James Hansen, an
       atmospheric scientist working for the U.S. government, testified in Congress that global warming was a real
       and dangerous threat (Figure 15.14).

       FIGURE 15.14 James Hansen. On June 23, 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen testified to the U.S. Congress
       about the danger of global warming resulting from the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. (credit:
       "James Hansen Crop1" by NASA/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Despite U.S. resistance, the larger international community proceeded apace. In 1988, the United Nations was
       able to establish the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Created in 1992 in
       Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the UNFCCC convenes annually for negotiations among member countries. Notable
       meetings have occurred in Kyoto (1997), Copenhagen (2009), Paris (2015), and Edinburgh (2021). The UNFCCC
       Paris Agreement of 2015 took into account how much each member country is able to pay for a major
       transition away from fossil fuels. On a five-year cycle, the agreement asks each country to make a contribution
       proportionate to its own needs and its ability to pay for new energy infrastructure, though it has no
       enforcement mechanism. The goal of the Paris Agreement is total warming of less than 2°C (3.6°F) above
       levels from the time of industrialization, around the year 1750. While some have called the agreement
       successful in helping approach this goal, others feel many countries are not fulfilling the promises they made.

       World War II brought about a massive technological transformation as countries like Germany and the United

       major progress in medical technology, the creation of new vaccines, and the elimination of deadly diseases. All

these achievements had profound effects on the way people lived, traveled, and worked. Underlying them were
major advancements in the field of information technologies, such as computers. Once the war was over, the
development of increasingly powerful computers ushered in a computer revolution as powerful as the
nineteenth century's Industrial Revolution, and with it a digital age.

The Digital Computer Revolution

Many of the technological advancements of the 1940s and 1950s came in the form of increasingly powerful
analog computers, which analyze a continuous stream of information, much like that recorded on vinyl
records. Analog computers worked well for solving big mathematical problems, such as the calculations
related to electrical power delivery systems or the study of nuclear physics. However, one of their weaknesses
was that they were inefficient at managing large amounts of data. Digital computers, or those that translate
information into a complex series of ones and zeros, were far more capable of managing bulk data. Just a few
years after the war, digital computing received a huge boost with the invention of the transistor, a device with
far more computing potential than its predecessor the vacuum tube. Scientists could amplify this enlarged
computing capacity even further by wiring multiple transistors together in increasingly complex ways.

The use of multiple transistors for computing purposes was an important step, but it had obvious drawbacks.
Making machines capable of processing a great deal of information required connecting many transistors,
which took up a great deal of space. Then, in the late 1950s, inventors in the United States developed an
innovative solution. Using silicon, they could integrate transistors and capacitors in a way that clumsy wiring
could not accomplish. The silicon-based integrated circuit freed computer technology from size constraints
and opened the door to additional advancements in computing power.

Even so, digital computers remained large, expensive, and complicated to operate, and their use was largely
confined to universities and the military. Only gradually over the 1970s did computing technology become
more widely available, largely thanks to mass-produced general-purpose computers, sometimes called
minicomputers, designed by IBM and the Digital Equipment Company. These served a variety of government
and private purposes, such as calculating the Census, managing the flow of tax monies, and processing
calculations related to creditworthiness (Figure 15.15). But despite being somewhat cheaper, minicomputers
remained out of reach for average users.

       for rapid processing by its computers. (credit: modification of work "Woman inspecting FOSDIC film" by U. S. Census
       Bureau/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       The journey from minicomputers to personal computers began with the Intel Corporation, established in 1968
       in Mountain View, California, in a region now commonly called Silicon Valley. During the 1970s, Intel
       developed a line of integrated circuits that were not only more powerful than their predecessors but also
       programmable. These became known as microprocessors, and they revolutionized computing by holding all of
       a computer's processing power in a single integrated circuit. In 1975, a company in New Mexico released the
       first marketed personal computer, the Altair 8800. This used an Intel microprocessor and was promoted to
       computer hobbyists eager to wield a level of computing power once available to only a few. The Altair's
       popularity inspired competing products like the Apple, the Commodore, and the Tandy Radio Shack computer
       (Figure 15.16). These personal computer systems were far easier to use and appealed to a much larger market
       than just hobbyists.

nicknamed the CoCo 3, was one of many personal computers released in the 1980s that average consumers were
able to buy for their homes. (credit: "CoCo3system" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
By 1982, there were 5.5 million personal computers in the United States, and over the next decade, their
number and computing power rose exponentially. Computers proliferated in government offices, private firms,
and family homes. Then, in 1984, Apple introduced the world to the Macintosh computer, which not only used
a mouse but also replaced the standard code-based user interface with one based on graphics and icons.
Recognizing the user-friendly possibilities of this graphic interface, competitors followed suit. Before long, the
design popularized by Apple had become the norm.
By the end of the 1980s, not only had personal computers become common, but the microprocessor itself
could be found everywhere. Microprocessors were incorporated into automobiles, cash registers, televisions,
and household appliances and made possible a variety of other electronic devices like videocassette recorders
and video game systems (Figure 15.17). Computer systems were created to store and manage financial,
educational, and health-care information. In one form or another and whether they realized it or not, by the
1990s, almost everyone in the developed world was interacting with computers.

small plastic cartridges that were plugged directly into the machine. (credit: "Atari 2600 mit Joystick" by

Modems were hardly new in the 1990s, but they became much faster and more common with the rise of the
internet. The origins of the internet date back to the 1960s and the efforts by government researchers in the
646 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       United States to use computers to share information. These developments were especially important for the
       U.S. Department of Defense during the Cold War and resulted in the emergence of the Advanced Research
       Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). In creating ARPANET, researchers developed many of the technologies
       that over the next few decades formed the basis for the internet we know today.

      The Internet and Social Media

       The process of globalization has been accelerated by the rise of the internet and the various social media
       platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter that exist there. Many people were introduced to the potential
       of computer networks for sharing information and creating small social networks in the 1980s, when
       individual users became able to connect their computers to others by using modems and telephone networks.
       This connectivity gave rise to regional bulletin board systems (BBSs), in which one person's computer served
       as a host for those of other users (Figure 15.18). BBSs functioned much like websites today. Though they ran
       far more slowly and had limited capabilities, they allowed users to share computer files like games and images,
       post messages for others to read, participate in virtual discussions and debates, and play text-based online
       games. BBSs used phone networks to communicate, and long-distance calls were then expensive, so their
       users tended to be local.

       FIGURE 15.18 A Bulletin Board System, 1980s. Bulletin board systems like this one relied on colorful text and
       simple graphics to make them appealing. They appear very limited compared to today's websites, but in the 1980s,
       they were revolutionary and opened new possibilities for the future of communication. (credit: "Screenshot of
       OpenTG's Group Permissions Editor" by Chris Tusa/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       Throughout the 1980s, BBSs continued to be popular with computer hobbyists and those intrigued by the idea
       of unique virtual communities, while networking technology improved steadily behind the scenes. The United
       States, Europe, and other developed countries were busy adopting a uniform protocol system that would allow
       computers around the world to easily communicate with others. Once this protocol had been established, the
       commercial internet as we currently understand it was born.
       As early as 1987, about thirty thousand hosts resided on the burgeoning internet. Soon telecommunications
       and software companies began to exploit this new network by creating online service providers like America
       Online (AOL) to act as gateways to the internet. Initially, they used standard phone lines and modems to
       connect, much as BBSs had. But as the volume of information on the internet increased exponentially, service
       providers turned to more expensive broadband connections that used cable television lines and even
       dedicated lines to connect. During the 1990s, the first websites, the first internet search engines, and the first
       commercial internet platforms were established.

By 2005, more than one billion people worldwide were using the internet regularly. They were able to shop
online, make phone calls around the world, and even create their own websites with almost no technical
training. Never before had the world been so connected. In 2004, Facebook was launched. Originally a
networking tool for Harvard students, it quickly expanded globally to become a giant in the new world of social
media. By 2010, nearly half a billion Facebook users around the world were sharing images and messages,
creating communities, and linking to news stories. By 2022, the number of Facebook users had reached nearly
three billion.

Before 2007, almost all internet users gained access to the network via a personal computer, either at home or
at work. That year, however, Apple Inc. released the first iPhone, a powerful cell phone but also a portable
computer capable of performing all the tasks it once required a desktop computer to do. Even more
revolutionary, it connected to the internet wirelessly through cell-phone infrastructure. While the iPhone was
not the first phone to connect to the internet, its revolutionary touch-screen interface was far superior to
earlier systems. Within just a few years, other cell-phone manufacturers were imitating its design and putting
smartphones, and thus internet access, in the pockets of users around the world.

Smartphones have transformed life in developing countries, where they have helped bypass some of the
traditional stages of infrastructure creation. In Africa, for example, people living where no landlines existed
can now communicate with others using cell phones. Small farmers and traders can use cell phones for
banking and to connect with potential suppliers and customers. In communities without libraries,
schoolchildren can access the internet's resources to study.

Smartphones have also democratized the internet, serving as powerful tools for organizing and promoting
political change. The large pro-democracy movement in Cairo's Tahrir Square captured the world's attention in
2011, for example. But it began with twenty-five-year-old activist Asmaa Mahfouz's YouTube video of January
18, 2011, in which she spoke directly to the camera and urged young Egyptians to protest at the square as part
of the larger Arab Spring, a call for government reform and democracy that echoed across in the Arab world.

The Arab Spring was touched off in December 2010 when Muhammad Bouazizi, a young college graduate, set
himself on fire in Tunisia after government officials there tried to interfere with the fruit cart that was his only
source of income. Other young Tunisians took to the streets in protest, and demonstrations began again in
January 2011. As people died in confrontations with government forces, President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali fled
the country, and Tunisia's prime minister resigned shortly thereafter.

The Tunisian protests led to similar demonstrations in Egypt. On January 17, 2011, an Egyptian set himself on
fire near the nation's Parliament to protest the lack of economic opportunities. Crowds of mostly young people
responded with massive demonstrations that lasted weeks (Figure 15.19). These demonstrations were fueled
by and broadcast to the world through text messages, photos, tweets, videos, and Facebook posts sent by
thousands of mobile phones, including that of Mahfouz. The devices amplified the calls for democracy and
showed the world the Egyptian government's use of violence to try to silence the protestors. Egyptian president
Hosni Mubarak resigned on February 11, 2011. He was later convicted for his role in ordering government
forces to harm and kill protestors.

       In the wake of the Egyptian protests, activists in Libya, Yemen, Syria, Morocco, Lebanon, Jordan, and other
       countries coordinated their activities using computers and smartphones to access social media, video, and
       mobile phone messaging. These efforts resulted in protests, changes to the laws, and even the toppling of
       governments, such as in Egypt and Tunisia. They also led to civil war in Syria, Iraq, and Libya, leading to
       thousands of deaths and a refugee crisis in the Mediterranean. While Twitter and Facebook were useful for
       scaling up protests, the movements to which they gave birth often struggled to find a purpose in countries
       without a well-established resistance movement.

for organizing. She addresses the role of social media in two parts. Take a look at her answers to "Did the
government completely misjudge what they were doing?" and "Could this have happened without social
media, without these new technologies?"

Since 2011, governments around the world have come to recognize the power of social media to bring about
change, and many authoritarian and even ostensibly democratic leaders have moved to limit or block social
media use in their countries. China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since 2009 and encourages its citizens
to instead use the state-authorized app WeChat, which shares information with the government. In 2020, India
banned the social media app TikTok, claiming it threatened state security and public order. In March 2022,
following its February invasion of Ukraine, Russia banned Instagram and Facebook because, the government
alleged, the platforms carried messages calling for violence against Russian troops and against Russian
president Vladimir Putin. Turkmenistan has gone further than China, India, or Russia. It not only bans
Facebook and Twitter, but it also requires citizens applying for internet access to swear they will not try to
evade state censorship.

China is noted for its strict internet censorship, and its government blocks access to a large number of sites in
a policy colloquially known as the Great Firewall of China. The Comparitech service allows you to see websites

In the United States, lawmakers have recognized that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter can
both promote and endanger democracy. Social media provides extremist groups with the ability to attract
followers from across the nation and incite violence. Groups can use the platforms to spread fake news, and a
report by the U.S. Senate has concluded that Russian intelligence operatives used Facebook, Twitter, and
Instagram to manipulate voters. Legislators have called on social media to more actively censor the content on
their platforms and limit or block access by groups or persons spreading hate speech or disinformation. The
potential for misuse of technology is heightened by advances that enable the creation of deepfakes, computer-
generated images that closely resemble real people.

Medical Miracles and Ongoing Health Challenges

Advances in computer technology were not the only technological success stories of the post-World War II
world. In 1947, scientists perfected an artificial kidney, and just five years later, the first successful kidney
transplant was performed. In the 1950s, antipsychotic drugs were developed and used to treat neurological
disorders that once consigned patients to a lifetime of difficult treatment in a psychiatric hospital. In the
1950s, geneticists discovered the double-helix structure of DNA, information that was crucial for later
advancements such as the ability to use DNA to diagnose and treat genetic diseases. In 1962, a surgical team
successfully reattached a severed limb for the first time, and in 1967, the first human heart transplant took
place. Over the next decade and a half, medical advances made it possible to conduct telemedicine, view and
monitor internal organs without performing surgery, and monitor the heartbeat of a fetus during pregnancy.

Medical science also made enormous gains in eradicating diseases that had been common for centuries. For
example, polio had caused paralysis and even death since the late nineteenth century, but in 1950, the first
successful polio vaccine, developed by the Polish-born virologist Hilary Koprowski, was demonstrated as
effective in children. This was an orally ingested live vaccine, a weakened form of the virus designed to help
the immune system develop antibodies. In the meantime, researcher Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh
was developing an injectable dead-virus vaccine (Figure 15.20). This vaccine rendered the virus inactive but
still triggered the body to produce antibodies. In 1955, Salk's vaccine was licensed for use in the United States,
and mass distribution began there. Other vaccines were developed in the United States and other countries
over the next several years. Their use has nearly eradicated polio cases, which once numbered in the hundreds
650 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       of thousands. When polio was detected in an adult in New York in July 2022, it was the first case in the United
       States since 2013.

       FIGURE 15.20 Jonas Salk. After the polio vaccine he developed proved successful, Dr. Jonas Salk chose not to
       patent it to ensure it would be used freely around the world. (credit: "Dr Jonas Edward Salk, creator of Salk polio
       vaccine, at Copenhagen Airport" by SAS Scandinavian Airlines/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       The eradication of smallpox is another important success story. Centuries ago, smallpox devastated
       communities around the world, especially Native American groups, which had no immunity to the disease
       when Europeans brought it to their shores. Early vaccines based on the cowpox virus were deployed in the
       United States and Europe in the eighteenth century with great effect. In the twentieth century, advancements
       made the vaccine safer and easier to administer. However, by the 1950s, much of the world remained
       unvaccinated and susceptible. Beginning in 1959, the World Health Organization (WHO) began working to
       eradicate smallpox through mass vaccination, redoubling efforts in 1967 through its Intensified Eradication
       Program. During the 1970s, smallpox was eradicated in South America, Asia, and Africa. In 1980, the WHO
       declared it had been eliminated globally.
       The WHO's smallpox program is considered the most effective disease-eradication initiative in history, but it
       was an aggressive campaign not easily replicated. And without a vaccine, the problems of controlling
       transmissible diseases can be immense. A novel disease was first reported among Los Angeles's gay
       community in 1981, and by 1982 it had become known as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
       Researchers realized it was commonly transmitted through sexual intercourse but could also be passed by
       shared needles and blood transfusions. At that time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control explained that AIDS
       was not transmitted through casual contact, but the information did little to calm rising concerns about this
       still largely mysterious and deadly disease. By 1987, more than 60,000 people in the world had died of AIDS. In
       the United States, the government was slow to fund research to develop treatments or to find a cure. That year,
       activists at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in New York City, concerned with the toll that
       AIDS was taking on the gay community and the government's seeming lack of concern regarding a disease that
       the media depicted as affecting primarily gay men, an already stigmatized group, formed the AIDS Coalition to
       Unleash Power (ACT UP). ACT UP engaged in nonviolent protest to bring attention to their cause and worked to
       correct misinformation regarding the disease and those who were infected with it.
       By the year 2000, scientists in the developed world had acquired a sophisticated understanding of AIDS and
       the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and treatments have emerged that make it a manageable rather
       than a lethal disease, at least in the developed world. But in parts of the developing world, like Sub-Saharan
       Africa, infection rates were still rising. One difficulty was that HIV infection and AIDS had become associated
       with homosexuality, which carried stigma and, in some places, even legal penalties that made those infected

reluctant to seek help. Addressing transmission with the general public also meant broaching sometimes
culturally sensitive topics like sexual intercourse. Those attempting to control the spread of the disease often
found themselves trying to influence social and cultural practices, a complicated task fraught with pitfalls.

This does not mean there were not successes. The proliferation of condom use, circumcision, and public
information campaigns, along with the declining cost of treatment, have greatly reduced the extent of the
epidemic in Africa. But AIDS is still an enormous and devastating reality for Africans today. Sub-Saharan
Africa is home to nearly 70 percent of the world's HIV-positive cases. Women and children are particularly
affected; Africa accounts for 92 percent of all cases of infected pregnant women and 90 percent of all infected
children.

Ebola virus has also threatened the health of Africans. The first known outbreak of Ebola, a hemorrhagic fever,
took place in Central Africa in 1976. Since then, there have been several other outbreaks. In 2013-2016, an
outbreak in West Africa quickly spread across national borders and threatened to become a global epidemic.
Approximately ten thousand people fell ill in Liberia alone, and nearly half of those infected died.

The most recent challenge to world health, the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrates the effects of both
globalization and technological developments. The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan, China, an
industrial and commercial hub, in December 2019. Airplane and cruise ship passengers soon unwittingly
spread it throughout the world; the first confirmed case in the United States appeared in January 2020. As
every continent reported infections, offices, stores, and schools closed and travel bans appeared. Despite these
restrictions, middle-class and wealthy people in the developed world continued almost as normal. Many
worked, studied, shopped, visited friends and family, and consulted doctors online from their homes.

Low-paid workers in service industries often lost their jobs, however, as restaurants and hotels closed, and
children without access to computers or stable internet connections struggled to keep up with their classes.
Even the more fortunate in the developed world confronted shortages of goods from toilet paper to medicines
to infant formula when global supply chains stalled as farm laborers, factory workers, dock hands, and railroad
employees fell ill or workplaces closed to prevent the spread of infection. Developing countries lacked funds to
support their citizens through prolonged periods of unemployment. Although vaccines were developed in
several countries, they were available primarily to people in wealthier nations. As of March 2022, only 1
percent of all vaccine doses administered worldwide had been given to people in low-income countries.

 Public Art and Modern Pandemics

  Dangerous diseases like HIV/AIDS can energize more people than doctors working in laboratories and global
  leaders publishing reports. During the early years of the HIV/AIDS crisis, grassroots organizers from around the
  world strove to focus attention on the problem. Their actions were necessary because governments often did
  little to prevent the spread of the disease or provide treatment for those infected. The AIDS Coalition to Unleash
  Power (ACT UP) became known for staging loud protests in public and sometimes private places to raise
  awareness about the disease. In the United States, the publicity generated through groups like ACT UP forced the
  government to pay greater attention and to budget more money to the search for a cure. Some artists responded
  to this movement with murals in well-known locations like the Berlin Wall (Figure 15.21).

         While some murals about diseases were a call to action, especially about HIV/AIDS, others have aimed to
         educate the public. A mural painted on a wall in Kenya for World Malaria Day 2014 showed viewers the proper
         use of bed nets to help lower the rate of infection (Figure 15.22).

  During the COVID-19 pandemic, artists also went to the streets. Some of the murals they painted demanded
  action or celebrated health workers. Others called for awareness about the rising number of elderly people dying
  of the disease (Figure 15.23).

On February 24, 2022, the world watched in horror and frustration as Russian tanks rolled across the
Ukrainian border and began bombing cities around the former Soviet republic. This was the second time in
fewer than ten years that Russian troops had invaded the nation. In 2014, Russian forces had annexed the
654 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       Ukrainian region of Crimea. While both invasions were decades in the making, to many they seemed like a
       rerun of a bygone era. Those who had watched Soviet tanks roll into Budapest and Prague to quell uprisings in
       the 1950s and 1960s saw the invasion of 2014 and the violence of 2022 as a reminder that some problems, no
       matter how far in the past, remain unresolved.

      Instability in the Post-Cold War World

       When the Soviet Union dissolved on December 31, 1991, most in the West celebrated the end of the Cold War,
       believing that a new world that would uniformly embrace liberal democracy and capitalism was in the process
       of being born. Political scientist Francis Fukuyama even published a book on the idea in 1992 called The End
       of History and the Last Man. The argument presented in the book was that the world had been marching
       toward a Western liberal democratic future for centuries, and with the Soviet Union gone, it had reached the
       inevitable end of its "ideological evolution." With the United States as the only remaining superpower, many
       also assumed the Cold War's bipolar world would soon evolve into a mostly unipolar one based on U.S. military,
       cultural, and economic dominance.

       With this idea in mind, U.S. president Bill Clinton drafted a foreign policy platform geared to revising and
       expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the alliance for mutual defense forged by the United
       States and other Western democracies during the Cold War. Clinton aimed to strengthen relationships in Asia,
       bring post-Soviet Russia into the international community, and address ethnic and political strife in the
       Middle East, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, Latin America, and East Africa. These goals occasionally required
       using the country's military, such as in 1995 when Clinton sent a force of twenty thousand to the Balkans as
       part of a NATO operation to enforce a cease-fire and protect upcoming elections.

       One of the most pressing concerns for the United States and the world, however, was the need to secure the
       thirty-five thousand nuclear weapons then installed in thousands of sites around Eurasia. Many were in states
       that had separated from the former Soviet Union such as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Because these
       countries were going through a difficult period of transition and instability, many feared that non-state actors,
       meaning terrorist groups not tied to a specific country, might gain access to the armaments or the material
       necessary to make them and cause catastrophic damage. Some of the work had begun even before the Soviet
       Union collapsed. In the summer of 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union had signed the Strategic Arms
       Reduction Treaty (START), agreeing to each reduce their arms stockpiles by more than 80 percent.

       After the disintegration of the USSR, however, the need to secure these stockpiles became more pressing. The
       solution proposed by the United States and supported by Russia was to denuclearize those states that had split
       from the former Soviet Union but still possessed nuclear weapons. While successful, the effort did run into
       some difficulties, particularly in Ukraine, which felt that preserving its nuclear weapons would be the best way
       to deter Russian belligerence in the future. Only after it had secured assurances from the international
       community that its borders would be respected did Ukraine allow its nuclear weapons to be removed and
       disassembled in Russia.

       Nuclear proliferation elsewhere around the world was also a problem. India, for example, had become a
       nuclear power in 1974. At the time, it claimed it was not pursuing nuclear weapons capability, but since then,
       it has embraced these weapons as an important part of its security platform. Given the history of hostility
       between India and Pakistan, international observers in the 1970s worried about the implications of a nuclear-
       armed India. Some of these fears were realized in 1998 when Pakistan tested its first nuclear weapons, a goal
       toward which it had been building since before India became a nuclear power. While India maintains a no-
       first-use doctrine for its nuclear weapons, Pakistan has not reciprocated. Today, the countries have
       approximately one hundred nuclear weapons each, as well as long-range ballistic missile delivery systems.

       Only a few years after Pakistan tested its first nuclear weapon, the illusion of an enduring post-Cold War peace
       was further shaken when on September 11, 2001, nineteen militant Islamic hijackers took control of four large
       passenger airplanes and crashed two of them into New York City's World Trade Center (Figure 15.24), one into

the Pentagon, and the fourth--after its path was deflected by passengers--into a field in Shanksville,
Pennsylvania. It was soon determined that the terrorist attack, which killed nearly three thousand people from
many nations, had been orchestrated by al-Qaeda, an Islamic terrorist organization then based in Afghanistan
that was financed and led by a militant Saudi Arabian national named Osama bin Laden. According to bin
Laden, the attack was carried out in response to U.S. support for Israel and its continued military presence in
the Middle East.

Center in New York, both its towers crumbled to the ground in a pile of rubble. Those still inside were all killed.

After assessing the damage and collecting global support, the United States launched an attack on Afghanistan
with the stated purpose of finding those responsible. This offensive represented the beginning of the U.S. war
on terror and resulted in the collapse of Afghanistan's Islamic fundamentalist Taliban government, many of
whose officials fled to the southern parts of the country or into neighboring Pakistan. Most of al-Qaeda's
leadership also escaped, however, including Osama bin Laden. Over the next several years, the U.S. military
pursued a policy of eliminating al-Qaeda, rebuilding civil society and infrastructure in Afghanistan, and
propping up a democratically elected regime in the country. These efforts were made more difficult, however,
by the decision of President George W. Bush to launch a war against Iraq in 2003.
The United States supported Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) but came into conflict with it during
the Gulf War in 1990, when Iraq invaded its neighbor Kuwait. The United States, Great Britain, and thirty-three
other nations came to Kuwait's defense by bombing Iraqi targets and then launching a ground invasion. A
mere one hundred hours after the coalition's ground invasion began, Iraqi forces had retreated from Kuwait,
and a cease-fire was in place. Immediately following, uprisings took place in Kurdish and Shiite regions of Iraq
that sought to topple President Saddam Hussein's government. Hussein brutally crushed the attempted
revolts, but the coalition forces withdrew from Iraq, leaving him in power.
In 2001, in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, U.S. foreign policy leaders began to worry that
Hussein might acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), possibly including biological weapons. The Bush
656 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       administration wanted to prevent this and to channel the international goodwill showered on the country after
       the 2001 attacks toward the goal of removing the Iraqi leader. To this end, the United States built a new
       coalition of Asian, European, and Latin American countries. It sent Secretary of State Colin Powell to the
       United Nations to present the argument that Iraq had connections to al-Qaeda and possessed WMDs that made
       it a threat to international security (Figure 15.25). Even though at the time some in the U.S. intelligence
       community felt the evidence on which Powell relied was weak or flawed, to secure support for a U.S. invasion,
       members of the Bush administration such as Vice President Dick Cheney claimed the WMDs existed.

       FIGURE 15.25 Colin Powell. Secretary of State Colin Powell gave a powerful presentation about Iraq's suspected
       weapons of mass destruction at the United Nations in 2003. At one point, he held up a model vial of anthrax (a
       bacterium that causes a serious infectious disease) to highlight the danger of biological weapons that Saddam
       Hussein was supposed to have. (credit: "Colin Powell anthrax vial. 5 Feb 2003 at the UN" by United States
       Government/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
       The invasion began on March 19, 2003, just a few weeks after Powell's presentation. By 2005, it had become
       obvious to the world that Iraq did not possess WMDs, and the hypothetical al-Qaeda connection had not been
       demonstrated. The invasion contributed to the violent unraveling of Iraqi society, however, which the coalition
       forces then struggled for years to bring under control. There were countless civilian casualties; Brown
       University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs estimates that between 184,382 and 207,156
       civilians were killed. While the United States could point to some successes, such as the 2005 Iraq elections
       and the 2006 conviction of Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity, the nation's reputation as a global
       force capable of projecting power to bring about positive change in the world had suffered greatly.
       The consequences for the United States became more obvious in October 2006 when communist North Korea
       launched its first nuclear weapons test, an event the U.S. government had worked for years to prevent. The test
       was the culmination of decades of work inside the isolated country. North Korean leaders believed nuclear
       weapons would guarantee its survival in the post-Cold War world. But the United States and neighboring
       countries like South Korea and Japan worried that the unstable North Korean regime might use the weapons
       against them. Given the problems in Iraq and diminished global standing of the United States, it was unclear
       whether North Korea could be deterred from attempting additional tests, or whether the United States could
       discourage Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons program.

      Radicalism, Refugees, and Resistance

       In 2011, the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq was completed, eight long years after the invasion.
       Hopes that peace in Iraq would last were dashed, however, with the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the

Levant (ISIL), a fundamentalist and militant Islamic group also referred to as the Islamic State. Formed in
1999, ISIL had fought against the U.S.-led coalition that invaded Iraq in 2003. In 2014, it attacked Iraqi security
forces and drove them from a number of cities, including Ramadi, Fallujah, and Mosul, and it killed thousands
of members of the Yazidi minority group in Iraq's Sinjar district.
ISIL leaders proclaimed themselves the heads of a new caliphate, an Islamic state led by a ruler claiming to be
a successor to Muhammad, with religious and political authority over all Muslims. This is a claim most of the
world's Muslims reject. In response, a military coalition led by the United States returned to Iraq following a
request by the Iraqi government. Meanwhile, ISIL's counterpart in Syria, known as the Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria, waged war against both the government of Syria and other nonfundamentalist groups that were also
seeking to oust Syria's president Bashar al-Assad. The U.S.-led coalition that returned to Iraq to fight the
Islamic State there intervened in Syria as well.
Instability in Iraq and Syria led to a flood of refugees making their way across the Mediterranean to Europe in
2015 (Figure 15.26). Yet more were fleeing genocidal violence in the Darfur region of Sudan, while many others
sought to escape failing states and poverty in numerous parts of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. These
refugees and economic migrants felt they would find a better and safer life in the developed countries of the
West, particularly Germany, Sweden, Britain, France, and the United States, and many were willing to risk
their lives to achieve this.

FIGURE 15.26 Refugee Crisis. In 2015, Europeans watched in amazement and sometimes fear as large numbers of
refugees in small boats made their way across the Mediterranean from the Middle East, Asia, and Africa to Europe's
shores. (credit: "LE Eithne Operation Triton" by Óglaigh na hÉireann/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Upon arrival, these groups met various responses. While some argued that the refugees had survived trauma
and deserved to be welcomed with open arms, others said they were fleeing circumstances outside the host
country's responsibility and would bring too many cultural and religious changes. For example, many
Europeans feared that refugees from Islamic countries would reject the values of the largely secular European
nations in which they settled. Many others believe that Muslims embrace political extremism or support acts of
terrorism. Responding to the developing migrant crisis, German chancellor Angela Merkel declared, "We can
do this!" and promised Germany would welcome 800,000 refugees in 2015.

       is a 2017 film about the crisis directed by the renowned Chinese visual artist and activist Ai Weiwei.

       While some were heartened by Merkel's offer, others throughout Europe felt it was short-sighted. They noted
       that since Germany was in the European Union, bringing refugees there effectively amounted to bringing them
       into any other country in the EU. Within Germany itself, there was also resistance. Founded in 2014, the
       German group Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West (PEGIDA) began conducting weekly
       marches in cities like Dresden, declaring that opening the doors to the Islamic world would spell the end of
       Europe (Figure 15.27). While PEGIDA made a point not to categorically oppose refugees, members continue to
       openly oppose the presence of the Islamic religion and culture within Germany.

       FIGURE 15.27 Immigration Protest. PEGIDA is just one of many European groups that have grown by focusing on
       European fears about Muslim immigrants and Islamic terrorism. This demonstration by the group took place in
       Dresden, Germany in 2016. (credit: "PEGIDA Demonstration Dresden 2016-10-03" by "Chrystalcolor"/Wikimedia

       PEGIDA is just one of several ultranationalist movements that support an extreme form of nationalism and
       often seek to create ethnically homogeneous homelands. Others are Golden Dawn in Greece, the English
       Defence League in Britain, and the Identitarian Movement of Austria. Such groups advocate the establishment
       of ethnic-based citizenship, resist non-European immigration, and generally promote more conservative
       social policies. Europe is not the only continent to see a resurgence of xenophobic political activism in the last
       few decades. In Japan, Nippon Kaigi ("Japan Conference") is an ultranationalist organization founded in 1997
       that advocates a staunchly nationalist education system, a strong monarchy, and positive interpretation of
       Japan's imperial past. The Nationalist Front of Mexico was founded in 2006 and advocates a neofascist
       ideology and a retreat from globalization. In the United States, the American Freedom Party, American Identity
       Movement, Patriot Front, National Justice Party, and others promote similar ideas. These groups are especially
       concerned with preventing immigration to the United States from Latin America (Figure 15.28). They are
       generally in the neofascist mold and advocate a United States that is overwhelmingly White and European in
       culture.

State Instability and Human Rights Abuses

Many of the migrants arriving at the southern border of the United States are fleeing economic and political
disorder in their home countries. This pattern goes back many decades. For example, many thousands of
Salvadoran migrants have entered the United States each year, especially during and after the El Salvador Civil
War (Figure 15.29). That war began in 1979 with a military coup supported by the United States, which feared
that radical leftist elements in El Salvador were destabilizing the country and leading it in a direction contrary
to U.S. Cold War interests.

FIGURE 15.29 El Salvador's Civil War. (a) The civil war in El Salvador greatly destabilized the country and led to a

       combatants in Perquín, El Salvador in 1990" by Linda Hess Miller/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0)

       By supporting the coup with money, military training, and the sharing of intelligence reports, the United States
       hoped to return stability to El Salvador, but the opposite occurred. Many in El Salvador felt the military
       government was illegitimate and staged protests and resistance. The military responded with violence of its
       own, such as a deadly attack on demonstrators in 1980. There were also rightist paramilitary groups, often
       referred to as "death squads," fighting against leftist guerrilla forces in the countryside and committing
       murders and massacres. As the country descended into chaos, many left and found refuge in the United States.
       Today these immigrants number about 2.5 million.

       A similar pattern of civil war and instability in other parts of Central America has also produced human rights
       abuses and an increase in migration to the United States. The Guatemalan Civil War (1960-1996), for example,
       led to numerous human rights violations against Guatemalans. These included a reported campaign of
       violence and terrorism by the government against ethnic Mayans and peasants accused of supporting leftist
       guerrilla groups. Nicaragua has experienced destabilization since the 1960s as well. Leftist guerrilla
       organizations fought against the dictatorship of the Somoza family, which ruled until the late 1970s. Then, in
       1979, one of the major leftist groups, the Sandinistas, took control. The Sandinistas were socialists, and within
       months they had opened diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and later accepted its economic and
       military assistance. This action alarmed the United States and led it to support resistance to the Sandinista
       government, which contributed to an escalation of the violence and a number of human rights abuses on both
       sides.

       The long-term consequences of the war in El Salvador (https://openstax.org/l/77ElSalvador) are still obvious
       today. Watch this brief news report to learn about some of them.

       While violence in Central America has declined in the last few decades, it persists elsewhere. Venezuela,
       effectively a one-party state since 2007, has been accused by the United States of a number of human rights
       abuses. These include murder, imprisonment, torture, and government support of armed groups that commit
       violence against protestors. Similar accusations have been made against the governments in Colombia, Cuba,
       Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. Chile's government committed numerous human rights abuses against its people
       during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). These included torture, execution, and sexual abuse
       of leftist political opponents. While Pinochet has since died, human rights organizations claim the abuses
       continue, particularly against Indigenous groups and those identifying as LGBTQ+.

       Similar human rights abuses committed by authoritarian governments are also a persistent reality across
       much of Africa. Between April and July 1994, nearly 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda when an estimated
       200,000 members of the Hutu majority sought to wipe out the minority Tutsi population and any Hutus who
       tried to protect them. Armed conflicts in countries like Liberia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Democratic
       Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Somalia have also led to many human rights violations. In a number of
       countries, militant Islamic organizations have committed civilian massacres and targeted killings. These
       include attacks by Boko Haram, the Islamic State in West Africa, and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara,
       which have been responsible for many hundreds of deaths over the last few years. In response, the
       governments in these countries have committed atrocities of their own. For example, in 2021, government
       forces in the Central African Republic attacked a mosque and killed fourteen people.

       Governments across Africa have often used violence to break up anti-government protests. For example, in the

small southern African country of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), government forces broke up a pro-
democracy protest in 2021, killing eighty people and injuring more than two hundred. Many more who
protested the regime of the Eswatini king Mswati III were arrested (Figure 15.30). Similar actions against
protestors in Sudan that year led to the deaths of fifty-three people. And other government abuses across the
continent have resulted in long prison sentences and even death for protestors, whistleblowers, and journalists
who have challenged government policies.

In Asia, Myanmar and China demonstrate that human rights violations can emerge where racial and religious
prejudices against minorities are pronounced. The Rohingya people, a Muslim minority living in
predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, have faced oppression for generations, including being officially excluded
from citizenship in 1982. Because they are a small minority and viewed with suspicion by the larger Buddhist
population, they have long been vulnerable to attacks. In 2017, brutality against the Rohingya escalated
dramatically and triggered a mass migration of more than 700,000 to neighboring Bangladesh. As of 2022,
nearly a million Rohingya people were still living in large refugee camps there (Figure 15.31).

       Another case of state-sponsored abuse against an ethnic minority is the oppression of the Uyghurs of China
       (Figure 15.32). The Uyghurs number about eleven million and are a mostly Muslim ethnic group of Turkic
       origin living in northwestern Xinjiang. The Chinese government has repressed them for decades, claiming that
       many hold extremist ideas about carving out their own Islamic state, which China views as a threat to its
       territorial integrity. Chinese policy has been to compel the Uyghurs to conform their religious beliefs more
       thoroughly to the state's nationalist message and to eliminate separatist movements. Since at least as early as
       2017, China has rounded up several hundred thousand Uyghurs and placed them in what it calls vocational
       training centers. Human rights groups, however, have described these as reeducation camps intended to
       compel the Uyghurs to renounce Islam and become loyal Chinese citizens. Relatively little is known about the
       many camps because the state controls information and denies that abuse occurs within them.

Women and girls often face the brunt of violence when instability reigns or when states sponsor oppression
against minorities. Both Rohingya and Uyghur women have described sexual abuse perpetrated by the state or
with its tacit approval. In 2014, the world condemned the Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram's attack on a
girl's high school in Nigeria and its kidnapping of 276 mostly Christian female students, many of whom were
forced into marriages with Boko Haram members or sold into sexual slavery. Those who escaped have
described beatings, sexual assaults, and torture. While this event captured global attention, including from
First Lady Michelle Obama, many similar kidnappings have occurred before and since with almost no
international coverage at all (Figure 15.33).

The situation of women in Afghanistan is particularly dire. Since retaking control of the country in August
2021 following the U.S. military's departure, the Taliban has rolled back virtually all the once-protected civil
rights of women and girls. Afghan women have been denied access to education, health care, and civil rights

       and the right to free expression, freedom of movement, and freedom of association. They are required to
       completely cover their bodies while outdoors and are routinely inspected by security officials to ensure they
       are properly clothed and in the company of a male relative. Because they are now restricted in the types of jobs
       they can hold, many Afghan women have found it difficult to earn enough money to support themselves or
       their families as they once did.

                                                                                                          DUELING VOICES

        The Debate Over Veils and Head Coverings

         Whether or not Muslim women should be required--or allowed--to wear veils or head coverings is a contentious
         issue. In some countries with Muslim-majority populations, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan, the law
         requires women to veil their heads and/or faces in public. In other Muslim countries, however, women can
         choose whether to do so.

         Muslim women living in the West also must confront the question of whether to cover their heads and faces in
         public. Sometimes government authorities do not give them a choice. In 2004, France banned the wearing of
         veils in public schools, and in 2011 it banned veils that cover the entire face, as did Belgium. Women cannot work
         for the French government while veiled, nor can anyone wearing an overtly religious symbol such as a crucifix or
         skullcap. French authorities claim these bans ensure the secular nature of the French state, a bedrock principle
         dating from the French Revolution and enshrined in Article 1 of the French Constitution of 1958.

         Supporters of women's right to veil argue that such laws are a backlash against Muslim immigrants and
         disproportionately affect Muslim women, and they point out that French public schools celebrate Christian
         holidays. While conservative politicians generally support the bans, some liberals would prevent veiled women
         from working in day care centers, and the Socialist junior minister for women's rights questioned whether veils
         should be allowed in universities.

         Muslim women themselves are divided in their opinions. Some consider veils symbols of oppression and argue
         that they can be good Muslims without covering themselves. One New York City woman explained, "I am a
         Muslim woman, and I have never worn a veil, nor has my mother or her sisters. . . . While we are devoted to
         Islam, we believe that God exists on the inside and not in outward symbols that are too often thwarted and
         perverted by political interests."

         Many others voluntarily choose to wear veils or headscarves and do not feel pressured to do so. They consider
         them a symbol of their cultural identity or religious piety. One young Muslim American woman explained to the
         New York Times, "I chose to start wearing the veil three years ago, even though the girls in my family don't. I
         chose to wear it myself after I studied Islam and thought it was a beautiful way to express my love for my religion
         and nothing more."

           · Why did France ban full-face veils? Do you find the government's arguments convincing?
           · Do you think banning religious symbols is the best way to achieve the separation of church and state? Why or

               why not?

      Global North and Global South

       The reality for many people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America is a stark reminder of the wide gulf between
       what some refer to as the Global North and the Global South. These labels describe the rough geographic
       pattern evident in the global distribution of the world's richest and poorest countries. Most of the richest
       countries, such as the United States, Canada, and the EU countries, are in the north, while poorer countries
       predominate in the south (Figure 15.34). However, there are also wealthy countries such as Australia, New
       Zealand, and Singapore in the southern hemisphere, so the terms actually reflect economic realities and not

geography. Furthermore, while not all people living in Global South countries are poor, those that are earn only
a fraction of what the average person in a Global North country earns. The world is complicated, and
complexity resists simple categorizations.

FIGURE 15.34 The Global North and the Global South. When people speak of the Global North, shown in blue in
this map, they mean mostly wealthy Western countries. With a few exceptions, the Global South, shown in red,
means mostly poorer countries, some of which were once colonized by European imperial powers. (credit:
modification of work "World map blank shorelines" by Maciej Jaros/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
Many of the economic problems in the Global South can be traced to imperial exploitation, sometimes going
back centuries. Countries in the Global North, especially in Europe, tended to reap the benefits of this
exploitation. The legacy of colonialism and imperialism in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and southern
Asia continues to affect these countries in the form of high levels of government corruption, poorly developed
industries, and borders drawn for the benefit of imperialist powers rather than by the groups living there. In
Africa, borders charted to benefit imperialist powers often separated members of the same ethnic group into
different countries while forcing hostile groups into the same country. Violent ethnic conflict has been a
frequent result.
Even Global South countries that are resource-rich have struggled to develop their economies over the past few
decades. Indeed, they often have more difficulty responding to their domestic needs than countries that are
relatively resource-poor. This problem, sometimes dubbed the resource curse, a term coined by British
economist Richard Auty in 1993, makes resource-rich countries prone to authoritarianism, high rates of
conflict, and low rates of economic growth. Resource-poor countries typically use citizens' taxes for the
majority of government funding, resulting in greater public scrutiny over how that money is used and
governments that are more responsive to public needs. In contrast, governments in resource-rich countries
are able to tap into profit-producing extractive industries like oil production to fund public expenditures.
Because that profit is often quite large, opportunities for government corruption abound. Efforts to capture
more profit also contribute to conflict and sometimes authoritarian regimes, as politicians use money to
reward political supporters and fund security forces that silence opponents and stamp out protest. There is
also typically less public scrutiny of potential corruption.

     LINK TO LEARNING

The resource curse is a complicated problem that scholars and others continue to try to solve. To better
understand the issue, take a look at this insightful short interview with Leif Wenar (https://openstax.org/l/
666 15 · The Contemporary World and Ongoing Challenges

       77Wenar) in which he discusses the resource curse. Wenar is the author of Blood Oil: Tyrants, Violence, and
       the Rules That Run the World.

       The African country of Angola, rich in diamonds and oil, has struggled with the resource curse. In 2018, oil
       made up more than 92 percent of its exports, and the oil industry accounted for about a third of its GDP. Since
       achieving independence from Portugal in 1975, the country has experienced internal wars and massacres. For
       much of this period, until 2017, Angola was ruled by José Eduardo dos Santos, who was routinely criticized
       internationally for election fraud, corruption, and authoritarianism. Much of his power was derived from the
       oil rents paid to him by oil companies operating in Angola, which he used to oppress his opposition, maintain
       his hold on power, and shower his family and close contacts with favors and money. The oil rents were
       substantial, but relatively little of this money actually trickled down to the country's largely impoverished
       people (Figure 15.35). Strife also weakened Angola's ability to feed itself. Famine conditions prevailed in the
       1980s and 1990s, and many educated and skilled workers left for opportunities abroad. In 2019, the
       percentage of the population below the national poverty line was 41 percent, 30 percent of adults had not
       completed primary schooling, and 53 percent of the country had no access to electricity.

       FIGURE 15.35 Poverty in Resource-Rich Angola. Despite their enormous natural riches, the people of Angola
       continue to live in great poverty, as in this typical village in the country. (credit: "Streetscene Angola village" by
       Paulo César Santos/Wikimedia Commons, CC0 1.0)
       While Angola is an extreme case, its problems are generally representative of those in many countries across
       the Global South, including those unaffected by the resource curse. As of 2015, approximately 85 percent of
       the world's extreme poor (those living on less than $1.90 per day) lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia,
       and half of them lived in just five countries: India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
       and Ethiopia. Many lack access to good-quality medical care, infrastructure, educational resources, and
       communication systems. They face high rates of famine, disease, and death from political instability. They also
       experience food instability. According to the United Nations, approximately 800 million people faced hunger in
       2020, many in the Global South. They are also more vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes,
       earthquakes, tsunamis, and heat waves. Their countries are more likely to experience problems related to
       environmental and industrial pollution, as well as the many effects of climate change.

These difficulties have been at least partially alleviated by the efforts of international organizations like the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The World Bank has encouraged community-driven
development by supporting government planning and investments that prioritize a bottom-up approach. It has
helped countries manage the problem of persistent natural disasters, such as financing early warning systems
for tsunamis in Southeast Asia. And it has provided funds to meet educational needs, to provide infrastructure
for clean water, and to combat hunger by boosting agricultural production. Similarly, the IMF has provided a
pool of monetary resources countries can access when they fall into financial difficulties.

While both organizations can point to their many achievements, they have occasionally made problems worse.
Critics like the economist Joseph Stiglitz, for instance, point to the many conditions the IMF imposes on
countries when it comes to help. These include increased privatization, elimination of protectionist policies,
higher interest rates, and austerity measures that reduce government spending. Such conditions, Stiglitz and
others have noted, tend to benefit foreign creditors from the Global North and hurt poor workers in the
countries the IMF purports to be saving. Similar criticisms have been directed against the World Bank. Many
have argued that the organization lacks representation from the Global South, so poor countries have relatively
little influence within the organization and on its policies and actions.

Section Summary

15.1 A Global Economy

In the aftermath of World War II, countries began to open trade and communications around the world. In
Europe, the EEC or Common Market eventually grew into the EU. In Asia, countries worked together to create
their own trading blocs like ASEAN and APEC. Canada, Mexico, and the United States signed the NAFTA treaty,
later replaced by USMCA. All these trading blocs and organizations have made it easier for MNCs to operate
around the world, leading to a rise in the standard of living for many developing countries.

But MNCs are often criticized for their profit-driven approach, which can create lasting problems in developing
countries, sometimes made worse by efforts to encourage these nations to privatize their public utilities. The
poorest groups are also most commonly exploited by MNCs that contract with large factories or sweatshops in
developing countries. Wealthy corporations like Apple and Nike have frequently been criticized for profiting
from the labor of poorly paid workers in unsafe environments in places like China and Bangladesh.

15.2 Debates about the Environment

In the 1950s and 1960s, some in developed countries began responding openly to the environmental problems
they saw around them, including those caused by the Green Revolution. Scientists like Rachel Carson, author
of Silent Spring, gave legitimacy to these concerns, and many people became environmental activists working
to promote change. They and the environmental groups they created spoke of the need to address global
warming and climate change, the dangers of nuclear energy, deforestation, the ozone hole, and many other
problems. These efforts were occasionally met with resistance, not just from those who survived by exploiting
natural resources in their own developing countries, but also from workers, like loggers and others, in
developed countries. By the 1980s, international groups like the United Nations were also calling for action.
Specific measures like the Montreal Protocol were followed by the UN's ambitious 2015 Paris Agreement to
limit warming. But achieving international agreement about how best to handle the problem of climate change
remains a struggle.

15.3 Science and Technology for Today's World

By the 1990s, computers had become commonplace in developed countries, though fears about their potential
impact on privacy grew with the rise of the internet and social media. Easy access to social media over
smartphones helped young protestors in Tunisia and Egypt organize to challenge their governments. The
movement spread across the Middle East in the form of the Arab Spring. Some nations such as China have
since blocked the use of many social media platforms.

Medical scientists have made great strides in curing and preventing diseases. Vaccines eliminated smallpox
around the world and came close to eliminating polio. But new illnesses arose, including Ebola virus and HIV/
AIDS. Since it was identified in the 1980s, treatments have emerged to make it a manageable disease for many
rather than a lethal one, though in the developing world, it is still a huge problem. The most recent challenge to
world health, the COVID-19 pandemic that began in December 2019, demonstrates how both globalization and
technological developments affect life in the twenty-first century.

15.4 Ongoing Problems and Solutions

When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, it seemed possible to many in the West that the United
States would lead the world into a new era of universal liberal democracy. But in 2001, the September 11
attacks by the terrorist group al-Qaeda prompted the United States to begin wars in Afghanistan and then in
Iraq. The mistakes made in Iraq damaged the reputation of the United States and weakened its ability to
preserve stability in the world. Its intervention in Iraq also spurred the growth of the Islamic State, responsible
for violent attacks in Iraq, Syria, and Africa.

Violence, civil war, and persecution have led large numbers of refugees from the Middle East and Africa to
cross the Mediterranean to Europe. Their arrival has provoked some resistance, and a number of
ultranationalist groups have sprung up in the United States and Europe. The migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico
border is partly the result of violence and instability in a number of Latin American countries, such as civil
wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.

Violence and human rights abuses have plagued Sub-Saharan Africa for decades. Many occur in the Global
South, and critics have connected the economic problems there to the region's history of imperial exploitation
by countries in the Global North. One of these problems is the resource curse, or the difficulty of responding to
domestic needs faced by resource-rich countries.
