            Peer Review Statement

The Biomedical Engineering for Africa monograph has been through the academic peer review
process to conform to the Department of Higher Education and Training requirements.
Each chapter, including the introductory chapter, has been peer-reviewed by senior academics at
universities in South Africa, Nigeria and the United States of America. Reviewers are considered
subject matter experts.
The review process was as follows:

       The papers were submitted to reviewers, who provided comments and suggestions.
       The Editorial Committee requested authors to correct the manuscripts in accordance with

          the comments and suggestions of the reviewers.
       If the Editorial Committee were satisfied with the revised manuscript, the manuscript was

          accepted for publication.
Peer review process confirmed by Dr Reggie Raju (Director: Research and Learning Services,
Libraries, University of Cape Town, South Africa).

                    Foreword

It is with great pleasure that I write the foreword to this much anticipated book on biomedical
engineering written by Africans and their collaborators, with an African perspective. High
mortality rates, expensive health care systems, and heavy dependence on imported health
technology from industrialised countries, motivate the development of technological
capacity on the African continent to advance health and healthcare. Biomedical engineering
education, research and practice are critical contributors to such capacity.
This book disseminates knowledge in a range of facets of innovation for improved health and
healthcare systems. It appropriately emphasises knowledge of context as a critical factor for
successful health technology development. Comprehensive coverage of the conception,
development and implementation of health-related technologies is accompanied by
educational approaches for prospective biomedical engineers and others wishing to
contribute health technology innovation. Emphasis has been placed on biomedical
engineering best practices for developing countries, especially in Africa, to bring about
inclusive developmental outcomes.
Biomedical Engineering for Africa will be a useful guide for aspiring and practicing biomedical
engineers, biomedical engineering educators, and other associated professionals. It is heart-
warming that biomedical engineering in Africa has come of age. Happy reading!
