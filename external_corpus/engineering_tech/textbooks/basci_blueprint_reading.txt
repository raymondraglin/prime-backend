Welcome to the Linn-Benton Welding
Department's First edition to blueprint
reading.

Being able to read and understand, as well as sketch, or even draw a
blueprint, is important to the making of accurate parts and complete
fabrications.

   Blueprints are tools that communicate what needs to be built or
made, what materials are needed and what specifications are
required. They insure that a design is made with complete accuracy
what meets the needs of the customer.

   This book is an updated version of the originally authored
publication by the Department of Engineering and Drafting
Technology Department at Linn-Benton Community College, in
Albany Oregon.

                                                                                      Introduction | 1

You have heard the saying, "A picture is worth a thousand words". This
statement is particularly true in regards to technical drawings.

   It would be almost impossible for an engineer, designer, or
architect to describe in words the shape, size, and relationship of
a complex object. Therefore, drawings have become the universal
language used by engineers, designers, technicians, as well as
craftsmen, to communicate the Information necessary to build,
assemble and service the products of industry.

   It is Important to remember, as you study Print Reading, that you
are learning to communicate with the graphic language used by
Industry: Lines are part of that language.

   Since technical drawings are made of lines, it is logical that the
first step in learning to "read" a drawing is to learn the meaning of
each kind of line. Generally, there are 11 basic types of lines. Each
kind of line has a definite form and "weight". Weight refers to line

4 | The Language of Lines
thickness or width. When combined in a drawing, lines provide part
of the Information needed to understand the print.

   Being able to interpret a blueprint and accurately build objects is a
needed skill to become successful in all trade crafts. It is a skill, like
many others you will learn, and it will take time and practice to fully
understand and become proficient.

   Object Line
   A visible line, or object line is a thick continuous line, used to
outline the visible edges or contours of an object.

   Hidden Line
   A hidden line, also known as a hidden object line is a medium weight
line, made of short dashes about 1/8" long with 1/16"gaps, to show
edges, surfaces and corners which cannot be seen. Sometimes they
are used to make a drawing easier to understand. Often they are
omitted in an isometric view.

                                                                       The Language of Lines | 5
   Section Line
   Section lines are used to show the cut surfaces of an object in
section views. They are fine, dark lines. Various types of section lines
may indicate the type of material cut by the cutting plane line.

   Center Line
   Center lines are used to indicate the centers of holes, arcs, and
symmetrical objects. They are very thin (size), long-short-long kinds
of lines.

6 | The Language of Lines
   Dimension Line
   Dimension lines are thin and are used to show the actual size of
an object. There are arrowheads at both end that terminate at the
extension lines.

   Extension Line
   Extension lines are also thin lines, showing the limits of
dimensions. Dimension line arrowheads touch extension lines.

Leader Line
   Leaders are more thin lines used to point to an area of a drawing

requiring a note for explanation. They are preferably drawn at a 45
angles.

                                                                        The Language of Lines | 7
   Cutting Plane Line
   A cutting plane line (very heavy) helps to show the internal shape at
a part or assembly by slicing through the object.

Break Line
   There are three kinds of break lines used in drawings. They are

used to remove, or `break out" part of a drawing for clarity, and also to
shorten objects which have the same shape throughout their length
and may be too long to place on the drawing.

8 | The Language of Lines
Short and long break lines are used for flat surfaces. Cylindrical are
used on rods, dowels, etc.

   Phantom Line
   Phantom lines are long-short-short-long lines most often used to
show the travel or movement of an object or a part in alternate
positions. It can also be used to show adjacent objects or features.

                                                                       The Language of Lines | 9
Border Line
   Borderlines are very thick, continuous lines used to show the

boundary of the drawing or to separate different objects drawn on
one sheet. They are also used to separate the title block form the rest
of the drawing.

   CURVED SURFACES
   INCLINED SURFACES

Now that you have learned about the kinds of lines found on prints,
the next step is to develop your visualization abilities. The ability
to "see" technical drawings; that is to "think in three dimensions,"
is the most important part of this course. Since most engineering
and architectural prints utilize some form of orthographic projection
(multi-view drawing), that type of drawing will be emphasized.

   Before going into a study of orthographic projection, you should
be able to recognize several other types of drawings. They are; 1.
Perspective drawing, 2. Oblique drawing, and 3. Isometric drawing. As
a group, they are called "pictorial drawings". They are found on prints
and are easy to visualize, so let's look at their differences.

Perspective

Perspective is the most realistic form of drawing. Artists use one-

                                                                                    Visualization | 15
point perspective, two-point (shown here), and three point to create
visual depth. Perspectives are used by architects and for industrial
pictorials of plan layouts, machinery, and other subjects where
realism is required. Objects drawn in perspective grow smaller as
they recede into the horizon.

Oblique

Oblique drawings are drawn with one plane (front) of the object
parallel to the drawing surface. The side, or other visible part of the
object is generally drawn at 30 or 45. Note that only the side is
on an angle. Many times these types of drawing are not drawn to
scale. The receding lines are drawn at 45 or 30 and will be drawn
at a different scale as the vertical and horizontal lines. This make the
drawing seem "out of shape". This type of drawing is not used very
often in industry.

16 | Visualization
Isometric

Isometric drawings have less distortion than oblique drawings, and
are used more frequently by industry for that reason. An isometric
drawing has both visible surfaces drawn at 30. These are the most
used type of drawings in the piping industry and take a good deal of
practice to fully understand how to draw. They best represent what
is being built and what it will look like from the different sides with
one drawing.

   Directions: Name the types of drawings shown below. Check your
own answers.

                                                                                    Visualization | 17
Single View

A single view of an object is sometimes all that is needed for a
complete visual explanation. When dimensions, material, and other

18 | Visualization
information is Included, an object requiring only a single view is easy
to understand.

   Most one-view drawings are of flat objects, made from materials
such as sheet metal and gasket stock. Spherical objects, such as a
cannonball, would require only one view and a note indicating the
material and diameter of the sphere.

   The object shown in the one-view drawing below could be made of
any appropriate material that might be specified. In appearance, it is
much like the gasket used as part of the cooling system on many cars.
All that would need to be noted is the material type and thickness
required.

                                                                                    Visualization | 19
Two View

Sometimes "two-view" drawings are use on prints. Two views may
be all that is needed to show the shape of an object. Objects that
are cylindrical, such as a length of pipe, are usually shown on a print
with two views. In such a case, two views is sufficient to explain the
shape. Notice in the two-view drawing shown below that the length
of the pipe is shown in one view, while the diameter is called out in
the other. Without the view on the right, what might this shape be
mistaken for? Square tube, channel...

Orthographic Projection

Orthographic projection is a name given to drawings that usually
have three views. Often, the three views selected are the top, front,
and right side. It is possible, of course, to select other views such as
the left side or bottom. Generally, though, it's the top, front and right
side that are traditionally seen by the person reading prints.

   Since most prints make use of the orthographic projection system,
and because the top, front, right side views are most often used, it

20 | Visualization
is important that you have their order, or arrangement on the print
fixed in your mind. To help you understand this system, think of a
chalkboard eraser, a short length of 2 x 4 lumber, or a common
brick. It looks like this:

   When seen on a print, using orthographic projection, it would
appear like this.

This system of orthographic projection may be difficult to
understand or visualize at first, but you will grasp it with some

                                                                                    Visualization | 21
practice. Here's a basic example of how it works, using a simple
object.

   Orthographic projection does not show depth, so the object shown
above will appear flat. With practice, however, you will learn to scan
the three views and "read" depth into them. Remember that the
location of the top, front and right side views does not change. The
projection lines between the orthographic views below show the
height, width, and depth relationship that exists between each view
and the other two views.

22 | Visualization
   In case you did not understand the three-view on the last page, let's
take another look at the same thing. This time numbers will be used
for identification for the surfaces.

                                                                                   Visualization | 23
Using orthographic projection, the object with the surfaces
numbered appears like this:

24 | Visualization
   Notice that the front view (1) is the key to the drawing, because it
most clearly shows the shape of the object. It tells you the object is
"L" shaped from the front. The other two views don't tell you much
by themselves. By looking at surface 1, however, you can see that 2
is taller than 3. Therefore, in "reading" the surfaces, 2 should appear
to be closer to you than 3. Now look at 4 and 5. Which surface is
projected closest to you?

   Answer: Surface 5 (rotate and place at bottom of layout)

   Now draw a simple box and tape all sides together to form a cube.
The cube will be 2"x 2"x 2". Once the instructor has approved your
drawing you will proceed to cut out and tape edges together to form
a cube.

                                                                                   Visualization | 25
Visualization Quiz

Directions:
   All visible surfaces on the objects shown are numbered. To

complete this quiz, you are to place those numbers on the
corresponding surfaces of the orthographic drawings.

26 | Visualization
Visualization | 27
   You may be wondering at this point why something like
orthographic projection is used on prints when isometric or oblique
drawings are so much easier to visualize. The answer is that both
of those types of pictorials are used for relatively uncomplicated
drawings. When an object is complex, however, neither can equal the
orthographic system for clear presentation of dimensions, notes, and
configuration details.

28 | Visualization
Hidden Surfaces

Another advantage of orthographic projection is that it allows the
person reading the print to have the ability to see the inside, or
surfaces of an object which normally could not be seen.

   With complicated objects this can become very useful.
   In the drawing below, the hidden line in the right side view
represents the entire surface of the flat area between the two higher
sides.

                                                                                   Visualization | 29
   In this example, the hidden lines result from a square hole through
the middle of the object.

30 | Visualization
   The hidden lines in this example are there because a part of one
corner of the front surface was cut away, or "recessed.

Hidden Surfaces

Directions: Draw the hidden lines which are missing in the views
below. Each problem has one incomplete view.

                                                                                    Visualization | 31
Curved Surfaces

Curved surfaces are perhaps tricky to "see" until you remember that
the curve is only shown in one view. You must put the curve in the
other views yourself, through visualization. Try to think that when
there is a sharp change of direction like at a corner, then that will
produce a line visible in another view. When the change of direction
is smooth like a curve, no line will be seen.

32 | Visualization
Here's another example of curved surfaces:
                                                                                Visualization | 33
   Curved surfaces exercise.
   Directions: Draw the lines which are missing in the views below.
Each problem has one incomplete view. Do not draw center lines.

34 | Visualization
Inclined Surfaces

Inclined surfaces are those which are at an angle, or slanted. In other
words, they are surfaces which are neither horizontal nor vertical.
In viewing orthographic drawings you need to be alert to angles and
inclined surfaces, for they are often found on the prints you will be
reading later.

   Notice the hidden line in the right view created by the inclined
surface on this object:

                                                                                   Visualization | 35
   Here is an object with two inclined surfaces.

Technical Sketching

   SKETCHING TECHNIQUES
   LETTERING
   OBLIQUE SKETCHING
   ISOMETRIC SKETCHING
   ORTHOGRAPHIC SKETCHING
   ON-THE-SPOT SKETCHING

On many occasions in your work it will most likely be necessary for
you to make a sketch. Perhaps your boss can't visualize a particular
problem without one, or you find it's necessary to make a
dimensioned sketch to show an apprentice how to complete a job. In
any case knowing how to sketch can make you more effective, and
therefore more valuable, as a tradesperson.

Many times out in the field you are working on sketches drawn on
anything from napkins, cardboard, wood scrapes or any flat surface.
Don't get me wrong, you will work projects with professionally
produced drawings but sometimes you have to work with what you
have.

   Being able to make technical sketches doesn't mean you need to be
an artist; and sketching isn't difficult if you follow a few simple rules.
You may be a little slow at first, but with some practice you will be
able to turn out reasonably good sketches without too much effort.

   You are not going to be judged as a professional draftsperson or
architect but you need to be able to describe, with lines what you are

38 | Technical Sketching
needing built, repaired or modified. This take practice and is a very
important skill to develop.

Sketching Techniques

All you need to start is a pencil and some paper. A soft pencil works
best for most people, so try a #2 or an F. Keep the pencil sharp, but
not too sharp: hold it with a grip firm enough for control, but not
so tight that your arm isn't relaxed. Don't draw heavily at first. That
way it is easier to erase without smudging. Darken the sketch when it
begins to shape up the way you want it.

   It's generally best to begin sketching with plain paper, although
some people like to use grid paper. On the job, you may find yourself
sketching on the back of a work order or piece of packing crate.
In any case, it's learning to sketch quickly and effectively that's
important.

   Here are some limbering up exercises wot get you started. To
keep your pencil sharper longer, and for more even lines widths, try
turning your pencil slowly while completing the lines in the exercises
below.

   Next, try sketching the objects on this page. Make your sketches as
much like the examples as possible.

   Remember; sketching means freehand drawing. No Straightedges,
compass, coins, etc!

                                                                         Technical Sketching | 39
Lettering

Now that you are warmed up, we will take the straight and curved
lines from the sketching exercise and use them to form letters. The
entire alphabet can be formed from the straight and curved lines you
have practiced.

   Look at the lettering below. If your printing is similar, and is easily
readable, you can skip this exercise and go on to oblique sketching. If
not, do some practicing. Some of the work ahead (and tests) require
good lettering.

   Remember, the most important requirement of good lettering is

40 | Technical Sketching
legibility. There is no use making a drawing if the person looking at
drawing cannot read your writing.

Oblique Sketching

Oblique sketches are a type of pictorial having one plane parallel
to the drawing surface, and the visible side sketched at an angle.
Usually, that angle works best at 30 to 45, or somewhat in between.
Beginners often have trouble keeping the 30 or 45 lines as the same
angle. If that happens, your sketch will look distorted.

                                                                          Technical Sketching | 41
   Here's how to sketch an oblique cube in three steps:

Possibly you might want to show the left side of the cube, or perhaps
draw the hidden lines, as at the right;

42 | Technical Sketching
In the spaces below, sketch oblique cubes as indicated.
   Sketch these objects in oblique, as shown:

                                                                         Technical Sketching | 43
44 | Technical Sketching
In this more difficult exercise, you are to make oblique sketches of
the objects shown. The third problem is drawn in isometric. You are

                                                                         Technical Sketching | 45
to sketch it in oblique. Convert problem four from orthographic to an
oblique sketch.

Isometric Sketching

Isometric sketches, unlike oblique, must maintain an angle very close
to 30.
46 | Technical Sketching
   Therefore, to get the "feel" of an isometric, try sketching 30 angles
in this exercise:

Sketching in isometric can be done in different ways. Generally, it's
recommended that you start and the bottom of the object and "box it
in", thereby enclosing it within a rectangular framework. For example,
if we were to take a simple object like this,

The steps needed to sketch it in isometric would be;
                                                                         Technical Sketching | 47
The unnecessary lines are then removed, leaving the object. Once
you gain some practice at this, it will be possible for you to make an
ISO drawing without the "guide" lines. It is important to use them
early on the help train your brain.

   To the beginner, building a "frame" before sketching the object
often seems unnecessary. That may be true with simple objects.
However, when things become more complex, a frame gives you a
means of developing the various parts in an organized way. Without
such guidelines you can easily "lose" your sketch.

   Sketch the examples given, using guidelines as shown in the first
exercise. Draw the guidelines lightly. Notice that 3 and 5 require
the use of non-isometric lines. Since those lines are not at 30, it is
best to connect the end points of those lines after the sketch nears
completion.

48 | Technical Sketching
Technical Sketching | 49
Circles and arcs, when sketched in isometric, become elliptical in
shape. If a circle is used, it will appear distorted, as in this example:

50 | Technical Sketching
   In sketching isometric circles and arcs, there are three positions
in which they are normally sketched, depending upon the surface
where the circular feature is located. Those surfaces, or picture
planes are:

   On the cube shapes below sketch ellipses as on the examples
above.

                                                                          Technical Sketching | 51
You may also want to practice sketching ellipses on the other
surfaces of the cubes.

52 | Technical Sketching
Orthographic Sketching

Of all the methods of making drawings, orthographic projection is the
most commonly used by draftsperson. Although the other methods
serve their purposes, they cannot always show the parts of an object
as well as orthographic representation.

   Orthographic projection is a system of projecting from view to view
to graphically describe the object. As a way of reviewing, study the

                                                                         Technical Sketching | 53
views of the small garage in this drawing. Notice the location and
relationship of each view to the other views.

The important thing to remember in orthographic sketching is the
alignment of views. The top view is projected directly above the front
view. The front and side view also line up with each other. The height,
width, and length of the object must remain the same from view to
view. There should be enough distance between the views to prevent
crowding; and to leave room for dimensions.

   Produce a top view in the drawing below.
54 | Technical Sketching
   Sketch each object in orthographic in the spaces on the right.
Remember, the idea is to project! Front, top and right side view.

                                                                         Technical Sketching | 55
56 | Technical Sketching
"On-THE-SPOT" Sketching

Now that you have learned the three different methods of sketching,
it is time to make sketches you can place in front of you and touch,
rather that sketching from drawings on paper.

   Sketching "ON-THE-SPOT" is a standard industry practice. A piece

                                                                         Technical Sketching | 57
of machinery needs to be changed, a support needs to be added, or
pictorial information in some way requires a sketch.

   Instructor will give you an object to sketch...
   You will need to produce an isometric of the object and also an
orthographic drawing with as many views as required to show details
of object to be built.

The ability to make accurate measurements is a basic skill needed by
everyone who reads and uses blueprints. This section is intended as
a review of the fundamental principles of measurement. Since some
students have had little need to measure accurately, these exercises
will provide the practice they need. Others, who have had more
experience, may find these exercises a worthwhile review.

   Whether or not you need to review these fundamentals, there is
one important thing to remember about getting measurements from
a print. If you need a dimension that is unclear or is not given, do
not measure the print! Since prints shrink, stretch, and may not be
drawn to scale, you can easily come up with some very inaccurate
dimensions.

Scale Measurement

A drawing of an object may be the same size as the object (full
size), or it may be larger or smaller than the object. In mo.st cases,
if it is not drawn full size, the drawing is made smaller than the
object. This is done primarily for the convenience of the users of the
drawings. After all, who wants to carry around a full size drawing of

                                                                                           Scaling | 59
a locomotive? Obviously, with an object as small as a wristwatch, it
would be necessary to draw to a larger scale.

   A machine part, for example, may be half the size (1/2"=1"); a
building may be drawn 1/48 size (1/4"=1'-0"); a map may be drawn 1/
200 size (1"=100'-0"); and a gear in that wristwatch may be ten-times
size (10"=1").

   There are numerous scales for different needs. Since each
occupational group has their own frequently used scales, some
practice or basics review will help you to work with the scales used in
your technology.

Full Scale

Full scale is simply letting one inch on a ruler, steel rule, or
draftsman's scale equal one inch on the actual object. Rules of this
kind are usually divided into 1 /16" or 1 /32" units. The first
measurement exercise will be with full size. If you can measure
accurately in full scale, you may want to skip ahead.

   Here is a "big Inch". Each space equals 1/32". If you have not worked
with accurate measurement, spend some time studying it.

Measurement practice: on the scale above, locate the following
fractions:

60 | Scaling
Directions:
   Each of the fractions below is numbered. Write that number above

the scale and point with an arrow where the fraction is located.
Number 1 has been completed.

                                                                                            Scaling | 61
Half Size

The principle of half size measurements on a drawing is simply letting
a unit, such as 1/2" on the scale, represent a larger unit such as 1" on
the drawing. If the drawing is properly labeled, the words HALF SIZE
or 1/2= 1 will appear in the title block.

   Using the half-size scale is not difficult, but it does take some
practice. To measure a distance of 2-3/16" you look first for the
2, then go backwards to the zero and count off another 3/16. You
measure this way for each dimension that has a fraction. Whole
numbers (numbers without fractions) are measured in the usual way.

Next, locate a half size scale (available in the lab) and measure the
lines below to the nearest 1 /32 of an inch. Write the length of the
line in the space provided.

62 | Scaling
Because paper is dimensionally unstable due to humidity, exact
answers to this half size measurement practice cannot be given. That
is another reminder that it's poor practice to measure from a piece of
paper.

   Quarter Size
   Quarter size is used and read in a similar way to half size except
that each unit, such as a quarter of an inch, represents a larger
unit, such as one inch. If the drawing is properly labeled the words
QUARTER SIZE, QUARTER.SCALE, or 1/4 = 1 will appear in the title
block.
   The quarter size scale is used in a similar manner as the half size
scale.
   For quarter size practice, draw lines in the area provided to the
required length. Have another student or the lab instructor check
your lines for accuracy. (A "=1" scale is available in the lab.)

                                                                                           Scaling | 63

6. Dimensioning

   Numerals
   Dimensions
   Extension Lines
   Arrowheads
   Dimension Figures
   Isometric Dimensioning
   Orthographic Dimensioning

If a drawing is to be complete, so that the object represented by the
drawing can be made as intended by the designer, it must tell two
complete stories. It tells this with views, which describe the shape
of the object, and with dimensions and notes, which gives sizes and
other information needed to make the object.

   Therefore, your next step is to learn the basics of dimensioning.
In that way you will understand not only how to interpret a drawing
to get the information you need, but also how to dimension your
sketches so that they can be used to communicate size information
to others.

Numerals

It may seem a bit basic, but a few exercises with the shapes of
numbers comes before dimensioning. The reason for such review is
simply that incorrectly or carelessly made numbers on a drawing or
sketch can easily be misinterpreted by someone on the job. That can
be costly.

   Therefore, the study of numbers forms is justified.
   The number forms presented here have been determined to be the

                                                                                  Dimensioning | 65
most legible, and are used by industry nationwide. The United States
standardized 1/8" vertical numbers are correctly formed as follows:

Dimension Lines

The dimension line is a fine, dark, solid line with arrowheads on each
end. It indicates direction and extent of a dimension. In machine
sketches and drawings, in which fractions and decimals are used for
dimensions, the dimension line is usually broken near the middle to
provide open space for the dimension numerals. In architectural and
structural sketches and drawings, the numerals are usually above an
unbroken dimension line.

In either case, the dimension line which is closest to the object
should be placed approximately

   1/2 away. The other dimensions beyond the first dimension (if
66 | Dimensioning
any) should be approximately 3/8 apart. You do not necessarily
have to remember this, but you should remember not to crowd your
dimension lines and to keep them a uniform distance apart.

   The most important thing is that the drawing needs to be "clean"
and dimensions need to be located in a space where they cannot be
confused with a surface they are not intended to be used for.

   Here is how dimension lines should be sketched:

Note: Dimensions less than six feet (72 in.) are given in inches.
Dimensions over six feet are usually shown in feet and inches. Be
sure that it is clear how dimensions are called out. When calling out
dimensions that are over 12", make sure ALL of dimensions are called
out in total inches or feet inches throughout the entire drawing.
Either 4'-5" or 53", they both mean the same thing but if there is a mix
of dimensioning it can become easy to look at 4'-8" and see 48".

                                                                                  Dimensioning | 67
Extension Lines

Extension lines on a drawing are fine, dark, solid lines that extend
outward from a point on a drawing to which a dimension refers.
Usually, the dimension line meets the extension line at right angles.
There should be a gap of about 1 / 16 where the extension line
would meet the outline of the object, and the extension line should
go beyond the outermost arrowhead approximately 1 /8. Also, there
should be not gaps where extension lines cross. Notice in this
example the larger dimensions are correctly placed outside, or
beyond the shorter dimensions, and that the dimensions are
preferably not drawn on the object itself. Sometimes, however, it is
necessary to dimension on the object.

   It is important to remember to place dimensions on the views,
68 | Dimensioning
in a two or three view drawing, where they will be the most easily
understood. Avoid dimensioning to a hidden line and avoid the
duplication of dimensions. Use common sense; keep dimensions as
clear and simple as possible. Remember, the person reading your
drawing needs to clearly understand, beyond question, how to
proceed. Otherwise, costly time and material will be wasted.

   There are two basic methods of placing dimensions on a sketch.
They may be placed so they read from the bottom of the sketch
(unidirectional dimensions) or from the bottom and right side
(aligned dimensions). The unidirectional system is usually best,
because it is more easily read by workmen.

   When dimensions will not fit in a space in the usual way, other
methods are used to dimension clearly, when those crowded
conditions exist.

                                                                                  Dimensioning | 69
   Arrowheads
   Arrowheads are placed at each end of dimension lines, on leader
lines, etc. Correctly made, arrows are about 1/8" to 3/16" in length,
and are about three times as long as they are wide. Usually they have
a slight barb, much like a fishhook.
   To make your drawing look clean, use the same style throughout
your drawing or sketch.

Dimension numerals

Numerals used to dimension an object are normally about 1/8" in
height.

70 | Dimensioning
When a dimension includes a fraction, the fraction is approximately 1
/ 4 in height, making the fractional numbers slightly smaller to allow
for space above and below the fractional line.

Again, it is particularly important that the numbers and fractions you
may put on a sketch or drawing be legible. Sloppy numbers can cause
expensive mistakes.

Notes

Notes are used on drawings to provide supplementary information.
They should be brief and carefully worded to avoid being
misinterpreted, and located on the sketch in an uncrowded area. The
leader lines going to the note should be kept short. Notes are usually
added after a sketch has been dimensioned to avoid interference with
dimensions.

                                                                                   Dimensioning | 71

   Dimension this object. Use a ruler or scale to determine the line

Oblique Dimensioning

Oblique dimensioning is mostly remembering to avoid dimensioning
on the object itself (when possible) and the use of common sense
74 | Dimensioning
dimensioning principles. It is also usually best to have dimensions
read from the bottom (unidirectional) as shown here.

Although it is best not to dimension on the view itself, its usually
accepted practice to place diameter and radius dimension on the
views if space permits.

   Sometime space and time is limited and you might have to bend the
typical rules of drawing and dimensioning. The most important thing
is to keep the drawing clean, concise, try to not a repeat dimensions
but give all required ones.

   Directions: Complete as indicated.

76 | Dimensioning
Isometric Dimensioning

When dimensioning an isometric sketch, it is important to keep
dimensions away from the object itself, and to place the dimension on
the same plane as the surface of the object being dimensioned. You
will probably find that to dimension well in isometric will take some
practice.

                                                                                  Dimensioning | 77
Place notes on an isometric drawing without regard to placing them
on the same plane, as with dimensions. It is easier to do, and easier to
read.

78 | Dimensioning
   Isometric notes do not have to be on the same plane.

   Notice in the example above that part of each leader line to the
notes are sketched at an approximate angle of 15, 30, 45, 60 or 75
degrees. This is done to avoid confusion with other lines. Never draw
leader lines entirely horizontal or vertical.

                                                                                  Dimensioning | 79

   Quiz
   Directions: You will be given an object to sketch and dimension.

Orthographic Dimensioning

When you look at the dovetailed object several pages back, it is
easy to see that an isometric sketch can quickly become cluttered
with dimensions. Because of this, more complicated sketches and
drawings are dimensional in orthographic. This method provides the
best way to dimension clearly and in detail.

   Here are seven general rules to follow when dimensioning.

82 | Dimensioning
 Show enough dimensions so that the intended sizes can be
   determined without having a workman calculate or assume any
   distances.

 State each dimension clearly, so it is understood in only one
   way.

 Show dimensions between points, lines or surfaces which have a
   necessary relationship to each other or which control the
   location of other components or mating parts.

 Select or arrange dimensions to avoid accumulations of
   dimensions that may cause unsatisfactory mating of parts. (In
   other words, provide for a buildup of tolerances, as in the
   example below.

 Show each dimension only once. (Do not duplicate dimensions).
 Where possible, dimension each feature in the view where it

   appears most clearly, and where its true shape appears.
 Whenever possible, specify dimensions to make use of readily

   available materials, parts and tools.

                                                                               Dimensioning | 83

7. Auxiliary Views

   FRONT VIEW AUXILIARIES
   TOP VIEW AUXILIARIES
   SIDE VIEW AUXILIARIES
   SKETCHING AUXILIARY VIEWS

When an object has a slanted or inclined surface, it usually is not
possible to show the inclined surface in an orthographic drawing
without distortion. To present a more accurate description of any
inclined surface, an additional view, known as an auxiliary view, is
usually required.

   An auxiliary view is simply a "helper" view, which shows the slanted
part of the object as it actually is. It turns, or projects, the. object so
that the true size and shape of the surf ace (or surfaces) are seen as
they actually are.

   Auxiliary views are commonly found on many types of industrial
drawings.

Front View Auxiliaries

There are three basic type of auxiliary views. In the first type, the
auxiliary view is projected from the front view of a three view
(orthographic) drawing. In the second and third types of drawings,
the auxiliary views are projected from the top and side views.

   Here is a front view auxiliary of a simple object with an inclined
surface.

                                                                                Auxiliary Views | 87
   Notice that the projection lines are perpendicular to the slanted
surface of the first view, and that only the slanted surface of the
object is shown in the auxiliary view.  The rest of the object is
omitted, however, for clarification portions of the adjacent surfaces
are sometimes shown. Also, notice that the slanted surfaces of the
top and side views are shortened because of distortion, whereas the
surface of the auxiliary view is true, or actual size.

   To sketch an auxiliary view, you begin with orthographic. views of
the object and add projection lines perpendicular (90) to the slanted
surface, adding a reference line any convenient distance from the
view with the slanted surface.

88 | Auxiliary Views
   Next, the distance CB on the auxiliary view is made the same length
as the related distance in one of the orthographic views; in this
example it's the side view. This completes the auxiliary view.

                                                                                Auxiliary Views | 89
Top View Auxiliaries

A top view auxiliary is developed in the same way as a front view
auxiliary, except that the auxiliary is projected from the top view.

   Whether the auxiliary view is to be projected from the front, top,
or side view depends on the position of the object, or which surface
of the object is slanted. In this example, the top view is slanted.
Therefore the auxiliary view must be projected from the top view.

   Again, notice how the angled surfaces shown in the front and side
views are not shown in true length.

90 | Auxiliary Views
Side View Auxiliary

Side view auxiliaries are drawn in the same way as front and top view
auxiliaries. Again, where the auxiliary view is to be projected depends
upon the position of the object or which surface of the object is
slanted.

Obviously, these are very basic auxiliary view examples and are
presented to introduce you to the concept of auxiliary views.

   As objects with inclined surfaces become more complex, auxiliary
views provide a means of presenting objects in their true size and
shape.

                                                                                Auxiliary Views | 91

The following problems require and auxiliary view to be complete.
Sketch the auxiliary views required in the spaces provided.

Drawing practice 2
   In this problem, a round hole is centered on the slanted surface and

drilled through the object. The hole appears elliptical in the. front and

view with the slanted surface. Complete the auxiliary view.

   SECTION LINING
   FULL SECTIONS
   HALF SECTIONS
   BROKEN OUT SECTIONS
   REVOLVFD SECTIONS
   OFFSET SECTIONS
   REMOVED SECTIONS

You have learned that when making a multiview sketch, hidden edges
and surfaces are usually shown with hidden (dash) lines.

   When an object becomes more complex, as in the case of an
automobile engine block, a clearer presentation of the interior can be
made by sketching the object as it would look if it were cut apart. In
that way, the many hidden lines on the sketch are eliminated.

   The process of sketching the internal configuration of an object
by showing it cut apart is known as sectioning. Sectioning is used
frequently on a wide variety of Industrial drawings.

   In this example, blocks A and B result after the block in figure 1 has
been "Sectioned". When you cut an apple in half you have sectioned
it. Just as an apple can be sectioned any way you choose, so can an
object in a sectional view of a drawing or sketch.

96 | Sectional Views
Sectional Views | 97
Cutting Plane
A surface cut by the saw in the drawing above is a cutting plane.
Actually, it is an imaginary cutting plane taken through the
object, since the object is imagined as being cut through at a
desired location.
Cutting Plane Line
A cutting plane is represented on a drawing by a cutting plane
line. This is a heavy long-short-short-long kind of line
terminated with arrows. The arrows in show the direction of
view.

   Once again, here is an graphic example of a cutting plane line and
the section that develops from it.

98 | Sectional Views
Section Lining

The lines in the figure above, which look like saw marks, are called
section lining. They are found on most sectional views, and indicate
the surface which has been exposed by the cutting plane. Notice that
the square hole in the object has no section lining, since it was not
changed by sectioning.

   Different kinds of section lining is used to identify different
materials. When an object is made of a combination of materials,
a variety of section lining symbols makes materials identification
easier. Here are a few examples:

                                                                               Sectional Views | 99
   Section lines are very light. When sketching an object or part that
requires a sectional view, they are drawn by eye at an angle of
approximately 45 degrees, and are spaced about 1/8" apart. Since
they are used to set off a section, they must be drawn with care.

   It is best to use the symbol for the material being shown as a
section on a sketch. If that symbol is not known, you may use the
general purpose symbol, which is also the symbol for cast iron.

Full Sections

When a cutting plane line passes entirely through an object, the
resulting section is called a full section Fig. 7 illustrates a full section.

100 | Sectional Views
   It is possible to section an object whenever a closer look
intentionally is desired. Here is an object sectioned from two
different directions.

Half Sections

If the cutting plane is passed halfway through an object, and one-
quarter of the object is removed, the resulting section is a half
section. A half section has the advantage of showing both inside and
outside configurations.

   It is frequently used for symmetrical objects. Hidden lines are
usually not shown on the un-sectioned half unless they are needed
for clearness or for dimensioning purposes. As in all sectional
drawings, the cutting plane take precedence over the center line.

                                                                               Sectional Views | 101
   Here is another example of a half section. Remember that only one
fourth of the object is removed with a half section, whereas half of
the object is generally removed with a full section.

Broken Out Sections

In many cases only a small part of a view needs to be sectioned in
order to show some internal detail. In the figure below, the broken
out section is removed by a freehand break line. A cutting plane line
does not need to be shown, since the location of the cut is obvious.

                                                                              Sectional Views | 105
Revolved Sections

A revolved section shows the shape of an object by rotating a section
90 degrees to face the viewer. The three revolved sections illustrated
in the spear-like object of figure 12 show the changes that take place
in its shape.

106 | Sectional Views
Offset Sections

An offset section is a means of including in a single section several
features of an object that are not in a straight line. To do this, the
cutting plane line is bent, or "OFFSET" to pass through the features
of the part.

Removed Sections

A section removed from its normal projected position in the standard
                                                                              Sectional Views | 107
arrangement of views is called a "removed" section. Such sections are
labeled SECTION A-A, SECTION B-B, etc., corresponding to the letter
designation at the ends of the cutting plane line. Removed sections
may be partial sections and are often drawn to a different scale.
