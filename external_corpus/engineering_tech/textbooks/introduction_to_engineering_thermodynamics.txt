which research outputs (including peer-reviewed academic journal
articles, theses, book chapters, and monographs) are made freely
available to the general public for viewing, and often for reuse.

   We are always committed to make our OER (open educational
resources) more accessible to a wide range of users. This book
follows the guidelines from OER Accessibility Toolkit published on
Open UBC. The following checklist provides the accessibility
features of this book.

Organizing     Contents is organized under headings and
Content           subheadings

               Headings and subheadings are used sequentially

Images         Images that convey information include
                  Alternative Text (alt-text) descriptions of the
                  image's content or function.

               Graphs and Charts include contextual or
                  supporting details in the text surrounding the
                  image.

               Images do not rely on colour to convey
                  information.

               Images that are purely decorative contain empty
                  alternative text descriptions.

Tables          Tables include row and column headers.
                Table includes title or caption.
                Tables in the main body of the book do not have

                    merged or split cells.
                Table has adequate cell padding.

              Notes on "tables with merged cells"

                Some thermodynamic tables in the Appendices
                    have merged cells. It is difficult to change the
                    layout because of the nature of the tables.

              Accessibility Statement | xv
Weblinks     The weblink is meaningful in context, does not
                 use generic text such as "click here" or "read
                 more".

           Notes on "weblinks open new tabs"

             Most examples in this book require reading data
                 from the thermodynamic tables in the
                 Appendices. Hyperlinks are created for the
                 thermodynamics tables. They are set to open in
                 new tabs intentionally because in this way
                 students can easily extract thermodynamic data
                 without loosing track of the example solution.

             Most images in the webbook are associated with
                 their source images, which usually have a higher
                 resolution. When clicking on the images in the
                 webbook, their source images will open in new
                 tabs. This setting is intentional because it is
                 easier for students to follow the flow of the
                 content while referring to the source images (if
                 needed) without interruptions.

Formulas    Equations are created using LaTeX and are
Font Size      rendered using MathJax. All equations can be
               displayed as high-resolution, accessible equation
               in pop-up windows.

            To trigger such display, right-click any equation
               in the book, then select "Math Settings", "Zoom
               Trigger", and then "Hover". Users only need to set
               this setting once, and all equations in the book
               will show in pop-up windows when a reader
               hovers a mouse over the equation in the
               webbook.

            Font size is 12 point or higher for body text.
            Font size is 9 point for footnotes or end notes.
            Font size can be zoomed to 200%.

Preface

This book aims to help students develop a fundamental
understanding of classical thermodynamics and its engineering
applications. It features concise explanations of key concepts, step-
by-step engineering examples, and interactive practice problems at
the end of each section.

   The book consists of seven chapters. It is suitable for a one-
term, introductory engineering thermodynamics course at the

1.1 What is thermodynamics

about?

You probably have this experience; when you rub your hands quickly
for a few minutes, your hands will start to feel warmer. How is this
common phenomenon related to thermodynamics? Well, when you
rub your hands quickly, your muscles do work. This work is then
converted to heat; therefore, you feel warmer. Heat and work are
two forms of energy. Work can be converted to heat, as seen in this
daily example. However, can heat be converted to work? Can we use
heat to produce work?

   Heat engine is a device that produces work continuously by
absorbing heat from a high-temperature heat source and rejecting
the waste heat to a low-temperature heat sink. Since the 17th
century, various heat engines were invented in an attempt to
harness work from heat. Figure 1.1.1 illustrates Watt's engine
invented by Scottish engineer James Watt in the late 18th century.
Watt's engine is one of the most successful early heat engines.
Its main components are a boiler (not shown in the figure) and a
condenser, each connecting to a piston-cylinder device. The two
valves, V and V', control the flow of steam into and out of the
cylinder. When valve V opens, valve V' remains closed. Steam from
the boiler enters the cylinder, pushing the piston up until it reaches
the top of the cylinder. Then valve V' opens, and valve V closes. The
steam in the cylinder escapes to the condenser and is condensed,
creating a vacuum in the cylinder. Consequently, the piston moves
downward under atmospheric pressure. The reciprocating motion
of the piston drives the pivoting beam DEF, which then powers the
pump chained to the beam. Watt's engine demonstrates how heat
is converted to work. This conversion relies on the phase change of
a working fluid, e.g., water, in the Watt's engine. The boiler in the

10 | What is thermodynamics?
Watt's engine is the heat source, where the hot steam is generated;
and the condenser is the heat sink, where the hot steam is cooled
and condensed to liquid water. All heat engines need a working fluid
circulating in a specially-arranged set of equipment, which operates
between a high-temperature heat source and a low-temperature
heat sink. Figure 1.1.2 is a schematic drawing of a heat engine. The
yellow circle represents the heat engine consisting of a set of
equipment.

          Figure 1.1.2 Schematic drawing of a heat engine

By examining Figure 1.1.2, you might notice that a certain amount of
heat is not converted to work. It is true that not all of the heat from a
heat source can be converted to useful work! Heat engines and their
underlying principles are governed by the two fundamental laws of
thermodynamics, the first and second laws of thermodynamics. We
will briefly introduce the two laws here and will provide detailed
explanations in Chapters 4-6.

   The first law of thermodynamics is about energy conservation.
      Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only be
      converted between different forms.

   The second law of thermodynamics explains why all real
      processes are irreversible, and how the irreversibility of a
      process is quantified with the concept of entropy generation. In
      reality, all processes always occur in the direction of producing

12 | What is thermodynamics?
      positive entropy generation due to the existence of
      irreversibilities. From the second law of thermodynamics, we
      can estimate the theoretical limit of efficiency that a real
      thermodynamic process or system can possibly achieve.
Thermodynamics emerged in the early 19th century with the
inventions of heat engines. It originally focused on the scientific
theories of heat-work conversion, and the operations and efficiency
improvement of heat engines. Nowadays, the applications of
thermodynamics have extended to all fields related to energy
conversion and conservation. In engineering fields, the principles of
thermodynamics are widely used in the design of thermal systems,
such as power plants using different energy sources (e.g., steam,
gas, nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar), air conditioning and
refrigeration systems, jet engines, biomedical devices, and chemical
processes, to name but a few. Figure 1.1.3 is a schematic drawing
of a nuclear power plant, whose performance and efficiency are
governed by the fundamental principles of thermodynamics.

14 | What is thermodynamics?
1.2 System and surroundings

In thermodynamics, a system refers to a selected quantity of matter
in the case of closed systems or a selected region in space in the
case of open systems, see Figure 1.2.1. The rest of the universe
outside the system is called surroundings, and the surface that
separates the system and its surroundings is called boundary. A
boundary may be fixed or movable, real or imaginary, rigid or
flexible.

          Figure 1.2.1 System and surroundings

A system interacts with its surroundings through two mechanisms:
 1. Mass transfer
2. Energy transfer (i.e., in the form of heat and work)

A system of a fixed mass is a closed system, which can only interact
                                                            1.2 System and surroundings | 15
with its surroundings through energy transfer. Mass cannot cross
the boundary of a closed system. For example, a sealed bottle of
soft drink, Figure 1.2.2, can be modelled as a closed system because
there is a fixed amount of liquid in the bottle. When you take the
bottle out of your cooler, the liquid will warm up slowly due to
the temperature difference between the bottle and the ambient
air (surroundings). In other words, the system (the liquid in the
bottle) interacts with its surroundings (the ambient air) through
energy transfer (in the form of heat transfer). Figure 1.2.3 illustrates
a piston-cylinder device, which can also be modelled as a closed
system. The amount of the fluid in the cylinder (the system) remains
constant as the piston moves. Only the transfer of energy, in the
form of heat and work, may happen across the system boundary
consisting of the cylinder walls and the lower surface of the piston.

Figure 1.2.2 A sealed bottle of soft drink as an example of closed systems

                         Figure 1.2.3 Piston cylinder device as an
                         example of closed systems

An open system, also called control volume, is a selected region
in space. An open system always exchanges mass with its
surroundings. It may exchange energy with its surroundings in the
form of heat and work, but energy transfer is not a necessary
condition for a system to be an open system. In other words, an
open system doesn't have to exchange heat or work with its
surroundings at all. Figure 1.2.4 illustrates an open system, which
typically encloses a device that involves mass flow through its inlet
and outlet. Figure 1.2.5 illustrates the outdoor condensing unit of an
air conditioner. It may be treated as an open system because the
coolant can enter and leave the condensing unit (the system) via its
connecting coolant lines.

                                                            1.2 System and surroundings | 17

         an example of open systems
18 | 1.2 System and surroundings
If a system doesn't allow the exchange of mass and energy with its
surroundings, it is called an isolated system. An isolated system is
an idealized, hypothetical system. In reality, no device is absolutely
isolated.

1.3 Extensive and intensive
properties

From the macroscopic perspective, a system is viewed as a
continuous, homogeneous matter called continuum, which consists
of a huge number of interacting molecules distributed throughout
the system. The interactions between the molecules are so frequent
that the physical or bulk properties of the system do NOT depend
on the behaviour of individual molecules. This hypothesis is valid
in a wide range of engineering applications. It allows the physical
properties of a system, such as pressure, density, and temperature,
to be defined as a continuous function at any point of the system.

   The following thermodynamic properties are typically used to
describe the interactions between a system and its surroundings:

   mass
   pressure
   temperature
   volume and specific volume
   internal energy and specific internal energy
   enthalpy and specific enthalpy
   entropy and specific entropy

These properties can be classified into two categories based on
their dependence on the mass of a system. More detailed
explanations of their physical meanings can be found in Chapter 2.

   Extensive properties depend on the mass of a system.
      Properties, such as mass , volume , internal energy
      , enthalpy , and entropy are extensive properties. Their
      values change accordingly as the mass of a system changes.

                                                                     1.3 Extensive and intensive
                                                                                     properties | 21
   Intensive properties are independent of the mass of a system.
      Pressure , temperature , specific volume , specific
      internal energy , specific enthalpy , and specific entropy
      are intensive properties.

Let us consider a container of air at 101 kPa and 20oC. If the
container is divided into two compartments and all other conditions
remain unchanged, see Figure 1.3.1, the air in each compartment
is still at 101 kPa and 20oC. The pressure and temperature of the
air are not affected by the changing mass in each compartment;
therefore, pressure and temperature are intensive properties.
On the other hand, the mass and volume of the air in each of
the compartments are different from the original values in the
container. Both of them depend on the mass of the system;
therefore, mass and volume are extensive properties.

All specific properties are intensive properties, as they refer to

the corresponding extensive properties per unit mass, e.g., specific

volume  and specific internal energy             .

1.4 State, process, and cycle

If a system is isolated from its surroundings or is free from any
unbalanced potentials, such as forced flows of mass or energy, the
system will eventually reach a uniform condition called equilibrium.
A system in equilibrium has uniform properties throughout the
system. The following equilibrium conditions are commonly
considered in thermodynamics.

   A system that features spatially-uniform temperature is
      in thermal equilibrium.

   A system free from chemical reactions is in chemical
      equilibrium.

   If there is no tendency for a system to change its pressure over
      time, the system is in mechanical equilibrium.

   For a system consisting of a mixture of multiple phases, such as
      liquid water and water vapour, if the composition of the mixture
      remains constant over time, the system is in phase equilibrium.

State refers to the condition of a system, which may be described
by a unique set of properties, such as pressure, temperature, and
specific volume. The state of a system in equilibrium is called
equilibrium state. A system may change from one state to another
state through a process. Let us consider a container of water
initially at 10oC and 101 kPa, as an example. We set the water in the
container as the system. The water is heated until its temperature
reaches 50oC, while its pressure is kept constant 101 kPa. We may
say that the water undergoes a constant-pressure, heating process
with an initial state of 10oC and 101 kPa and a final state of 50oC and
101 kPa.

Typically, there are many possible paths that a system may take

24 | 1.4 State, process, and cycle
between two states; therefore, the exact path of a process is
extremely important and must be clearly specified in order to
describe a process! Here are the definitions of some common
processes.

   Isobaric process: the pressure remains constant in a process.
   Isochoric process: the specific volume remains constant in a

      process.
   Isothermal process: the temperature remains constant in a

      process.
   Adiabatic process: no heat transfer occurs between a system

      and its surroundings in a process.
   Isentropic process: the entropy remains constant in a process.
Figure 1.4.1 shows a compression process as the piston moves from
the right to the left. States 1 and 2 represent the initial and final
states. Each point along the process path represents an equilibrium
state. If all states in a process are equilibrium states, the process
is called quasi-equilibrium process. In this book, we will deal with
systems in equilibrium; therefore, all states thereafter refer to
equilibrium states, and all processes refer to quasi-equilibrium
processes.

                                                             1.4 State, process, and cycle | 25
Figure 1.4.1 Schematic of a process. States 1 and 2 represent
the initial and final states; each point along the process path
represents an equilibrium state.

If a system undergoes a series of processes and finally returns

to its initial state, we say that the system completes a cycle.

Thermodynamic cycles are the basis for the operation of thermal

equipment. For example, the vapour-compression refrigeration

cycle is often used in conventional refrigerators and air

conditioners, as shown in Figure 1.4.2. The cycle consists of four

main devices: compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and

evaporator. A working fluid called refrigerant circulates through

these devices connected by tubes. The refrigerant in the cycle

experiences phase changes between vapour and liquid, as shown in

Figure 1.4.3. Phase diagrams (see details in Chapter 2) are commonly

used to analyze a process or a cycle. Figure 1.4.4 illustrates the

temperature-specific entropy,       , diagram for the vapour-

compression refrigeration cycle, where the numbered dots

represent different states and the lines with arrows represent

different processes in this cycle. For example, the number "1" in

26 | 1.4 State, process, and cycle
Figure 1.4.3 and Figure 1.4.4 refers to the state of the refrigerant at
the inlet of the compressor or the exit of the evaporator. The line 1-2
in Figure 1.4.4 refers to the compression process in the compressor.

Otto cycle is another thermodynamic cycle. It is an ideal cycle that
modells the operation of internal combustion engines. Figure 1.4.5
shows the cycle consisting of four strokes. The pressure-volume
diagram, Figure 1.4.6, illustrates different processes in this cycle.

       1. Intake stroke, line 0-1 in Figure 1.4.6. During the intake
            stroke, the inlet valve opens and the outlet valve remains
            closed. Air is drawn into the cylinder as the piston moves to
            the bottom dead center (BDC).

       2. Compression stroke, line 1-2 in Figure 1.4.6. During the
            compression stroke, both valves remain closed. The air is
            compressed as the piston moves from BDC to the top dead
            center (TDC).

            this stroke, both valves remain closed. The piston is at TDC
            momentarily while the fuel-air mixture is ignited by the
            spark. The burning of the fuel-air mixture generates a large
            force, pushing the piston from TDC to BDC.

            exhaust stroke, the outlet valve opens and the inlet valve
            remains closed. The piston remains at BDC momentarily,
            allowing a certain amount of heat to release to the
            surroundings. Then the piston moves from BDC towards
            TDC to reject the exhaust and more heat to the
            surroundings.

1.5 Chapter review

Thermodynamics has a wide range of applications in many
engineering fields, in particular, the fields related to energy
conversion and conservation. In this chapter, we have introduced
some fundamental concepts and definitions used in the study of
engineering thermodynamics.

   An important skill that students need to develop, when
performing thermodynamic analysis on devices, is to identify the
system, its surroundings, and their interactions. There are three
types of systems: closed system, open system, and isolated system,
defined in terms of their ability to transfer mass and energy with
the surroundings.

   In this book, we consider systems in equilibrium. Each equilibrium
state possesses a unique set of thermodynamic properties, which
can be classified as extensive and intensive properties. When a
system undergoes a process from one equilibrium state to another
equilibrium state, its thermodynamic properties will change
accordingly. The process path must be clearly specified when
describing a process. Students need to understand the definitions
of the common processes, including isobaric, isothermal, isochoric,
adiabatic, and isentropic processes.

An equilibrium state in a process has a unique set of thermodynamic
properties. In this chapter, we will introduce common
thermodynamic properties, phase diagrams, and thermodynamic
tables. Through examples, we will demonstrate how to use
thermodynamic tables to determine thermodynamic properties of a
pure substance at a given state. The International Systems of Units
(SI units) will be used for all properties and examples.

2.1 Pure substance

A pure substance refers to a matter that has a homogeneous and
definite chemical composition. A pure substance may exist in a
single phase, such as liquid water, ice, and CO2 gas. It can also exist
as a multi-phase mixture, such as a mixture of liquid water and
water vapour in equilibrium.

   Air is a common working fluid used in many thermal devices.
Can air be treated as a pure substance? Although air is a mixture
consisting of roughly 78% of nitrogen, 21% of oxygen, and trace
amounts of other gases and moisture, air is homogeneous and has
distinct properties without phase changes in its composition in
many thermodynamic processes. In such conditions, we can treat
air as a pure substance.

2.2 Thermodynamic
properties

Pure substances are widely used in thermodynamic cycles. For
example, in the vapour-compression refrigeration cycle, Figure
1.4.2, refrigerant R134a is used as the working fluid, which is
circulated through a compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and
evaporator via the connecting tubes.

   In steam power plants, water is used as the working fluid. Figure
2.2.1 shows a coal-fired steam power plant. Purified water flows
vertically up the tube-lined walls of the boiler, where it turns into
steam. Steam flows into the boiler drum (17), separating from any
remaining water, and then flows into the pendant superheater (19),
where its temperature and pressure increase rapidly to around 200
bar and 570캜. The superheated steam is piped to the high-pressure
turbine (11), where both its pressure and temperature are reduced.
The steam is then returned to the boiler reheater (21). After being
reheated, it enters the intermediate-pressure turbine (9) and then
the low-pressure turbine (6). The steam, now just above its boiling
point, is brought into thermal contact with the cold water in the
condenser (8), where it is condensed rapidly back into water. The
water then passes a feed pump (7), a de-aerator (12), a feed heater
(13), and an economizer (23) before being returned to the boiler
drum.

Figure 2.2.1 Steam power plant: water is used as the working fluid.

In both cycles, the working fluids, water and R134a, are pure
substances. Their properties, such as pressure and temperature,
continuously change as they flow through different devices in the
cycles. How are the changes of fluid properties related to the overall
performance of a device, such as the aforementioned steam power
plant and refrigerator? To answer this question, we need to
understand the thermodynamic properties of pure substances at
different states of a process or a cycle.

   The common properties of a pure substance include pressure,
temperature, specific volume, density, specific internal energy,
specific enthalpy, and specific entropy. These properties are
interrelated to each other. Thermodynamic tables or equations of
state are commonly used to determine the thermodynamic
properties of a pure substance. Appendices A-D provide
thermodynamic tables for selected pure substances. The ideal gas
equation of state will be introduced in Chapter 3.

40 | 2.2 Thermodynamic properties
2.2.1 Pressure

Consider a normal force exerted by an object on a surface. Pressure
is defined as the normal force per unit area of the surface.

where

       : force perpendicular to a surface, in kN or N
       : surface contact area, in m2

       : pressure, in kPa or Pa

   In the SI units, force is usually expressed in Newtons, N, or kilo
Newtons, kN, and area in meter squared, m2; therefore, pressure is
expressed in Pascal, 1 Pa = 1 N/m2, or kilo-Pascal, 1 kPa = 1 kN/m2.
Other common SI units include 1 bar =100 kPa, 1 atm =101.325 kPa,
and 1 MPa = 106 Pa =1000 kPa.

Pressure depends on the normal force and the contact area. If you
stand up tall on a flat horizontal surface, the pressure on your feet
is your weight divided by the total contact area of your feet on the
surface. If you lift up one foot, the pressure on your other foot will
double as the contact area is decreased by half.

   Pressure in a fluid acts equally in all directions at a given point
in that fluid; therefore, pressure is a scalar quantity. It is important
to note that although pressure is a scalar quantity, pressure force,

                , is a vector and is always perpendicular to the contact
surface.

   Pressure in a fluid is commonly measured by pressure gauges
(Figure 2.2.2) or U-tube manometers (Figure 2.2.3). Most pressure
gauges are calibrated to show the gauge pressure or vacuum
pressure, which is the difference between the absolute pressure
and the atmospheric pressure.

                                                        2.2 Thermodynamic properties | 41

   Example 1

      Consider a piston-cylinder device containing a gas. The
   mass of the piston is 10 kg. The diameter of the piston is 20
   cm. The atmospheric pressure is 1 atm = 101.325 kPa. What
   is the absolute pressure of the gas in the cylinder assuming
   the piston is in static equilibrium? The friction between the
   piston and the cylinder is negligible.

        Solution
        There are three forces acting on the piston:
          Weight of the piston
          Force due to the atmospheric pressure
          Force due to the gas pressure
        As the piston is in static equilibrium, the resultant force
     on the piston is zero.

        Therefore, the absolute pressure of the gas is

2.2.2 Temperature

Temperature is another measurable thermodynamic property,
which indicates the hotness or coldness of a body. Thermometer
is a common device for temperature measurement. If two bodies
have the same temperature readings on a thermometer, the two
bodies must have the same temperature. In other words, they are
in thermal equilibrium. This seemingly obvious observation is called
the zeroth law of thermodynamics: if two bodies are in thermal
equilibrium with a third, the three bodies must be in thermal
equilibrium with each other. This law establishes the basis for
temperature measurement; it allows us to compare the
temperatures of different bodies, no matter if they are in contact or
not.

   Temperature can be expressed on different temperature scales,
such as Celsius or Kelvin scales in the SI units and Fahrenheit or
Rankine scales in the Imperial units. For example, a room
temperature may be expressed as 20oC or 68 F. All temperature
scales are calibrated based on two easily reproducible
temperatures, such as the freezing and boiling temperatures of
water at the standard atmospheric pressure.

   A temperature expressed in Kelvin in the SI units or in Rankine
in the Imperial units is called absolute temperature. An absolute

                                                        2.2 Thermodynamic properties | 45
temperature of zero indicates the state of the minimum energy
of a matter. Absolute temperature, also called thermodynamic
temperature, is an important property in thermodynamic analyses.
The conversion between the Celsius and Kelvin scales is

2.2.3 Density and specific volume

Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a body. Specific
volume is the reciprocal of density.

where

        : mass, in kg
        : volume, in m3
       : specific volume, in m3/kg
       : density, in kg/m3

   Both temperature and pressure may affect the density and
specific volume of a fluid. The density and specific volume of a
gas are strong functions of both temperature and pressure. For
example, when a gas is compressed, its pressure will increase,
causing the density of the gas to increase and the specific volume
of the gas to decrease. When a gas is heated, its temperature will
increase. Consequently, the density of the gas will decrease and the
specific volume of the gas will increase.

   On the contrary, the density and specific volume of a liquid
depend much more strongly on the temperature than on the

46 | 2.2 Thermodynamic properties
pressure; therefore, it is common to assume that the density and
specific volume of a liquid are functions of temperature only.

     Example 2

        A container consists of two sections separated by a
     membrane. Section A contains 0.5 kg of air. Its volume is
     0.75 m3. Section B contains air of density 0.6 kg/m3. Its
     volume is 0.5 m3. If the membrane is broken, and the air in
     the two sections mixes and reaches a uniform state, what is
     the specific volume of the air at the final state?

        Solution
        The masses and volumes in sections A and B at the initial
     state are

   The two sections reach a uniform state at the final state;
therefore,

   Therefore,

2.2.4 Internal energy and specific internal energy

The essence of the first law of thermodynamics is energy
conservation. We need to understand different forms of energy
in a system. Internal energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy
constitute the total stored energy of a system if the system is free of
magnetic, electric, and surface tension effects.

where

       : total stored energy, in J or kJ
           : kinetic energy, in J or kJ
          : potential energy, in J or kJ

       : internal energy, in J or kJ

   Internal energy is associated with the motions and structure of
48 | 2.2 Thermodynamic properties
the molecules of a system in a microscopic level. A system, no
matter how tiny it is, contains a significantly large number of
molecules in various modes of random motions, such as translation,
rotation, and vibration. Although it is difficult to predict the
behaviour of individual molecules, the statistical average can be
calculated by using statistical theory. From a statistical standpoint,
the internal energy of a system is considered to be the sum of the
kinetic and potential energies of the collection of all molecules in
the system. Maxwell explains the relation between the molecular
velocity (a microscopic quantity) and the temperature (a
macroscopic quantity) of a gas: as the temperature increases, the
gas molecules move faster causing the mean microscopic kinetic
energy of all molecules to increase; therefore, the internal energy
of the system increases. In other words, the internal energy of
a substance is strongly associated with the temperature of the
substance; therefore, internal energy is a form of thermal energy.
For example, the internal energy of 1 kg of water at 500 kPa
increases from about 83.88 kJ to 167.47 kJ when its temperature
increases from 20oC to 40oC. In general, temperature has a
dominant effect on the internal energy of a system although other
factors, such as pressure, phase, and chemical composition may also
have an effect on the internal energy of a system.

   From a macroscopic standpoint, a thermodynamic system, as a
whole, has both kinetic and potential energies when it is in motion
and is positioned at an elevation on Earth. The kinetic and potential
energies are two forms of mechanical energy. They must be
described with respect to an external reference frame. When a
system experiences a change of elevation or velocity, the kinetic and
potential energies of the system will convert between each other.
For example, a rock falling from a cliff gains kinetic energy but
losses potential energy because its elevation decreases with respect
to the ground.

   In general, the total stored energy of a thermodynamic system

                                                        2.2 Thermodynamic properties | 49
consists of the internal, kinetic, and potential energies. However,
the kinetic and potential energies are insignificant compared to the
internal energy in many cases, and thus can be neglected.

       , and  are extensive properties as their values

depend on the mass of a system. The relation of their corresponding

intensive properties is expressed as

where

              : total specific energy, in J/kg or kJ/kg

              : specific internal energy, J/kg or kJ/kg

              : specific kinetic energy, J/kg or kJ/kg

              : specific potential energy, J/kg or kJ/kg

   The internal energy and specific internal energy are important
properties for the analysis of closed systems, which will be
explained in detail in Chapters 4-6.

2.2.5 Enthalpy and specific enthalpy

Enthalpy is an important thermodynamic property for the analysis

of open systems or control volumes, where mass transfer is always

accompanied by energy transfer. Enthalpy is calculated as the sum

of the internal energy, , and the flow work,     , of the fluid

flowing into or out of a control volume.

Now, what is flow work and why is it written as  ? Let us

consider a fluid element entering a control volume of a pipe section,

see Figure 2.2.4. The control volume is illustrated as the red, dashed-

50 | 2.2 Thermodynamic properties
lined rectangle. The fluid element, just before it enters the control
volume, is at an equilibrium state and has an internal energy, ,
and a pressure, . The fluid element carries its internal energy as
it flows into the control volume. In addition, the fluid element must
overcome the resistance from the downstream flow in the pipe. In
other words, a certain amount of work must be done to force the
fluid element into the control volume. We call such work essential
to maintain the continuous flow of a fluid through a control volume
as flow work. Refer to Figure 2.2.4, the flow work can be calculated
as

where  is the pressure force acting on the cross-

section, or the left control surface, of the control volume. is the

cross-sectional area of the left control surface. is the distance

that the fluid element travels from its original position to where

it just enters the control volume completely.  is the

volume of the fluid element.

   For flow through an open system or control volume, both the
internal energy carried by the fluid throughout the flow and the
flow work required to maintain the flow contribute to the change
of energy in a control volume. Therefore, it is common to combine
the internal energy and the flow work as a new thermodynamic
property, enthalpy, .

   Enthalpy, similar to the internal energy, is an extensive property
because its value depends on the mass of a system. Its
corresponding intensive property is called specific enthalpy, or
enthalpy per unit mass of a substance.

where

2.2.6 Entropy and specific entropy

Some processes occur spontaneously in nature, such as salt
dissolving in water. But some processes cannot occur
spontaneously in nature. For example, water at 80oC and 10oC can
mix in a container and eventually reach a thermal equilibrium. The
mixture, however, cannot separate spontaneously into water at
80oC and water at 10oC. In other words, the process of separating
the mixture is "irreversible" and cannot happen spontaneously. We
may use a thermodynamic property called entropy to help us
understand the physics of such phenomena.
52 | 2.2 Thermodynamic properties
   Entropy is a measure of the lack of order resulting from the
dispersal of energy and matter. Every spontaneous process is
accompanied by an increase in the entropy (or disorder) of the
universe. From a statistics point of view, it is more probable that
the dispersal of energy and matter in a process is rather "random"
than "orderly". If we consider a fixed amount of gas in an isolated
container, as illustrated in Figure 2.2.5. The probability of the
molecules having a random distribution is much higher than the
probability of them having an "orderly" distribution. Entropy is a
concept to represent the degree of the "randomness" or "disorder"
of a system. Such "disorder" was explained in statistical theories by
early scientists such as Maxwell, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. Nowadays,
entropy has been generally recognized as an important
thermodynamic property associated with the "quality" aspect of the
energy of a system; while energy represents the "quantity" aspect
of the energy of the system. Both energy and entropy are of great
importance in thermal analysis. The first law of thermodynamics,
see Chapters 4 and 5, addresses the concepts of energy and energy
conservation. The second law of thermodynamics is closely
associated with the concepts of entropy and entropy generation,
which explain why a process in nature only occurs in the direction
of decreasing the quality of energy or increasing the entropy of the
universe. These concepts will be explained in detail as we study the
second law of thermodynamics in Chapter 6.

Entropy, , is an extensive property as its value depends on the

mass of a system. The common SI units for entropy include kJ/

K and J/K. Its corresponding intensive property is called specific

entropy,  . Its common SI units are kJ/kgK or J/kgK.

2.3 Phase diagrams

A pure substance may exist in any of the three phases: solid, liquid,

and vapour, at certain temperatures and pressures. When its

temperature or pressure changes, a substance may transition from

one phase to another. For example, liquid water at 1 atm turns into
ice when its temperature drops to the freezing point of 0oC. The

equilibrium state of a pure substance and its phase transitions are

commonly illustrated in phase diagrams. Figure 2.3.1 is a three-

dimensional              phase diagram, where the three axes

are pressure, specific volume, and temperature, respectively. This

phase diagram clearly shows the single phase regions of solid, liquid,

and vapour or gas, as well as three two-phase regions, where solid-

liquid, liquid-vapour, or solid-vapour coexist in equilibrium. The

three-dimensional        phase diagram can be projected

to generate two-dimensional phase diagrams, such as  ,

, and                    diagrams. When analyzing processes and

cycles, these two-dimensional phase diagrams are commonly used,

and therefore will be discussed in detail here.

liquid and vapour phases is called vaporization line. Each point on

the vaporization line represents an equilibrium state of saturation;

the substance is either a saturated liquid, a saturated vapour, or

a two-phase liquid-vapour mixture. The temperature and its

corresponding pressure at each point on the vaporization line are

called saturation temperature,  , and saturation pressure,

, respectively. Each saturation temperature corresponds to a unique

saturation pressure, and vice versa. A liquid (or vapour) starts to

evaporate (or condense) when its temperature and pressure reach

and         . The saturation properties of selected fluids can be

found in the thermodynamic tables in Appendices A-D.

The curve that represents the transition between the solid and
liquid phases is called fusion line. Each point on the fusion line
has a unique set of temperature and pressure called freezing
temperature and freezing pressure, respectively. Along the fusion
line, the substance may exist as a saturated liquid, a solid, or a two-
phase solid-liquid mixture.

The curve below the triple point is called sublimation line, across
which a substance can change directly from solid to vapour or vice
versa without a transition through the liquid phase. Each point on
the sublimation line represents an equilibrium state, at which the
substance may exist as a saturated vapour, a solid, or a two-phase
solid-vapour mixture.

The vaporization, fusion and sublimation lines meet at the triple
point, at which the three phases, solid, liquid, and vapour, coexist
in equilibrium. Appendix F lists the triple points of a selection of

58 | 2.3 Phase diagrams
pure substances. It is noted, from Figure 2.3.2, that the liquid phase
cannot exist below the triple point pressure. When a substance is at
a pressure lower than the triple point pressure, it can only transition
between the solid and vapour phases.

The critical point in the  diagram is where the

vaporization line ends. The pressure and temperature at the critical

point are called critical pressure, , and critical temperature,

, respectively. A state above the critical point has a pressure

   and a temperature       ; therefore, it is referred to

as a supercritical state. A substance at a supercritical state is called

supercritical fluid, which has a unique characteristic: no distinct

liquid and gas phases can exist anymore in the supercritical zone.

In this book, we will mainly focus on the subcritical zone, where

        Review the P-T diagram for CO2, as shown in Figure 2.3.3.
         1. What is the lowest pressure for liquid CO2 to exist?
        2. Is CO2 at 100 bar, 275 K a solid, liquid or gas?
        3. CO2 at 100 bar, 275 K is cooled in an isobaric

     process. At approximately what temperature will CO2
     start to change its phase? Will it change to a liquid or
     a solid? Draw the process line.
Solution:
1. From the P-T diagram, the liquid phase can only
     exist when the pressure is great than the triple point
     pressure. From Appendix F, Table F1, CO2 has a triple
     point pressure of 517 kPa and a triple point
     temperature of 216.55 K (-56.60 캜), respectively;
     therefore, the lowest pressure for liquid CO2 to exist
     is 517 kPa.
2. From the P-T diagram, Figure 2.3.e1, CO2 at 100 bar,
     275 K is in the liquid phase.
3. The isobaric process is shown as the horizontal,
     yellow line with a constant pressure of 100 bar, see
     Figure 2.3.e1. At approximately 220 K, the isobaric
     process line meets the fusion line, and the liquid CO2
     starts to change to solid CO2.

2.3.2 T-v and P-v diagrams

In many thermodynamic cycles, a working fluid experiences phase

changes between liquid and vapour in the subcritical zone, such as

water in a steam power plant and R134a in a vapour-compression

refrigeration system. The liquid-vapour phase change can be

illustrated in the       and  diagrams, as shown in

Figures 2.3.4 and 2.3.5. In these diagrams, we can clearly see the

three regions: compressed liquid region, saturated liquid-vapour

62 | 2.3 Phase diagrams
region, and superheated vapour region. The curve that separates
the compressed liquid region and saturated liquid-vapour region is
called the saturated liquid line. Any point on the saturated liquid
line represents a saturated liquid state. In a similar fashion, the
curve that lies between the saturated liquid-vapour region and the
superheated vapour region is called the saturated vapour line. Any
point on the saturated vapour line represents a saturated vapour
state. The two saturation lines meet at the critical point.

It is important to note that the liquid state is commonly called

compressed liquid or subcooled liquid, and the vapour state is

commonly called superheated vapour. In the liquid-vapour, two-

phase region, the corresponding isothermal and isobaric processes

coincide and remain as horizontal lines. This indicates that, during

the phase change process, both temperature and pressure remain

constant, i.e.,           and  .

2.3.3 The saturated liquid-vapour two-phase
region

For a saturated liquid-vapour, two-phase mixture, we define quality
x to denote the mass fraction of the saturated vapour in the mixture.

2.4 Thermodynamic tables

Thermodynamic tables are commonly used to determine the
properties of a substance at a given state. This book includes the
tables for four pure substances: water, ammonia, R134a, and carbon
dioxide. The data in these tables are obtained from NIST Chemistry
WebBook, SRD 69, which consists of the thermophysical properties
of various common fluids.
Appendix A: Thermodynamic Properties of Water

   Table A1: Saturated water
   Table A2: Superheated vapour, water
   Table A3: Compressed liquid water

Appendix B: Thermodynamic Properties of Ammonia

   Table B1: Saturated ammonia
   Table B2: Superheated ammonia

Appendix C: Thermodynamic Properties of R134a

   Table C1: Saturated R134a
   Table C2: Superheated R134a

Appendix D: Thermodynamic Properties of Carbon Dioxide

   Table D2: Superheated CO2

Tables A1, B1, C1, and D1 are the tables for the saturated fluids.
They are used to find the properties of the corresponding fluids in
saturated liquid, saturated vapour, and two-phase regions. Tables
A2, B2, C2, and D2 are the superheated vapour tables for finding the

                                                              2.4 Thermodynamic tables | 67
properties of the fluids in the superheated vapour region. Table A3
is the compressed liquid table for water.

   In these tables, the specific volume, specific internal energy,
specific enthalpy, and specific entropy are tabulated as functions
of the pressure and temperature. Among those thermodynamic
properties, , , and are measurable properties, and , , and

   cannot be measured directly; they are calculated with respect to
predefined reference states. The reference states for the tables in
this book are clearly stated in Appendices A-D.

It is important to note that thermodynamic tables can be

generated with respect to different reference states. Because the

values of , , and strongly depend on the reference state, it is

not surprising to see different values of , , and from different

sources. This may cause inconvenience or errors when performing

calculations. To avoid unnecessary confusion and to reduce the

chance of errors, thermodynamic tables from the same source

should be used in calculations because, in most thermodynamic

analyses, we are concerned about the changes in specific internal

energy, specific enthalpy, and specific entropy, or  ,  , and

.

How do we determine if a fluid is a compressed liquid, superheated
vapour, or two-phase liquid-vapour mixture? How do we find the
fluid properties at a certain state? By examining the tables in
Appendices A-D, you probably have noticed that all properties in
these tables are intensive properties. To determine the fluid
properties at a certain state, we will need to know two intensive
properties from this list: , , , , , , and . The following
flow charts demonstrate the procedure.

Case 1: both T and P are given. You may draw a          diagram

(see Figure 2.3.2) to help you better understand the flow chart in

Figure 2.4.1.

Figure 2.4.2.

Figure 2.4.3.

Case 4: temperature T and one of u, h and s are given. The
procedure is exactly the same as for case 3. Replace with the given

  , , or in the flow chart, Figure 2.4.3.

The compressed liquid table is presented only for water in the

pressure range of 0.5-50 MPa in this book. When the compressed

liquid tables are not available for a specific fluid or in a specific

range, the saturated liquid properties at the same temperature may

be used as an approximation, i.e.,       ,                     ,

       , and                  .

The tables in Appendices A-D are presented with a small
temperature increment. Linear interpolations, see Figure 2.4.4, are
often used if the given temperature or other properties cannot be
found directly from these tables.

the property is to be found.        and     indicate

the properties of two known states, between which the unknown

state  is located. To improve the accuracy, the two states

The following examples demonstrate how to use these tables to find
the properties of a compressed liquid, superheated vapour, and
liquid-vapour mixture.

     Example 1

        Determine the properties of water at T=150oC and P=100
     kPa.

72 | 2.4 Thermodynamic tables
   Solution:
    1. Both temperature and pressure are given for water.

        Use the flow chart for case 1, Figure 2.4.1.
   2. From Table A1: at T=150oC, Psat = 0.47617 MPa =

        476.17 kPa.
   3. Because P=100 kPa < 476.17 kPa, or P < Psat , water at

        this state is a superheated vapour.
   4. From Table A2: at T=150oC and P=100 kPa,

             v = 1.93665 m3/kg, u = 2582.94 kJ/kg
             h = 2776.60 kJ/kg, s = 7.6148 kJ/kgK

Example 2

   Determine the properties of ammonia at T=0oC and v
=0.2 m3/kg.

   Solution:
    1. Both T and v are given for ammonia. Use the flow

        chart for case 3, Figure 2.4.3.
   2. From Table B1: at T=0oC, vf =0.001566 m3/kg and vg

        = 0.289297 m3/kg.

        3. Because vf < v < vg , ammonia at this state is a
             liquid-vapour two-phase mixture. Its pressure and
             quality are

                  From Table B1: at T=0oC,
                            uf =342.48 kJ/kg and ug = 1481.17 kJ/kg
                            hf = 343.16 kJ/kg and hg = 1605.39 kJ/kg
                            sf = 1.4716 kJ/kgK and sg = 6.0926 kJ/kgK

                  Therefore, the specific internal energy, specific
               enthalpy, and specific entropy of this two-phase
               mixture are

     Example 3

74 | 2.4 Thermodynamic tables
   Refrigerant R134a has a specific enthalpy h = 420 kJ/kg at
T=20oC. Determine the pressure P and specific volume v of
R134a at this state.

      Solution:
   1. Refer to case 4 as both T and h are given for R134a.

        Because the procedures for cases 3 and 4 are the
        same, the flow chart for case 3, Figure 2.4.3, is used
        by replacing v with h.
   2. From Table C1: at T=20oC, hg=409.75 kJ/kg. Because
        h = 420 kJ/kg > hg , R134a at this state is a
        superheated vapour.
   3. From Table C2:

                       At T=20oC and P1 = 100 kPa: h1 = 420.31 kJ/
                    kg, v1 = 0.233731 m3/kg

                       At T=20oC and P2 = 150 kPa: h2 = 419.33 kJ/
                    kg, v2 = 0.154053 m3/kg
             Because 419.33 kJ/kg < 420 kJ/kg < 420.31 kJ/kg,
          the pressure of R134a at the given state must be
          between 100 kPa and 150 kPa. Use linear
          interpolation to calculate the pressure and specific
          volume at the given state.

2.5 Chapter review

An important step in thermodynamic analysis is to predict the
thermodynamic properties, in particular, the intensive properties
at different states of a process or a cycle. In this chapter, we have
introduced common thermodynamic properties of pure substances,
and how to use phase diagrams and thermodynamic tables to
determine the phase of a fluid and its corresponding properties at a
given state. Below are the key takeaways:

 Pure substances may be used as working fluids in thermal

   devices. A pure substance may exist as a single-phase matter,

   such as solid, liquid, vapour or gas, or a saturated two-phase

   mixture.

 The state of a pure substance can be illustrated in the

                         and  phase diagrams.

 A state of a pure substance is fixed by two independent,
   intensive properties.

    For a single-phase fluid, if two intensive properties from

   the list:                  and are known, then the state

       is fixed.
    For a two-phase mixture, if two properties from the list:

                                   and the quality are known, then the

   state is fixed.

 The properties of a fixed state can be extracted from the

   thermodynamic tables directly or by using linear interpolations.

                        and  diagrams are of particular

   importance in thermodynamic analysis. It is highly
   recommended that students relate the appropriate phase
   diagrams to the flow charts in Section 2.4, when practicing how
   to locate a state and how to read thermodynamic tables.

3.0 Chapter introduction and
learning objectives

Thermodynamic tables are commonly used to evaluate
thermodynamic properties of a pure substance. This method is
accurate, but may be time consuming for complicated calculations.
It would be desirable if, for some special cases, a simple method
with relatively good accuracy could be developed for evaluating
thermodynamic properties.

   This chapter introduces the concepts of "ideal" gas, ideal gas
equation of state (EOS), real gas, and compressibility factor. It
explains the difference between "ideal" and real gases, and at what
conditions the ideal gas model may be used as an approximation for
evaluating thermodynamic properties of simple gases.

3.1 Ideal gas and ideal gas
equation of state

Consider a container of fixed volume filled with a gas. When the
container is heated, the gas temperature will increase, causing the
gas pressure to increase. The variations of gas pressure and
temperature are governed by the equations of state. An equation of
state (EOS) is an expression that relates pressure, temperature, and
specific volume of a gas.

   The simplest equation of state is the ideal gas equation of state,
which is expressed as

                                             or
   where

                 : mass, in kg
                : volume, in m3
               : specific volume, in m3/kg
                : absolute temperature, in K
                : pressure, in kPa or Pa
                : gas constant in kJ/kgK or J/kgK

   A gas which obeys the ideal gas EOS is called an ideal gas. The
ideal gas model is a hypothetical model. It approximates the

                      behaviour of a gas at high temperatures and low
pressures in the superheated vapour region.

When a gas is at a state near the saturation region or its critical

point, the gas behaviour deviates from the ideal gas model

significantly. For example, Figure 3.1.1 shows the  diagram

for water. Steam in the shaded region is either at a high

temperature or a low pressure. The ideal gas model is valid in this

region with a relative error of less than 1%. Moving out of the

3.1 Ideal gas and ideal gas equation of
                                      state | 85
shaded region and towards the saturated vapour line or the critical
point, the relative error increases significantly because the ideal gas
EOS can no longer represent the gas behaviour in these regions.
A common mistake that students tend to make is to use the ideal
gas EOS in all calculations without evaluating its suitability for the
given conditions. It is important to note that, although many gasses
may be treated as ideal gases in a certain range of pressures and
temperatures, the ideal gas EOS is NOT valid for gases in all
conditions. Therefore, it cannot be used without verification. The
compressibility factor in Section 3.2 explains how to verify if a gas is
an "ideal" or real gas.

Example 1

   Two tanks contain methane. For the given conditions,
methane can be treated as an ideal gas.

     Tank 1 has a volume of 0.3 m3, and is at a
        temperature of 20캜 and a pressure of 300 kPa.

     Tank 2 contains 1.5 kg of methane, and is at a
        temperature of 30캜 and a pressure of 800 kPa.

   The partition between the two tanks is removed to allow
methane in the tanks to mix and reach equilibrium. What is

3.2 Real gas and
compressibility factor

The    relation of a real gas doesn't obey the ideal gas

EOS. For a gas at a given range of pressures and temperatures, we

may calculate its compressibility factor to evaluate the suitability of

the ideal gas EOS for the given condition.

   The compressibility factor is a dimensionless correction factor to
account for the deviation of the real gas behaviour from the "ideal"
gas model. It is defined as

where                                   or

        : compressibility factor, dimensionless
       : specific volume, in m3/kg
        : absolute temperature, in K
        : pressure, in kPa or Pa
        : gas constant, in kJ/kgK or J/kgK

The compressibility factor of an ideal gas is exactly one. For real
gases, the compressibility factor may be very different from one.
Figures 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 illustrate the compressibility factors of
hydrogen and nitrogen, respectively, over a range of pressures and
temperatures. It can be seen that the compressibility factor changes
with both pressure and temperature. As the pressure approaches
zero, the compressibility factor tends to converge to one. In other
words, a real gas may behave like an ideal gas at "low" pressures
regardless of its temperature.

   From Figures 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, it can be seen that the
compressibility charts for different gases may vary largely. It is

92 | 3.2 Real gas and compressibility
factor
therefore more practical to use a generalized compressibility chart,

as shown in Figure 3.2.3, where the pressures and temperatures

are normalized with respect to the critical pressure and critical

temperature of a gas. The reduced pressure   and reduced

temperature are defined as

where

       : pressure, in kPa or Pa

       : critical pressure, in kPa or Pa.    and must

have the same unit.

       : reduced pressure, dimensionless

       : absolute temperature, in K

       : critical temperature, in K

       : reduced temperature, dimensionless

The compressibility factor is thus plotted as a function of and

. The generalized compressibility chart can be viewed as a

graphical representation of the gas behaviour over a wide range

of pressures and temperatures. It is valid for many substances,

especially those that have simple molecular structures. From Figure

3.2.3, it can be seen that the smallest compressibility factor occurs

at the critical point,      and            . This indicates that a

real gas deviates significantly from the ideal gas behaviour near its

critical point. As      or           , the compressibility factor

       . In other words, a real gas behaves like an ideal gas at "low"

pressures and "high" temperatures.

Typically, thermodynamic tables or real-gas EOS are used for
evaluating the relation of pressure, temperature, and specific
volume of real gases. If neither tool is available, the generalized
compressibility chart may be used instead as a fast and reasonably
accurate tool, especially for substances with simple molecular
structures. Below is the procedure of how to use the generalized
compressibility chart, followed by examples.

1. Find the critical pressure,  , and critical temperature,

          , of a substance from Appendix E

2. Calculate the reduced pressure, , and reduced temperature,

3. Estimate the compressibility factor, , from Figure 3.2.3.

volume (if needed)

        Find the compressibility factor of the following
     substances at the given conditions. Is it reasonable to treat
     them as ideal gases at the given conditions?

         1. Methane at -50oC, 4.1 MPa
        2. Ammonia at 600oC, 500 kPa
        Solution
        1. Methane at -50oC, 4.1 MPa

                  First, find the critical properties of methane from
               Table E1.

                                                  ,
                  Second, calculate the reduced temperature and
               reduced pressure.

                                             ; therefore, methane at the

               given condition cannot be treated as an ideal gas.

        2. Ammonia at 600oC, 500 kPa

96 | 3.2 Real gas and compressibility factor
             First, find the critical properties of ammonia from
          Table E1.

             Second, calculate the reduced temperature and
          reduced pressure.

             From Figure 3.2.3, the compressibility factor

          ideal gas at the given condition. Note that the
          reduced temperature of ammonia is greater than 2
          and the reduced pressure is very small, indicating
          the given state is far away from the critical point.

        Method 2: use the ideal gas EOS alone

   Comment:
   Method 1 gives the most accurate value for specific
volume among the three methods, as the steam table is
specific for water vapour at different pressures and
temperatures. Method 2 assumes steam as an ideal gas.
This method is easy to use but gives the least accurate
result. Method 3, by correcting the ideal gas EOS with the
compressibility factor, improves the accuracy of the
calculation.

3.3 Chapter Review

The ideal gas EOS is the simplest model to relate the pressure,
temperature, and specific volume of a gas. It can be used for
thermodynamic analysis if the compressibiliy factor of a gas at a
given condition approaches one, or the gas behaves like an "ideal"
gas. It is important to note that, despite its simplicity, the ideal gas
EOS cannot be used in all conditions. Its suitability at a given state
must be verified.

A real gas doesn't obey the ideal gas EOS at a given state. For a

real gas, the compressibility factor can be incorporated to improve

the accuracy of the prediction of the  relation. The

compressibility factor of a gas may be obtained from the generalized

compressibility chart.

4.1 Internal energy in a system

The total energy of a system may consist of internal energy, kinetic
energy, potential energy, and other forms of energy. For a system
free of magnetic, electric, and surface tension effects, its total
energy and corresponding specific energy can be expressed as

where          , and                   represent the total energy,

internal energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy of a system,

respectively;  , and                   are their corresponding specific

energies. Recall from Chapter 2, internal energy is a form of

thermal energy. A system at different states may have different

internal energies due to different temperature and pressure at each

state; therefore, is a state function. It is important to note that

the change in internal energy in a process depends on the initial and

final states, not on the path of the process. For example, although

the three processes in Figure 4.1.1 undergo different paths, their

changes in internal energy,            , between the two states 1 and 2 are

the same because the three processes have identical initial states

and identical final states.

   The first law of thermodynamics gives the relation between the
total energy stored in a system and the energy transferred into or
out of the system in the form of heat and work. In this chapter, we
will firstly introduce the common methods of determining internal
energy and work, and then the first law of thermodynamics and its
applications to closed systems.

4.1.2 Constant-volume specific heat

When a substance absorbs heat, its temperature tends to increase.
Different substances require different amounts of heat for a given
temperature rise. For example, it requires 4.18 kJ of heat to warm
up 1 kg of water by 1oC. But it only requires 2.22 kJ of heat to warm
up the same amount of gasoline by 1oC. In other words, water and
gasoline have different energy storage capacities. Specific heat, also
called heat capacity, is an important property used to quantify the
energy storage capacity of a substance. Specific heat is defined as
the energy required to raise the temperature of one unit mass (i.e.,
1 kg) of a substance by one degree (i.e., 1oC, or 1 K),

where

       : specific heat, in kJ/kgK
       : mass of a substance, in kg

           : the amount of heat supplied to or extracted from a

substance per unit change of temperature, in kJ/K

The specific heat of a substance may be measured in an isochoric

or isobaric process; they are therefore called constant-volume

specific heat,  , and constant-pressure specific heat,           ,

respectively. Both and are properties of a substance. They

can be used to calculate the changes of specific internal energy,
      , and specific enthalpy, , respectively, in a process involving

ideal gases, liquids and solids. The constant-volume specific heat is
introduced below in detail and the constant-pressure specific heat
will be introduced in Chapter 5.

                4.1 Internal energy in a system | 111
   Constant-volume specific heat is defined as the energy required

to raise the temperature of one unit mass (i.e., 1 kg) of a substance by
one degree (i.e., 1oC, or 1 K) in an isochoric process. Mathematically,

it is expressed as,

where

         : constant-volume specific heat, in kJ/kgK

       : internal energy, in kJ/kg
       : temperature, in K or oC

   The constant-volume specific heat of selected ideal gases can be
found in Appendix G, Table G1. For example, oxygen has
0.658 kJ/kgK. If we heat up 1 kg of oxygen at 300 K in a sealed,
rigid tank, it will require 0.658 kJ of heat for the temperature of the
oxygen to rise from 300 K to 301 K.

   It is important to note that although is typically measured in
isochoric processes, it is a property of a substance. The use of
is NOT limited to isochoric processes. As can be seen in the next
section, for ideal gases can be used to calculate the change in
specific internal energy, , in ANY processes.

4.1.3 Using Cv to calculate u for ideal gases

A gas behaves like an ideal gas as its compressibility factor

. The specific internal energy of an ideal gas is a function of

temperature only,  ; therefore,

112 | 4.1 Internal energy in a system
   The change in specific internal energy between two states in any
process involving ideal gases can be found from

   where
               : specific internal energy, in kJ/kg
                : temperature, in K or oC
                  : average constant-volume specific heat. Table G1

          provides the values of for selected ideal gases.

   The above equation provides a convenient way for estimating
       of ideal gases in a process. Its accuracy depends on the change

in temperature in a process. In many cases, especially, those with
small temperature variations, this method is reasonably accurate
and can be used for ideal gases when the thermodynamic tables
are not available. If the thermodynamic tables are available or high
accuracy is required for the process analysis, it is preferable to use
the thermodynamic tables to determine at different states first,
and then .

     process. Will your answer be different if the process is
     isochoric or isobaric?

        Solution
        Air is treated as an ideal gas. From Table G1:

                                            ; therefore,

        The change in internal energy in this process is 43.08 kJ.
     As is a property of the substance (e.g., air in this
     example), the answer will be the same regardless of the
     type of the process.

4.2 Heat transfer across a
boundary

The total energy stored in a system may change when energy is
transferred into or out of the system. For a closed system, the
energy transfer is achieved via two mechanisms: heat and work, as
illustrated in Figure 1.2.3.

   Heat transfer takes place when a temperature difference exists
between a system and its surroundings. As heat transfer must cross
the system boundary, it is a boundary phenomenon. The heat
transfer between two states during a process can be written as

   Different from internal energy, heat transfer is NOT a state
function. It is a path function because the amount of heat that is
absorbed or rejected by a substance in a process depends not only
on the initial and final states, but also on the process path. Although
heat transfer is NOT a property of a system, it has a significant
effect on the changes of properties of the system in a process.

   Specific heat transfer refers to the amount of heat transfer per
unit mass of a substance. It is defined as

where

        : mass of a system, in kg
        : amount of heat transfer in a process, in kJ
       : amount of specific heat transfer in a process, in kJ/kg

4.3 Work

   Work is a form of mechanical energy associated with a force and
its resulting displacement. When a force moves a body from one
position to another, it does work on that body over the distance, see
Figure 4.3.1.

   The common SI units for work are kJ and J.

Figure 4.3.1 Work done due to a force acting on a block over a distance

4.3.1 Boundary work

Work associated with the expansion and compression of a gas is
commonly called boundary work because it is done at the boundary
between a system and its surroundings.
Let us consider a piston-cylinder device, as illustrated in Figure
4.3.2. The gas in the cylinder exerts an upward force,
118 | 4.3 Work
, where is the gas pressure, and is the cross-sectional area

of the piston. Upon receiving heat, the gas will tend to expand,

pushing the piston up. We will assume the expansion process is

quasi-equilibrium, and the piston moves up an infinitesimal

distance . The boundary work done by the gas to the surroundings

in         this  infinitesimal               process        is

                                             ; therefore,

the total boundary work between two states in a process can be
written as

    where

           : pressure, in kPa or Pa
           : volume, in m3

                : boundary work, in kJ or J

   Specific boundary work refers to the boundary work done by a
unit mass of a substance. It can be written as

    where

            : pressure, in kPa or Pa
           : specific volume, in m3/kg

                : specific boundary work, in kJ/kg or J/kg

Figure 4.3.2 Boundary work caused by the expansion of gas in
a piston-cylinder device

From the integral equations for       and  , we can tell that the

boundary work and specific boundary work between any two states

in a process can be illustrated graphically as the area under the

process curve in the             and       diagrams, respectively.

For example, the shaded area in Figure 4.3.3 represents the specific

boundary work between states 1 and 2 in the compression process

A. The three compression processes, A, B, and C in Figure 4.3.3 have

different specific boundary work because of their different paths.

By comparing the areas under the process curves, we can tell that

120 | 4.3 Work
process A has the smallest specific boundary work and process C
has the largest specific boundary work.

   Figure 4.3.3 demonstrates that the boundary work and specific
boundary work in a quasi-equilibrium process are path functions;
they depend on the initial and final states as well as the process
path. Boundary work can be defined as positive or negative. Here
is a common sign convention: the boundary work in an expansion
process is positive. This is because the change of volume in an
expansion process is positive. Likewise, the boundary work in a
compression process is negative.

A polytropic process refers to any quasi-equilibrium
thermodynamic process, which can be described with the following
mathematical expression.

expressions can be used to represent the relations of pressure-
volume or pressure-specific volume of various processes that are
encountered in real thermal systems, including the isobaric,
isochoric, and isothermal processes. Table 4.3.1 lists the polytropic
exponents corresponding to an ideal gas undergoing an isobaric,

system

The following procedure may be followed when solving problems
with the first law of thermodynamics.

1. Sketch the physical system described in the problem and show

its main components.

2. Set up an appropriate closed system by drawing the system

boundary. How a system is set up may determine if a means of

energy transfer can be regarded as heat or work.

3. Indicate the heat and work transferred into or out of the

system and their signs, see Figure 4.4.1.

4. Identify the type of the processes (e.g., isobaric, isothermal,

isochoric, polytropic, or isentropic). Show the processes on the

and                   diagrams if possible, and list all of the

known and unknown states.

5. Apply the first law of thermodynamics to the closed system,
      eliminating the terms that are not applicable to the system.

6. Solve for the unknowns by combining the first law of
      thermodynamics with the ideal gas law, thermodynamic tables,
      and other physical laws as appropriate.

The following examples demonstrate how to apply the first law of
thermodynamics to closed systems.

     Example 1

Consider the vapour compression refrigeration cycle

consisting of a compressor, condenser, expansion device,

and evaporator as shown. The compressor must consume

work,    , from an external energy source such as

electricity. The evaporator and condenser absorb and reject

heat,    and , respectively. What is the relation

between  ,  , and ?

compressor, condenser, expansion device, and evaporator

Solution:

The vapour compression refrigeration cycle can be

regarded as a closed system with the initial and final states

being identical; therefore,  .

   Note the sign convention for heat: in (+), out (-) and for
work: in (-), out (+). This relation can be interpreted as the
total energy transferred out of the cycle remains the same
as the total energy transferred into the cycle.

               4.4 The first law of thermodynamics for closed systems | 147
     Example 2

        A rigid tank has two rooms, both containing R134a at the
     following initial states.

                  Room A: m= 2 kg, P=200 kPa, v=0.132 m3/kg
                  Room B: m= 3 kg, P=500 kPa, T=100캜
        A crack is developed in the partition between the two
     rooms, which allows R134a in the tank to mix. Assume the
     mixing takes place slowly until R134a in the whole tank
     reaches a uniform state at 50캜. Find the heat transfer
     during this process. The process can be treated as a quasi-
     equilibrium process.

      Figure 4.4.e2 A rigid tank with two rooms

        Solution:
        First, set the whole rigid tank as the closed system.

                  Because the volume of the tank remains constant,
               the boundary work during the mixing process is

       thermodynamics,

                                                       and

          The heat transfer during the process depends on
       the internal energies of the initial and final states.

                       \begin{align*} \Delta U &amp;= U_3 -
                    (U_1 + U_2) \\&amp;= (m_1 + m_2)u_{3} -
                    (m_{1}u_{1} + m_{2}u_{2}) \end{align*}
          where the subscripts 1, 2, and 3 represent the
       initial states of R134a in rooms A and B, and the final
       state of R134a in the whole tank, respectively.
Second, find the specific internal energies, u1, u2 , and u3.

          From Table C1, at T = -10캜, Psat = 200.6 kPa, vg =

          From Table C1, at T = 100캜, Psat = 3972.38 kPa.
       Since P < Psat, R134a at this state is a superheated
       vapour.

               Since v3 > vg, R134a at the final state is a
               superheated vapour.

                  From Table C2,
                            At P = 200 kPa, T = 50캜, v = 0.127663

        Second, consider the boundary work in a polytropic
     process. The specific volumes are unknowns

        Third, find the specific volumes and specific internal
     energies at both initial and final states.

                  At the initial state: P1 = 100 kPa, T1 = 0캜. From
               Table B1, Psat = 429.39 kPa at 0캜. Since P1 < Psat,
               ammonia is a superheated vapour.

                  From Table B2,
                            v1 = 1.31365 m3/kg, u1 = 1504.29 kJ/kg.

                  At the final state P2 = 150 kPa. The process is
               polytropic with n =1.25.

               150 kPa, vg = 0.771672 m3/kg. Since v2 > vg, ammonia
               at the final state is a superheated vapour.

   Last, the heat transfer in this process can now be found
from

   During this process heat is rejected to the surroundings;
therefore, the sign for heat transfer is negative.

Second, analyze the processes.

          The process is isobaric from state 1 to state 2, then
       isochoric from state 2 to state 3. The specific work is
       the shaded area of the rectangle shown in the

                           and

   Third, determine the specific volumes and specific
internal energies at states 1 and 3.

             At state 1, P1 = 200 kPa and T1 = 200oC.

From Table A2,                  u1 = 2654.63 kJ/
          v1 = 1.08048 m3/kg,

       kg

State 2 is saturated liquid water at P2 = 200 kPa.

From Table A1,

          At T = 120 oC, P = 198.67 kPa, vf = 0.001060
       m3/kg

          At T = 125 oC, P = 232.24 kPa, vf = 0.001065
       m3/kg

Use linear interpolation,

       and
At state 3, P3 = 25 kPa. v3 = v2 = 0.0010602 m3/kg.
From Table A1, vf < v3 < vg; therefore, state 3 is a

vapour with T3 = Tsat  65oC.

   uf = 272.09 kJ/kg,    ug = 2462.42
kJ/kg

   The quality and specific internal energy of the two
phase mixture are

                  Note that state 3 is almost a saturated liquid with
               very small quality; therefore, u3  ug.
        Last, calculate the specific boundary work and specific
     heat transfer in this whole process

                     \begin{align*} q &amp;=( u_3 - u_1) + w

                  -2598.4 \ \rm{kJ/kg}\end{align*}
        In this cooling process, the volume decreases, resulting in
     a negative specific boundary work. The temperature and
     the internal energy decrease too. As a result, the specific
     heat transfer is negative indicating a heat loss from the
     system to its surroundings.

4.5 Chapter review

Energy can be transferred to and from a closed system by two
mechanisms: heat transfer and work. Both heat transfer and work
have a significant effect on the total energy as well as the internal
energy stored in a system, as expressed in the first law of
thermodynamics.

   When applying the first law of thermodynamics to a closed
system, it is important to evaluate the internal energy of the system
at various states of a process, and the boundary work and heat
transfer during the process.

 The internal energy is a property of a system. It is a state

function and is independent of the process path. In general, the

specific internal energy can be found by using thermodynamic

tables. For ideal gases, solids or liquids, the specific internal

energy can be calculated by using the constant-volume specific

heat.

 Heat transfer and boundary work are not properties of a

system. They are boundary phenomena and path functions.

Their magnitudes depend on the initial and final states as well

as the path of a process.

 The boundary work and specific boundary work in a process

can be expressed graphically as the area under the process

curve in the               and  diagrams, respectively;

therefore, these diagrams are often used when evaluating the

boundary work in a process.

learning objectives

Many thermal devices, such as compressors, turbines, and heat
exchangers can be modelled as open systems. A common feature
of these devices is that they all have inlets and outlets, through
which a working fluid transfers both mass and energy into and
out of the devices. This chapter extends the concept of energy
conservation to open systems with a focus on steady-state, steady
flows (SSSF). Examples are given to illustrate the applications of
the first law of thermodynamics in typical SSSF devices such as
turbines, compressors, heat exchangers, expansion valves, and
mixing chambers.

5.1 Enthalpy

Enthalpy is an important thermodynamic property for the analysis
of energy conservation in open systems. It combines the internal
energy and flow work associated with the flowing fluid (see Section
2.2.5 for details). The following sections explain how to determine
the specific enthalpy at a given state.

5.1.1 Using thermodynamic tables to determine
specific enthalpy h

As described in Chapter 2, thermodynamic tables can be used to
determine thermodynamic properties, such as pressure,
temperature, specific volume, specific internal energy, specific
enthalpy, and specific entropy of a pure substance at a given
condition. After the specific enthalpy is found, the enthalpy can
then be calculated by using the following equation:

where

        : enthalpy, in kJ or J
       : specific enthalpy, in kJ/kg or J/kg
        : mass of the system, in kg

   From Appendix C, Table C1, at T = 20oC, hf = 227.47 kJ/kg,
hg = 409.75 kJ/kg. Since hf < h < hg , R134a at this state is a
two-phase mixture of saturated liquid and saturated vapour
with a pressure of P = Psat = 0.57171 MPa = 571.71 kPa and a

5.1.2 Constant-pressure specific heat

Constant-pressure specific heat is defined as the energy required
to raise the temperature of a unit mass (i.e., 1 kg) of a substance by
1 degree (i.e., 1oC, or 1 K) in an isobaric process. Mathematically, it is
expressed as

where

         : constant-pressure specific heat, in kJ/kgK

       : specific enthalpy, in kJ/kg
       : temperature, in K or oC

   The constant-pressure specific heat of selected substances can
be found in Appendix G. For example, the constant-pressure
specific heat of air at 300 K is 1.005 kJ/kgK, see Table G1. Let us
consider one kilogram of air originally at 300 K in a piston-cylinder
device. It will require 1.005 kJ of heat for the air temperature to
increase from 300 K to 301 K if the piston-cylinder device is heated
to allow the air to expand in an isobaric process.

                                            5.1 Enthalpy | 169
It is important to note that both specific heats, and , are

properties of a substance. Although they are typically measured in
isochoric and isobaric processes, respectively, their applications are
NOT limited to isochoric or isobaric processes. For ideal gases,

and    can be used to determine   and  , respectively, in

ANY processes.

5.1.3 Using Cp to calculate h for ideal gases

The specific enthalpy of an ideal gas is a function of temperature

only,               ; therefore,

   The change of specific enthalpy of an ideal gas within a small
temperature range can be calculated as

where

       : constant-pressure specific heat in a small

       temperature range, in kJ/kgK
            : specific enthalpy, in kJ/kg
             : temperature, in K or oC

          Subscripts 1 and 2 represent states 1 and 2 in a process,
       respectively.

   The above formula is a simple, approximate method to estimate
the change of specific enthalpy of an ideal gas due to temperature
variations. It is reasonably accurate and may be used when the
thermodynamic tables of an ideal gas are not available. Table G1
lists the constant-pressure specific heat of selected substances at

170 | 5.1 Enthalpy
300 K. Strictly speaking, since  ,  at a different

temperature should be calculated according to that specific
temperature. However, Table G1 is often used in approximate
calculations as long as the temperature variations of the ideal gas
remain in a small range.

The specific heat ratio, , of an ideal gas is defined as the ratio of
   to .

   The following equations relate , , , and . Detailed
derivations are omitted here.

5.1.4 Using Cp to calculate h for solids and
liquids

Liquids and solids are generally treated as incompressible
substances because their volumes do not change with pressure
or temperature significantly. For liquids and solids, the difference
between the constant-volume specific heat and the constant-
pressure specific heat is typically negligible; therefore,

                                                                                  5.1 Enthalpy | 171
     Example 2

        Consider a piston-cylinder device containing 2 kg of
     oxygen at 300 K, 200 kPa. The piston-cylinder device is
     made of 0.5 kg of aluminum. How much heat is required for
     the oxygen to reach a temperature of 600 K in an isobaric
     process? Assume the oxygen and the piston-cylinder are
     always in thermal equilibrium during the isobaric process.
     The oxygen can be treated as an ideal gas in this heating
     process.

        Solution
        First, set up a closed system as shown outlined in blue,
     which consists of the piston-cylinder and O2.

172 | 5.1 Enthalpy
               Figure 5.1.e1 Piston-cylinder device containing
               oxygen

   Second, apply the first law of thermodynamics to the
closed system. Note that, in the heating process, the
temperatures and internal energies of both O2 and the
piston-cylinder increase.

                                                            and

Third, calculate the change in internal energy of the

piston-cylinder. From Table G3, the constant-pressure

specific heat for aluminum is  = 0.897 kJ/kgK.

                               5.1 Enthalpy | 173
Fourth, analyze the boundary work done by O2 and the

change in internal energy of O2 in this isobaric process,

where                      .

          \begin{align*} \because \; \; W_{O_{2}} &amp;=
       P(\mathbb{V}_2 - \mathbb{V}_1) \; \; \; \; \Delta
       U_{O_{2}} = U_2 - U_1 \\ H &amp;=U+P\
       mathbb{V} \end{align*}

                              (for isobaric

       process)

       From Table G1, the constant-pressure specific

       heat for oxygen is     = 0.918 kJ/kgK.

Last, calculate the total heat transfer in this process.

5.2 Mass and energy
conservation equations in a
control volume

5.2.1 Steady flow and transient flow

An open system allows both mass and energy to transfer across
its boundary. Many thermal devices, such as compressors, turbines,
and heat exchangers have inlets and outlets and can be modelled as
open systems. Figure 5.2.1 is a schematic drawing of an open system
with one inlet and one outlet. A control volume (C.V.), shown as
the dash-lined rectangle in Figure 5.2.1, is selected for the analysis
of the change of properties in the open system. A working fluid
flows into and out of the control volume through the inlet and
outlet. In addition, energy transfer occurs between the system and
its surroundings in the form of heat and work. As a result, both mass
and energy within the control volume may change over time.

If neither the mass nor the energy within the control volume

change with respect to time, i.e.,    and

                     , the flow is called a steady flow. In a steady flow,

the thermodynamic properties within a control volume do not
change with respect to time; but they do not need to remain
uniform everywhere within the control volume. The properties may
vary from point to point, but at any given point, they must remain
the same during the entire process. Many devices may be treated as

176 | 5.2 Mass and energy
conservation equations in a control
steady flow devices after they have been in operation for a certain
period of time under the same operating condition.

In a transient flow, the mass and energy within a control volume

change with respect to time, i.e.,  and

                     . Consequently, other thermodynamic properties

may also change with respect to time. Flow through a device during
its start-up and shut-down periods is usually treated as a transient
flow.

5.2.2 Mass conservation equation

The mass flow rate and volume flow rate are defined as the mass
         5.2 Mass and energy conservation equations in a control volume | 177
and volume of a fluid flowing through an inlet or outlet per unit
time, respectively. They are expressed as

where

       : cross-sectional area of the inlet or outlet, in m2

       : mass of the flow, in kg

       : mass flow rate, in kg/s
       : volume of the flow, in m3
       : volume flow rate, in m3/s

       : average velocity normal to the cross-sectional

area , in m/s
     : density of the working fluid, in kg/m3
     : specific volume of the working fluid, in m3/kg

   The conservation of mass, also called the continuity equation,
states that mass cannot be created or destroyed. The time rate of
change of massin a control volume at a certain time equalsthe
netmass flow rate intothe control volume at that time.

Since  for steady flows, the mass conservation

equation for steady flows is, therefore, written as

178 | 5.2 Mass and energy conservation equations in a control volume
where  and      represent the mass flow rates through the

inlets and outlets of a control volume, respectively.

5.2.3 Energy conservation equation

The exchange of energy between a control volume and its
surroundings is achieved via three mechanisms: (1) heat transfer, (2)
work, and (3) mass transfer. The conservation of energy in a control
volume states that the time rate of change of energyin a control
volume at a certain time equalsthe netrate of energy transfer
intothe control volume at that time via the three mechanisms:heat
transfer, work, and mass transfer.

Since           for steady flows, the energy conservation

equation for steady flows is, therefore, written as

where

       : specific enthalpy, in J/kg
        : mass flow rate, in kg/s

5.3.1 Turbines and compressors

Turbines and compressors are common energy conversion devices,
in which the energy of a working fluid is converted to mechanical
energy or vice versa. A typical turbine consists of rotor blades
attached to a shaft, which is free to rotate. Figure 5.3.1 shows the
main components of a hydraulic turbine. During the operation of
a turbine, a working fluid (e.g., steam, gas, wind or water) flows
continuously over a row of highly curved blades, creating a torque
on the blades. In this process, the energy of the working fluid is
converted to the mechanical energy of the rotating shaft.
Consequently, the pressure and temperature of the fluid gradually
decrease in the turbine. Figure 5.3.2 illustrates the energy
conversion in a wind turbine. The wind energy is first converted to
the mechanical energy of the shaft and gearbox, then converted to
the electrical energy through the generator.

   Compressors work in the opposite way to turbines. Compressors
consume shaft power in order to increase the pressure of a working
fluid, typically a gas. In a dynamic compressor, such as a centrifugal
compressor, the increase of the gas pressure is achieved by forcing
the gas into narrow passages formed by adjacent blades, which
rotate around a shaft. Figure 5.3.3 shows a centrifugal compressor
driven by an electric motor. In a reciprocating compressor, the

                                                             5.3 Applications of the mass and

increase of the gas pressure is achieved by the decrease of the
gas volume as the piston, driven by a crank-shaft, compresses the
gas. Figure 5.3.4 animates the expansion and compression processes
in a reciprocating compressor. In both dynamic and reciprocating
compressors, the mechanical energy of the rotating shaft or crank-
shaft is converted to the energy stored in the fluid. As a result, the
pressure of the fluid increases in the compressor.

Figure 5.3.5 illustrates the flow of energy through a turbine and a

outlet. We may apply the following assumptions to typical turbines
and compressors:

 The flow through a turbine or a compressor is steady.
 The turbine or compressor is well-insulated:

 The changes in potential and kinetic energies are negligible

compared to the change in enthalpy:  ,

With these assumptions, the mass and energy conservation
equations can be simplified as follows,

     this compressor? Apply the following assumptions in your
     analysis: (1) the flow is steady with negligible changes in the
     kinetic and potential energies; (2) the compressor is well-
     insulated; (3) air is an ideal gas; and (4) the process is
     polytropic with n=1.35.

        Solution:
        Analysis: the shaft power of the compressor is
     proportional to the change in enthalpy of air in the
     compressor. Because air is treated as an ideal gas, the
     change in enthalpy can be calculated in terms of the change
     in temperature. Therefore, we need to find the temperature
     at the outlet of the compressor first.
        Air is an ideal gas and the process is polytropic;
     therefore,

        Combine the above two equations and eliminate ,

        Apply the above equation to the process between the
     inlet condition, state 1, and the outlet condition, state 2.
     Note that R is the gas constant of air,

        From Table G1, Cp = 1.005 kJ/kgK for air. Apply the energy
     conservation equation to the compressor considering the
     first two assumptions in the question descriptions.

        The compressor consumes 1.456 kW of power when
     operating under the given conditions.

5.3.2 Throttling valves

Throttling valves are also called thermal expansion valves. They
are used in vapour compression refrigeration systems to regulate
the pressure in the evaporator as well as the superheat of the
refrigerant flowing out of the evaporator. Throttling valves may
be constructed as a porous plug, capillary tubes, or an adjustable
valve such as an orifice, ball, or poppet valve. By restricting the
refrigerant flow through the valve, a considerable pressure drop
can be achieved. As the pressure of the refrigerant decreases, its
corresponding saturation temperature decreases accordingly.

                                                                                 flow devices | 187
Therefore, a phase change often occurs as the refrigerant passes
through a throttling valve. Figure 5.3.6 shows a thermal expansion
valve in a vapour compression refrigeration system. The following
assumptions are commonly used for the analysis of the mass and
energy conservation in a typical throttling valve.

 The flow through a throttling valve is steady.
 The flow through a throttling valve is fast enough so that the

   heat transfer between the refrigerant and its surroundings is
   negligible. Therefore, the flow is commonly treated as
   adiabatic:

 No work exchange occurs between the refrigerant and its
   surroundings:

 The changes in potential and kinetic energies are negligible

compared to the change in enthalpy:  ,

Based on these assumptions, the mass and energy conservation
equations in throttling valves can be written as

where
            : specific enthalpy of the refrigerant, in kJ/kg
              : mass flow rate of the refrigerant through a throttling

       valve, in kg/m3
          Subscripts, i and e, represent the inlet and exit of the

       throttling valve, respectively.

flow by gradually changing their cross-sectional areas. They are
widely used in many engineering systems, such as piping systems,
HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) systems, and steam
and gas engines. Figure 5.3.7 illustrates a turbojet engine, which
consists of a centrifugal compressor, a combustion chamber, a
turbine, and a nozzle section. The gas leaving the turbine is
accelerated in the nozzle section, creating a high velocity jet, and
thus a high thrust.

   The flow in nozzles and diffusers can be subsonic or supersonic.
In this book, we will only discuss subsonic nozzles and subsonic
diffusers; thereafter, the terms "nozzle" and "diffuser" refer to
subsonic nozzle and subsonic diffuser, respectively.

compressor, a combustion chamber, a turbine, and a nozzle section

In a nozzle, the flow velocity increases and the pressure decreases
as the cross-sectional area of the nozzle decreases. On the contrary,

in a diffuser, the flow velocity decreases and the pressure increases
as the cross-sectional area of the diffuser increases. Figure 5.3.8
shows a schematic of a nozzle and a diffuser. The following
assumptions are commonly made when analyzing the mass and
energy conservation in a typical nozzle or diffuser.

   The flow through a nozzle or diffuser is steady.
   The flow through a nozzle or diffuser is fast enough so that the

      heat transfer between the fluid and its surroundings is
      negligible. Therefore, the flow is commonly treated as
      adiabatic:
   No work exchange occurs between the fluid and its
      surroundings:
   The change in potential energy is negligible compared to the
      changes in enthalpy and in kinetic energy:

With these assumptions, the mass and energy conservation
equations in nozzles and diffusers can be written as

   where
               : specific enthalpy of the fluid, in J/kg. Note: J/kg =

          m2/s2.
                 : mass flow rate of the fluid through a nozzle or diffuser,

          in kg/m3
                : velocity of the fluid, in m/s

             Subscripts, i and e, represent the inlet and exit of the
          nozzle or diffuser, respectively.

     Example 3

        The inlet and outlet diameters of a hydrogen nozzle are
     44 mm and 20 mm, respectively. Hydrogen enters the
     nozzle at -30oC, 5 bar, and 2 g/s, and exits the nozzle at 2
     bar. Assuming the process is adiabatic and hydrogen is an
     ideal gas, what is the temperature and velocity of hydrogen
     at the nozzle outlet?

        Solution:
        Analysis: the energy conservation equation provides the
     relationship between the temperature, specific enthalpy,
     and velocity of the hydrogen. We will apply the mass and

 temperature at the nozzle outlet.

        In this nozzle, the velocity increases significantly as the
     pressure decreases. The temperature remains almost
     constant.

        Important note:
          The temperatures in the calculations must be in

             Kelvin because the ideal gas law is used to derive other
             equations.
          The constant-pressure specific heat must be in J/
             kgK to ensure the consistency of the units.

5.3.4 Ducts and pipes

Ducts and pipes are used to transport liquids and gases. Their
configurations vary largely with applications; therefore, it is
impractical to apply general assumptions to all ducts and pipes.
Ducts and pipes may be analyzed specifically with the mass and
energy conservation equations in Section 5.2.

        Consider a vertical pipe section exposed to the ambient.
     The pipe has a constant diameter of 100 mm. Its inlet is 5 m
     above its outlet. Water at 10oC and 100 kPa enters the pipe
     at a velocity of 2 m/s, and exits at 12oC and 100 kPa.
     Assuming steady flow, what is the rate of heat transfer
     absorbed by the water in this pipe section?

        Since the diameter of the pipe section and the density of
     water remain constant in the pipe, the inlet and outlet
     velocity must be the same based on the mass conservation
     equation. From Table G2: Cp =4.181 kJ/kgK = 4181 J/kgK for
     water.

        The water absorbs 130.6 kW of heat from the ambient.

        Important note:
          The constant-pressure specific heat must be in J/

             kgK in the calculations to ensure the consistency of the
             units.

5.3.5 Mixing chambers

Mixing chambers are devices used to mix multiple streams of a
fluid to achieve a desirable temperature or phase in the mixed flow.
Figure 5.3.10 is a schematic of a mixing chamber in HVAC systems,
where the outdoor fresh air mixes with the indoor return air in
order to achieve a desirable air temperature and a targeted fresh air
to return air ratio. The common assumptions for analyzing the mass
and energy conservation in a mixing chamber are listed below:

   The flow through a mixing chamber is steady.

200 | 5.3 Applications of the mass and energy conservation equations in
steady flow devices
   No work exchange occurs between the mixing chamber and its
      surroundings:

   The changes in potential and kinetic energies are negligible:
                         ,

   The pressure variation in a mixing chamber is usually
      negligible.

With these assumptions, the mass and energy conservation
equations in mixing chambers can be written as

where

       : specific enthalpy of the fluid, in kJ/kg
        : mass flow rate, in kg/m3

       : rate of heat transfer entering the mixing chamber, in

       kW
          Subscripts, i and e, represent the inlets and exits of the

       mixing chamber, respectively.

                                                                            flow devices | 201
     Example 5

        Consider a well-insulated mixing chamber in an HVAC
     system, see Figure 5.3.10. The cold outdoor air at -10oC and
     100 kPa mixes with the return air at 22oC and 100 kPa. The
     mass flow rates of the outdoor air and return air are 0.5
     kg/s and 3 kg/s, respectively. Assume the flow is steady
     and the air is an ideal gas under the given conditions. What
     is the air temperature leaving the mixing chamber?

        Solution:
        Apply both mass and energy conservation equations to
     the mixing chamber:

                     \Delta h = C_p \Delta T (for ideal gases)
        From the above three equations,

                     \begin{align*} T_3 &amp;=
                  \dfrac{\dot{m}_{1}T_2 +
                  \dot{m}_{2}T_2}{\dot{m}_1 + \dot{m}_2}
                  \\&amp;= \dfrac{0.5 \times (-10) + 3 \times
                  (22)}{0.5 + 3} = 17.43 \ {}^ \rm{o} \rm{C}
                  \end{align*}
        The mixed air leaves the mixing chamber at a
     temperature of 17.43oC. In this calculation, the
     temperatures can be expressed either in oC or Kelvin as as
     long as the consistent units are used.

5.3.6 Heat exchangers

Heat exchangers are used to transfer heat between two flowing
fluids. They can be found in many applications, such as HVAC
systems, automotive systems, power generation plants, and
chemical processing. Heat exchangers come in different types. For
example, Figure 5.3.11 shows a tube-within-shell heat exchanger,
where heat is transferred between the shell-side fluid and the tube-
side fluid. The tube-within-shell heat exchanger is a typical indirect
heat exchanger, in which the two fluids don't mix during the heat
transfer process.

   Figure 5.3.11 Schematic of a straight tube heat exchanger

Below are the common assumptions for analyzing the mass and
energy conservation in an indirect heat exchanger:

    5.3 Applications of the mass and energy conservation equations in steady
                                                                                flow devices | 203
   The flows through an indirect heat exchanger are steady.
   Each flow passage has only one inlet and one outlet.
   No work exchange occurs between the heat exchanger and its

      surroundings:
   The changes in potential and kinetic energies are negligible:

                         ,
   The pressure variation in a heat exchanger is usually negligible.

With these assumptions, the mass and energy conservation
equations for an indirect heat exchanger can be written as

where

       : specific enthalpy of the fluid, in kJ/kg
        : mass flow rate, in kg/m3

       : rate of heat transfer entering the heat exchanger, in

kW
   Subscripts, i and e, represent the inlet and exit of the heat

exchanger, respectively.
   Subscripts, hot and cold, represent the hot and cold

streams, respectively, through the heat exchanger.

   It is important to note that, although the mass and energy
conservation equations derived for mixing chambers and heat
exchangers look very similar, there exists a major difference
between these two devices. In a mixing chamber, all flow streams
mix and exit as a single stream; therefore, both mass and energy
conservation equations are applied to the entire mixing chamber
consisting of all flow streams. On the contrary, in an indirect heat
exchanger, the cold and hot streams do NOT mix; therefore, the
mass conservation equation must be applied to each flow stream

204 | 5.3 Applications of the mass and energy conservation equations in

individually. The energy conservation equation may be applied to
the entire heat exchanger or each flow stream individually.

     Example 6

        Consider the evaporator of a vapour compression
     refrigeration system using R134a as the working fluid. R134a
     enters the evaporator at -10oC with a quality of 0.1 and exits
     as a saturated vapour. Air enters the evaporator in a
     separate stream at 25oC and exits at 5oC. Assume (1) the
     evaporator is well-insulated; (2) the flow is steady; (3) the
     pressure remains constant in the evaporator; and (4) air is
     an ideal gas. What is the mass flow rate of air required in
     this system if the mass flow rate of R134a is 2 kg/s?

      Figure 5.3.e4 Heat exchanger

        Solution:
        Apply the mass conservation equations to the R134a and
     air streams, separately.

        Apply the energy conservation equation to the
     evaporator.

        Find the specific enthalpies of R134a at states 1 and 2
     using thermodynamic tables.

                  At state 1, T1 = -10oC, x= 0.1. From Table C1, hf =
               186.70 kJ/kg, hg = 392.67 kJ/kg

                  At state 2, R134a is a saturated vapour at T2 =
               -10oC; therefore,

                  From Table G1, Cp,air = 1.005 kJ/kgK. Therefore,

        The system requires an air supply at a rate of 18.445 kg/s.

5.4 Chapter review

In this chapter, we have introduced the mass and energy
conservation equations for control volumes. The general
conservation equations for control volumes are explained in Section
5.2. When applying these conservation principles to a thermal
device, it is important to evaluate the operation of the device, set up
an appropriate control volume, and make appropriate assumptions.
This is an important skill that students need to develop through
practice.

   Section 5.3 demonstrates how to simplify the conservation
equations for common steady-state steady-flow devices such as
turbines and compressors, throttling valves, pipes and ducts,
nozzles and diffusers, mixing chambers, and heat exchangers. It
is important to understand that, the equations in Section 5.3 are
derived for these devices with certain assumptions. When applying
these derived equations to a specific thermal device, a careful
evaluation of the assumptions must be done to ensure the derived
equations are appropriate for the given conditions.

                                                                       5.4 Chapter review | 209

6.0 Chapter introduction and
learning objectives

Heat and work are two forms of energy. From the first law of
thermodynamics, we may say "1 kJ of heat = 1 kJ of work", but how do
we interpret the "=" sign here? Does it mean that heat and work are
equivalent?

   Let us consider a daily example. In winter, you might need an
electric resistance heater to warm up your room. From Figure 6.0.1
(a), the electric charges do work on the resistor as they flow in the
direction of lower electric potential. In this process, the electric
energy from the circuit is converted to heat, which is then
dissipated in your room, or the surroundings. As a result, the room
temperature will tend to rise. If the heater consumes 1 kW of electric
power, it will generate and dissipate approximately 1 kW of heat to
the surroundings. In terms of the amount of energy conversion, we
can safely say that 1 kW of electric energy is no different from 1 kW
of heat. However, is this energy conversion process reversible? If
we simply cool the surroundings and provide 1 kW of heat to the
resistor, is it possible to generate 1 kW of electric power from this
1 kW of heat? Unfortunately, the answers to both questions are no,
see Figure 6.0.1 (b).

Figure 6.0.1 Electric resistance heater illustrating heat-and-work conversion
and irreversible process

This example illustrates an important concept of heat-work
conversion. Although heat and work can be converted between each
other, they are not equivalent. Work can always be converted to
heat completely and directly; but heat cannot be converted to work
completely and directly even under an ideal condition, because heat
is a form of energy of "low" quality (a more "random", "disordered"
system) and work is a form of energy of "high" quality (a highly
"ordered" system). A natural, spontaneous process has a tendency
to move toward a greater degree of randomness or disorder in a
system. Therefore, an energy conversion process in nature tends to
occur in the direction of converting energy from a "high" quality
form to a "low" quality form. The first law of thermodynamics
addresses the heat and work conversion quantitatively, but has no
indication on whether or under what condition such conversion can
actually happen. Satisfying the first law of thermodynamics does not
ensure a process can take place in reality. Whether a process can
happen or not is determined by the second law of thermodynamics.

   This chapter introduces the concepts of reversible and
irreversible processes, Carnot cycles, entropy generation and the
second law of thermodynamics, and the applications of the second
law to both closed and open systems.

6.1 Heat engine

A heat engine is a continuously operating device that produces work
by transferring heat from a heat source (high-temperature body) to
a heat sink (low-temperature body) using a working fluid. In a heat
engine cycle, a working fluid may remain as a single-phase fluid or
experience phase changes.

   A steam engine is a type of heat engine commonly used in steam
power generating plants. It operates on Rankine cycles and uses
water as the working fluid. We will use a steam engine to illustrate
how heat is converted to work in heat engines. A typical steam
engine consists of four main equipment: boiler, turbine, condenser,
and pump, as shown in Figure 6.1.1. The T-s diagram in Figure 6.1.2
illustrates the four processes in a Rankine cycle:

1. Water at a low pressure and a low temperature (state 1) is

pumped to a boiler. The pump consumes power,      , in

order to maintain a continuous supply of water to the boiler

while increasing the pressure of the water entering the boiler

(state 2). Process 1-2 may be assumed adiabatic.

2. In the boiler, the liquid water absorbs heat,  , from an

external heat source and changes into high-temperature, high-

pressure steam (state 3). The pressure drop in the boiler is

usually negligible; therefore, process 2-3 may be assumed

isobaric.

3. The high-temperature, high-pressure steam then expands in

the turbine, making the turbine rotate continuously, and thus

generating mechanical power,                      . During the

expansion process, the temperature and pressure of the steam
decrease. Consequently, the steam leaving the turbine (state 4)
becomes a low-temperature, low-pressure, two-phase mixture.

220 | 6.1 Heat engine
Process 3-4 may be assumed adiabatic.

4. The steam leaving the turbine then enters a condenser and is

condensed to a saturated or compressed liquid (state 1). During

this process, heat,  , is removed from the steam. The

pressure drop in the condenser is usually negligible; therefore,
process 4-1 may be assumed isobaric.

                                                                             6.1 Heat engine | 221
Figure 6.1.2 T-s diagram of a Rankine cycle

Figure 6.1.3 is a simplified schematic for analyzing the energy
conservation in heat engines. Applying the first law of
thermodynamics to the cycle, we can write

\dot{Q}_{H} - \dot{Q}_{L} = \dot{W}_{turbine} -
     \dot{W}_{pump} = \dot{W}_{net, out}

Clearly, the heat removed by the condenser,  , cannot be

converted to useful work. It is wasted in order to complete the cycle.
In other words, a heat engine cannot convert all the heat supplied
by the heat source (e.g., boiler) to useful work, even under ideal
conditions. Thermal efficiency is a dimensionless parameter used to
measure the performance of a heat engine.

HE1 and HE2, respectively. In stage 1, the steam absorbs

heat,  , from the boiler and generates a power,                       . A

portion of the exhaust steam from stage 1 then enters stage

2, further generating a power,  . The remaining exhaust

steam from stage 1 is used to preheat the feed water. If the

thermal efficiencies of the two turbine stages are

cycle as a function of     and  ? Assume 90% of the

exhaust steam exiting from stage 1 enters stage 2 and

6.2 Refrigerator and heat
pump

6.2.1 Refrigerator

A refrigerator is a cyclic device, which absorbs heat from a heat sink
and reject heat to a heat source by consuming work. The working
fluid is called refrigerant, which usually undergoes phase changes in
the cycle.

   A typical vapour-compression refrigeration system consists of
mainly four pieces of equipment, as shown in Figure 6.2.1:

 1. An evaporator, through which the low-pressure, low-
      temperature refrigerant absorbs heat from a heat sink (e.g., a
      freezer compartment or a space to be refrigerated) and changes
      from a two-phase mixture to a saturated or superheated
      vapour.

2. A compressor, which is used to increase the pressure and
      temperature of the refrigerant vapour by consuming work.

3. A condenser, through which heat is rejected to a heat source
      (e.g. kitchen or outdoor air). At the exit of the condenser, the
      refrigerant is typically a two-phase mixture or a liquid.

4. An expansion valve, which is used to reduce the pressure and
      temperature of the refrigerant in order to achieve a liquid-
      vapour mixture of desirable quality at the exit of the expansion
      valve.

228 | 6.2 Refrigerator and heat pump
Figure 6.2.1 Vapor compression refrigeration cycle consisting of a compressor,
condenser, expansion device, and evaporator

As heat cannot be transferred from a low-temperature body to a
high-temperature body spontaneously in nature, refrigerators must
consume work in order to operate between a heat sink and a heat
source, even under ideal conditions.

   Figure 6.2.2 is a schematic for analyzing the energy conservation
in a refrigerator. The same schematic may be used to represent a
heat pump by replacing the notation "Ref" with "HP" in the circular
area.

                   pump)

Applying the first law of thermodynamics to the cycle, we can write

The main purpose of refrigerators is to remove heat, , from

a heat sink (cold space); therefore, we are interested in the amount

of heat that can be removed per unit of power consumption. The

dimensionless ratio of                is called the coefficient of

performance,            , of the refrigerator. It is an indicator of the

performance of a refrigerator.

              ; therefore,                 in a well-designed

refrigerator. A higher      indicates a better performance.

6.2.2 Heat pump

A heat pump uses the same vapour compression refrigeration cycle,
see Figure 6.2.1, as a refrigerator. It absorbs heat from a heat sink
(e.g., outdoor air in the winter) and delivers (more) heat to a heat
source (e.g., indoor air) by consuming work. Applying the first law
of thermodynamics to the heat pump cycle, we can derive

Different from refrigerators, the main purpose of heat pumps is

to add heat,     , to a heat source, such as an indoor space of a

building. Therefore, we are interested in the amount of heat,  ,

that can be transferred from the condenser to the heat source per
unit power consumption. The dimensionless ratio of

is called the coefficient of performance,  , of heat pump.

depend on the changes of enthalpies in these devices. First,
determine the specific enthalpy of each state from Tables
B1 and B2.

        From Table B2, h1 = 1603.63 kJ/kg.

     State 4, evaporator inlet: P4 = 0.2 MPa. Typically, the
        expansion valve is assumed well-insulated; therefore,

6.3 The second law of
thermodynamics:
Kelvin-Planck and Clausius
statements

The first law of thermodynamics focuses on energy conservation.
It does not describe any restrictions or possibilities for a process
to take place. A process satisfying the first law of thermodynamics
may or may not be achievable in reality. In fact, whether a process
is possible is governed by both the first and the second laws of
thermodynamics. There are two classical statements of the second
law of thermodynamics; one imposes the limits on the operation of
heat engines, and the other on the operation of refrigerators and
heat pumps.

Kelvin-Planck Statement: it is impossible for any device that

operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and

produce only a net amount of work. Figure 6.3.1 illustrates the

Kelvin-Planck statement. Any device violating the Kelvin-Planck

statement would produce a net work output equivalent to the

amount of the heat received by the device, or  , thus

resulting in a thermal efficiency              .

thermodynamics: Kelvin-Planck and
Figure 6.3.1 Schematic illustrating
Kelvin-Planck statement

Clausius statement: it is impossible to construct a device that

operates in a cycle and produces no effect other than the transfer of

heat from a lower-temperature body to a higher-temperature body.

Figure 6.3.2 illustrates the Clausius statement. Any device violating

the Clausius statement would have zero work input and nonzero

heat transfer received and delivered by the device, or     ,

, and thus a                                            .

                                                                      statements | 237

                      illustrating the Clausius
                      statement

Although the Kelvin-Planck and Clausius statements refer to
different cycles, they are equivalent in their consequences. Any
device that violates the Kelvin-Planck statement must violate the
Clausius statement, and vice versa.

Let us consider a combined system, which consists of a heat

pump and an imagined engine operating between a heat source at

a higher temperature  and a heat sink at a lower temperature

, as shown in Figure 6.3.3.

238 | 6.3 The second law of thermodynamics: Kelvin-Planck and Clausius
statements
1. Let us assume the imagined engine violates the Kelvin-Planck

statement; therefore, it can convert all of the heat absorbed

from the heat source to useful power, or  . The power

generated from the imagined engine is then used to drive the

heat pump.

2. For the heat pump,                     . Therefore, the heat

released by the heat pump to the heat source is
                               .

3. Applying the first law to the heat pump, the heat absorbed
     by the heat pump from the heat sink must be
                                                                  .

4. Now let us compare the net heat absorbed by the combined

system from the heat sink,                , and the

net heat rejected by the combined system to the heat source,
                                                . They are exactly the same!

What the combined system does is to transfer heat from the
heat sink (lower-temperature body) to the heat source (higher-
temperature body) without consuming any power at all!

It is apparent that the combined system violates the Clausius
statement because the imagined engine violates the Kelvin-Planck
statement. Since the Kelvin-Planck and Clausius statements are
equivalent, both of them may be used to describe the second law of
thermodynamics.

   A real process or device must satisfy both the first and the second
laws of thermodynamics: the first law sets a constraint on the
amount of energy that must be conserved in a process or a device;
the second law indicates whether a process is possible in reality.
Any device that violates either the first or the second law is called
a perpetual-motion machine, which attempts to produce work from
nothing or convert heat completely to useful work. In fact, no
perpetual-motion machine can actually work.

6.4.1 Irreversibilities

The Kelvin-Planck and Clausius statements of the second law

indicate that for heat engines,  , and for refrigerators and

heat pumps,                      . But can           and

             in an ideal condition? How is an ideal process or

cycle defined? What is the theoretical limit of  or  in

an ideal cycle? To answer these questions, we will first need to
understand the concepts of reversible processes and
irreversibilities.

   A reversible process is a process that can be reversed without
leaving any change in either the system or its surroundings, which
means both the system and its surroundings always return to their
original states during a reversible process. A fictitious, frictionless
pendulum can be treated as a reversible process, see Figure 6.4.1; it
will never stop and always returns to its original state. However, in
reality, friction always exists. A pendulum will gradually slow down
and eventually stop.

                     Figure 6.4.1 Frictionless pendulum as an
                     example of a reversible process

Factors that render a process irreversible are called
irreversibilities. Friction, unrestrained expansion, mixing of fluids,
heat transfer through a finite temperature difference, electric
resistance, inelastic deformation of solids, and chemical reactions
are some examples of irreversibilities. All processes occurring in
nature are irreversible due to the existence of irreversibilities. Some
processes are more irreversible than others. A reversible process is
commonly used as an idealized model to which an actual process
can be compared. The efficiency of a reversible process is the
theoretical limit that an actual, irreversible process can possibly
achieve in a nearly ideal condition.

only reversible processes, it produces the maximum power output

and has the maximum thermal efficiency among all heat engines

operating between the same heat source at     and the same heat

sink at . The thermal efficiency of a Carnot heat engine can be

expressed as

where
                : absolute temperature of the heat source, in Kelvin
               : absolute temperature of the heat sink, in Kelvin
                 : heat supplied by the heat source to the Carnot heat

       engine, in kJ
                : heat rejected from the Carnot heat engine to the

       heat sink, in kJ
                      : thermal efficiency of the Carnot heat engine,

       dimensionless

The thermodynamic temperature scale, or absolute temperature

scale is defined so that                   .

   In summary, the thermal efficiency of an actual heat engine is
always less than that of the Carnot heat engine. It is impossible for
any heat engine to achieve a better performance than the Carnot
heat engine operating between the same heat source at and the
same heat sink at .

For a heat engine operating between a heat source at  and

a heat sink at , either increasing           or decreasing  can

improve its thermal efficiency. In practice, much effort is made

to increase the temperature of the heat source  within the

material limits because the temperature of the heat sink    is

usually constrained by the ambient temperature. In many large

steam power plants, the temperature of the inlet steam (heat
source) is in the range of 300~600oC (573~873 K) in order to improve

the thermal efficiency of the heat engines.

Example 1

   Consider a proposal to build a 500-MW steam power
plant operating on a Rankine cycle by a lake. The steam
generated by the boiler is at 250캜. The condenser is to be
cooled by the lake water at a flow rate of 20 m3/s. As the
cooling water will be discharged to the lake, the design
team needs to evaluate its impact on the local aquatic
ecosystem. Assume the cooling water supplied from the
lake to the condenser is at a constant temperature of 18캜.

   1. If the cycle were reversible (Carnot cycle), what is
        the thermal efficiency of the power plant? Estimate
        the temperature rise of the discharge water to the
        lake.

   2. If the cycle were reversible (Carnot cycle), and the
        steam temperature increases to 300oC, how would the
        thermal efficiency of the power plant change?

   3. The above two scenarios are ideal Carnot cycles.
        In fact, the projected thermal efficiency of the actual

                                                                   6.4 Carnot cycles | 249
             cycle is about 35%. Estimate the temperature rise of
             the discharge water to the lake in this case.

           Figure 6.4.e1 A schematic of a Carnot heat engine. Heat is
           rejected to a nearby lake.
        Solution:
        1. The power plant is assumed to operate on a Carnot
     cycle between a heat source at the steam temperature of
     TH = 250캜 and a heat sink at the cooling water
     temperature of TL = 18캜. The thermal efficiency of the
     Carnot cycle is

                                                    and

   Therefore, the heat rejected to the discharge water to the
lake is

From Table G2, Cp = 4.181 kJ/kgK for water, and the

density of water is  ; therefore,

   2. For a Carnot cycle with TH = 300캜 and TL = 18캜,

   Comment:
   Compare the two Carnot cycles, increasing the heat
source temperature TH can increase the thermal efficiency
of the cycle. Similarly, decreasing the heat sink temperature
TL can also increase the thermal efficiency of the cycle.

   3. The thermal efficiency of an actual cycle is always less
than that of the Carnot cycle operating between the same

                                                                    6.4 Carnot cycles | 251
     heat source and heat sink. If the projected thermal
     efficiency of the actual cycle is 35%, then the heat absorbed
     by the discharge water will be

        The temperature rise of the discharge water will be

        Comment:
        The actual cycle will cause a much higher temperature
     rise in the discharge water than the Carnot cycle due to the
     existence of the irreversibilities. A large amount of heat
     rejection to the lake could have a negative impact on the
     aquatic life and should be monitored closely.

6.4.3 Carnot refrigerator and Carnot heat pump

   If the four processes, compression, evaporation, expansion and
condensation, in a vapour-compression refrigeration system are
all reversible, the cycle is reversible and is called the Carnot
refrigeration cycle. A refrigerator or a heat pump operating in such
a cycle is called a Carnot refrigerator or a Carnot heat pump.

   Among all refrigerators (or heat pumps) operating between the

252 | 6.4 Carnot cycles
same heat source at     and the same heat sink at , the Carnot

refrigerator (or heat pump) consumes the least amount of power,

thus achieving the highest coefficient of performance,

       or               , as expressed below:

 Carnot refrigerator:

 Carnot heat pump:

where

                     : coefficient of performance of a Carnot

       refrigerator, dimensionless
                                : coefficient of performance of a Carnot

       heat pump, dimensionless
                : absolute temperature of the heat source, in Kelvin

       : absolute temperature of the heat sink, in Kelvin

Example 2

   A heat pump provides 20 kW of heating to a house in
winter. The house must be maintained at 24oC. If the COP
of the heat pump is 5.5, and the outdoor temperature is
0oC, answer the following questions.

    1. How much power is required to drive the heat

                                                                    6.4 Carnot cycles | 253
             pump? Compare the power consumption of this heat
             pump and an electric resistance heater providing the
             same amount of heating to the house.
        2. If the cycle were a Carnot cycle, what would the
             power consumption be?
        3. If the outdoor temperature decreases, will the COP
             of the heat pump increase, remain the same, or
             decrease?

                         Figure 6.4.e2 Schematic of a heat pump

        Solution:
     1. The heat pump provides 20 kW of heating to the house;
     therefore,

254 | 6.4 Carnot cycles
   If an electric resistance heater is used to provide 20 kW
of heating to the house, the electric resistance heater will
consume 20 kW of electric power, assuming the efficiency
of the heater is 100%. Therefore,

   Compare the power consumption of the heat pump and
electric heater, using heat pump will save 16.354 kW of
power.

   2. If the cycle were a Carnot cycle,

   The actual cycle achieves a much smaller COP and
consumes a much greater power than the Carnot cycle due
to the irreversibilities.

   3. Since

                                                                    6.4 Carnot cycles | 255
As  is a constant room temperature,

will decrease if the outdoor temperature decreases.

Because the Carnot cycle always has the maximum COP
compared to any real cycle operating between the same
heat source and heat sink, the COP of a real heat pump will
also decrease if the outdoor temperature decreases;
therefore, heat pumps are preferably used in mild winter
conditions.

6.5.1 The inequality of Clausius

The inequality of Clausius states that for any cycle, reversible or
irreversible, there exists the following relation:

where      represents the differential amount of heat transfer

into or out of a system through an infinitesimal part of the system

boundary.  is positive for heat transfer into the system and

is negative for heat transfer out of the system. is the absolute

temperature at the infinitesimal part of the system boundary, where

the heat transfer occurs. The cyclic integral symbol indicates

that the integration must be done for the entire cycle. In other
words, all heat transfer into and out of the system, as well as their
corresponding boundary temperatures, must be considered in the
integral.

The inequality of Clausius applies to all cycles. We will prove it

by using the heat engine cycle, Figure 6.1.3, as an example. For

a reversible heat engine cycle operating between a heat source

at a constant temperature of   and a heat sink at a constant

temperature of , the cyclic integral can be written as

Note that for a reversible cycle,

Therefore, the following equation exists for a reversible cycle.

For an irreversible cycle operating between the same two heat

reservoirs at constant temperatures of  and , we assume

that the heat absorbed from the heat source,  , remains the

same as that in the reversible cycle,

                                              and

                                                   and

   Therefore,

                       Q_L}{T_L}\right)_{irrev} =
                       \left(\dfrac{Q_H}{T_H}\right)_{irrev} -
                       \left(\dfrac{Q_L}{T_L}\right)_{irrev} &lt; 0
   Now, we have proven the inequality of Clausius for heat engine
cycles. A similar procedure may be applied to prove the inequality of
Clausius for refrigerator and heat pump cycles.

6.5.2 Definition of entropy

Why is the inequality of Clausius important? The cyclic integral is
either equal to or less than zero depending on the nature of the
cycle: reversible or irreversible. The inequality of Clausius provides
a basis for introducing the concepts of entropy and entropy
generation. Both concepts are important in the second law of
thermodynamics.

260 | 6.5 Entropy and entropy generation
          Figure 6.5.1 A reversible cycle consisting of path A and path B
Let us apply the inequality of Clausius to a reversible cycle
consisting of two reversible processes 1 2 via path A and 2 1 via
path B, see Figure 6.5.1.

   The above equation indicates that the integral between the two
states 1 and 2 of any reversible processes depends only on the two

                                                6.5 Entropy and entropy generation | 261
states, not on the paths; therefore, the integral

is a state function and must be related to a thermodynamic
property. We define such thermodynamic property as entropy, ,
and the change in entropy between two states can be expressed as

   The infinitesimal change of entropy in a reversible process can
thus be written as

where is the entropy and is the absolute temperature. The

common SI units for entropy are kJ/K or J/K. It is important to note

that entropy, , is a state function;      in a process depends on

the initial and final states, not on the path of the process.

Entropy is an extensive property; its corresponding intensive

property is called specific entropy,      , and its common SI

units are kJ/kgK or J/kgK.

   Entropy generation is another important concept in the second
law of thermodynamics. Let us consider a cycle consisting of two
processes; process 2 1 is a reversible process and process 1 2
can be any process, either reversible or irreversible, see Figure 6.5.2.
We will apply the definition of entropy and the inequality of Clausius
in the following derivations.

We may change the above inequality to an equation by

introducing entropy generation,  , to the right side;

reversible processes, and the " " sign for irreversible processes.

                       \hspace{3em} \left( \delta S_{gen} \ge 0\right)

Figure 6.5.2 A cycle consisting of reversible and/or irreversible processes for
introducing entropy generation

It is important to note that  and         are different concepts.

 Entropy generation,         , is a measure of the irreversibilities

in a process.       is NOT a property of the system. It depends

on the path of a process; the more irreversible a process is, the

larger         is.

 Entropy is a thermodynamic property of the system. It is a

268 | 6.5 Entropy and entropy generation
state function.  depends on the initial and final states only,

not on the path of a process.

 In general,          .       may be positive or negative,

but  must be positive for irreversible processes or zero for

reversible processes.

Why is entropy generation important? how does it play a role in the

universe? The universe is everything, including all the matter and

energy that could possibly exist in all space and time. We may treat

the universe as an isolated system because nothing exists outside

the universe. From the entropy generation,  , we can

prove that the entropy in the universe always increases due to the
existence of irreversibilities in nature and in all human activities.

          Figure 6.5.3 The universe as an isolated system

Let us define a system in the universe and everything outside the
system boundary as the surroundings, see Figure 6.5.3. The change
of entropy in the universe can be written as

                                               6.5 Entropy and entropy generation | 269
where                          , and  represent the changes

of entropy in the universe, the system, and its surroundings,
respectively.

   The change of entropy in the universe can be written in terms of
entropy generation as

                                          and

Since the universe is an isolated system, heat transfer across the

universe boundary              . In addition, since all real processes

happening in the universe are irreversible, we can drop the " " sign

in the inequality; therefore,

   The above relation indicates that the entropy generation in the
universe is always a positive number due to the irreversibilities in
all real processes. As a result, the entropy in the universe always
increases. This concept can be expressed in a general format as
follows if we divide the universe into a number of subsystems.

   where           is the change of entropy in the subsystem, i, in
the universe.

The second law of thermodynamics was previously described with
the Kelvin-Planck and Clausius statements. In fact, any device that
violates the Kelvin-Planck or Clausius statements must have

                 .

   Take a heat pump as an example. We may prove that any heat
pump that violates the Clausius statement would have

. A heat pump that violates the Clausius statement would have
                     from the first law of thermodynamics, see Figure

the initial and final states are the same; therefore,  . The

change of entropy in the heat pump cycle can be expressed as

6.6 The second law of
thermodynamics for closed
systems

The change of entropy in a system is caused by entropy transfer and
entropy generation.

   Entropy can be transferred to a system via two mechanisms: (1)
heat transfer and (2) mass transfer. It is noted that work is a form of
energy transfer; it does NOT contribute to entropy transfer!

   For a closed system, entropy is transferred only by heat transfer,
see Figure 6.6.1; therefore, the second law of thermodynamics for
a closed system undergoing a process from states 1 to 2 can be
written as

This equation is also referred to as the entropy balance equation

for closed systems. The integral  represents the entropy

transfer caused by the heat transfer between the system and its
surroundings (i.e., heat source and heat sink). Because this integral
is difficult to calculate, a common practice is to approximate it

with  , where  is the heat transfer that takes place

at location of the system boundary, which has a constant
temperature of . If heat transfer occurs in multiple locations,

thermodynamics for closed systems

which represents the temperature of the system boundary or the
surroundings if the boundary and the surroundings are in thermal
equilibrium. is NOT the temperature of the system itself!

   The entropy balance equation is often used together with the first

6.7.1 Determining the specific entropy of pure
substances by using thermodynamic tables

The specific entropy of a pure substance can be found from

thermodynamic tables if the tables are available. The procedures are

explained in Section 2.4. In addition to the  and

diagrams, the  diagram is commonly used to illustrate the

relation between temperature and specific entropy of a pure

substance. Figure 6.7.1 shows the  diagram for water.

   Solution:

   From Table A1: T = 250 oC, = 0.001252 m3/kg, =
0.050083 m3/kg

   Since v_f &lt; v &lt; v_g, water at the given state is a
two phase mixture; the saturation pressure is Psat = 3976.17

   The quality is

The specific entropy is

278 | 6.7 Specific entropy of a state
   From Table C1: by examining the saturation pressures at
0 oC and - 5 oC, we can estimate that the saturation
pressure for T = -2 oC is about 270 kPa; therefore, R134a at
the given state is a superheated vapour.

   From Table C2,
             P = 100 kPa, T = -10 oC, = 0.207433 m3/ kg, =

          1.7986 kJ/kgK
             P = 100 kPa, T = 0 oC, = 0.216303 m3/ kg, =

A rigid tank contains 3 kg of R134a initially at 0oC, 200

kPa. R134a is now cooled until its temperature drops to

-20oC. Determine the change in entropy,   , of R134a

during this process. Is                ?

Solution:

   The initial state is at T1 = 0oC and P1 =200 kPa. From Table
C2 in Appendix C,

           = 1.7654 kJ/kgK, = 0.104811 m3/kg

The tank is rigid; therefore, = = 0.104811 m3/kg.

From Table C1, at T2 = -20oC:

           = 0.000736 m3/kg,           = 0.147395 m3/kg

           = 0.9002 kJ/kgK,            = 1.7413 kJ/kgK

   Because v_f &lt; v_2 &lt; v_g, the final state is a two-
phase mixture.

The total entropy change is

It is important to note that              in general.

The total entropy of R134a decreases in this cooling
process, but the entropy generation is always greater than
zero in a real process.

6.7.2 Determining the specific entropy of solids
and liquids

The specific entropy of a solid or a liquid depends mainly on the
temperature. The change of specific entropy in a process from
states 1 to 2 can be calculated as,

where

liquids,  . Table G2 and Table G3 list the specific

heats of selected solids and liquids, respectively.

6.7.3 Determining the specific entropy of ideal
gases

The specific entropy of an ideal gas is a function of both
temperature and pressure. Here we will introduce a simplified
method for calculating the change of the specific entropy of an ideal
gas in a process by assuming constant specific heats. This method is
reasonably accurate for a process undergoing a small temperature
change.

Solution:

process.

6.7.4 Isentropic relations for an ideal gas

   If a process is reversible and adiabatic, it is called an isentropic
process and its entropy remains constant. An isentropic process is
an idealized process. It is commonly used as a basis for evaluating
real processes. The concept of isentropic applies to all substances
including ideal gases. The following isentropic relations, however,
are ONLY valid for ideal gases.

ideal gases can be found in Table G1.

It is noted that the isentropic relation                  for

ideal gases is actually a special case of the polytropic relation

       with                               .

The first and second laws of thermodynamics are often used
together with the thermodynamic tables or ideal gas equations in
thermal analysis. The following strategy may be adapted when
solving problems requiring the second law of thermodynamics:

1. Identify the process(es), e.g., isobaric, isothermal, isochoric, or

isentropic process.

2. Determine the initial, final, and any intermediate states. Find

the properties, such as,              , by using the

     thermodynamic tables or equations, e.g., for an ideal gas, solid,
     or liquid.
3. Determine the heat transfer, , or other unknowns by applying

the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems.

4. Determine the entropy generation,  , or other unknowns

by applying the second law of thermodynamics for closed
systems.

thermodynamics for open
systems

   Entropy can be transferred to a system via two mechanisms: (1)
heat transfer and (2) mass transfer. For open systems, the second
law of thermodynamics is often written in the rate form; therefore,
we are interested in the time rate of entropy transfer due to heat
transfer and mass transfer.

laws of thermodynamics are often used together with the continuity
equation and the thermodynamic tables or the ideal gas equation.
The following strategy may be adapted:

1. Set up a proper control volume to enclose the device of
     interest and identify the flow condition, i.e., steady or transient
     flow, through the control volume.

2. Determine the relations among the mass flow rates at the
     inlet(s) and outlet(s) by using the continuity equation.

3. Find the fluid properties at the inlet(s) and outlet(s), such as,
                           , by using the thermodynamic tables or

     equations, e.g., for an ideal gas, solid or liquid.
4. Determine the rate of heat transfer, , or other unknowns by

applying the first law of thermodynamics for open systems;

5. Determine the rate of entropy generation,  , or other

unknowns by applying the second law of thermodynamics for
open systems.

   Solution:
   The control volume is set up to enclose both the heat
pump and heat exchanger, as shown in Figure 6.10.e2.
   From Table C1, we can tell that, at the given pressures

both the inlet and the outlet of the heat exchanger. The
specific enthalpies and specific entropies of R134a can be

          At the outlet, P2 = 300 kPa, T2 = 50oC; therefore, h2

   Comment:

   The rate of entropy generation in this control volume
(consisting of both heat exchanger and heat pump) is
positive; therefore, it is very likely that this setup can work
in reality, and the processes in the heat exchanger and heat
pump are irreversible.

   To further verify this, we can calculate the rate of
entropy generation for each individual device, i.e., heat
exchanger and heat pump, separately. However, with the
given information, there exists a challenge to evaluate the
amount of entropy transfer due to the heat transfer
provided by the heat pump to the heat exchanger. Strictly

speaking,  should be evaluated because the

temperature of the heat exchanger varies, leading to a
possible variation of temperature, , at the boundary
between the heat pump and the heat exchanger. The
relation between the instantaneous rate of heat transfer
from the heat pump to the heat exchanger, , and the

boundary temperature,  , must be obtained to enable a
detailed analysis.

   Here, let us perform a simplified calculation to
demonstrate the concept. Assume that remains
constant as the average temperature between the inlet and
the outlet of the heat exchanger, thus

                                             .

Apply the second law of thermodynamics to the heat

for the heat pump cycle.

   Furthermore, the COP of the Carnot cycle operating
between the heat sink of 280 K and the heat source of
308.15 K is

                 COP_{HP, rev} = \dfrac{308.15}{308.15-280}=10.9
             &gt; 5=COP_{HP}

Because                         and

                                , this heat pump cycle is an

irreversible, realistic cycle.

   Similarly, let us apply the second law of thermodynamics
to the heat exchanger.

Because                         , the process in this heat

exchanger is almost ideal and reversible. It is noted that
heat losses are typically unavoidable in real devices, but
they are not considered in this example. Due to heat losses
from the heat exchanger, the real process will have

                       . Consequently, the outlet temperature
may not be able to reach 50oC.

   Consider an adiabatic two-stage compressor having an
intercooler, as shown in Figure 6.10.e3.

     Air at 10캜, 101 kPa enters the first stage of the
        compressor and is compressed to 300 kPa, 150캜.

     After being cooled to 30캜 in a well-insulated
        intercooler, the air then enters the second stage
        cylinder and is compressed to 900 kPa.

negligible, (2) air is an ideal gas, and (3) the two compression
processes are polytropic with the same polytropic
exponent. Determine

6.11 Chapter review

In this chapter, we have introduced two statements of the second
law of thermodynamics including the Kelvin-Planck statement and
the Clausius statement, and the ideal model of Carnot cycles. These
concepts establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the best
possible performance, in terms of the thermal efficiency or COP, of
heat engines, refrigerators, or heat pumps operating between two
heat reservoirs.

   The second law of thermodynamics can be expressed in terms
of entropy generation. Due to the existence of irreversibilities, a
real process or cycle always proceeds in the direction that obeys

                 . For an ideal, reversible process or cycle, such as the

Carnot cycles,         . Any real or ideal process or cycle must

satisfy both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics.

   The first and second laws of thermodynamics are often used
together with the thermodynamic tables or ideal gas equations in
thermal analysis. When applying the second law of thermodynamics
for closed or open systems, it is important to write an appropriate
entropy balance equation. Entropy, entropy transfer, and entropy
generation are three important concepts in the entropy balance
equation. They have different physical meanings.

 Entropy is a measure of the degree of the "randomness" or

"disorder" of a system. It is a thermodynamic property of the

system and a state function. The change of entropy,            , in

a process only depends on the initial and final states of the

process.

 Entropy generation,  , is a measure of the irreversibilities

in a process. It is not a property of the system. It depends on the
path of a process; the more irreversible a process is, the larger

                       6.11 Chapter review | 319
               is.
   Entropy transfer always accompanies mass transfer and heat

      transfer in a process or a cycle. Entropy transfer is a boundary
      phenomenon. It relates to the mass flow rate or heat transfer
      across the system boundary, as well as the temperature of the
      boundary.

Absolute pressure

      Absolute pressure is a pressure that is measured relative to
      an ideal reference, or absolute vacuum. It is the sum of the
      atmospheric pressure and the gauge pressure. Absolute
      pressure is ALWAYS a positive number.

Absolute temperature

      Absolute temperature, also called thermodynamic temperature,
      is the temperature expressed on the Kelvin or Rankine scale.
      Absolute zero (0 K or 0 R) is the minimum possible temperature.
      Matter at absolute zero is in the state of lowest possible
      (minimum) energy.

Adiabatic process

      An adiabatic process is a process, in which heat transfer does
      NOT occur between a system and its surroundings.
