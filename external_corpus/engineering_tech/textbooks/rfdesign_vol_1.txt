Preface

The book series Microwave and RF Design is a comprehensive treatment
of radio frequency (RF) and microwave design with a modern "systems-
first" approach. A strong emphasis on design permeates the series with
extensive case studies and design examples. Design is oriented towards
cellular communications and microstrip design so that lessons learned can
be applied to real-world design tasks. The books in the Microwave and RF
Design series are:

    · Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems, Volume 1
    · Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines, Volume 2
    · Microwave and RF Design: Networks, Volume 3
    · Microwave and RF Design: Modules, Volume 4
    · Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators, Volume 5

The length and format of each is suitable for automatic printing and binding.

Rationale

The central philosophy behind this series's popular approach is that the
student or practicing engineer will develop a full appreciation for RF and
microwave engineering and gain the practical skills to perform system-
level design decisions. Now more than ever companies need engineers with
an ingrained appreciation of systems and armed with the skills to make
system decisions. One of the greatest challenges facing RF and microwave
engineering is the increasing level of abstraction needed to create innovative
microwave and RF systems. This book series is organized in such a way that
the reader comes to understand the impact that system-level decisions have
on component and subsystem design. At the same time, the capabilities of
technologies, components, and subsystems impact system design. The book
series is meticulously crafted to intertwine these themes.

Audience

The book series was originally developed for three courses at North
Carolina State University. One is a final-year undergraduate class, another an
introductory graduate class, and the third an advanced graduate class. Books
in the series are used as supplementary texts in two other classes. There
are extensive case studies, examples, and end of chapter problems ranging
from straight-forward to in-depth problems requiring hours to solve. A
companion book, Fundamentals of Microwave and RF Design, is more suitable
for an undergraduate class yet there is a direct linkage between the material
in this book and the series which can then be used as a career-long reference
text. I believe it is completely understandable for senior-level students
where a microwave/RF engineering course is offered. The book series is a
comprehensive RF and microwave text and reference, with detailed index,
appendices, and cross-references throughout. Practicing engineers will find
the book series a valuable systems primer, a refresher as needed, and a
vi  PREFACE

    reference tool in the field. Additionally, it can serve as a valuable, accessible
    resource for those outside RF circuit engineering who need to understand
    how they can work with RF hardware engineers.

    Organization
       This book is a volume in a five volume series on RF and microwave

    design. The first volume in the series, Microwave and RF Design: Radio
    Systems, addresses radio systems mainly following the evolution of cellular
    radio. A central aspect of microwave engineering is distributed effects
    considered in the second volume of this book series, Microwave and RF
    Design: Transmission Lines. Here transmission lines are treated as supporting
    forward- and backward-traveling voltage and current waves and these
    are related to electromagnetic effects. The third volume, Microwave and RF
    Design: Networks, covers microwave network theory which is the theory
    that describes power flow and can be used with transmission line effects.
    Topics covered in Microwave and RF Design: Modules, focus on designing
    microwave circuits and systems using modules introducing a large number
    of different modules. Modules is just another term for a network but the
    implication is that is is packaged and often available off-the-shelf. Other
    topics that are important in system design using modules are considered
    including noise, distortion, and dynamic range. Most microwave and RF
    designers construct systems using modules developed by other engineers
    who specialize in developing the modules. Examples are filter and amplifier
    modules which once designed can be used in many different systems. Much
    of microwave design is about maximizing dynamic range, minimizing noise,
    and minimizing DC power consumption. The fifth volume in this series,
    Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators, considers amplifier and
    oscillator design and develops the skills required to develop modules.

    Volume 1: Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems

    The first book of the series covers RF systems. It describes system concepts
    and provides comprehensive knowledge of RF and microwave systems.
    The emphasis is on understanding how systems are crafted from many
    different technologies and concepts. The reader gains valuable insight into
    how different technologies can be traded off in meeting system requirements.
    I do not believe this systems presentation is available anywhere else in such
    a compact form.

    Volume 2: Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines

    This book begins with a chapter on transmission line theory and introduces
    the concepts of forward- and backward-traveling waves. Many examples are
    included of advanced techniques for analyzing and designing transmission
    line networks. This is followed by a chapter on planar transmission lines
    with microstrip lines primarily used in design examples. Design examples
    illustrate some of the less quantifiable design decisions that must be made.
    The next chapter describes frequency-dependent transmission line effects
    and describes the design choices that must be taken to avoid multimoding.
    The final chapter in this volume addresses coupled-lines. It is shown how to
    design coupled-line networks that exploit this distributed effect to realize
    novel circuit functionality and how to design networks that minimize
    negative effects. The modern treatment of transmission lines in this volume
    emphasizes planar circuit design and the practical aspects of designing
PREFACE                                                                          vii

around unwanted effects. Detailed design of a directional coupler is used
to illustrate the use of coupled lines. Network equivalents of coupled lines
are introduced as fundamental building blocks that are used later in the
synthesis of coupled-line filters. The text, examples, and problems introduce
the often hidden design requirements of designing to mitigate parasitic
effects and unwanted modes of operation.

Volume 3: Microwave and RF Design: Networks

Volume 3 focuses on microwave networks with descriptions based on S
parameters and ABCD matrices, and the representation of reflection and
transmission information on polar plots called Smith charts. Microwave
measurement and calibration technology are examined. A sampling of
the wide variety of microwave elements based on transmission lines is
presented. It is shown how many of these have lumped-element equivalents
and how lumped elements and transmission lines can be combined as a
compromise between the high performance of transmission line structures
and the compactness of lumped elements. This volume concludes with an
in-depth treatment of matching for maximum power transfer. Both lumped-
element and distributed-element matching are presented.

Volume 4: Microwave and RF Design: Modules

Volume 4 focuses on the design of systems based on microwave modules.
The book considers the wide variety of RF modules including amplifiers,
local oscillators, switches, circulators, isolators, phase detectors, frequency
multipliers and dividers, phase-locked loops, and direct digital synthesizers.
The use of modules has become increasingly important in RF and microwave
engineering. A wide variety of passive and active modules are available
and high-performance systems can be realized cost effectively and with
stellar performance by using off-the-shelf modules interconnected using
planar transmission lines. Module vendors are encouraged by the market
to develop competitive modules that can be used in a wide variety of
applications. The great majority of RF and microwave engineers either
develop modules or use modules to realize RF systems. Systems must also
be concerned with noise and distortion, including distortion that originates
in supposedly linear elements. Something as simple as a termination
can produce distortion called passive intermodulation distortion. Design
techniques are presented for designing cascaded systems while managing
noise and distortion. Filters are also modules and general filter theory is
covered and the design of parallel coupled line filters is presented in detail.
Filter design is presented as a mixture of art and science. This mix, and the
thought processes involved, are emphasized through the design of a filter
integrated throughout this chapter.

Volume 5: Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators

The fifth volume presents the design of amplifiers and oscillators in
a way that enables state-of-the-art designs to be developed. Detailed
strategies for amplifiers and voltage-controlled oscillators are presented.
Design of competitive microwave amplifiers and oscillators are particularly
challenging as many trade-offs are required in design, and the design
decisions cannot be reduced to a formulaic flow. Very detailed case studies
are presented and while some may seem quite complicated, they parallel the
level of sophistication required to develop competitive designs.

      Case Studies

      A key feature of this book series is the use of real world case studies
      of leading edge designs. Some of the case studies are designs done in
      my research group to demonstrate design techniques resulting in leading
      performance. The case studies and the persons responsible for helping to
      develop them are as follows.

         1. Software defined radio transmitter.
         2. High dynamic range down converter design. This case study was

             developed with Alan Victor.
         3. Design of a third-order Chebyshev combline filter. This case study was

             developed with Wael Fathelbab.
         4. Design of a bandstop filter. This case study was developed with Wael

             Fathelbab.
         5. Tunable Resonator with a varactor diode stack. This case study was

             developed with Alan Victor.
         6. Analysis of a 15 GHz Receiver. This case study was developed with

             Alan Victor.
         7. Transceiver Architecture. This case study was developed with Alan

             Victor.
         8. Narrowband linear amplifier design. This case study was developed

             with Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
         9. Wideband Amplifier Design. This case study was developed with Dane

             Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
        10. Distributed biasing of differential amplifiers. This case study was

             developed with Wael Fathelbab.
        11. Analysis of a distributed amplifier. This case study was developed with

             Ratan Bhatia, Jason Gerber, Tony Kwan, and Rowan Gilmore.
        12. Design of a WiMAX power amplifier. This case study was developed

             with Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
        13. Reflection oscillator. This case study was developed with Dane Collins

             and National Instruments Corporation.
        14. Design of a C-Band VCO. This case study was developed with Alan

             Victor.
        15. Oscillator phase noise analysis. This case study was developed with

             Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
         Many of these case studies are available as captioned YouTube videos and
      qualified instructors can request higher resolution videos from the author.

      Course Structures

      Based on the adoption of the first and second editions at universities,
      several different university courses have been developed using various parts
      of what was originally one very large book. The book supports teaching
      two or three classes with courses varying by the selection of volumes
      and chapters. A standard microwave class following the format of earlier
      microwave texts can be taught using the second and third volumes. Such
      a course will benefit from the strong practical design flavor and modern
      treatment of measurement technology, Smith charts, and matching networks.
      Transmission line propagation and design is presented in the context of
      microstrip technology providing an immediately useful skill. The subtleties
      of multimoding are also presented in the context of microstrip lines. In such
PREFACE                                                                            ix

a class the first volume on microwave systems can be assigned for self-
learning.

   Another approach is to teach a course that focuses on transmission line
effects including parallel coupled-line filters and module design. Such a class
would focus on Volumes 2, 3 and 4. A filter design course would focus
on using Volume 4 on module design. A course on amplifier and oscillator
design would use Volume 5. This course is supported by a large number of
case studies that present design concepts that would otherwise be difficult to
put into the flow of the textbook.

   Another option suited to an undergraduate or introductory graduate class
is to teach a class that enables engineers to develop RF and microwave
systems. This class uses portions of Volumes 2, 3 and 4. This class then omits
detailed filter, amplifier, and oscillator design.

   The fundamental philosophy behind the book series is that the broader
impact of the material should be presented first. Systems should be discussed
up front and not left as an afterthought for the final chapter of a textbook, the
last lecture of the semester, or the last course of a curriculum.

   The book series is written so that all electrical engineers can gain an
appreciation of RF and microwave hardware engineering. The body of the
text can be covered without strong reliance on this electromagnetic theory,
but it is there for those who desire it for teaching or reader review. The book
is rich with detailed information and also serves as a technical reference.

The Systems Engineer

Systems are developed beginning with fuzzy requirements for components
and subsystems. Just as system requirements provide impetus to develop
new base technologies, the development of new technologies provides new
capabilities that drive innovation and new systems. The new capabilities
may arise from developments made in support of other systems. Sometimes
serendipity leads to the new capabilities. Creating innovative microwave
and RF systems that address market needs or provide for new opportunities
is the most exciting challenge in RF design. The engineers who can
conceptualize and architect new RF systems are in great demand. This book
began as an effort to train RF systems engineers and as an RF systems
resource for practicing engineers. Many RF systems engineers began their
careers when systems were simple. Today, appreciating a system requires
higher levels of abstraction than in the past, but it also requires detailed
knowledge or the ability to access detailed knowledge and expertise. So what
makes a systems engineer? There is not a simple answer, but many partial
answers. We know that system engineers have great technical confidence and
broad appreciation for technologies. They are both broad in their knowledge
of a large swath of technologies and also deep in knowledge of a few
areas, sometimes called the "T" model. One book or course will not make
a systems engineer. It is clear that there must be a diverse set of experiences.
This book series fulfills the role of fostering both high-level abstraction of
RF engineering and also detailed design skills to realize effective RF and
microwave modules. My hope is that this book will provide the necessary
background for the next generation of RF systems engineers by stressing
system principles immediately, followed by core RF technologies. Core
technologies are thereby covered within the context of the systems in which
they are used.

1.1 Introduction

Radio frequency (RF) systems drive the requirements of microwave and RF
circuits, and the capabilities of RF and microwave circuits fuel the evolution
of RF systems. This interdependence and the trade-offs required necessitate
that the successful RF and microwave designer have an appreciation
of systems. Today, communications is the main driver of RF system
development, leading to RF technology evolution at an unprecedented
pace. Similar relationships exist for national security including radar and
sensors used in detection and ranging. Other radio systems have less
immediate impact on RF technology but are very important for the smaller
number of RF engineers working in the fields of navigation, astronomy,
defense, and heating. No longer can many years be put aside for methodical
trade-offs of circuit complexity, technology development, and architecture
choices at the system level. As relationships have become more intertwined,
RF communication, radar, and sensor engineers must develop a broad
appreciation of technology, communication principles, and circuit design.

   This book is the first volume in a series on microwave and RF design. A
central aspect of microwave engineering is distributed effects considered in
the second volume of his book series [1]. Here the transmission lines are
treated as supporting forward and backward traveling voltage and current
waves and these are related to electromagnetic effects. The third volume
[2] covers microwave network theory which is the theory that describe
power flow and can be used to describe transmission line effects. Topics

   matching networks that enable maximum power transfer. The fourth volume
   [3] focuses on designing microwave circuits and systems using modules
   introducing a large number of different modules. Modules is just another
   term for a network but the implication is that is is packaged and often
   available off-the-shelf. Other topics in this chapter that are important in
   system design using modules are considered including noise, distortion,
   and dynamic range. Most microwave and RF designers construct systems
   using modules developed by other engineers who specialize in developing
   the modules. Examples are filter and amplifier chip modules which once
   designed can be used in many different systems. Much of microwave design
   is about maximizing dynamic range, minimizing noise, and minimizing DC
   power consumption. The fifth volume in this series [4] considers amplifier
   and oscillator design and develops the skills required to develop modules.

   1.2 RF and Microwave Engineering

   An RF signal is a signal that is coherently generated, radiated by a transmit
   antenna, propagated through air or space, collected by a receive antenna,
   and then amplified and information extracted. An RF circuit operates at the
   same frequency as the RF signal that is transmitted or received. That is, the
   frequency at which a circuit operates does not define that it is an RF circuit.
   The RF spectrum is part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum exploited by
   humans for communications. A broad categorization of the EM spectrum is
   shown in Table 1-1. Today radios operate from 3 Hz to 300 GHz, although
   the upper end will increase as technology progresses.

      Microwaves refers to the frequencies where the size of a circuit or
   structure is comparable to or greater than the wavelength of the EM signal.
   The division is arbitrary but if a circuit structure is greater than 1/20 of
   a wavelength, then most engineers would regard the circuit as being a

microwave circuit. For now the microwave frequency range is generally             When a radio signal
taken as 300 MHz to 300 GHz. At these frequencies distributed effects,            near 60 GHz passes
sometimes called transmission line effects, must be considered.                   through air an oxygen
                                                                                  molecule of two
   One of the key characteristics distinguishing RF signals from infrared and     bound oxygen atoms
visible light is that an RF signal can be generated with coherent phase, and      vibrates and EM
information can be transmitted in both amplitude and phase variations of the      energy is transferred
RF signal. Such signals can be easily generated up to 220 GHz. The necessary      to the mechanical
hardware becomes progressively more expensive as frequency increases. The         energy of vibration
upper limit of radio frequencies is about 300 GHz today, but the limit is         and thus heat.
extending slowly above this as technology progresses.

   The RF bands are listed in Table 1-2 along with propagation modes and
representative applications. The propagation of RF signals in free space
follows one or more paths from a transmitter to a receiver at any frequency,
with differences being in the size of the antennas needed to transmit and
receive signals. The size of the necessary antenna is related to wavelength,
with the typical dimensions ranging from a quarter of a wavelength to a
few wavelengths if a reflector is used to focus the EM waves. On earth,
and dependent on frequency, RF signals propagate through walls, diffract
around objects, refract when the dielectric constant of the medium changes,
and reflect from buildings and walls. The extent is dependent on frequency.
Above ground the propagation at RF is affected by atmospheric loss, by
charge layers induced by solar radiation in the upper atmosphere, and by
density variations in the air caused by heating as well as the thinning of air
with height above the earth. The ionosphere is the uppermost part of the
atmosphere, at 60 to 90 km, and is ionized by solar radiation, producing a
reflective surface, called the D layer, to radio signals up to 3 GHz. The D
layer weakens at night and most radio signals can then pass through this
weakened layer. The E layer extends from 90 to 120 km and is ionized by X-
rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation, and the ionized regions, which reflect
RF signals, form ionized clouds that last only a few hours. The F layer of the
ionosphere extends from 200 to 500 km and ionization in this layer is due
to extreme ultraviolet radiation. Refraction results from this charged layer
rather than reflection, as the charges are widely separated. At night the F
layer results in what is called the skywave, which is the refraction of radio
waves around the earth. At low frequencies a radio wave penetrates the
earth's surface and the wave can become trapped at the interface between
two regions of different permittivity, the earth region and the air region. This
radio wave is called the surface wave or ground wave.

   Propagating RF signals in air are absorbed by molecules in the atmosphere
primarily by molecular resonances such as the bending and stretching of
bonds. This bending and stretching converts energy in the EM wave into
vibrational energy of the molecules. The transmittance of radio signals
versus frequency in dry air at an altitude of 4.2 km is shown in Figure 1-1.
The first molecular resonance encountered in dry air as frequency increases
is the oxygen resonance, centered at 60 GHz, but below that the absorption in
dry air is very small. Attenuation increases with higher water vapor pressure
(with a resonance at 22 GHz) and in rain. Within 2 GHz of 60 GHz a signal
will not travel far, and this can be used to provide localized communication
over a few meters as a local data link. Regions of low attenuation (i.e.
high transmittance), are called windows and there are numerous low loss
windows.

           RF signals diffract and so can bend around structures and penetrate
        into valleys. The ability to diffract reduces with increasing frequency.
        However, as frequency increases the size of antennas decreases and the
        capacity to carry information increases. A very good compromise for mobile
        communications is at UHF, 300 MHz to 4 GHz, where antennas are of
        convenient size and there is a good ability to diffract around objects and even
        penetrate walls. This choice can be seen with 1G-4G cellular communication
        systems operating in several bands from 450 MHz to 3.6 GHz where
        antennas do not dominate the size of the handset, and the ability to receive
        calls within buildings and without line of sight to the base station is well
        known.

           RF bands have been further divided for particular applications. The

frequency bands for radar are shown in Table 1-3. The L, S, and C bands are
referred to as having octave bandwidths, as the upper frequency of a band
is twice the lower frequency. The other bands are half-octave bands, as the
upper frequency limit is approximately 50% higher than the lower frequency
limit. The same letter band designations are used by other standards.
The most important alternative band designation is for the waveguide
bands. These bands refer to the useful range of operation of a rectangular
waveguide, which is a rectangular tube that confines a propagating signal
within four conducting walls (see Figure 1-2). The waveguide bands are
shown in Table 1-4 with the conventional letter designation of bands and
standardized waveguide dimensions. Compared to coaxial lines rectangular
waveguides have very low loss.1

1.3 Communication Over Distance

Communicating using EM signals has been an integral part of society since
the transmission of the first telegraph signals over wires in the mid 19th
century [7]. This development derived from an understanding of magnetic
induction based on the experiments of Faraday in 1831 [8] in which he
investigated the relationship of magnetic fields and currents. This work of
Faraday is now known as Faraday's law, or Faraday's law of induction. It
was one of four key laws developed between 1820 and 1835 that described
the interaction of static fields and of static fields with currents. These four

  0.5 db/m while an X-band waveguide has a loss of 0.1 dB/m. At 100 GHz a 1 mm-diameter
  coaxial line has a loss of 12.5 dB/m compared to 2.5 dB/m loss for a W-band waveguide.

         laws are the Biot-Savart law (developed around 1820), Ampere's law (1826),
         Faraday's law (1831), and Gauss's law (1835). These are all static laws and do
         not describe propagating fields.

         1.3.1 Electromagnetic Fields

         We now know that there are two components of the EM field, the electric
         field, E, with units of volts per meter (V/m), and the magnetic field, H,
         with units of amperes per meter (A/m). E and H fields together describe the
         force between charges. There are also two flux quantities that are necessary

         to understand the interactions between these fields and vacuum or matter.
         The first is D, the electric flux density, with units of coulombs per square
         meter (C/m2), and the other is B, the magnetic flux density, with units of
         teslas (T). B and H, and D and E, are related to each other by the properties
         of the medium, which are embodied in the quantities µ and  (with the cali-
         graphic letter, e.g. B, denoting a time-domain quantity):

                     B¯ = µH¯                           (1.1)      D¯ = E¯,    (1.2)

         where the over bar denotes a vector quantity. The quantity µ is called the

         permeability of the medium and describes the ability to store magnetic

         energy in a region. The permeability in free space (or vacuum) is denoted
         µ0 = 4 × 10-7 H/m and the magnetic flux and magnetic field are related as

                                                  B¯ = µ0H¯.                   (1.3)
INTRODUCTION TO RF AND MICROWAVE SYSTEMS                                            7

   The other material quantity is the permittivity, , which describes the
ability to store energy in a volume and in a vacuum

                         D¯ = 0E¯,                                         (1.4)

where 0 = 8.854 × 10-12 F/m is the permittivity of a vacuum. The relative
permittivity, r, is the ratio the permittivity of a material to that of vacuum:

                         r = /0.                                           (1.5)

Similarly, the relative permeability, µr, refers to the ratio of permeability of
a material to its value in a vacuum:

                         µr = µ/µ0.                                        (1.6)

1.3.2 Biot-Savart Law

The Biot-Savart law relates current to magnetic field as, see Figure 1-3,

                         ¯ Id × a^R
                       dH =   4R  2,                                       (1.7)

which has the units of amperes per meter in the SI system. In Equation (1.7)
dH¯ is the incremental static H field, I is current, d is the vector of the length
of a filament of current I, a^R is the unit vector in the direction from the
current filament to the magnetic field, and R is the distance between the
filament and the magnetic field. The dH¯ field is directed at right angles
to a^R and the current filament. So Equation (1.7) says that a filament of
current produces a magnetic field at a point. The total magnetic field from
a current on a wire or surface can be found by modeling the wire or surface
as a number of current filaments, and the total magnetic field at a point is
obtained by integrating the contributions from each filament.

1.3.3 Faraday's Law of Induction

Faraday's law relates a time-varying magnetic field to an induced voltage
drop, V , around a closed path, which is now understood to be  E¯ · d, that
is, the closed contour integral of the electric field,

V = E¯ · d = - B¯ · ds, (1.8)
                                    s t
                       

and this has the units of volts in the SI unit system. The operation described
in Equation (1.8) is illustrated in Figure 1-4.

1.3.4 Ampere's Circuital Law

Ampere's circuital law, often called just Ampere's law, relates direct current
and the static magnetic field H¯. The relationship is based on Figure 1-5 and
Ampere's circuital law is

                        H¯ · d = Ienclosed.                                (1.9)

                       

That is, the integral of the magnetic field around a loop is equal to the current
enclosed by the loop. Using symmetry, the magnitude of the magnetic field
at a distance r from the center of the wire shown in Figure 1-5 is

                       H = |I|/(2r).                                       (1.10)

                     1.3.5 Gauss's Law

                         The final static EM law is Gauss's law, which relates the static electric flux
                         density vector, D¯ , to charge. With reference to Figure 1-6, Gauss's law in
                         integral form is

                                     D¯ · ds = v · dv = Qenclosed.  (1.11)

                                  s  v

   This states that the integral of the electric flux vector, D¯ , over a closed surface
   is equal to the total charge enclosed by the surface, Qenclosed.

   1.3.6 Gauss's Law of Magnetism

   Gauss's law of magnetism parallels Gauss's law which now applies to
   magnetic fields. In integral form the law is

                                      B¯ · ds = 0.                  (1.12)

                                     s

   This states that the integral of the magnetic flux vector, D¯ , over a closed
   surface is zero reflecting the fact that magnetic charges do not exist.

   1.3.7 Telegraph

   With the static field laws established, the stage was set to begin the
   development of the transmission of EM signals over wires. While traveling
   by ship back to the United States from Europe in 1832, Samuel Morse learned
   of Faraday's experiments and conceived of an EM telegraph. He sought out
   partners in Leonard Gale, a professor of science at New York University, and
   Alfred Vail, "skilled in the mechanical arts," who constructed the telegraph
   models used in their experiments. In 1835 this collaboration led to an
   experimental version transmitting a signal over 16 km of wire. Morse was not

alone in imagining an EM telegraph, and in 1837 Charles Wheatstone opened
the first commercial telegraph line between London and Camden Town,
England, a distance of 2.4 km. Subsequently, in 1844, Morse designed and
developed a line to connect Washington, DC, and Baltimore, Maryland. This
culminated in the first public transmission on May 24, 1844, when Morse sent
a telegraph message from the Capitol in Washington to Baltimore. This event
is recognized as the birth of communication over distance using wires. This
rapid pace of transition from basic research into electromagnetism (Faraday's
experiment) to a fielded transmission system has been repeated many times
in the evolution of wired and wireless communication technology.

   The early telegraph systems used EM induction and multicell batteries
that were switched in and out of circuit with the long telegraph wire
and so created pulses of current. We now know that these current pulses
created propagating magnetic fields that were guided by the wires and were
accompanied by electric fields. In 1840 Morse applied for a U.S. patent for
"Improvement in the Mode of Communicating Information by Signals by the
Application of Electro-Magnetism Telegraph," which described "lightning
wires" and "Morse code." By 1854, 37,000 km of telegraph wire crossed
the United States, and this had a profound effect on the development of the
country. Railroads made early extensive use of telegraph and a new industry
was created. In the United States the telegraph industry was dominated by
Western Union, which became one of the largest companies in the world. Just
as with telegraph, the history of wired and wireless communication has been
shaped by politics, business interests, market risk, entrepreneurship, patent
ownership, and patent litigation as much as by the technology itself.

   The first telegraph signals were just short bursts and slightly longer bursts
of noise using Morse code in which sequences of dots, dashes, and pauses
represent numbers and letters (see Table 1-5).2 The speed of transmission
was determined by an operator's ability to key and recognize the codes.
Information transfer using EM signals in the late 19th century was therefore

2 Morse code uses sequences of dots, dashes, and spaces. The duration of a dash (or "dah")
  is three times longer than that of a dot (or "dit"). Between letters there is a small gap. For
  example, the Morse code for PI is ". - - . . ." . Between words there is a slightly longer pause and

 between sentences an even longer pause. Table 1-5 lists the international Morse code adopted

  in 1848. The original Morse code developed in the 1830s is now known as "American Morse
  code" or "railroad code." The "modern international Morse code" extends the international
  Morse code with sequences for non-English letters and special symbols.
10  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    about 5 bits per second (bits/s). Morse achieved 10 words per minute.

    1.3.8 The Origins of Radio

    In the 1850s Morse began to experiment with wireless transmission, but this
    was still based on the principle of conduction. He used a flowing river,
    which as is now known is a medium rich with ions, to carry the charge.
    On one side of the river he set up a series connection of a metal plate, a
    battery, a Morse key, and a second metal plate. This formed the transmitter
    circuit. The metal plates were inserted into the water and separated by a
    distance considerably greater than the width of the river. On the other side
    of the river, metal plates were placed directly opposite the transmitter plates
    and this second set of plates was connected by a wire to a galvanometer
    in series. This formed the receive circuit, and electric pulses established by
    the transmitter resulted in the charge being transferred across the river by
    conduction and the pulses subsequently detected by the galvanometer. This
    was the first wireless transmission using electromagnetism, but it was not
    radio.

       Morse relied entirely on conduction to achieve wireless transmission and
    it is now known that we need alternating electric and magnetic fields to
    propagate information over distance without charge carriers. The next steps
    in the progress to radio were experiments in induction. These culminated in
    an experiment by Loomis who in 1866 sent the first aerial wireless signals
    using kites flown by copper wires [9]. The transmitter kite had a Morse key
    at the ground end and an electric potential would have been developed
    between the ground and the kite itself. Closing the key resulted in current
    flow along the wire and this created a magnetic field that spread out and
    induced a current in the receive kite and this was detected by a galvanometer.
    However, not much of an electric field is produced and an EM wave is
    not transmitted. As such, the range of this system is very limited. Practical
    wireless communication requires an EM wave at a high-enough frequency
    that it can be efficiently generated by short wires.

    1.3.9 Maxwell's Equations

    The essential next step in the invention of radio was the development of

    Maxwell's equations in 1861. Before Maxwell's equations were postulated,

    several static EM laws were known. These are the Biot-Savart law, Ampere's

    circuital law, Gauss's law, and Faraday's law. Taken together they cannot de-

    scribe the propagation of EM signals, but they can be derived from Maxwell's

    equations. Maxwell's equations cannot be derived from the static electric and

    magnetic field laws. Maxwell's equations embody additional insight relating

    spatial derivatives to time derivatives, which leads to a description of prop-

    agating fields. Maxwell's equations are

     × E¯ = - B¯ - M¯  (1.13)                 × H¯ = D¯ + J¯               (1.15)
                   t   (1.14)                             t                (1.16)

     · D¯ = V                                   · B¯ = mV .

       Several of the quantities in Maxwell's equation have already been intro-
    duced, but now the electric and magnetic fields are in vector form. The other
    quantities in Equations (1.13)-(1.16) are
INTRODUCTION TO RF AND MICROWAVE SYSTEMS                                           11

   with units of amperes per square     sity, with units of webers per cu-
   meter (A/m2);                        bic meter (Wb/m3); and

   meter (C/m3);

Magnetic charges do not exist, but their introduction through the magnetic
charge density, mV , and the magnetic current density, M¯ , introduce an aes-
thetically appealing symmetry to Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's equations
are differential equations, and as with most differential equations, their so-
lution is obtained with particular boundary conditions, which in radio engi-
neering are imposed by conductors. Electric conductors (i.e., electric walls)
support electric charges and hence electric current. By analogy, magnetic
walls support magnetic charges and magnetic currents. Magnetic walls also
provide boundary conditions to be used in the solution of Maxwell's equa-
tions. The notion of magnetic walls is important in RF and microwave engi-
neering, as they are approximated by the boundary between two dielectrics
of different permittivity. The greater the difference in permittivity, the more
closely the boundary approximates a magnetic wall.

   Maxwell's equations are fundamental properties and there is no
underlying theory, so they must be accepted "as is," but they have been
verified in countless experiments. Maxwell's equations have three types of
derivatives. First, there is the time derivative, /t. Then there are two spatial
derivatives, ×, called curl, capturing the way a field circulates spatially
(or the amount that it curls up on itself), and ·, called the div operator,
describing the spreading-out of a field. In rectangular coordinates, curl, ×,
describes how much a field circles around the x, y, and z axes. That is, the
curl describes how a field circulates on itself. So Equation (1.13) relates the
amount an electric field circulates on itself to changes of the B field in time.
So a spatial derivative of electric fields is related to a time derivative of the
magnetic field. Also in Equation (1.15) the spatial derivative of the magnetic
field is related to the time derivative of the electric field. These are the key
elements that result in self-sustaining propagation.

   Div, ·, describes how a field spreads out from a point. So the presence
of net electric charge (say, on a conductor) will result in the electric
field spreading out from a point (see Equation (1.14)). In contrast, the
magnetic field (Equation (1.16)) can never diverge from a point, which is
a result of magnetic charges not existing (except when the magnetic wall
approximation is used).

   How fast a field varies with time, B¯/t and D¯/t, depends on frequency.
The more interesting property is how fast a field can change spatially,  × E¯
and ×H¯--this depends on wavelength relative to geometry. So if the cross-
sectional dimensions of a transmission line are less than a wavelength (/2
or /4 in different circumstances), then it will be impossible for the fields
to curl up on themselves and so there will be only one solution (with no or
minimal spatial variation of the E and H fields) or, in some cases, no solution
to Maxwell's equations.
12  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    1.3.10 Transmission of Radio Signals

    Now the discussion returns to the technological development of radio.
    About the same time as Loomis's induction experiments in 1864, James
    Maxwell [10] laid the foundations of modern EM theory in 1861
    [11]. Maxwell theorized that electric and magnetic fields are different
    manifestations of the same phenomenon. The revolutionary conclusion was
    that if they are time varying, then they would travel through space as a
    wave. This insight was accepted almost immediately by many people and
    initiated a large number of endeavors. The period of 1875 to 1900 was a time
    of tremendous innovation in wireless communication.

       On November 22, 1875, Edison observed EM sparks. Previously sparks
    were considered to be an induction phenomenon, but Edison thought that
    he was producing a new kind of force, which he called the etheric force. He
    believed that this would enable communication without wires. To put this
    in context, the telegraph was invented in the 1830s and the telephone was
    invented in 1876.

       The next stage leading to radio was orchestrated by D. E. Hughes
    beginning in 1879. Hughes experimented with a spark gap and reasoned that
    in the gap there was a rapidly alternating current and not a constant current
    as others of his time believed. The electric oscillator was born. The spark gap
    transmitter was augmented with a clockwork mechanism to interrupt the
    transmitter circuit and produce pulsed radio signals. He used a telephone as
    a receiver and walked around London and detected the transmitted signals
    over distance. Hughes noted that he had good reception at 180 feet. Hughes
    publicly demonstrated his "radio" in 1870 to the Royal Society, but the
    eminent scientists of the society determined that the effect was simply due to
    induction. This discouraged Hughes from continuing. However, Hughes has
    a legitimate claim to having invented radio, mobile digital radio at that, and
    probably was transmitting pulses on a 100 kHz carrier. In Hugeness's radio
    the RF carrier was produced by the spark gap oscillator and the information
    was coded as pulses. It was a small leap to a Morse key-based system.

       The invention of practical radio can be attributed to many people,
    beginning with Heinrich Hertz, who in the period from 1885 to 1889
    successfully verified the essential prediction of Maxwell's equations that
    EM energy could propagate through the atmosphere. Hertz was much more
    thorough than Hughes and his results were widely accepted. In 1891 Tesla
    developed what is now called the Tesla coil, which is a transformer with a
    primary and a secondary coil, one inside the other. When one of the coils
    was excited by an alternating signal, a large voltage was produced across the
    terminals of the other coil. Tesla pursued the application of his coils to radio
    and realized that the coils could be tuned so that the resulting resonance
    greatly amplified a radio signal.

       The next milestone was the establishment of the first practical radio system
    by Marconi, with experiments beginning in 1894. Oscillations were produced
    in a spark gap, which were amplified by a Tesla coil. The work culminated
    in the transmission of telegraph signals across the Atlantic (from Ireland to
    Canada) by Marconi in 1901. In 1904, crystal radio kits to detect wireless
    telegraph signals could be readily purchased.

       Spark gap transmitters could only send pulses of noise and not voice. One
    generator that could be amplitude modulated was an alternator. At the end

of the 19th century, readily available alternators produced a 60 Hz signal.
Reginald Resplendent attempted to make a higher-frequency alternator and
the best he achieved operated at 1 kHz. Resplendent realized that Maxwell's
equations indicated that radiation increased dramatically with frequency
and so he needed a much-higher-frequency signal source. Under contract,
General Electric developed a 2-kW, 100-kHz alternator designed by Ernst
Alexanderson. With this alternator, the first radio communication of voice
occurred on December 23, 1900, in a transmission by Fessenden from an
island in the Potomac River, near Washington, DC. Then on December 24,
1906, Fessenden transmitted voice from Massachusetts to ships hundreds
of miles away in the Atlantic Ocean. This milestone is regarded as the
beginning of the radio era.

   Marconi subsequently purchased 50 and 200 kW Alexanderson alternators
for his trans-Atlantic transmissions. Marconi was a great integrator of ideas,
with particular achievements being the design of transmitting and receiving
antennas that could be tuned to a particular frequency and the development
of a coherer to improve detection of a signal.

1.3.11 Early Radio

Radio works by superimposing relatively slowly varying information, at
what is called the baseband frequency, on a carrier sinusoid by varying the
amplitude and/or phase of the sinusoid. Early radio systems were based
on modulating an oscillating carrier either by pulsing the carrier (using for
example Morse code)--this modulation scheme is called amplitude shift
keying (ASK)--or by varying the amplitude of the carrier, i.e. amplitude
modulation (AM), in the case of analog, usually voice, transmission. The
waveforms and spectra of these modulation schemes are shown in Figure 1-
7. The information is contained in the baseband signal, which is also called
the modulating signal. The spectrum of the baseband signal extends to DC or
perhaps down to where it rolls off at a low frequency. The carrier is a single
sinewave and contains no information. The amplitude of the carrier is varied
by the baseband signal to produce the modulated signal. In general, there
are many cycles of the carrier relative to variations of the baseband signal so
that the bandwidth of the modulated signal is relatively small compared to
the frequency of the carrier.

low, fLOW, medium, fMED, and high
frequency, fHIGH, sections. The mixers
can be idealized as multipliers, shown
as circles with crosses, that boost the
frequency of the input baseband or IF
signal by the frequency of the carrier.

                            AM and ASK radios are narrowband communication systems (they use
                         a small portion of the EM spectrum), so to avoid interference with other
                         radios it is necessary to search for an open part of the spectrum to place
                         the carrier signal. In the decade of the 1900s there was little organization and
                         a listener needed to search to find the desired transmission. The technology
                         of the day necessitated this anyway, as the carrier would drift around by
                         10% or so since it was then not possible to build a stable oscillator. It
                         was not until the Titanic sinking in 1912 that regulation was imposed on
                         the wireless industry. Investigations of the Titanic sinking concluded that
                         most of the lives lost would have been saved if a nearby ship had been
                         monitoring its radio channels and if the frequency of the emergency channel
                         was fixed. However, a second ship, but not close enough, did respond
                         to Titanic's "SOS" signal. A result of the investigations was the Service
                         Regulations of the 1912 London International Radiotelegraph Convention.
                         These early regulations were fairly liberal and radio stations were allowed
                         to use radio wavelengths of their own choosing, but restricted to four
                         broad bands: a single band at 1500 kHz for amateurs; 187.5 to 500 kHz,
                         appropriated primarily for government use; below 187.5 kHz for commercial
                         use, and 500 kHz to 1500 kHz, also a commercial band. Subsequent years saw
                         more stringent assignment of narrow spectral bands and the assignment of
                         channels. The standards and regulatory environment for radio were set--
                         there would be assigned frequency bands for particular purposes. Very
                         quickly strong government and commercial interests struggled for exclusive
                         use of particular bands and thus the EM spectrum developed considerable
                         value. Entities "owned" portions of the spectrum either through a license or
                         through government allocation.

                            While most of the spectrum is allocated, there are several open bands
                         where licenses are not required. The instrumentation, scientific, and
                         medical (ISM) bands at 2.4 and 5.8 GHz are examples. Since these bands
                         are loosely regulated, radios must cope with potentially high levels of
                         interference.

                     1.4 Radio Architecture

                         A radio device is comprised of several key reasonably well-defined units. By
                         frequency there are baseband, intermediate frequency (IF), and RF partitions.
                         In a typical device, the information--either transmitted or received, bits
                         or analog waveforms--is fully contained in the baseband unit. In the
                         case of digital radios, the digital information originating in the baseband
                         digital signal processor (DSP) is converted to an analog waveform typically
                         using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This architecture is shown for
                         a simple transmitter in Figure 1-8. When the basic information is analog,
INTRODUCTION TO RF AND MICROWAVE SYSTEMS                                           15

say a voice signal in analog broadcast radios, the information is already a
baseband analog waveform. This analog baseband signal can have frequency
components that range from DC to many megahertz. However, the baseband
signal can range from DC to gigahertz in the case of some radars and point-
to-point links that operate at tens of gigahertz.

   The RF hardware interfaces the external EM environment with the rest of
the communication device. The information that is represented at baseband
is translated to a higher-frequency signal that can more easily propagate over
the air and for which antennas can be more easily built with manageable
sizes. Thus the information content is generally contained in a narrow band
of frequencies centered at the carrier frequency. The information content
generally occupies a relatively small slice of the EM spectrum. The term
"generally" is used as it is not strictly necessary that communication be
confined to a narrow band: that is, narrow in percentage terms relative to
the RF.

   The trade-offs in the choice of carrier frequency are that lower-frequency
EM signals require larger antennas, typically one-quarter to one-half
wavelength long, but propagate over longer distances and tend to follow the
curvature of the earth. AM broadcast radio stations operate around 1 MHz
(where the wavelength, , is 300 m) using transmit antennas that are 100 m
high or more, but good reception is possible at hundreds of kilometers from
the transmitter. At higher frequencies, antennas can be smaller, a much larger
amount of information can be transmitted with a fixed fractional bandwidth,
and there is less congestion. An antenna at 2 GHz (where the free-space
wavelength 0 = 15 cm) is around 4 cm long (and smaller with a dielectric
or when folded or coiled), which is a very convenient size for a hand-held
communicator.

   The concept of an IF is related to the almost universal architecture of
transmitters in the 20th century when baseband signals were first translated,
or heterodyned, to a band around an IF before a second translation to a
higher RF. Initially the IF was just above the audible range and was known
as the supersonic frequency. The same progression applies in reverse in a
receiver where information carried at RF is first translated to IF before finally
being converted to baseband. This architecture resulted in near-optimum
noise performance and relatively simple hardware, particularly at RF, where
components are much more expensive than at lower frequencies.

   The above discussion is a broad description of how radios work. There are
many qualifications, as there are many evolving architectures and significant
rethinking of the way radios can operate. Architectures and basic properties
of radios are trade-offs of the capabilities of technologies, signal processing
capability, cost, market dynamics, and politics.

1.5 Conventional Wireless Communications

Up until the mid-1970s most wireless communications were based
on centralized high-power transmitters, often operating in a wide-area
broadcast mode, and reception (e.g., by a television or radio unit)
was expected until the signal level fell below a noise-related threshold.
These systems are particularly sensitive to interference, therefore systems
transmitting at the same frequency were geographically separated so that a
transmitted signal falls below the background noise threshold before there

ventional radio system. The two
transmitters, 1, are at the centers
of the coverage circles defined by
the background noise threshold.

                         is a chance of it interfering with a neighboring system operating at the
                         same frequency. This situation is illustrated in Figure 1-9. Here there are a
                         number of base stations, each operating at a frequency (or set of frequencies)
                         designated by numerals referring to the frequency of operation, which are
                         correspondingly designated as f1, f2, etc. In Figure 1-9 the coverage by two
                         base stations, 1, both operating at the frequency f1 are shown by the shaded
                         regions. The shading indicates the geographical region over which the
                         signals are above the minimum detectable signal threshold. The frequency
                         reuse factor of these types of systems is low, as there is a large geographical
                         area where there is no reception at a particular frequency. The coverage area
                         will not be circular or constant because terrain is not flat, signals are blocked
                         by and reflected from buildings, and background noise levels vary during
                         the day and signal levels vary from season to season as vegetation coverage
                         changes. Allowances must be made in the allocation of broadcast areas to
                         account for the changing coverage level. At the same time, it is necessary,
                         in conventional radio, for the coverage area to be large so that reception,
                         particularly for mobile devices, is continuous over metropolitan-size areas.

                            The original mobile radio service in the United States is now called 0G
                         for zero-generation radio. Very few users could be supported in 0G mobile
                         radio because there were very few channels. The first 0G mobile system, the
                         Mobile Telephone Service introduced in 1946, had six channels. That is, only
                         six calls could be made at any one time. Because of interference this was
                         reduced to three channels. So a metropolitan area such as New York city
                         could only support three calls at the same time. In the three-channel version,
                         the channels were 60 kHz wide and with a little more than 60 kHz guard
                         band between channels. More channels were eventually made available.
                         However the maximum practical frequency at the time was 450 MHz and
                         the spectrum from 1 MHz to 500 MHz was highly sought after. Other
                         uses included AM and FM radio, TV broadcast, military communications,
                         and radar. It was seen by regulatory authorities that it was not in the
                         public interest to support more individual users if that meant that broadcast
                         services that catered to many people had to be compromised. There were no
                         cells, just one large coverage area. In every change in radio generation there
                         have been multiple enhancements to improve capacity. So just providing
                         more bandwidth so there could be more channels was not a viable option.
                         Supporting the transition to 1G was more bandwidth, the concept of cells
                         and handoff, narrow channels, and higher operating frequency (900 MHz
                         to 1 GHz). The continued evolution to fifth generation (5G) radio and the
                         concepts that supported it are described in Chapters 2-5.

1.6 RF Power Calculations

1.6.1 RF Propagation

As an RF signal propagates away from a transmitter the power density
reduces conserving the power in the EM wave. In the absence of obstacles
and without atmospheric attenuation the total power passing through
the surface of a sphere centered on a transmitter is equal to the power
transmitted. Since the area of the sphere of radius r is 4r2, the power
density, e.g. in W/m2, at a distance r drops off as 1/r2. With obstacles the
EM wave can diffract, reflect, and follow multiple paths to a receiver where it
can combine destructively or constructively. It is the destructive interference
that is of concern as this limits the reliable reception of a signal. There is a
low probability of perfect cancellation occurring and instead it is found that
the power density reduces as 1/rn where n ranges from 2 for free space to
5 for a dense urban environment with many obstacles, no line of sight, and
multiple signal paths.

EXAMPLE 1.1 Signal Propagation

A signal is received at a distance r from a transmitter and the received power drops off as
1/r2. When r = 1 km, 100 nW is received. What is r when the received power is 100 fW?

Solution:

The signal collected by the receiver is proportional to the power density of the EM signal.
The received signal power Pr = k/r2 where k is a constant. This leads to

Pr(1 km) = 100 nW = 106 =  kr2             r2                                     (1.17)
Pr (r)                           2=        3 2;   r = 1012 m2 = 1000 km
        100 fW             k(1 km) (10 m)

EXAMPLE 1.2 Signal Propagation With Obstructions

A transmitter sends a signal to a receiver in a suburban environment that is a distance d away.
When d = 5 km the signal power received is 100 nW. At what distance from the transmitter
is the reliably received signal 1 pW if the received signal power falls off as 1/d3.

Solution:

Note that the signal falls off faster than the 1/d2 variation of free space. It is not sufficient
to know the total power transmitted and instead the power density at a particular distance
must be known. The power reliably received, PR(5 km), at 5 km is 100 nW and this is the
power density, PD(5 km), multiplied by the effective area, Ar, of the receive antenna:

        PR(5 km) = 100 nW = PD(5 km)Ar = d3 k = (5 km)3 k = 125 km3 k .

Both Ar and k are constants and k = 12500 nW · km3 = 1.25 · 10-5 W · km3. The power
received at a distance d is 1 pW when

        -12                k 1.25 · 10-5 W·km3

    1.6.2 Logarithm

    A cellular phone can reliably receive a signal as small as 100 fW and the
    signal to be transmitted could be 1 W. So the same circuitry can encounter
    signals differing in power by a factor of 1013. To handle such a large range of
    signals a logarithmic scale is used.

       Logarithms are used in RF engineering to express the ratio of powers using
    reasonable numbers. Logarithms are taken with respect to a base b such that
    if x = by, then y = logb(x). In engineering, log(x) is the same as log10(x), and
    ln(x) is the same as loge(x) and is called the natural logarithm (e = 2.71828
    . . . ). Unfortunately in physics and mathematics (and in programs such as
    MATLAB), log x means ln x, so be careful. Common formulas involving
    logarithms are given in Table 1-6.

    1.6.3 Decibels

    RF signal levels are usually expressed in terms of the power of a signal. While
    power can be expressed in absolute terms such as watts (W) or milliwatts
    (mW), it is much more useful to use a logarithmic scale. The ratio of two
    power levels P and PREF in bels3 (B) is

                                         P (B) = log P ,                                 (1.19)
                                                           PREF

    where PREF is a reference power. Here log x is the same as log10 x. Human
    senses have a logarithmic response and the minimum resolution tends to be
    about 0.1 B, so it is most common to use decibels (dB); 1 B = 10 dB. Common
    designations are shown in Table 1-7. Also, 1 mW = 0 dBm is a very common
    power level in RF and microwave power circuits where the m in dBm refers
    to the 1 mW reference. As well, dBW is used, and this is the power ratio with
    respect to 1 W with 1 W = 0 dBW = 30 dBm.

       Working on the decibel scale enables convenient calculations using power
    numbers ranging from 10s of dBm to -110 dBm to be used rather than
    numbers ranging from 100 W to 0.00000000000001 W.

EXAMPLE 1.3 Power Gain

An amplifier has a power gain of 1200. What is the power gain in decibels? If the input power
is 5 dBm, what is the output power in dBm?

Solution:
Power gain in decibels, GdB = 10 log 1200 = 30.79 dB.
The output power is Pout|dBm = PdB + Pin|dBm = 30.79 + 5 = 35.79 dBm.

EXAMPLE 1.4 Gain Calculations

A signal with a power of 2 mW is applied to the input of an
amplifier that increases the power of the signal by a factor of 20.

(a) What is the input power in dBm?                = 10 · log(2) = 3.010 dBm  3.0 dBm.  (1.20)
            Pin = 2 mW = 10 · log 2 mW
                                             1 mW

(a) What is the gain, G, of the amplifier in dB?                                        (1.21)
     The amplifier gain (by default this is power gain) is

                             G = 20 = 10 · log(20) dB = 10 · 1.301 dB = 13.0 dB.

(b) What is the output power of the amplifier?

          G = Pout ,       and in decibels G|dB = Pout|dBm - Pin|dBm                    (1.22)
                 Pin                                                                    (1.23)

    Thus the output power in dBm is

          Pout|dBm = G|dB + Pin|dBm = 13.0 dB + 3.0 dBm = 16.0 dBm.

    Note that dB and dBm are dimensionless but they do have meaning; dB indicates a power
    ratio but dBm refers to a power. Quantities in dB and one quantity in dBm can be added
    or subtracted to yield dBm, and the difference of two quantities in dBm yields a power
    ratio in dB.

EXAMPLE 1.5 Power Calculations

    The output stage of an RF front-end consists of an amplifier
    followed by a filter and then an antenna. The amplifier has a
    gain of 33 dB, the filter has a loss of 2.2 dB, and of the power
    input to the antenna, 45% is lost as heat due to resistive
    losses. If the power input to the amplifier is 1 W, then:

    (a) What is the power input to the amplifier expressed in dBm?
         Pin = 1 W = 1000 mW, PdBm = 10 log(1000/1) = 30 dBm.

    (b) Express the loss of the antenna in dB.
         45% of the power input to the antenna is dissipated as heat.
         The antenna has an efficiency, , of 55% and so P2 = 0.55P1.
         Loss = P1/P2 = 1/0.55 = 1.818 = 2.60 dB.

    (c) What is the total gain of the RF front end (amplifier + filter + antenna)?

    Total gain = (amplifier gain)dB + (filter gain)dB - (loss of antenna)dB         (1.24)
                  = (33 - 2.2 - 2.6) dB = 28.2 dB

    (d) What is the total power radiated by the antenna in dBm?

    PR = Pin |dBm + (amplifier gain)dB + (filter gain)dB - (loss of antenna)dB

    = 30 dBm + (33 - 2.2 - 2.6) dB = 58.2 dBm.                                      (1.25)

    (e) What is the total power radiated by the antenna?                            (1.26)
                                     PR = 1058.2/10 = (661 × 103) mW = 661 W.

       In Examples 1.3 and 1.4 two digits following the decimal point were used
    for the output power expressed in dBm. This corresponds to an implied
    accuracy of about 0.01% or 4 significant digits of the absolute number. This
    level of precision is typical for the result of an engineering calculation. See
    Section 2.A.1 of [1] for further discussion of precision and accuracy.

    1.6.4 Decibels and Voltage Gain

    Figure 1-10(a) is an amplifier with input and output resistances that could be
    different. If Av is the voltage gain of the RF amplifier, then

                                                     V2 = AvV1                              (1.27)

    and the input and output powers will be

                                            V2       and P V out = 22 .                     (1.28)

INTRODUCTION TO RF AND MICROWAVE SYSTEMS                                                 21

The `2' in the denominator arises because V1 and V2 are peak amplitudes of
sinusoids in RF engineering. Thus the power gain is

           G=  Pout V222R1 R1 2
                        = 2 = Av.                                 (1.29)
               Pin V1 2R2 R2

The power gain depends on the input and output resistance ratio of the
amplifiers and this is commonly used to realize significant power gain even
if the voltage gain is quite small. If the input and output resistances of the
amplifier are the same, then the power gain is just the voltage gain squared.

   In handling this situation some authors have used the unit dBV (decibel
as a voltage ratio). This should not be used, decibels should always refer to a
power ratio, and it is needlessly confusing to use dBV in RF engineering.

EXAMPLE 1.6 Voltage Gain to Power Gain

Figure 1-10(b) is a differential amplifier with a 200  input resistance and 5  output
resistance. If the voltage Av is 0.6, what is the power gain of the amplifier in dB?

Solution:

The input and output powers are          12                 1 (AvV1)2
                    Pin = 12 V12/R1 and  Pout = 2 V2 /R2 = 2           .         (1.30)
                                                              R2

Thus the power gain is

G = Pout = (AvV1)2      V12 -1           R1 2 200 2

Pin        R2           R1 = R2 Av = 5 0.6 = 14.4 = 11.58 dB.                    (1.31)

The surprising result is that even with a voltage gain of less than 1, a significant
power gain can be obtained if the input and output resistances are different. A result
used in many RF amplifiers.

1.7 Photons and Electromagnetic Waves

Most of the time it is not necessary to consider the quantum nature of radio
waves. Considering electric and magnetic fields, and Maxwell's equations,
is sufficient to understand radio systems. Still the underlying physics is
that currents in circuits derive from the movement of quantum particles,
here electrons, and propagating EM signals are transported by photons, also
quantum particles.

   In a receiver system, information is translated by a metallic antenna from
the propagating photons to moving charges in a conductor. This transfer of
information is through the interaction of a photon with charge carriers. So
the information transfer is based on the quantized energy of a photon and it
is possible that quantum effects could be important. The relative level of the
photon energy and the random kinetic energy of an electron is important in
determining if quantum effects must be considered.

   With all EM radiation, information is conveyed by photons and the energy
of a photon is conventionally expressed in terms of electron volts (eV). An
electron volt is the energy gained by an electron when it moves across an
electric potential of 1 V and 1 eV = 1.602×10-19 J (1 J = 6.241509 × 1018 eV).

                          1.3806505 × 10-23 J/K is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature
                          in kelvin. This applies to an electron that is moving in a group of electrons,
                          say in a plasma, in thermodynamic equilibrium. Freely conducting electrons
                          in a conductor are in a plasma. The thermal energy of such an electron is
                          its random kinetic energy with kT = 12 mv2 where m is the mass of the
                          electron and v is its velocity. (The thermal energy of an isolated electron,
                          i.e. in a non-interacting electron gas, is 32 kT , but that is not the situation
                          with microwave circuits.) At room temperature (T = 298 K) the thermal
                          energy of a conducting electron in a metal is kT = 25.7 meV. This is much
                          more than the energy of a microwave photon (1.24 µeV to 1.24 meV). Thus at
                          room temperature discrete quantum effects are not apparent for microwave
                          signals and so microwave radiation (at room temperature) can be treated as
                          a continuum effect.

                             A photon has a dual nature, as a particle and as an EM wave. The break
                          point as to which nature helps the most in understanding behavior depends
                          on the energy of the photon versus the thermal energy of an electron. When
                          a microwave photon is captured in a metal at room temperature it makes
                          little sense to talk about the photon as increasing the energy state of an
                          individual electron. Instead, it is best to think of the photon as an EM wave
                          with an electric field that accelerates an ensemble of free electrons (in the
                          conduction band). Thus the energy of one photon is transferred to a group
                          of electrons as faster moving electrons but with the energy increase being
                          so small relative to thermal energy that a quantized effect is not apparent.
                          However even a very low power microwave signal has an enormous number
                          of photons (a 1 pW 300 GHz signal has 5 × 109 photons per second) and each
                          photon accelerates the free electrons a little bit with the combined effect being
                          that the electric field of the microwave signal results in appreciable current.
                          This is the view that we use with room temperature circuits and antennas at
                          microwave frequencies; the EM signal (instead of discrete photons) interacts
                          with the free electrons in a conductor and produces current. Quantum effects
                          must be considered when temperature is very low (say below 4 K) or
                          frequency is very high, e.g. the photon energies for red light (400 THz) is
                          1.7 eV.

                          1.8 Summary

                          Today six billion individuals regularly transmit information wirelessly using
                          transmitters and receivers that can be smaller than an infants hand, contain
                          trillions of transistors, and provide connectivity in nearly any location.

                             The history of radio communications is remarkable and nearly every
                          aspect of electrical engineering is involved. The most important factor of all
                          is that consumers are prepared to part with a large portion of their income
                          to have untethered connectivity. This overwhelming desire for ubiquitous
                          communication surprised even the most optimistic proponents of personal
                          wireless communications. Wireless communication is now a significant part
INTRODUCTION TO RF AND MICROWAVE SYSTEMS                                         23

of every country's economy, and governments are very involved in setting
standards and protecting the competitiveness of their own industries.

   The history of radio communications has led to the current mode of
operation, allocating a narrow slice of the EM spectrum to one or a few users.
This choice dictated the need for very stable oscillators and high-rejection
filters, for example. The stability of oscillators in consumer products is a
few hertz around 1 GHz, a few parts in a billion, a level of precision that
is unrivaled for any other physical quantity in a manufactured device.

   The RF spectrum is used to support a tremendous range of applications,
including voice and data communications, satellite-based navigation, radar,
weather radar, mapping, environmental monitoring, air traffic control, police
radar, perimeter surveillance, automobile collision avoidance, and many
military applications. A big trend is the virtual disappearance of analog radio
and now the almost complete use of digital radio. Digital radio is much more
tolerant to interference and can use a much smaller slice of the EM spectrum.
Another big trend is the tremendous demand for EM spectrum resulting
in appreciable use of the spectrum up to 100 GHz and soon beyond that.
Currently large parts of the spectrum are allocated for exclusive military use
and there is pressure to reduce the spectrum allocated for government use of
all kinds.

   In RF and microwave engineering there are always considerable
approximations made in design, partly because of necessary simplifications
that must be made in modeling, but also because many of the material
properties required in a detailed design can only be approximately known.
Most RF and microwave design deals with frequency-selective circuits often
relying on line lengths that have a length that is a particular fraction of
a wavelength. Many designs can require frequency tolerances of as little
as 0.1%, and filters can require even tighter tolerances. It is therefore
impossible to design exactly. Measurements are required to validate and
iterate designs. Conceptual understanding is essential; the designer must
be able to relate measurements, which themselves have errors, with
computer simulations. The ability to design circuits with good tolerance
to manufacturing variations and perhaps circuits that can be tuned by
automatic equipment are skills developed by experienced designers.

   Chapter 2 describes modulation methods and the ideas that led to being
able to transmit many bits of data per hertz of bandwidth. High orders
of modulation send many bits of information and the higher the order
of modulation the more sophisticated the modulation and demodulation
schemes must be. Transmitters and receivers that implement the modulation
and demodulation methods and up-convert and down-convert, respectively,
between the low frequency baseband information and the high frequency
radio signals are described in Chapter 3. Antennas reviewed in Chapter 4 are
the interface between electronic circuits and freely propagating EM waves.
Directional antennas are essential to supporting many users by enabling
frequency reuse of the EM spectrum in the same cell. The 1G through to
5G cellular systems are described in Chapter 5. In addition other microwave
systems such as radar and WiFi are briefly described and their development
has closely followed or just preceded that of cellular radio. The tremendous
advances are the result of the synergistic development of system concepts
and of digital and microwave hardware.

2.1 Introduction

Most radio communication systems superimpose slowly varying informa-
tion on a sinusoidal carrier that is transmitted as a radio frequency (RF)
signal. This modulated RF signal is sent through a medium, usually air, by
a transmitter to a receiver. In the transmitter information is initially repre-
sented at what is called baseband. The process of transferring information
from baseband to the much higher frequency carrier wave is called modula-
tion. Most modulation schemes slowly vary the amplitude and/or phase of
a sinusoidal carrier waveform. In the receiver the process is reversed using
demodulation to extract the baseband information from the varying state,
such as the amplitude and/or phase, of the modulated carrier.

   Radio has evolved subject to constraints imposed by political, hardware,
and compatibility considerations. New schemes generally must be compat-
ible and co-exist with earlier schemes. This chapter discusses the many dif-
ferent modulation schemes that are used in radios. Nearly all modulation
schemes are supported in modern radios such as 4G and 5G cellular radios,
and many are supported in WiFi. Sometimes this is to provide support for
legacy radios while in other situations they are used because simpler mod-
ulation formats tolerate higher levels of interference. Indeed the level of so-

                         phistication of modulation methods may need to be frequently changed to
                         accommodate varying interference environments. Legacy analog modula-

                         the relatively unsophisticated hardware of years past. High-order modula-
                         tion schemes enable many digital bits to be sent in each hertz of bandwidth
                         and are only possible because of the evolution of digital signal processing
                         and because of advances in high-density, low-power digital electronics.

                            Section 2.2 introduces some of the metrics that are used to compare
                         modulation schemes and Section 2.3 introduces modulation. Section 2.4
                         describes analog modulation. Then Section 2.5 describes digital modulation
                         followed by sections that deal with the specifics of various digital
                         modulation methods: frequency shift keying (FSK) in Section 2.6; phase
                         shift keying (PSK) in Section 2.8; and quadrature amplitude modulation
                         (QAM) in Section 2.9. Before the discussion of PSK a concept called carrier
                         recovery is discussed in Section 2.7 as the necessity to do this was behind
                         the development of a variety of PSK modulation schemes. This is followed
                         by a discussion of the metrics that can be used to quantify interference and
                         distortion of modulated signals.

                            Modulation, and the hardware architectures and circuits for modulating
                         and demodulating radio signals, are presented largely in three chapters.
                         There is an overlap of these topics but modulation itself is largely confined
                         to this chapter although some architecture concepts must necessarily be
                         introduced to understand the evolution of modulation schemes. The next
                         chapter, Chapter 3, focuses on architectures and essential circuits for
                         modulators and demodulators.

                     2.2 Radio Signal Metrics

                         Radio signals are engineered to trade-off efficient use of the EM spectrum
                         with the complexity and performance of the required RF hardware.
                         Ultimately the goal is to efficiently use spectrum through maximal packing
                         of information, e.g. digital bits, in a given bandwidth while, for mobile radios
                         especially, using as little prime power as possible. The choice of the type of
                         modulation to use is at the core of the communication system design trade-
                         off.

                            There are two families of modulation methods: analog and digital
                         modulation. In analog modulation the RF signal has a continuous range of
                         values; in digital modulation, the output has a number of discrete states at
                         particular times called clock ticks, say every microsecond. There are just a
                         few modulation schemes, all of which are digital, that achieve the optimum

of the amplitude of a modulated signal, and this variability has a direct
impact on how analog hardware performs are designed and how efficiently

Crest Factor

CF is the ratio of the maximum signal, such as a voltage, to its root-mean-
square (rms) value. Referring to the arbitrary waveform shown in Figure
2-2(a), xp is the absolute peak value of the waveform x(t), if xrms is its rms
value, then the crest factor is [2]

More formally,  CF = xp/xrms.                                    (2.1)
                CF = x ,                                         (2.2)

where x is the infinity norm, and here is the maximum value of x(t),
x = max[x(t)] = xp, and x2 is just the rms value of x(t):

                xrms = x2 = lim                 1 T x(t) · dt .  (2.3)

Note that CF is a voltage (or current) ratio rather than a power ratio. The CFs
of several waveforms are given in Table 2-1.

Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR)

The peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is analogous to CF but for power.
If x(t) is the voltage across a resistor, as shown in Figure 2-2(b), then the

                 where again xp is the peak absolute value of the waveform. Pp is the power
                 of the peak of a waveform treating it as though it was a DC signal. This is
                 appropriate for a slowly varying signal such as a power frequency signal as
                 it is this instantaneous power that determines thermal disruption of a power
                 system. It is not the appropriate power to use with radio signals and a more
                 suitable microwave signal metric is described in Section 2.2.2. The average
                 power dissipated in the resistor is

                 Then                Pavg = |xrms|2 /R.                           (2.5)
                 In decibels,      PAPR = Pp = CF2 = (xp/xrms)2 .                 (2.6)

                    The definition of PAPR above can be used with any waveform and can
                 be used in all branches of electrical engineering. The PAPRs of several
                 waveforms are given in Table 2-1.

EXAMPLE 2.1 Crest Factor and PAPR of an Offset Sinusoid.

What is the crest factor (CF) and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal x(t) =
0.1 + 0.5 sin(t)?

Solution:

The signal is a sinusoid offset by a DC term. The peak value of x(t) is xp = 0.6, and the rms
value of the signal will be the square root of the rms values squared of the individual DC and
sinusoidal components. This applies to any composite signal provided that the components

                                                         
are uncorrelated. So xrms = 0.12 + (0.5/ 2)2 = 0.3674. The general solution for a signal
x(t) = a + b sin(t) is, using Equation (2.3),

xrms =                lim 1    T                   lim 1    T
                     T  T                         T  T
                                [x(t)]2 .dt =                [a + b sin(t)]2 .dt

                             0                            0

            = lim 1 T a2 + ab sin(t) + b2 sin2(t) .dt
                  T  T 0

            = lim 1             T              T                     T
                  T  T
                                   a2.dt +        ab sin(t).dt +        b2  1  [1  +  cos(2t)]  .dt
                                                                            2
                             0              0                     0

            = lim 1 a2T.dt + 0 + 12 b2T                                                              (2.8)
                  T  T

since the integral of sin and cos over a period is zero. Thus

                     xrms = a2 + b2/2 = 0.12 + 12 0.52 = 0.3674,                                      (2.9)
                                                                                                     (2.10)
the crest factor is  CF = xp = 0.6 = 1.6331,                                                         (2.11)
                             xrms 0.3674

and PAPR is PAPR = 20 log(1.6331) = 4.260 dB.

There is a quicker way of calculating PAPR by dealing with the powers directly. The peak
power of the waveform is Pp = x2p/R = 0.62/R = 0.36/R, where x is being treated as a
voltage across a resistor R. The two parts of x(t), i.e. the DC component and the sinewave,

are uncorrelated, so the average power of the combined signal is the sum of the powers of

the uncorrelated components, so

                             Pavg = 1R 0.12 + 21 0.52 1R = 0.1350 R .                                (2.12)

Thus, in decibels,   Pp            xp2            0.36
  PAPR|dB = 10 log
                                = 2 = 10 log              = 10 log(2.667) = 4.260 dB. (2.13)
                     Pavg          xrms           0.135

2.2.2 Peak-to-Mean Envelope Power Ratio

Another metric for characterizing signals is the peak-to-mean envelope
power ratio (PMEPR) and this is particularly useful for modulated signals.
The amount of information sent by a communication signal is proportional
to its average power, however, RF hardware must be designed with
enough margin to be able to handle peaks in the signal without producing
appreciable distortion. The waveform of a narrowband modulated signal
appears as a carrier that slowly changes in amplitude and phase. One
sinewave of this modulated signal is called a pseudo-carrier and the power
of one cycle of the pseudo-carrier when the amplitude of the modulated
32              STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    signal is at its maximum (i.e. at the peak of the envelope) is called the peak
    envelope power (PEP) [1] (PEP = PPEP). The ratio of PEP to the average
    signal power (the power averaged over all time) is called the PMEPR.

       Then if the average power of the modulated signal is Pavg

                              PMEPR = PEP = PPEP .                          (2.14)
                                               Pavg     Pavg

    PMEPR is a good indicator of how sensitive a modulation format is to
    distortion introduced by the nonlinearity of RF hardware [3].

       It is complex to determine the PMEPR for a general modulated signal.
    Below the mathematics is presented for an AM signal with a sinusoidal
    modulating signal. Determining the PMEPR otherwise requires numerical
    integration following the procedure outlined below.

    PMEPR of an AM Signal

    A good estimate of the PMEPR of an AM signal can be obtained by
    considering a sinusoidal modulating signal (rather than an actual baseband
    signal). Let y(t) = cos (2fmt) be a cosinusoidal modulating signal with
    frequency fm. Then, for AM, the modulated carrier signal is

                  x(t) = Ac [1 + m cos (2fmt)] cos (2fct)                   (2.15)

    where m is the modulation index (e.g. 100% AM has m = 1). Thus if the
    power of just one quasi-period of x(t), i.e. one cycle of the pseudo carrier, is
    considered then x(t) has a power that varies with time.

       Consider a voltage v(t) across a resistor of conductance G. The power of
    the signal is determined by integrating over all time, which is work, and
    dividing by the time period. This yields the average power:

                           Pavg = lim  1 Gv2(t) dt.                         (2.16)
                                      - 2

    Now, if v(t) is a sinusoidal, v(t) = A cos t, then

    Pavg = lim 1        2     cos2
               2
                     Ac    G        (  t)  dt

                  -

    = lim 1        21
         2          AcG [1 + cos (2t)] dt
                  -           2

    = 12 A2c G    lim 1           1 dt + lim 1                          = 12 A2c G. (2.17)
                    2                        2
                              -                            cos (2t) dt

                                                        -

    In the above equation, a useful equivalence has been employed by observing
    that the infinite integral of a cosinusoid can be simplified to just integrating
    over one period, T = 2/:

                lim 1         cos  n (t) dt = 1          T /2               (2.18)

                                                        -T /2

    where n is a positive integer. In power calculations there are a number of
    other useful simplifying techniques based on trigonometric identities. Some

                           -

   Now the discussion returns to characterizing an AM signal by considering
the long-term average power and the maximum short-term power of the
signal. The pseudo-carrier at its peak amplitude is, from Equation (2.15),

                           xp(t) = Ac [1 + m] cos (2fct) .                                    (2.24)

Then the power (PPEP) of the peak pseudo carrier is obtained by integrating
over one period of the pseudo carrier:

   PPEP = 1         T/2 Gx2(t) dt = 1            T /2                  22

                    -T /2                 T     -T /2

The average power (Pavg) of the modulated signal is obtained by integrating

over all time, so

    Thus the rms voltage, xrms, can be determined as Pavg = x2rmsG. So the
    PMEPR of an AM signal (i.e., PMEPRAM) is

    For 100% AM described by m = 1, the PMEPR is

    2.2.3 Two-Tone Signal

    In assessing, either through laboratory measurements or simulations, it
    is common and often necessary to use very simple representations of a
    baseband signal or even of a modulated signal. This greatly simplifies
    matters and there is a justified expectation that the performance with the
    test signal is a good indication of performance with an actual baseband or
    modulated signal. With simulation at the circuit level it is usually impossible
    to consider real baseband signals as simulation may not even be possible or
    simulation may take unacceptable times. Instead it is common to use single-
    tone, i.e. single sinewave, or two-tone signals. A two-tone signal is a signal
    that is the sum of two cosinusoids:

             y(t) = XA cos(At) + XB cos(Bt).                            (2.29)

    Generally the frequencies of the two tones are close (|A - B|  A), with
    the concept being that both tones fit within the passband of a transmitter's or
    receiver's bandpass filters. A two-tone signal is not a form of modulation, but
    is commonly used to characterize the nonlinear performance of RF systems
    and has an envelope that is similar to that of many modulated signals. The
    composite signal, y(t), looks like a pseudo-carrier with a slowly varying
    amplitude, not unlike an AM signal. The tones are uncorrelated so that the
    average power of the composite signal, y(t), is the sum of the powers of each
    of the individual tones. The peak power of the composite signal is that of
    the peak pseudo-carrier, so y(t) has a peak amplitude of XA + XB. The peak
    pseudo carrier is the single RF sinusoid where the sinusoid of each sinusoid
    align as much as possible. Similar concepts apply to three-tone and n-tone
    signals.

EXAMPLE 2.2 PMEPR of a Two-Tone Signal

What is the PMEPR of a two-tone signal with the tones having equal amplitude?

Solution:

Let the amplitudes of the two tones be XA and XB. Now XA = XB = X, and so the peak

pseudo-carrier has amplitude 2X, and the power of the peak RF carrier is proportional to

12 (2X)2  =  2X 2 .  The  average  power  is proportional to  12     +      2  )  =  21 (X2  + X2)  =  X2,  as

                                                              2 (XA     XB

each tone is independent of the other and so the powers can be added.

                          PMEPR =         PPEP 2X2
                                                = 2 = 2 = 3 dB.                                        (2.30)

EXAMPLE 2.3 PMEPR of Uncorrelated Signals

Consider the combination of two uncorrelated analog signals, e.g. a two-tone signal.

One signal is denoted x(t) and the other y(t), where x(t) = 0.1 sin (109t) and y(t) =
0.05 sin (1.01 · 109t). What is the PMEPR of this combined signal?

Solution:

These two signals are uncorrelated and this is key in determining the average power, Pavg,
as the sum of the powers of each individual signal (k is a proportionality constant):

 Pavg = x2  (t) · dt + y2(t) · dt = k (0.1)2 + k (0.5)2 = k [0.01 + 0.0025] = 0.00625k.

          -               -

The two carriers are close in frequency so that the sum signal z(t) = x(t) + y(t) looks like a
slowly varying signal with a radian frequency near 109 rads per second. The peak amplitude

of one pseudo-cycle of z(t) is 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15. Thus the power of the largest cycle is

and so        PPEP = 12 k(0.15)2 = 0.01125k,                                                           (2.31)
          PMEPR = PPEP = 0.01125 = 1.8 = 2.55 dB.

                          Pavg 0.00625

and P2, respectively, then the average power of the composite signal is Pavg
= P1 + P2. However, in determining the peak sinusoidal power, the RF
cycle where the two largest pseudo-carrier sinusoids align is considered, and
here the voltages add to produce a single cycle of a sinewave with a higher
amplitude. So peak power applies to just one RF pseudo-cycle. Generally the
voltage amplitude of the two sinewaves would be added and then the power
calculated. If the uncorrelated carriers are modulated and the modulating
signals (the baseband signals) are uncorrelated, then the average power can
be determined in the same way, but the peak power calculation is much more
complicated. The integrations are the only calculations that can always be
relied on and can be used with all modulated signals.

                  The preferred usage of PAR, PAPR, or PMEPR in RF and microwave
               engineering is currently in a transition phase. The most common usage of
               PAR and PAPR in electrical engineering refers to the peak of a signal as being
               the instantaneous peak value, and in the case of PAPR, the instantaneous
               power of the signal is calculated as if the peak is a DC value. In the past,
               many RF and microwave publications have taken the peak as the peak
               power of a sinusoid having an amplitude equal to the peak voltage of the
               signal and used that to calculate PAR. This usage is inconsistent with the
               predominant usage in electrical engineering and is a particular problem
               when using wireless technology in other disciplines. PMEPR is the preferred
               usage for what RF and microwave engineers intend to refer to when using
               the term PAR. A reader of RF literature encountering PAR needs to determine
               how the term is being used. There is no confusion if PMEPR is used.

EXAMPLE 2.4 PAPR and PMEPR of an AM signal

    What is the PAPR and PMEPR of a 100% AM signal?

    Solution:

    The signal is x(t) = Ac [1 + cos 2fmt] cos 2fct and the PMEPR of this signal, from
    Equation (2.27), is 4.26 dB. Now PAPR uses the absolute maximum value of the signal rather
    than the maximum short-term power of the envelope. The peak value of x(t) is 2Ac so the
    peak power (if the signal is a voltage across a conductance G) is

                           Ppeak,PAPR = (2Ac)2 G.                                        (2.32)

    Pavg is the same for PAPR and PMEPR for the AM signal, see Equation (2.26), so that

               Ppeak,PAPR  (2Ac)2 G     = 4 = 16 = 5.333 = 7.27 dB.
    PAPR =                 =1 2            3/4 3                                         (2.33)
               Pavg        2 Ac 1 + 21

    So PAPR is 3 dB higher than PMEPR for a 100% modulated AM signal, see Equation (2.27).
    This is not always the case for other modulation schemes.

               2.3 Modulation Overview

               There are two families of modulation methods with analog modulation
               used in early radios including 1G cellular radio, and digital modulation
               used in modern radios starting with 2G cellular radio. While 1G cellular
               radio transmitted voice signals using analog modulation, 1G also used a
               simple type of digital modulation for signaling. With the exception of ultra-
               wideband (UWB) pulse radio [5], all modern radio modulation schemes
               slowly vary the amplitude, phase, or frequency of a sinusoidal signal called
               the carrier. This results in a narrow bandwidth modulated signal perhaps
               with fractional bandwidth typically in the range of 0.002% to 2%. The early
               spark-gap wireless telegraph systems were ultra-wideband but they were
               soon discontinued because they interfered with conventional radios which
               were soon developed and assigned specific parts, i.e. bands, of the spectrum.
               The initial pulse radio concept of the 1990s occupied most of the spectrum
               between 3.1 and 10.6 GHz but was never deployed mainly because capacity
               was relatively poor. The term ultra-wideband wireless is now widely taken
               to mean a wireless device such as a radar or radio with a bandwidth which
               is at least the lesser of 500 MHz or 20% of the carrier frequency [6]. So even
               the UWB millimeter-wave radios exploiting the high bandwidth available
MODULATION                                                                          37

at millimeter wave frequencies still employ a relatively slowly varying
modulation of a carrier.

2.4 Analog Modulation

The waveforms and spectra of the signals with common analog modulation
methods are shown in Figure 2-3. The modulating signal is generally referred
to as the baseband signal and it contains all of the information to be
transmitted and interpreted at the receiver. The waveforms in Figure 2-3 are
stylized. They are presented this way so that the effects of modulation can
be more easily seen. The baseband signal (Figure 2-3(a)) is shown as having
a period that is not much greater than the period of the carrier (Figure 2-
3(b)). In reality there would be hundreds or thousands of RF cycles for each
cycle of the baseband signal so that the highest frequency component of the
baseband signal is a tiny fraction of the carrier frequency. In this situation the
spectra shown on the right in Figure 2-3(c-e) would be too narrow to enable
any detail to be seen.

2.4.1 Amplitude Modulation

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is the simplest analog modulation method to
implement. Here a signal is used to slowly vary the amplitude of the carrier
according to the level of the modulating signal. With AM (Figure 2-3(c))
the amplitude of the carrier is modulated, and this results in a broadening
of the spectrum of the carrier, as shown in Figure 2-3(c)(ii). This spectrum
contains the original carrier component and upper and lower sidebands,
designated as U and L, respectively. In AM, the two sidebands contain
identical information, so all the information contained in the baseband signal
is conveyed if just one sideband is transmitted.

   The basic AM signal x(t) has the form

            x(t) = Ac [1 + my(t)] cos(2fct),  (2.34)

50% AM modulated signal; and
(f) rectified and lowpass (LP) fil-
tered 50% modulated signal. The
envelope contains only ampli-
tude information and for AM the
envelope is the same as the base-
band signal.

                         where m is the modulation index, y(t) is the baseband information-bearing
                         signal that has frequency components that are much lower than the carrier
                         frequency fc, and the maximum value of |y(t)| is one. Provided that y(t)
                         varies slowly relative to the carrier, x(t) looks like a carrier whose amplitude
                         varies slowly. To get an idea of how slowly the amplitude varies in an
                         actual system, consider an AM radio that broadcasts at 1 MHz (which is in
                         the middle of the AM broadcast band). The highest frequency component
                         of the modulating signal corresponding to voice is about 4 kHz. Thus the
                         amplitude of the carrier takes 250 carrier cycles to go through a complete
                         amplitude variation. At all times a cycle of the modulated carrier, the
                         pseudo-carrier, appears to be periodic, but in fact it is not quite.

                            The concept of the envelope of a modulated RF signal is introduced in
                         Figure 2-4. The envelope is an important concept and is directly related
                         to the distortion introduced by analog hardware and to the DC power
                         requirements which determines the battery life for mobile radios. Figure 2-
                         4(a) is the carrier and the amplitude-modulated carrier is shown in Figure
                         2-4(b). The outline of the modulated carrier is called the envelope, and for
                         AM this is identical to the modulating, i.e. baseband, signal. The envelope is
                         shown again in Figure 2-4(c). At the peak of the envelope, the RF signal has
                         maximum short-term power (considering the power of a single RF cycle).
                         With 100% AM, m = 1 in Equation (2.34), there is no short-term RF power
                         when the envelope is at its minimum. The modulated signal with 50%
                         modulation, m = 0.5, is shown in Figure 2-4(d) and at all times there is an
                         appreciable RF signal power.

                            Very simple analog hardware is required to demodulate the basic
                         amplitude modulated signal, that is an AM signal with a carrier and both
                         sidebands. The receiver requires bandpass filtering to select the channel from
                         the incoming radio signal then rectifying the output of the bandpass filter.
                         The waveform after rectification of a 50% AM signal is shown in Figure 2-
                         4(e) and contains frequency components at baseband and sidebands around
                         harmonics of the carrier, and the harmonics of the carrier itself. Lowpass
                         filtering of the rectified waveform extracts the original baseband signal and
                         completes demodulation, see Figure 2-4(f). The only electronics required is a

single diode. The disadvantage is that more spectrum is used than required
and the largest signal is the carrier that conveys no information but causes
interference in other radios. Without the carrier and both sidebands being
transmitted it is necessary to use DSP to demodulate the signal.

   It is not possible to represent an actual baseband signal in a simple way
and undertake the analytic derivations that illustrate the characteristics
of modulation. Instead it is usual to use either a one-tone or two-tone
signal, derive results, and then extrapolate the results for a finite bandwidth
baseband signal. For a single-tone baseband signal y(t) = cos(mt + ), then
the basic AM modulated signal, from Equation (2.34), is

x(t) = [1 + m cos(mt + ] cos(ct)                                                          (2.35)
      = cos(ct) + 12 m[cos((c - m)t - ) + cos((c + m)t + )]

which has three (radian) frequency components, one at the carrier frequency

c, one just below the carrier at c - m, and one just above at c + M (since

m  c). The extension to a finite bandwidth baseband signal, see Figure 2-
                                                                              1

the carrier then become finite bandwidth sidebands with a lower sideband L

centered at c - m and an upper sideband U centered at at (c + m) each

having the same bandwidth, , as the baseband signal, see Figure 2-3(c)(ii).

The AM modulator described so far produces a modulated signal with

a carrier and two sidebands. This modulation is called double-sideband

(DSB) modulation. There is identical information in each of the sidebands

and so only one of the sidebands needs to be transmitted. The carrier

contains no information so if only one sideband was transmitted then the

received single-sideband (SSB) suppressed-carrier SC (together SSB-SC)

signal has all of the information needed to recover the original baseband

signal. However the simple demodulation process using rectification as

described earlier in this section no longer works. The receiver needs to use

DSP but the spectrum is used efficiently.

One circuit that implements SSB-SC AM is the Hartley modulator shown

in Figure 2-5. As will be seen, this basic architecture is significant and used

in all modern radios. In modern radios the Hartley modulator, or a variant,

takes a modulated signal which is centered at an intermediate frequency and

shifts it up in frequency so that it is centered at another frequency a little

below or a little above the carrier of the Hartley modulator.

In a Hartley modulator both the modulating signal m(t) and the carrier are

multiplied together in a mixer and then also 90 phase-shifted versions are

mixed before being added together. The signal flow is as follows beginning

with m(t) = cos(mt + ), p(t) = cos(mt +  - /2) = sin(mt + ) and

    and so the lower sideband (LSB) is selected. An interesting observation is
    that the phase, , of the baseband signal is also translated up in frequency. A
    feature that is not exploited in AM but is in digital modulation.

    2.4.2 Phase Modulation

    In phase modulation (PM) the phase of the carrier depends on the
    instantaneous level of the baseband signal. The phase-modulated carrier is
    shown in Figure 2-3(e)(i) and it looks like the frequency of the modulated
    carrier is changing. What is actually happening is that when the phase is
    changing most quickly the apparent frequency of the RF waveform changes.
    Here, as the baseband signal is decreasing, the phase shift reduces and
    the effect is to increase the apparent frequency of the RF signal. As the
    baseband signal increases, the effect is to reduce the apparent frequency of
    the modulated RF signal. The result is that with PM is that the bandwidth
    of the time-varying signal is spread out, as seen in Figure 2-6. PM can be
    implemented using a phase-locked loop (PLL) but further details will be
    skipped here.

       Consider a phase-modulated signal s(t) = cos(ct + (t)) where (t) is the
    baseband signal containing the information to be transmitted. The spectrum
    of s(t) can be determined by simplifying (t) as a sinusoid with frequency
    fm = 2m so that (t) =  cos(mt) where  is the phase modulation index.
    (The maximum possible phase change is ± and then  = .) The phase-
    modulated signal becomes

              s(t) = cos(ct +  cos(mt)])                                             (2.37)
                   = cos(ct) cos(cos(mt)) - sin(ct) sin(cos(mt))

    which has the Bessel function-based expansion

    s(t) = J0() cos(ct)                                                              (2.38)
    + J1() cos(c + m)t + /2) + J1() cos(c - m)t + /2)
    + J2() cos(c + 2m)t + ) + J2() cos(c - 2m)t + ]
    + J3() cos(c + 3m)t + 3/2) + J3() cos(c - 3m)t + 3/2) + . . .

    where Jn is the Bessel function of the first kind of order n. The spectrum of
    this signal is shown in Figure 2-6(a) which consists of discrete tones grouped
    as lower- and upper-sideband sets centered on the carrier at fc. The discrete
    tones in the sidebands are separated from each other and from fc by fm. The
    sidebands have lower amplitude further away from the carrier.

       If the modulating signal has a finite bandwidth, approximated by fm
    varying from a minimum value, (fm - f ) up to the maximum frequency
    (fm + f ), then the spectrum of the modulated signal becomes that shown
    in Figure 2-6(b), with the centers of adjacent sidebands separated by fm and
    the first sidebands separated from the carrier by fm as well. This is DSB

modulation and there is a carrier (so it is not suppressed). The sidebands do
not carry identical information and several, perhaps three below and three
above the carrier, are required to enable demodulation of a PM signal. Thus
a rather large bandwidth is required to transmit the modulated signal.

2.4.3 Frequency Modulation

The other analog modulation schemes commonly used is frequency
modulation (FM), see Figure 2-3(d). The signals produced by FM and PM
appear to be similar; the difference is in how the signals are generated. In
FM, the amplitude of the baseband signal determines the frequency of the
modulated carrier. Consider the FM waveform in Figure 2-3(d)(i). When the
baseband signal is at its peak value the modulated carrier is at its minimum
frequency, and when the signal is at is lowest value the modulated carrier
is at its maximum frequency. (Depending on the hardware implementation
it could be the other way around.) The result is that the bandwidth of the
time-varying signal is spread out, as seen in Figure 2-7.

   One way of implementing the FM modulator is to use a voltage-controlled
42  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    oscillator (VCO) with the baseband signal controlling the frequency of an
    oscillator. An FM receiver must compress, in frequency, the transmitted
    signal to re-create the original narrower bandwidth baseband signal. FM
    demodulation can be thought of as providing signal enhancement or
    equivalently noise suppression in a process that can be called analog
    processing gain. Only the components of the original FM signals are
    coherently collapsed to a narrower bandwidth baseband signal while noise,
    being uncorrelated, is still spread out (although rearranged). Thus the ratio of
    the signal to noise powers increases, as after demodulation only the power
    of the noise in the smaller bandwidth of the baseband signal is important.
    Thus compared to AM, FM significantly increases the tolerance to noise that
    may be added to the signal during transmission. PM has the same property,
    although the details of modulation and demodulation are different. For both
    FM and PM signals the peak amplitude of the RF phasor is equal to the
    average amplitude, and so the PMEPR is 1 or 0 dB.

       Consider an FM signal s(t) = cos([c + x(t)]t) where x(t) is the baseband
    signal containing the information to be transmitted. The spectrum of s(t) can
    be determined by simplifying x(t) as a sinusoid with frequency fm = 2m
    so that x(t) =  cos(mt) where  is the frequency modulation index. The
    FM signal becomes

    s(t) = cos([c +  cos(mt)]t)                           (2.39)
         = cos(ct) cos(cos(mt)t) - sin(ct) sin(cos(mt)t)

    which has the Bessel function-based expansion

    s(t) = J0(t) cos(ct)
    - J1() sin(c + m)t + /2) - J1(t) sin(c - m)t + /2)
    - J2(t) cos(c - 2m)t + ) + J2(t) cos(c - 2m)t + ]
    + J3(t) sin(c + 3m)t + 3/2) + J3(t) sin(c - 3m)t + 3/2) + . . .

                                                                                                  (2.40)

    where Jn is the Bessel function of the first kind of order n. The spectrum of
    this signal is shown in Figure 2-7(b) which consists of discrete tones grouped
    as lower- and upper-sideband sets centered on the carrier at fc. The discrete
    tones in the sidebands are separated from each other and from fc by fm. The
    sidebands have lower amplitude further away from the carrier.

       If the modulating signal has a finite bandwidth, approximated by fm =
    m/(2) varying from a minimum value (fm- f ) up to the maximum
    frequency (fm+ f ), then the spectrum of the modulated signal becomes
    that shown in Figure 2-7(c) with the centers of adjacent sidebands separated
    by fm and the first sidebands from the carrier by fm as well. This is DSB
    modulation and there is a carrier (so it is not suppressed but is smaller
    than with AM). The sidebands do not carry identical information and
    several, perhaps three on either side of the carrier, are required to enable
    demodulation of an FM signal. Thus a rather large bandwidth to required
    to transmit the modulated signal as it is not sufficient to transmit just one
    sideband to enable demodulation.
MODULATION                                                                                            43

Carson's Rule

Frequency- and phase-modulated signals have a very wide spectrum and the
bandwidth required to reliably transmit a PM or FM signal is subjective. The
best accepted criterion for determining the bandwidth requirement is called
Carson's bandwidth rule or just Carson's rule [7, 8].

   An FM signal is shown in Figure 2-7. In particular, Figure 2-7(a) shows the
FM function. The level (typically voltage) of the baseband signal determines
the frequency deviation of the carrier from its unmodulated value. The
frequency shift when the modulating signal is a DC value xm at its maximum
amplitude is called the peak frequency deviation, f . So, if the modulating
signal changes very slowly, the bandwidth of the modulated signal is 2f .

   A rapidly varying sinusoidal modulating signal produces a modulated
signal with many discrete sidebands as seen in Figure 2-7(b). If the modulat-
ing baseband signal is broadband, then the sidebands have finite bandwidth
as seen in Figure 2-7(c) and many are required to recover the original base-
band signal. These sidebands continue indefinitely in frequency but rapidly
reduce in power away from the frequency of the unmodulated carrier. Car-
son's rule provides an estimate of the bandwidth that contains 98% of the
energy. If the maximum frequency of the modulating signal is fm, and the
maximum value of the modulating waveform is xm (which would produce
a frequency deviation of f if it is DC), then Carson's rule is that the

               bandwidth required = 2 × (fm + f ) .  (2.41)

Narrowband and Wideband FM

The most common type of FM signal, as used in FM broadcast radio, is called
wideband FM, as the maximum frequency deviation is much greater than the
highest frequency of the modulating or baseband signal, that is, f  fm.
In narrowband FM, f is close to fm. Narrowband FM uses less bandwidth
but requires a more sophisticated demodulation technique.

EXAMPLE 2.5 PAPR and PMEPR of FM Signals

      Consider FM signals close in frequency but whose spectra do not overlap.

      (a) What are PAPR and PMEPR of just one FM signal?
      (b) What are PAPR and PMEPR of a signal comprised of two uncorrelated narrowband FM

           signals each having a small fractional bandwidth and having the same average power.

      Solution:

      (a) An FM signal has a constant envelope just like a single sinusoid, and so PAPR = 1.414 =
           3.01 dB and PMEPR = 1 = 0 dB.

      (b) Since the modulation is relatively slow, each of the FM signals will look like single tone
           signals and the combined signal will look like a two-tone signal. However this is not
           enough to solve the problem. A thought experiment is required to determine the largest
           pseudo-carrier when the FM signals combine. If the amplitude of each tone is X, then
           the amplitude when the FM signal waveforms align is 2X. (This is the same as the peak
           of a two-tone signal but arrived at differently.) Then

                                 Pavg = sum of the powers of each FM signal = 2k 21 X2,

           where k is a proportionality constant. For PAPR,

         2.4.4 Analog Modulation Summary

         Analog modulation was used in the first radios and in 1G cellular radios.
         Radio transmission using analog modulation, i.e. analog radio, has almost
         ceased as it does not use spectrum efficiently. Digital modulation along with
         error correction, can pack much more information in a limited bandwidth. A
         final comparison of the analog modulation techniques is given in Figure 2-8
         emphasizing the PMEPR of AM and FM. The PMEPR of PM is the same as
         for FM.

            One particular event in the development of radio is illustrative of the
         relationship of technology and business interests. Frequency modulation
         was invented by Edwin H. Armstrong and patented in 1933 [9, 10]. FM
         is virtually static free and clearly superior to AM radio. However, it was
         not immediately adopted largely because AM radio was established in the
         1930s, and the adoption of FM would have resulted in the scrapping of a
         large installed infrastructure (seen as a commercial catastrophe) and so the
         introduction of FM was delayed by decades. The best technology does not
         always win immediately! Commercial interests and the large investment
         in an alternative technology have a great deal to do with the success of a
         technology [11].

            With FM and PM there are two sets of sidebands with one set above the
         carrier frequency and the other set below. The carrier itself is low-level but
         is not completely suppressed. Now SSB modulation refers to producing just
         one of the sideband sets. There is such as thing as SSB FM with just a few
         sidebands below (or above) the carrier but it is more like a combination of
         FM and AM [12], and was never deployed.

         2.5 Digital Modulation

         Digital radio transmits bits by creating discrete states, usually discrete
         amplitudes and phases of a carrier. The process of creating these discrete
         states from a digital bitstream is called digital modulation. A state is
         established at a particular time called a clock tick. What that means is that the

information in the signal is the state of the waveform, such as the amplitude
and the phase of a phasor, at every clock tick such as every microsecond.
The time it takes to go from one state to another (a clock tick interval)
defines the bandwidth of the modulated signal. For example, if a clock tick
is at every microsecond the bandwidth of the modulated signal is about one
megahertz as it takes about one microsecond to go from one state to another.
The inverse relationship of the interval between clock ticks to bandwidth is
only approximate (as will be seen when software-defined radio is considered
in a future chapter).

   One important digital modulation method does not fit with the description
above. This is Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation where the carrier is
set to a particular frequency at each clock tick.

   The basic digital modulation formats are shown in Figure 2-9. The
fundamental characteristic of digital modulation is that there are discrete
states, each of which is also known as a symbol, with a symbol defining the
value of one or more bits. For example, the states are different frequencies in
FSK and different phases in phase shift keying (PSK). With the modulated
waveforms shown in Figure 2-9 there are only two states, which is the
same as saying that there are two symbols, each symbol having one bit
of information (either 0 or 1). With multiple states groups of bits can be
represented.

   In this section many methods of digital modulation are described. The
first few methods are binary modulation methods with just two symbols
with one symbol indicating that a single bit is `0' and the other symbol
indicating that it is a `1'. Then four-state modulation is introduced with four
symbols with each symbol indicating the values of two bits. Higher-order
modulation schemes can send more than more bits per symbol and thus
more bits per second (bits/s) per hertz of bandwidth. There is a limit to the
number of symbols as the "distance" between symbols becomes smaller and
the effect of noise, interference, and circuit distortion can cause a symbol to
be misinterpreted as another. A modulation method that sends more bits per
symbol is said to have higher modulation efficiency. This and other metrics
that enable modulation methods to be compared are defined in the next
subsection.

    2.5.1 Modulation Efficiency

    With digital modulation, the information being sent is in the form of bits and
    it is possible to send more that one bit per second in one hertz of bandwidth.
    This is because in digital modulation there can be several bits per symbol,
    however the bandwidth of the modulated signal is determined by the rate of
    change from one state to another, whereas the number of bits per transition
    depends on the number of states. It is important for the transition to be no
    faster than required so as to minimize bandwidth.

       The ratio of the bit rate in bits per second (bits/s) to the bandwidth (BW)
    in hertz is called the modulation efficiency, c, and has the units of bits per
    second per hertz (bits/s/Hz). The modulation efficiency is also called the
    channel efficiency, hence the subscript c on c. The bits here are the gross bits
    which includes the information bits and bits added for error correction and
    others added to aid in identifying the signal, and so c is a measure of the
    performance of the modulation method itself. Thus

                              modulation efficiency = c = gross bit rate .                       (2.44)
                                                                      bandwidth

       The additional bits added to a bit stream are called coding bits and
    the process of adding the coding bits is called coding. If coding is used,
    then the information rate is lower than the gross bit rate transmitted. Thus
    gross bit rate refers to the bits actually transmitted and information rate
    (or information bit rate) refers to the bit rate of information transmission.
    The link spectrum efficiency is the information bit rate divided by the
    bandwidth. Often the term "link" is dropped and just spectrum efficiency
    is used (with units of bits/s/Hz). Thus

    link spectrum efficiency = information bit rate  c.                                          (2.45)
                                             bandwidth

EXAMPLE 2.6 Modulation Efficiency

    A radio transmits a bit stream of 2 Mbits/s using a bandwidth of 1 MHz.

      (a) What is the modulation efficiency?
      (b) If 25% of the bits are used for error correction, what is the modulation efficiency?
      (c) With error correction coding, what is the information rate?
     (d) With error correction coding, what is the link spectrum efficiency?

    Solution:

    (a) The gross bit rate is 2 Mbits/s and the bandwidth is 1 MHz. So

    c = modulation efficiency = gross bit rate = 2 Mbits/ss = 2 bits/s/Hz.
                                   bandwidth  1 MHz

    (b) The modulation efficiency is unaffected by error correction coding. So the modulation

    efficiency is unchanged:
    c = modulation efficiency = gross bit rate = 2 Mbits/s = 2 bits/s/Hz.
                                   bandwidth  1 MHz

    (c) With 25% of the bits in the gross bit stream being coding bits, the information rate is
         75% of 2 Mbits/s or 1.5 Mbits/s.

    (d) link spectrum efficiency = information bit rate = 1.5 Mbits/s = 1.5 bits/s/Hz.

2.6 Frequency Shift Keying, FSK

Frequency shift keying (FSK) is one of the simplest forms of digital
modulation, with the frequency of the transmitted signal at a clock tick
indicating a symbol, usually representing either one or two bits. Binary
FSK (BFSK) is illustrated in Figure 2-9(d). It can be implemented by
applying a discrete signal to the input of a voltage-controlled oscillator
and so was ideally suited to early digital radio as simple high-performance
FM modulators were available. Four-state FSK modulation is used in the
GSM 2G cellular standard, a legacy standard still widely supported by
modern cellular radios and sometimes the only modulation supported by the
infrastructure (i.e. basestations) in some regions where it is not economically
viable to retrofit old installations.

2.6.1 Essentials of FSK Modulation

The schematic of a binary FSK modulation system is shown in Figure
2-10. Here, a binary bitstream is lowpass filtered and used to drive an
FSK modulator, one implementation of which shifts the frequency of an
oscillator according to the voltage of the baseband signal. This function
can be achieved using a VCO or a PLL circuit, and an FM demodulator
can be used to receive the signal. Another characteristic feature of FSK
is that the amplitude of the modulated signal is constant, so efficient
saturating (and hence nonlinear) amplifiers can be used without the concern
of frequency distortion. Not surprisingly, FSK was the first form of digital
modulation used in mobile digital radio. A particular implementation of FSK
is Minimum Shift Keying (MSK), which uses a baseband lowpass filter so
that the transitions from one state to another are smooth in time and limit the
bandwidth of the modulated signal.

   The constellation diagram is often thought of as being like a phasor
diagram and this analogy works most of the time but it does not work
for FSK modulation. A phasor diagram describes a phasor that is fixed in
frequency. If the phasor is very slowly phase and/or amplitude modulated,
then this approximation is good. FSK modulation cannot be represented on a
phasor diagram, as the information is in the frequency at the clock ticks and
not the than the phase and/or amplitude of a phasor. The symbols of two-
and four-state FSK modulation are shown in Figure 2-11 which are called
constellation diagrams

   As an example consider an FSK-modulated signal with a bandwidth of
200 kHz and a carrier at 1 GHz (this approximately corresponds to the 2G
GSM cellular system). This is a 0.02% bandwidth, so the phasor changes
very slowly. Going from one FSK state to another takes about 1230 to 3692

            Figure 2-10: The frequency shift
            keying (FSK) modulation system.
            In the GSM four-state cellular sys-
            temadjacent constellation points
            differ in frequency by 33.25 kHz.
48  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

FSK modulation. In two-state FSK a
symbol indicates whether a bit is a '0'
or a '1'. In four-state FSK there are four
symbols and each symbol has a different
frequency and indicates the values of two
bits.

    RF cycles depending on the frequency difference of the transition from one
    symbol to the next. With a 1 GHz carrier the frequencies of the four symbols
    are (1 GHz - 33.25 kHz), (1 GHz - 16.62 kHz), (1 GHz + 16.62 kHz), and
    (1 GHz + 33.25 kHz). This may seem like a very small frequency difference
    but hardware in the basestation and in the handset can easily achieve a
    frequency resolution of a few hertz at 1 GHz. In trying to represent FSK
    modulation on a pseudo-phasor diagram, the frequency is approximated
    as being fixed and the maximum real frequency shift is arbitrarily taken as
    being a significant shift of the pseudo-phasor.

       In FSK, the states are on a circle in the constellation diagram (see Figure 2-
    11), with two-state FSK shown in Figure 2-11(a) and four-state FSK shown
    in Figure 2-11(b). Note that the constellation diagram indicates that the
    amplitude of the phasor is constant, as FSK modulation is a form of FM
    modulation. Consider four-state FSK more closely. There are four frequency
    states ranging from the low-frequency state to the high-frequency state as
    shown in Figure 2-11(b). In four-state FSK modulation a transition from the
    low-frequency state to the high-frequency state takes three times longer than
    a transition between adjacent states. While the `01' and `11' states appear
    to be adjacent, in reality the frequency transition must traverse through
    the other frequency states. Filtering of the baseband modulating signal is
    required to minimize the bandwidth of the modulated four-state FSK signal.
    This reduces modulation efficiency to less than the theoretical maximum of
    2 bits/s/Hz.

       In summary, there are slight inconsistencies and arbitrariness in using a
    phasor diagram for FSK, but FSK does have a defined constellation diagram
    that is closely related, but not identical, to a phasor diagram. Another
    difference is that a phasor diagram depends on the amplitude of the RF
    signal, while a constellation diagram is continuously being re-normalized to
    the average RF power level to maintain a constant size. With FSK modulation
    almost the entire modulation and demodulation paths can be implemented
    using analog circuitry and so was ideally suited to early cellular radios.

    2.6.2 Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying

    Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) is the modulation scheme used
    in the GSM cellular wireless system and is a variant of MSK with
    waveform shaping coming from a Gaussian lowpass filter. It is a particular
    implementation of FSK modulation.

       The modulation efficiency of GMSK as implemented in the GSM system
    (it depends slightly on the Gaussian filter parameters) is 1.35 bits/s/Hz.
    Unfiltered MSK has a constant RF envelope. However filtering is required
MODULATION                                                                         49

to limit the RF bandwidth and this results in amplitude variations of about
30%. This is still very little so one of the fundamental advantages of this
modulation scheme is that nonlinear, power-efficient amplification can be
used. GMSK is essentially a digital implementation of FM with discrete
changes in the frequency of modulation with the input bitstream filtered
so that the change in frequency from one state to the next is smooth. It is
only at the clock ticks that the modulated signal must have the specified
discrete frequency. The phase of the modulating signal is always continuous
and there is no information in the phase of the modulated signal.

   The ideal transitions in FSK follow a circle from one state to another
as shown in Figure 2-11 so that the PMEPR of ideal FSK is 0 dB. With
GMSK the transitions do not follow a circle because of the filtering and the
transitions also overshoot. As such the amplitude of a GMSK modulated
signal varies and the PMEPR of GMSK is 3.01 dB. This is the PMEPR for a
single modulated carrier, combining multiple modulated carriers as done in
a basestation increases the PMEPR. Statistically the envelopes are less likely
to all align if there are multiple carriers. For example, with multi-carrier
GMSK, PMEPR = 3.01 dB, 6.02 dB, 9.01 dB, 11.40 dB, 14.26 dB, and 17.39 dB
for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 carriers respectively. (These values were calculated
numerically by simulating a multi-carrier system.)

   GMSK and other FSK methods have the advantage that implementation of
the baseband and RF hardware is relatively simple. A GMSK transmitter can
use conventional frequency modulation. On receive, an FM discriminator,
i.e. an FM receiver with sampling, can be used avoiding more complex I and
Q demodulation.

2.6.3 Doppler Effect

Frequency is a physical parameter that can be established and measured
with great accuracy, down to a few hertz at 1 GHz in a mobile handset for
example. Thus if a receiver is stationary the frequency states at the clock ticks
of an FSK modulated carrier can be measured with great accuracy. When a
receiver and transmitter are moving relative to each other there will be a
Doppler shift of the carrier frequency. If the relative velocity of the receiver
and transmitter is vs the Doppler shift will be

            f = f vs/c  (2.46)

where f is the frequency of the radio transmission and c is the speed of light.
For a receiver moving at 100 km/hr receiving a 1 GHz signal from a fixed
transmitter, the Doppler frequency shift is f = 92.6 Hz which is much less
than the 33 kHz frequency spacing of adjacent states in the FSK example
above. Thus the Doppler shift is not of concern. This effective fixing of the
constellation points is one of the advantages of GSM.

2.6.4 Summary

GSM was not the only 2G system. The 2G NADC (for North American
Digital Cellular) system modulated the phase of a carrier using phase shift
keying. The NADC cellular system had higher modulation efficiency than
GSM yet MSK became the dominant 2G system and is still supported as
a legacy modulation system in modern cellular radio. The main reason for
50  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    this is that GSM was more closely aligned with the business interests of the
    telephone operators of the day.

    2.7 Carrier Recovery

    Carrier recovery refers to establishing a local carrier reference signal which
    accurately reproduces the frequency and, with some modulation methods,
    the phase of the carrier of the modulated signal. All digital modulation
    methods require carrier recovery to establish a reference to determine the
    state of the carrier at the clock ticks. In addition digital modulation methods
    require that the timing of the clock ticks be established. Since radios using
    digital modulation all send packets of data, i.e. sequences of symbols, having
    a known sequence at the beginning of packet transmission enables the timing
    to be determined.

       With FSK modulation the frequency at the clock ticks must be determined.
    This is relatively simple because the frequency at the clock ticks can be
    accurately measured as a local clock can be established within a few hertz
    because of the availability of accurate crystal references. The frequency of the
    received signal can still be shifted by the Doppler effect of the transmitter
    or receiver is moving but this is quite small compared to the frequency
    differences between the received states. With FSK it is not necessary to
    determine the phase of the carrier.

       All digital modulation other than FSK modulates a carrier by shifting the
    carrier's phase and/or amplitude to a number of discrete states. Recovering
    the state of this modulated carrier requires that the phase of the carrier be
    recovered from the receive signal and to do this there must be a constant
    phase local version of the carrier. The circuits that implement the local
    version of the carrier are called carrier recovery circuits. These circuits
    modify a very stable internal oscillator in the receiver that after an initial
    setting of an approximate frequency, has a frequency and phase that can
    only change slowly. However, there must be a received signal at all times,
    because if the received signal falls below the noise level the carrier recovery
    circuit will try to track the noise. This requirement has led to a number of
    different modulation schemes that avoid the amplitude of the modulated
    signal from ever being small during a transition. This is important in 2G and
    3G cellular radio but 4G and 5G cellular systems use pilot tones to achieve
    carrier recovery.

       In early digital radios carrier recovery was implemented in analog
    circuitry and more modern radios implement carrier recovery by splitting
    the function between an analog oscillator signal that can be assigned to
    a large number of discrete states (providing course carrier recovery) and
    DSP of the (coarsely recovered) baseband signal to precisely recover the
    carrier signal. Thus in modern digital radios the carrier recovery circuit is
    implemented partially as an analog circuit and partially as a digital circuit.

    2.8 Phase Shift Keying Modulation

    There are many variations on phase shift keying (PSK) modulation with
    the methods differing by their spectral efficiencies, PMEPR, and suitability
    for carrier recovery. Compared to FSK more sophisticated digital signal
    processing is required to demodulate a PSK-modulated signal.

2.8.1 Essentials of PSK

PSK is an efficient digital modulation scheme and can be simply
implemented and demodulated using a phase-locked loop. The simplest
scheme is binary PSK (BPSK) with two phase states. The waveform and
spectrum of BPSK are shown in Figure 2-12. The incoming baseband
bitstream shown in Figure 2-12(a) modulates the phase of a carrier producing
the modulated signal shown in Figure 2-12(b). The spectrum of the
modulated signal is shown in Figure 2-12(c). What is very interesting about
this spectrum is that it approximately fills a square. So PSK modulation
results in an efficient use of the spectrum. This can be contrasted with the
spectrum of an FM signal shown in Figure 2-7(c), which does not fill the
channel uniformly. A binary PSK modulation system is shown in Figure 2-13
where the binary input data causes 180 phase changes of the carrier. The
abrupt changes in phase shown in the output modulated waveform result
in more bandwidth than is necessary. However a practical PSK modulator
first lowpass filters the binary data before the carrier is modulated. This
filtering eliminates the abrupt changes in the phase of the modulated signal
and so reduces the required bandwidth. It is the spectrum of this signal that
is shown in Figure 2-12(c).

   There are many variants of increasing complexity, called orders, of PSK,
with the fundamental characteristics being the number of phase states (e.g.
with 2n phase states, n bits of information can be transmitted) and how the
phasor of the RF signal transitions from one phase state to another. PSK
schemes are designed to shape the spectrum of the modulated signal to fit as
much energy as possible within a spectral mask. This results in a modulated
carrier whose amplitude varies (and thus has a time-varying envelope). Such
schemes require highly linear amplifiers to preserve the amplitude variations
of the modulated RF signal.

   There are PSK methods that manage the phase transitions to achieve
a constant envelope modulated RF signal but these have lower spectral
efficiency. Military radios sometimes use this type of modulation scheme as
it is much harder to detect and intercept communications if the amplitude of
the modulated carrier is constant.

   The communication limit of one symbol per hertz of bandwidth,
52  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

Figure 2-14: Phasor diagram of QPSK modulation. Here there are four
discrete phase states of the phasor indictaed by the points A, B, C, and
D. The PSK modulator moves the phasor from one phase state to another.
The task at the receiver is determining the phase of the phasor.

                         the symbol rate, comes from the Nyquist signaling theorem.1 Nyquist
                         determined that the number of independent pulses that could be put through
                         a telegraph channel per unit of time is limited to twice the bandwidth of
                         the channel. With a modulated RF carrier, this translates to the modulated
                         carrier moving from one state to another in a unit of time equal to one over
                         the bandwidth. The transition identifies a symbol, and hence one symbol
                         can be sent per hertz of bandwidth. More accurately it could be said that the
                         transition is a symbol rather than the end of the transition being a symbol. In
                         PSK modulation the states are the phases of a phasor since the amplitude of
                         the modulated signal is (ideally) constant.

                            The phase-shifted (i.e. phase-modulated) carrier of a PSK signal can be
                         represented on a phasor diagram. Figure 2-14 is a phasor diagram with four
                         phase states--A, B, C, D--and the phasor moves from one state to another
                         under the control of the modulation circuit. What is shown here is 4-state
                         PSK or quadra-phase shift keying (QPSK) and very often but less accurately
                         called quadrature phase shift keying. The states, or symbols, are identified
                         by their angle or equivalently by their rectangular coordinates, called I, for
                         in-phase, and Q, for quadrature phase.

                         PSK Modulation

                         In PSK modulation the phase of a carrier signal is set to one of a number
                         of discrete values at the clock ticks. For example, in QPSK there are four
                         discrete settings of the phase of the carrier, e.g. 45, 135, -135, and -45.
                         Converting this to radians the discrete baseband signal is (t) = /4, 3/4,
                         5/4, and 7/4, at the clock ticks. Thus if the bandwidth of the baseband
                         signal is 1 MHz what is shown as (t) are the intended phases of the
                         carrier every microsecond. Wave-shaping or filtering is used to provide a
                         smooth variation of (t) between the clock ticks and so the bandwidth of
                         the modulated signal is constrained. High-order PSK modulation has more
                         discrete states, e.g. 8-PSK has eight discrete phase states.

                            There are several ways to implement PSK modulation and one uses the
                         quadrature modulator shown in Figure 2-15. The discrete baseband signal
                         (t) could be internal to a DSP which is then interpolated in time and output
                         by the DSP's DAC as two smooth signals i(t) = cos((t)) and q(t) = sin((t)).
                         On a phasor diagram i(t) and q(t) at the clock ticks addresses one of QPSK's
                         four states of the carrier's phasor, see Figure 2-14.

                            For PSK modulation the constellation diagram is very similar to a phasor

the modulated signal. This a subtle but important distinction, for example, a

PSK baseband signal has a constellation diagram even though the baseband

signal does not have a phasor representation. PSK modulation using the

block diagram shown in Figure 2-15 has a carrier that is directly input to the
top multiplier and a 90 phase-shifted version input to the bottom multiplier.
Let the carrier be cos(ct) and so the version of the carrier input to the bottom
multiplier is cos(ct - /2) = - sin(ct). So, with q(t) being a 90 phase-
shifted version of i(t), (using the identities in Section 1.A.2 of [4])

a(t)  =  cos((t)) cos(ct)  =   1  [cos(ct  -  (t))  +  cos(ct  +  (t))]        (2.47)
                               2                                               (2.48)
                                                                               (2.49)
b(t)  =  sin((t))[-  sin(ct)]  =  -  1  [cos(ct  -  (t))  -  cos(ct  +  (t))]
                                     2

s(t) = a(t) + b(t) = cos(ct + (t)).

Thus s(t) is the single-sideband modulated carrier carrying information in
the phase of the modulated carrier. The modulating signal (t) is driven by
a digital code that is designed so that (t) changes at a minimum rate (it
never has the same value for more than a few clock ticks). Thus there are
no low frequency components of (t) and thus there is no modulated signal
at or very close to the carrier. Thus the carrier is suppressed but there is a
sideband above and below the carrier frequency. This is SSB-SC modulation.

2.8.2 Binary Phase Shift Keying

PSK uses prescribed phase shifts to define symbols, each of which can
represent one, two, or more bits. Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK),
illustrated in Figures 2-12 and 2-13, has two phase states and conveys one bit
per symbol and is a relatively spectrally inefficient scheme, with a maximum
(i.e. ideal) modulation efficiency of 1 bits/s/Hz. The reason why the practical
modulation efficiency is less than this number is because the transition from
one phase state to the other must be constrained to avoid the modulated
signal becoming very small, and also because there are no ideal lowpass
filters to filter the input binary data stream. Although it has low modulation
efficiency, it is ideally suited to low-power applications. BPSK is commonly
used in Bluetooth.

   The operation of BPSK modulation can be described using the constella-
tion diagram shown in Figure 2-16(a). The BPSK constellation diagram in-
dicates that there are two states. These states can be interpreted as the rms
values of i(t) and q(t) at the sampling times corresponding to the bit rate. The
distance of a constellation point from the origin corresponds to (normalized)
rms power of the pseudo-sinusoid of the modulated carrier at the sampling
instant. (Normalization is with respect to the average power.) The curves
in Figure 2-16(b) indicate three transitions. The states are at the ends of the
transitions. If a 1, in Figure 2-16(b), is assigned to the positive I value and 0

                         "1001."

                            Figure 2-17(a) is the constellation diagram of BPSK, with two symbols
                         denoted as 0 and 1, and the trajectory of the transition from one constellation
                         point to the other depending on the hardware used to implement the BPSK
                         modulator. Figure 2-17(b) shows the transition from the `0' state to the `1'
                         state (and back) while maintaining a constant amplitude. If this transition is
                         very fast, then the waveform produced is as shown in Figure 2-17(c), where
                         there are abrupt phase transitions and these have high spectral content. It is
                         better to slow down the transitions, as then the waveform (shown in Figure
                         2-17(d)), has smooth transitions and the bandwidth of the modulated carrier
                         is minimal. The preferred smooth transition is obtained by lowpass filtering
                         the baseband signal. That is, the abrupt transitions in the modulated RF
                         signal result in the modulated signal having a broad bandwidth. The graceful
                         transition of BPSK modulation limits the bandwidth of the modulated
                         carrier.

                            A simple implementation of BPSK modulation would result in direct
                         transition from one state to the others causing the phasor to traverse the
                         origin and the amplitude of the RF signal to become very small and less than
                         the noise level (see Figure 2-17(e)). The resulting modulated RF waveform is

shown in Figure 2-17(f). This is a problem because the receiver would not be
able to track the RF signal.

Carrier Recovery

In a PSK demodulator, a local copy of the carrier must be produced to act as
a reference in determining the phase of the modulated signal. The technique
that produces the local copy of the unmodulated carrier is called carrier
recovery. The circuit that directly implements carrier recovery of a BPSK
signal is shown in Figure 2-18(a). At the clock ticks the waveform of a BPSK
modulated signal is

                  vBPSK(t) = A(t) cos (RFt + n) ,                (2.50)

where the carrier frequency fRF = RF/(2) and n can have a value of 0 or
1. Squaring this produces a signal

y(t) = vB2 PSK(t) = A2(t) cos2 (RFt + n) = 12 A2(t) [1 + cos (2RFt + n2)]

            = 12 A2(t) [1 + cos (2RFt)] .                        (2.51)

This is a signal at twice the carrier frequency with no carrier modulation
since n2 and 0 radians are indistinguishable. The squaring operation is
performed by mixing vBPSK(t) with itself. Bandpass filtering y(t) produces
a signal z(t) at the second harmonic of the carrier. The divide-by-2
block is implemented using a phase-locked loop (PLL). The result is the
recovered carrier, w(t), that is used as the timing reference for sampling the
demodulated I and Q components at precise times.

   A better carrier recovery circuit than that in Figure 2-18(a) and described
above is the Costas loop [14] shown in Figure 2-18(b). The BPSK Costas
loop implements carrier recovery and I/Q demodulation simultaneously. In
Figure 2-18(b) i(t) and q(t) are mixed to produce a signal applied at the input
of the third lowpass filter, LPF3. The main function of this filter is to remove
noise and to average the signal coming out of the phase detector. The output
of LPF3 drives a VCO in which the oscillation frequency is controlled by
the applied voltage. The quadrature phase shifter then mixes the recovered
carrier and a 90 shifted version with the BPSK signal.

   It is critical that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the ratio of the signal
power to the noise power, of the BPSK signal be sufficiently large at all times
or else the Costas loop will produce a noisy recovered carrier signal. If the
modulated carrier becomes very small, for example when the trajectory on
the constellation diagram goes through the origin (where the level of the
carrier carrier falls below the noise level), the carrier will not be accurately
recovered.

clock tick.

                 2.8.3 Quadra-Phase Shift Keying, QPSK

                 In QPSK wireless systems, modulation efficiency is obtained by sending
                 more than one bit of information per hertz of bandwidth (i.e., more than one
                 bit per symbol). In QPSK information is encoded in four phase states and
                 two bits are required to identify a symbol (i.e., to identify a phase state).
                 The constellation diagram of QPSK is shown in Figure 2-19(a) where the
                 modulated RF carrier has four phase states identified as A, B, C, and D. So a
                 QPSK modulator shifts the phase of the carrier to one of these phase states,
                 and a QPSK demodulator must determine the phase of the received RF
                 signal. The received RF signal is sampled with precise timing as determined
                 by the recovered carrier signal. Thus two bits of information are transmitted
                 per change of phase states. Each change of phase state requires at least 1 Hz
                 of bandwidth with the minimum bandwidth obtained when the transition
                 from one state to another is no faster than that required to reach the new
                 phase state before the sampling instant. QPSK modulation is also referred to
                 as quarternary PSK.

                    QPSK can be implemented using the modulator shown in Figure 2-20. In
                 Figure 2-20, the input bitstream is first converted into two parallel bitstreams
                 each containing half the number of bits of the original bit stream. Thus a two-
                 bit sequence in the serial bitstream becomes one IK bit and one QK bit. The
                 (IK , QK ) pair constitutes the Kth symbol. The bitstreams are converted into
                 waveforms i(t) and q(t) by the wave-shaping circuit.

                    The constellation diagram of QPSK is the result of plotting I and Q on a
                 rectangular graph as shown in Figure 2-19(a). All possible phase transitions
                 are shown in Figure 2-19(b). In the absence of wave-shaping circuits, i(t)
                 and q(t) have very sharp transitions, and the paths shown in Figure 2-16(b)
                 occur almost instantaneously. This leads to large spectral spreads in the
                 modulated waveform, s(t). So to limit the spectrum of the RF signal s(t),
                 the shape of i(t) and q(t) is controlled; the waveform is shaped, usually
                 by lowpass filtering. So a pulse-shaping circuit changes baseband binary
                 information into a more smoothly varying signal. Each transition or path
                 in Figure 2-16 represents the transfer of a symbol, with the best efficiency
                 that can be obtained in wireless communication being one symbol per hertz

of bandwidth. Each symbol contains two bits so the maximum modulation
efficiency of QPSK modulation is 2 bits/s/Hz of bandwidth. What is actually
achieved depends on the wave-shaping circuits and on the criteria used to
establish the bandwidth of s(t).

Carrier Recovery

Carrier recovery of a QPSK signal is similar to that for a BPSK signal. At the
clock ticks an RF QPSK modulated signal

vQPSK(t) = A(t) cos (RFt + n/2) ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3,                  (2.52)

where the carrier frequency fRF = RF/(2). The fourth power of this
produces

vQ4 PSK(t) = A4(t) cos4 (RFt + n/2)                                (2.53)
            = 18 A4(t) [3 + 4 cos (2RFt + n) + cos (4RFt + n2)] .

Following bandpass filtering at 4fRF and then dividing the frequency by
4, the carrier is recovered. Circuits implementing this are similar to those
for recovering the carrier of BPSK signals. This concept can be extended to
carrier recovery for any M -PSK-modulated signal.

EXAMPLE 2.7 QPSK Modulation and Constellation

The bit sequence 110101001100 is to be transmitted using QPSK modulation. Show
the transitions on a constellation diagram.

Solution:

The bit sequence 110101001100 must be converted to a two-bit-wide parallel
stream of symbols resulting in the sequence of symbols 11 01 01 00 11 00. The
symbol 11 transitions to the symbol 01 and then to the symbol 01 and so on. The
states (or symbols) and the transitions from one symbol to the next required to send
the bitstream 110101001100 are shown in Figure 2-21. QPSK modulation results in
the phasor of the carrier transitioning through the origin so that the average power
is lower and the PMEPR is high. A more significant problem is that the phasor will
fall below the noise floor, making carrier recovery almost impossible.

2.8.4 /4 Quadrature Phase Shift Keying

A major objective in digital modulation is to ensure that the RF trajectory
from one phase state to another does not go through the origin. The transition
is slow, so that if the trajectory goes through the origin, the amplitude of the
carrier will be below the noise floor for a considerable time and it will not
be possible to recover the carrier reference. This is why the QPSK scheme
is not used directly in 2G and 3G cellular radio. (The 4G and 5G cellular
radio systems do use QPSK among other modulation schemes and use pilot
tones to recover the carrier.) One of the solutions developed to address this
problem is the /4 quadrature phase shift keying (/4-QPSK) modulation
scheme. In this scheme the constellation at each symbol is rotated /4
radians from the previous symbol, as shown in Figure 2-22. (In an alternative
implementation of /4-QPSK modulation the constellation diagram could

the set of symbols 11 01 01 00 11 00 using QPSK. Note that symbols 2 and 3 are identical, so
there is no transition. The SYMBOL numbers indicated reference the symbol at the end of the
transition (end of the arrow). The assignment of bits to symbols (e.g., assigning the bits `11' to
the symbol in the first quadrant) is arbitrary in general but the assignment of symbols is defined
in a particular standard.

agram at one symbol; and (b) the constella-

tion diagram at the time of the next symbol.    (a)  (b)

    rotate by /4 continuously rather than switching between conditions as
    described here.)

       One of the unique characteristics of /4-QPSK modulation is that there is
    always a change, even if a symbol is repeated. This helps with recovering
    the carrier frequency. If the binary bitstream itself (with sharp transitions
    in time) is the modulation signal, then the transition from one symbol to
    the next occurs instantaneously and hence the modulated signal has a broad
    spectrum around the carrier frequency. The transition, however, is slower if
    the bitstream is filtered, and so the bandwidth of the modulated signal will
    be less. Ideally the transmission of one symbol per hertz would be obtained.
    However, in /4-QPSK modulation the change from one symbol to the next
    has a variable distance (and so a transition takes different times) so that
    the ideal modulation efficiency of one symbol per second per hertz (or 2

        radians, as shown in Figure 2-22. At one symbol (or time) the constellation diagram is that

        bitstream 110101001000 are shown in Figure 2-23.

2.8.5 Differential Quadra Phase Shift Keying, DQPSK

Multiple transmission paths, or multipaths, due to reflections result in
constructive and destructive interference and can result in rapid additional
phase rotations. Thus relying on the phase of a phasor at the symbol sample
time, at the clock ticks, to determine the symbol transmitted is prone to
error. When an error results at one symbol, this error accumulates when
subsequent symbols are extracted. The solution is to use encoding, and one of
the simplest encoding schemes is differential phase encoding. In this scheme
the information of the modulated signal is contained in changes in phase
rather than in the absolute phase. That is, the transition defines the symbol
rather than the end point of the transition.

   The /4-DQPSK modulation scheme is a differentially encoded form of

    /4-QPSK. The /4-DQPSK scheme incorporates the /4-QPSK modulator
    and an encoding scheme, as shown in Figure 2-24(a). The scheme is defined
    with respect to its constellation diagram, shown in Figure 2-24(b) and
    repeated in Figure 2-24(c) for clarity. The D indicates differential coding,
    while the /4 denotes the rotation of the constellation by /4 radians from
    one interval to the next. This can be explained by considering Figure 2-24(a).
    A four-bit stream is divided into two quadrature nibbles of two bits each.
    These nibbles independently control the I and Q encoding, respectively,
    so that the allowable transitions rotate according to the last transition. The
    information or data is in the phase transitions rather than the constellation
    points themselves. The relationship between the symbol value and the
    transition is given in Figure 2-24(d). For example, the transitions shown in
    Figure 2-25 for six successive time intervals describes the input bit sequence
    000110110101. Its waveform and spectrum are shown in Figure 2-26. More
    detail of the spectrum is shown in Figure 2-27. In practice with realistic filters
    and allowing for the longer transitions, /4-DQPSK modulation achieves
    a modulation efficiency of 1.62 bits/s/Hz, the same as /4-QPSK, but of
    course with greater resilience to changes in the transmission path.

       In a differential scheme, the data transmitted are determined by

comparing a symbol with the previously received symbol, so the data are
determined from the change in phase of the carrier rather than the actual
phase of the carrier. This process of inferring the data actually sent from
the received symbols is called decoding. When /4-DQPSK encoding was
introduced in the early 1990s the DSP available for a mobile handset had
only just reached sufficient complexity. Today, encoding is used with all
digital radio systems and is more sophisticated than just the differential
scheme of DQPSK. There are new ways to handle carrier phase ambiguity.
The sophistication of modern coding schemes is beyond the scope of the
hardware-centric theme of this book.

2.8.6 Offset Quadra Phase Shift Keying, OQPSK

The offset quadra phase shift keying (OQPSK) modulation scheme avoids
transitions passing through the origin on the constellation diagram (see
Figure 2-29(a)). As in all QPSK schemes, there are two bits per symbol, but
now one bit is used to immediately modulate the RF signal, whereas the
other bit is delayed by half a symbol period, as shown in Figure 2-28. The
maximum phase change for a bit transition is 90, and as QK is delayed, a
total phase change of approximately 180 is possible during one symbol. The

    constellation diagram is shown in Figure 2-29(a).
       The OQPSK modulator can be implemented using relatively simple

    electronics with a digital delay circuit delaying the Q bit by half a symbol
    period and lowpass filters shaping the I and Q bits. The OQPSK scheme
    is also called staggered quadrature phase shift Keying (SQPSK). Better
    performance can be obtained by using DSP to shape the I and Q transitions
    so that they change smoothly and the phasor trajectory nearly follows a
    circle. Consequently I and Q change together, but in such a manner that
    the PMEPR is maintained close to 0 dB. Two modulation techniques that
    implement this are the shaped offset QPSK (SOQPSK) and the Feher QPSK
    (FQPSK) schemes. The constellation diagrams for SOQPSK and FQPSK are
    shown in Figure 2-29(d). These are constant envelope digital modulation
    schemes. As with OQPSK, the Q bit is delayed by one-half of a symbol
    period and the I and Q baseband signals are shaped by a half-sine filter.
    The advantage is that high-efficiency saturating amplifier designs can be
    used and battery life extended. There is a similar modulation format called
    shaped binary phase shift keying (SBPSK) which, as expected, has two
    constellation points as shown in Figure 2-29(e). SOQPSK, FQPSK, and
    SBPSK are continuous phase modulation (CPM) schemes, as the phase

never changes abruptly. Instead, the phase changes smoothly, achieving high
modulation efficiency and maintaining a constant envelope. Implementation
of the receiver, however, is complex. CPM schemes have good immunity to
interference and are commonly used in military systems.

        Solution:

        The bit sequence is first separated into the parallel stream 01-00-10-10-01-10. The
        I bit changes first, followed by the Q bit delayed by half of the time of a bit. Five
        constellation diagrams are shown in Figure 2-30 with the transitions sending the bit
        sequence.

2.8.7 3/8-8PSK, Rotating Eight-State Phase Shift Keying

The 3/8-8PSK modulation scheme is similar to /4-DQPSK in the sense
that rotation of the constellation occurs from one time interval to the next.
This time, however, the rotation of the constellation from one symbol to the
next is 3/8. This modulation scheme is used in the enhanced data rates for
GSM evolution (EDGE) system, and provides three bits per symbol (ideally)
compared to GMSK used in GSM which has two bits per symbol (ideally).
With some other changes, GSM/EDGE provides data transmission of up to
128 kbits/s, faster than the 48 kbits/s possible with GSM.

   Quadrature modulation schemes with four states, such as QPSK, have two
I states and two Q states that can be established by lowpass filtering the
I and Q bitstreams. For higher-order modulation schemes such as 8-PSK,
this approach will not work. Instead, i(t) and q(t) are established in the DSP
unit and then converted using a DAC to generate the analog signals applied

    directly in the DSP and a DAC converts this to an IF and a hardware mixer
    up-converts this to RF. QAM

    2.8.8 Summary

    PSK modulation is implemented in many radio standards including all
    cellular standards after 2G. There was a 2G system that used /4DQPSK
    but that is no longer supported. The modern radio standards support many
    modulation formats but in high interference situations BPSK, QPSK and 8-
    PSK have the best performance. While QPSK was dismissed in 2G and 3G
    because of difficulties with carrier recovery, 4G and 5G have another method
    for implementing carrier recovery which allows QPSK on its own to be used.
    GMSK is still supported by modern cellular phones but the infrastructure,
    i.e. basestations, are starting to be retired.

       Most of the modulation schemes described in this section were introduced
    as optimum trade-offs of modulation efficiency, resistance to interference,
    and hardware complexity. Some, such as BPSK, draw very little power and
    are suited to the internet-of-things (IoT) applications which must have a
    battery lifetime of ten years.

    2.9 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation

    The digital modulation schemes described so far modulate the phase or
    frequency of a carrier to convey digital data and the constellation points
    lie on a circle of constant amplitude. The effect of this is to provide
    some immunity to amplitude changes to the signal. However, much more
    information can be transmitted if the amplitude is varied as well as the
    phase. With considerable signal processing it is possible to reliably use
    quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) in which amplitude and phase are
    both changed.

       A 16-state rectangular QAM, 16-QAM, constellation is shown in Figure
    2-29(c). Since there are 16 (= 24) symbols the values of 4 binary bits are
    uniquely specified by each symbol. In Figure 2-29(c) a gray-scale assignment
    of 4 bit values is shown. Several QAM schemes are shown in Figure 2-31.
    These constellations can be produced by separately amplitude modulating
    an I carrier and a Q carrier. Both carriers have the same frequency but are 90
    out of phase. The two carriers are then combined so that the fixed carrier is
    suppressed. The most common form of QAM is square QAM, or rectangular
    QAM with an equal number of I and Q states. The most common forms are

                                                   time durations. Since the symbol interval is
                                                   fixed, it is the longest path that determines
                                                   the bandwidth required.

16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 128-QAM, in 4G, and 256-QAM additionally in 5G.
The constellation points are closer together with high-order QAM and so are
more susceptible to noise and other interference. Thus high-order QAM can
deliver more data, but less reliably than lower-order QAM.

   The constellation in QAM can be constructed in many ways, and while
rectangular QAM is the most common form, non rectangular schemes exist;
for example, having two PSK schemes at two different amplitude levels.
While there are sometimes minor advantages to such schemes, square QAM
is generally preferred as it requires simpler modulation and demodulation.

   One possible architecture of a QAM modulator is shown in Figure 2-32 and
this can only be implemented in DSP since it is not sufficient to use analog
lowpass filtering to implement the wave-shaping function as the i(t) and q(t)
must be precisely the real and imaginary parts of the symbol at each clock
tick.

2.10 Digital Modulation Summary

The modulation efficiencies of various digital modulation schemes are
summarized in Table 2-2. For example, in 1 kHz of bandwidth the 3/8-8PSK
scheme (supported in 3G cellular radio) transmits 2700 bits.

   beta.69: It is critical to control interference in digital radio so that the error
66                      STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

                        in digital transmission is no more than one bit per symbol. Error correction
                        can then be used to provide error-free digital communications.

                           The modulation efficiency of an actual modulation method is less than the
                        ideal (see Table 2-2). With digital modulation wave-shaping at baseband is
                        required to constrain the spectrum of the RF-modulated signal. Thus it will
                        take different times for the phasor to make the transition from one symbol
                        to another; to achieve longer transitions in the same time interval requires
                        more bandwidth than that required for shorter transitions. As a result, the
                        modulation efficiency of modulation methods other than binary methods
                        will be less than the ideal. So in a QPSK-like scheme, 2 bits per symbol are
                        achievable, but the longest transition takes the most time, so the bandwidth
                        needs to be increased so that the transition is completed in time (i.e., in a fixed
                        time equal to one over the bandwidth). Various modulation methods have
                        relative merits in terms of modulation efficiency, tolerance to fading (due
                        to destructive interference), carrier recovery, spectral spreading in nonlinear
                        circuitry, and many other issues that are the purview of communication
                        system theorists.

scheme [16].            reduced by increasing the signal level at the transmitter thus increasing the
                        signal-to-interference ratio. This comes with a price as increasing the signal
                        level results in higher levels of interference for other radios. The solution
                        arrived at is to ensure that if there is an error, then the incorrectly detected
                        symbol is no more than one symbol away from the actual symbol. This means
                        that there is at most one bit in error while a symbol can carry multiple bits of
                        information. Error correction coding can then be used to eliminate errors.

                           In QAM, symbols are assigned to constellation points using a Gray code
                        in which nearest neighbor symbols change by only one bit [17], e.g. see
                        Figure 2-29(c). Thus there is only one bit out of many that will be in error
                        if there is noise and interference. If the error is greater then a lower-order
                        of modulation is used so that if a symbol is incorrectly detected then the
                        incorrect symbol is at most one symbol away from the actual transmitted
                        symbol.

                        2.11.1 Cochannel Interference

                        The minimum signal detectable in conventional wireless systems is
                        determined by the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at the input to a
                        receiver, where interference refers to noise as well as interference from other
                        radios. In cellular wireless systems the dominant interference is from other
                        radios and is called cochannel interference. The degree to which cochannel
                        interference can be controlled has a large effect on system capacity. Control
                        of cochannel interference is largely achieved by controlling the power levels

2.11.2 Adjacent Channel Interference

Adjacent channel interference results from several factors. Since filtering is
non ideal, there is inherent overlap of neighboring channels (Figure 2-33). For
this reason, adjacent channels are assigned to different cells. The nonlinear
behavior of transmitters also contributes to adjacent channel interference.
Thus characterization of nonlinear phenomena is important in RF design.
The spectrum of a signal modulated using a QPSK scheme is shown in
Figure 2-34. The signal between frequencies f1 and f2 is due to the digital
modulation scheme itself. Most of the signal outside this region is due
to nonlinear effects and is called spectral regrowth, a process similar to
distortion of a two-tone signal. Using the frequency limits defined in Figure
2-34, the lower channel ACPR is defined as

ACPRADJ,LOWER = Power in lower adjacent channel =        ff 43 X(f )df
                                  Power in main channel  f2 , (2.54)
                                                         f1 X(f )df

where X(f ) is the spectral power density of the RF signal. Upper channel
ACPR, ACPRADJ,UPPER, is similarly defined. When ACPR is being referred
to without indicating whether it is upper or lower ACPR, the larger (i.e., the
worse) of ACPRADJ,LOWER and ACPRADJ,UPPER is used. ACPR is usually
expressed in decibels, and while the definition is such that ACPR will be less
than one, when expressed in decibels, a positive number is often used (e.g.,
20 dB for an ACPR of 0.01 rather than the correct -20 dB, so be careful).

    Noise and nonlinear distortion affect the ability to correctly demodulate
    signals and determine the transmitted symbols. These distortion effects can
    be described by their effect on the received constellation diagram, see Figure
    2-35, which shows the state of the system at the sampling instant determined
    by the recovered carrier.

       Figure 2-35(a) shows the effect of amplitude distortion errors on the
    demodulated signal. Sampling of the received signal will be a distorted
    constellation point that does not correspond to the ideal constellation point.
    A decision must be made by the DSP unit as to which ideal constellation
    point corresponds to the distorted constellation point. The effect of phase
    distortion is shown in Figure 2-35(b). Both amplitude and phase distortion
    could occur in the transmitter or receiver, or be the result of effects in the
    signal path. Figure 2-35(c) shows the effect of noise on signal impairment.
    Again the constellation point extracted from the RF signal is affected by noise
    and the sampled and ideal constellation points do not coincide. Associating
    the constellation point extracted from sampling the received RF waveform
    with the wrong constellation point creates a symbol error and thus a bit error.
    Errors in recovering the carrier further distort the constellation diagram. All
    mobile digital radio systems adjust the level of the transmitted RF signal, and
    additionally in 4G and 5G cellular radio change the order of modulation, so
    an acceptable BER is obtained. Using more power than necessary reduces
    battery life and causes additional interference in other radios.

    2.11.4 Comparison of GMSK and /4DQPSK Modulation

    This section presents the results of the type of analysis that is performed
    to characterize modulation methods. There is a large body of literature
    documenting the performance of modulation schemes and is usually the
    result of an assumed error model, that is the type of interference and the
    statistical description of that interference, and then numerical simulations.
    This section compares GMSK and /4DQPSK modulation methods, the first
    widely-used cellular digital modulation methods.

       The constellations of 4-state GMSK, see Figure 2-11(b), and /4DQPSK,
    see Figure 2-19 are the same except that with /4 DQPSK the constellation
    rotates every closk tick. In GMSK the amplitude of the modulated carrier
    remains almost constant and the frequency of the carrier varies slowly.
    With GMSK the symbols correspond to different RF frequencies so it is not
    possible for symbols with frequencies at opposite ends of the frequency
    range to transition directly without traversing the other symbol points. This
    long transition results in reduction of GMSK's modulation efficiency. With

frequency deviation from the carrier; and (b) BER versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as Eb/No
(or energy per bit divided by noise per bit).

/4DQPSK there are direct transitions and the magnitude of the RF phasor
does not stay constant. So while higher modulation efficiency is obtained
compared to GMSK, /4-DQPSK has a significantly time-varying envelope.

   The modulation format used impacts the choice of circuitry, battery life,
and the tolerance of the system to noise. Figure 2-36 contrasts the power
density versus frequency and bit error rate (BER) of four-state GMSK and
QPSK modulation. In Figure 2-36(a), fc is the carrier frequency and fb is the
bit frequency, and it is seen that GMSK and QPSK have different spectral
shapes. Most of the energy is contained within the bandwidth defined by half
the bit frequency (this is the symbol frequency since there are two bits per
symbol). At multiples of the bit frequency, the power density with GMSK is
much lower than with QPSK, resulting in less interference (adjacent channel
interference [ACI]) with radios in adjacent channels. This is an important
metric with radios that is captured by the adjacent channel power ratio
(ACPR), the ratio of the power in the adjacent channel to the power in the
main channel. Another important metric is the BER which is increased by
noise in the main channel with different modulation formats differing in
their susceptibility to interference. The level of noise is captured by the ratio
of the power in a bit, Eb, to the noise power, No, in the time interval of a bit.
This ratio, Eb/No (read as E B N O), is directly related to the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR). In particular, consider the plot of the BER against Eb/No shown
in Figure 2-36(b), where it can be seen that /4DQPSK is less susceptible to
noise than GMSK.

2.11.5 Error Vector Magnitude

The error vector magnitude (EVM) metric characterizes the accuracy of the
waveform at the sampling instances and so is directly related to the BER in
digital radio. EVM captures the combined effect of amplifier nonlinearities,
amplitude and phase imbalances of separate I and Q signal paths, in-band
amplitude ripple (e.g., due to filters), noise, non ideal mixing, non ideal
carrier recovery, and DAC inaccuracies.

   The EVM is a measure of the departure of a sampled phasor from the ideal

         phasor located at the constellation point (see Figure 2-37(a)). Introducing an
         error vector, Xerror, and a reference vector, Xreference, that points to the ideal
         constellation point, the EVM is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the
         error vector to the reference vector so that

                       EVM = |Xerror| .                                           (2.55)
                                  |Xreference|

         Expressing the error and reference in terms of the powers Perror and Preference,
         respectively, enables EVM to be expressed as

                       EVM =       Perror ,                                       (2.56)

         in decibels,  EVMdB = 10 log Perror = 20 log |Xerror| ; (2.57)
                                 Preference                         |Xreference|

         or as a percentage, EVM(%) = Xerror · 100%.                              (2.58)

         If the modulation format results in constellation points having different
         powers (e.g., with 16-QAM), the constellation point with the highest power
         is used as the reference and the error at each constellation point is averaged.
         With reference to Figure 2-37, and with N constellation points,

                       EVM =  1  N       (Ii2  +  Q2i )          ,                (2.59)

         where |Xmax| is the magnitude of the reference vector to the most distant

MODULATION                                                                                         71

constellation point and the ideal constellation point. Note that for QAM
the constellation diagram corresponds to a phasor diagram that is being
continuously normalized to the average received RF signal level. In the
constellation diagram the I and Q coordinates correspond to RMS quantities.
Thus |Xmax| is an RMS quantity. EVM is traditionally expressed as a
percentage.

   A similar measure of signal quality is the modulation error ratio (MER), a
measure of the average signal power to the average error power. In decibels
it is defined as

              1 N I2 + Q2                             N I2 + Q2
              N i=1 i           i                     i=1 i     i
MER|dB = 10 log 1 N                2 = 10 log N                    2.  (2.60)
              N i=1 (Ii + Qi )2                       i=1 (Ii + Qi )2

The advantage of the MER is that it relates directly to the SNR.
   Another quantity related to both the EVM and MER concepts is the imple-

mentation margin, k.. The implementation margin is a measure of the perfor-
mance of particular hardware and is developed by design groups based on
experience with similar designs. The required EVM can be estimated from
the hardware implementation margin:

              EVMrequired =             k.                             (2.61)
                                SNR · PMEPR                            (2.62)

In decibels,  EVMdb, required = kdB - SNRdB - PMEPRdB.

EXAMPLE 2.10 Modulation Error Ratio

A 16-QAM modulated signal has a maximum RF phasor rms value of 4 V. If the noise on the
signal has an rms value of 0.1 V, what is the modulation error ratio of the modulated signal?

Solution:

                                     The distance from the origin to each of the constellation
                                     points must be determined, but because of symmetry only the
                                     distances x3, x4, x7(= x6) and x8 need to be calculated. The
                                     maximum RF phasor amplitude is 4 V, so the length x4 = 4,
                                     with components
                                     I4 = Q4 = x24/2 = 2.828
                                     I6 = - 31 · I4 = -0.943 = -Q6, so x6 = 1.333
                                     I3 = 0.943; Q3 = 2.828, so x3 = 2.981 = x8

              16        2
              i=1 xi
and           MER = 16 2 .
              i=1 (xnoise)

The calculation is simplified by considering just one quadrant and the noise, xnoise = 0.1, is

the same for each constellation point.

                        4 x3 + x4 + x6 + x82222

              MER =             16 · xnoise2

                     =  4 2.9812 + 42 + 1.3332 + 2.9812 142.2
                                                             =         = 888.8.
                                           16 · 0.12            0.16

              MER|dB = 10 log(888.8) = 29.5 dB
72  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    Compare this to the SNR calculated at the individual constellation points:
    Point 3, SNR = x23/0.12 = 888.6 = 29.5 dB
    Point 4, SNR = x24/0.12 = 1600 = 32.0 dB
    Point 7, SNR = x27/0.12 = 177.7 = 22.5 dB.

               2.12 Summary

                  All modern modulation methods impress information on a sinusoidal carrier
                  that is at a high enough frequency that it can be easily transmitted. There
                  are many modulation techniques with the choice of which to use based on
                  the technology available to implement the modulation scheme, the tolerance
                  of the modulation scheme to interference, how efficiently the modulation
                  scheme uses the EM spectrum, and the amount of DC power consumed.
                  In military communications it is also important that a modulation scheme
                  produce a noise-like signal that is difficult to detect and intercept.

                     The first widely adopted modulation schemes produced simple pulses
                  as used in wireless telegraphy. The tolerance to interference was achieved
                  through the relatively slow transmission of bits, and hence redundancy.
                  More information was transmitted when amplitude modulation was
                  introduced to superimpose voice on a carrier. With this scheme, interference
                  was always a problem, and once interference appeared on a signal it could
                  not be removed nor suppressed. The first significant advance in modulation
                  techniques was the invention of frequency modulation. In this scheme
                  a narrowband analog modulating signal (e.g. voice) became a relatively
                  wideband frequency-modulated RF signal. When the modulated signal
                  was received and demodulated, the wide bandwidth of the modulated
                  signal was collapsed to the original relatively narrowband modulating
                  signal. The demodulation process combined correlated components of the
                  modulated signal and the uncorrelated components, noise and interference,
                  were suppressed.

                     The introduction of digital modulation was a significant advance in the
                  suppression of interference. Digital information was now being transmitted,
                  and errors in the data caused by interference and noise would be completely
                  unacceptable. The solution was to embed error-correcting codes in the data
                  so that if a manageable number of bits were lost in the transmitted signal,
                  the original data could still be fully recovered. As a result, digital radio
                  (using digital modulation) could be used in situations with even more
                  distortion than was acceptable in analog radio (using analog modulation). If
                  interference is low, then today's wireless systems use high-order modulation
                  switching to lower-order (and less spectrally efficient) modulation when
                  necessary to cope with higher interference.

                     Several important metrics are used to provide a measure of the signal
                  characteristics. The crest factor, peak-to-average ratio, and peak-to-mean
                  envelope power ratio (PMEPR) are all indicators of how much care must be
                  given to nonlinear circuit design, especially to amplifier and mixer design.
                  Amplifiers must operate so that the peak signal is amplified with minimal
                  distortion. It is the peak signal that determines the DC power drawn by
                  an amplifier. However, the average RF output power of an RF front end is
                  determined by the mean of the envelope. So a high PMEPR signal will result
                  in lower amplifier efficiency.
MODULATION                                                                                    73

   Many of the techniques described in this chapter for modulating
and demodulating RF signals were presented as circuit techniques.
However many modern phones support multiple standards and hardware
implementation would require multiple copies of similar versions of analog
circuits. Today it is more cost effective to perform most of the operations
in a DSP unit. Most of the time the DSP realization is close to the
hardware implementation. An example is carrier recovery. For narrow-band
communication signals in wireless communicators, carrier recovery can be
performed using a digital implementation of the concepts described for
the hardware carrier recovery circuits. While it is more power efficient to
implement many of the techniques in hardware, the need to support multiple
standards has necessitated the software reconfigurability available with a
DSP unit. Which approach is used is the decision of the RF system designer--
an experienced engineer with a rich background in wireless technologies. It
is therefore important that the aspiring and practicing RF engineer have a
broad perspective of RF circuits and of communications theory. Hence the
emphasis of this book on a systems approach to RF and microwave design.

   Frequency modulation, and the similar PM modulation method were used
in the 1G analog cellular radio. With the addition of AM, the three schemes
are the bases of all analog radio. Digital cellular radio began with 2G and
there were two types of 2G cellular radios with the GSM system using GMSK
modulation, a type of FSK modulation, and the NADC system using /4-
DQPSK modulation. The two 2G systems were incompatible. The 3G cellular
radio used two types of QPSK modulation, one for the up-link from handset
to basestation, and one from the basestation to a handset. The 1G-3G systems
implemented most of the modulation and demodulation functions in analog
hardware. With 4G and 5G cellular radio a large number of modulation
schemes are supported choosing as high an order of modulation as allowed
by the channel conditions. Most of the modulation and demodulation in 4G
and 5G are implemented in DSP with just the translation to and from the
radio frequency signal implemented in analog hardware.

3.1 Introduction

An essential function of a radio transmitter is modulation which is
implemented by a modulator which converts the information at baseband
to a finite bandwidth modulated radio signal centered at or near the carrier
frequency. At the block level a modulator is described by its architecture and
at a lower level by its circuit implementation. In a receiver a demodulator
demodulates the radio signal extracting the baseband information.

   The architectures of transmitters and receivers have changed significantly
since the first radio signals were transmitted. Largely this is the result of
increased integration of hardware but also due to advances in modulation
concepts. In modern radios, as used with 4G and 5G cellular radio, many of
the modulation functions once only implemented with analog hardware are
now implemented digitally in a digital signal processing (DSP) unit. Only
the final translation to the frequency of the radio signal is implemented in
analog hardware. This concept is known as software-defined radio (SDR)
which also has the additional implication that the analog hardware can
be reconfigured under software control. SDR has two significant impacts.

The "90" blocks shift the phase of the signal by
+90. The mixer indicated by the circle with a cross
is an ideal multiplier, e.g. a1(t) = m(t) · c1(t).

                         One is that it is feasible to support a large number of modulation schemes
                         including legacy modulation schemes, without any changes to the analog
                         hardware. The second is that by simplifying the functionality of the analog
                         hardware it is possible to optimize analog hardware for maximum efficiency.
                         Demodulation has also been significantly impacted by SDR with a similar
                         transfer of functions from analog to digital hardware.

                            In some designs a receiver and a transmitter share components and
                         then the RF front end is called a transceiver. This chapter is concerned
                         with the architectures of receivers, transmitters, and transceivers. Design
                         choices are made to maximize the tolerance to interference, manage
                         hardware complexity, optimize power efficiency, and enable various radios
                         to simultaneously operate together.

                            The presentation in this chapter closely follows the historical development
                         of transmitters and receivers. As well, modulators and demodulators at
                         different stages of evolution are considered together.

                            Section 3.2 introduces single-sideband and double-sideband modulation.
                         Then early modulator and demodulator technology is considered in Section
                         3.3. These were circuits that could be implemented with just a few vacuum
                         tubes or transistors and, in one case, a demodulator could be implemented
                         with a single diode. With increasing circuit sophistication an architectural
                         approach to modulator and demodulator design became possible. These
                         are considered in Section 3.4. Demodulation requires local generation of a
                         radio signal's carrier in a process called carrier recovery. This is discussed
                         in Section 3.5. Following this is a discussion of more modern transmitters
                         and receivers as used in 2G and 3G cellular radio in Sections 3.6 and 3.7
                         respectively. Current radios, e.g. 4G and 5G, are software defined radios
                         (SDRs) where most of the modulation and demodulation is implemented
                         in DSP and there is considerable software-based adaptation of the analog
                         hardware that now undertakes the task of translating between and low
                         intermediate frequency and the frequency of the radio signal. Sections 3.8-
                         3.13 present the many aspects of SDR transmitters and receivers.

                     3.2 Single-Sideband and Double-Sideband Modulation

                         The simplest implementation of analog modulation results in a modulated
                         carrier signal whose spectrum consists of the carrier and upper and lower
                         sidebands. It is possible to eliminate one of the sidebands in AM modulation,
                         or one of the sidebands sets in PM and FM modulation, producing single
                         sideband modulation SSB. This however needs to be implemented in DSP. At
                         the same time the carrier can be suppressed resulting in suppressed-carrier
                         modulation or together SSB-SC modulation.

                            The simplest system that implements SSC-SC modulation is the Hartley
                         modulator [1, 2], shown in Figure 3-1. This circuit results in single-

sideband (SSB) modulation or more precisely single-sideband modulation

suppressed-carrier (SSB-SC) modulation. This circuit is used in all modern

radios taking a modulated signal which is centered at an intermediate
frequency and shifting it up in frequency so that its is centered at another

frequency a little below or a little above the carrier of the Hartley modulator.
   Both the modulating signal m(t)and the carrier are multiplied together

in a mixer and then also 90 phase-shifted versions are also mixed before
being added together. The signal flow is as follows beginning with m(t) =
cos(m1t), p(t) = cos(m1t - /2) = sin(m1t) and carrier signal c1(t) =
cos(ct):

a1(t) = cos(m1t) cos(ct) = 21 [cos((c - m1)t) + cos((c + m1)t)]

b1(t) = sin(m1t) sin(ct) = 12 [cos((c - m1)t) - cos((c + m1)t)]

s1(t) = a1(t) + b1(t) = cos((c - m1)t)                           (3.1)

and so the lower sideband (USB) is selected.
   That is, if a finite bandwidth modulating signal m(t) was mixed only once

with the carrier c1(t), the spectrum of the output a1(t) would include upper
and lower sidebands as well as the carrier as shown in Figure 3-2(a). With
the Hartley modulator the spectrum of Figure 3-2(b) is obtained.

   In digital modulation both the upper and lower sideband are retained but
the carrier is suppressed. Both sidebands are required to recover the signal
but the spectrum is used efficiently as the modulating signal is complex
with two components, think of real/imaginary parts, or amplitude/phase
information. Since a DSP unit is required the resulting modulated signal
must be at a relatively low frequency and then a second frequency
conversion stage is required to shift the modulated signal to the desired
operating frequency, see Figure 3-3. This second stage is a SSB-SC modulator,
however since the input to the second stage is a DSB-SC signal, the final RF
signal is a DSB-SC signal.

   All the concepts introduced in this section are still used in modern radios,
just that now they are mostly implemented in a DSP unit rather than in
analog hardware.

    3.3 Early Modulation and Demodulation Technology

    Early modulators and demodulators are considered here in part because the
    terms associated with the historical transmitters and receivers are still used
    today, but also because the early trade-offs influenced the architectures used
    today. Today transmitters and receivers use DSP technology, very stable LOs,
    and sophisticated clock recovery schemes. This was not always so. One of the
    early problems was demodulating a signal when the frequency of transmitter
    oscillators, i.e. carriers, drifted by up to 10%. Radio at first used AM and
    the carrier was sent with the information-carrying sidebands. With this
    signal, a simple single-diode rectifier circuit connected to a bandpass filter
    could be used, but the reception was poor. To improve performance it was
    necessary to lock an oscillator in the receiver to the carrier and then amplify
    the received signal. Here some of the early schemes that addressed these
    problems are discussed. There were many more variants, but the discussion
    covers the essential ideas.

    3.3.1 Heterodyne Receiver

    The heterodyning principle mixes a single-tone signal, the LO, with a finite
    bandwidth signal to produce a lower-frequency version of the information-
    bearing signal. With the LO frequency set appropriately, the low-frequency
    signal would be in the audio range. If the information-bearing signal is
    an AM signal, then the low-frequency version of the signal is the original
    audio signal, which is the envelope of the AM signal. This type of receiver is
    called a tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver, and performance is critically
    dependent on the stability of the LO and the selectivity of the receive filter.
    The TRF receiver required the user to adjust a tunable capacitor so that,
    with a fixed inductor, a tunable bandpass filter was created. Such a filter
    has a limited Q and a bandwidth that is wider than the bandwidth of the
    radio channel.1 Even worse, a user had to adjust both the frequency of the
    bandpass filter and the frequency of the LO. The initial radios based on this
    principle were called audions, used a triode vacuum tube as an amplifier,
    and were used beginning in 1906. They were an improvement on the crystal
    detectors (which used a single diode with filters), but there was a need for
    something better.

    3.3.2 Homodyne Receiver

    The homodyne [3], syncrodyne (for synchronous heterodyne) [4], and
    autodyne (for automatic heterodyne) circuits were needed improvements
    on the audion and are based on the regenerative circuit invented by Edwin
    Armstrong in 1912 while he was an electrical engineering student at New
    York City's Columbia University [5]. Armstrong's circuit fed the input signal
    into an amplifying circuit and a portion of this signal was coupled back
    into the input circuit so that the signal was amplified over and over again.
    This is a positive feedback amplifier. A small input RF signal was amplified
    to such a large extent that it resulted in the amplifying circuit becoming
    nonlinear and consequently it rectified the amplitude modulated RF signal.

    1 Q is the quality factor and is the ratio of the energy stored to the energy resistively lost in each
      cycle. Good frequency selectively in a filter requires high-Q components.

                                             and (b) triode vacuum tube.

Colebrook used this principle and developed the original homodyne receiver
shown in Figure 3-4(a). This serves to illustrate the operation of the family
of regenerative receivers. The antenna shown on the left-hand side is part
of a resonant circuit that is in the feedback path of a triode oscillator. The
triode vacuum tube is shown in Figure 3-4(b). Here the grid coils (which
control the flow of carriers between the bottom cathode2 and top anode) are
weakly coupled to the anode circuit. When an AC signal appears at the top
anode, the part within the passband of the tuned circuit is fed back to the grid
and the signal is reinforced. The radio signals of the day were AM and had
a relatively large carrier, so the oscillator locked on to the carrier. The AM
sidebands were then successfully heterodyned down to the desired audio
frequencies.

   The autodyne worked on a slightly different principle in that the
oscillation frequency was tuned to a slightly different frequency from the
carrier. Still, the autodyne combined the functions of an oscillator and
detector in the same circuit.

3.3.3 FM Modulator

FM modulation can be implemented using a voltage-controlled oscillator
(VCO) with the baseband signal controlling the frequency of an oscillator. A
VCO can be very simple circuit and so was easily implemented in early radio.
The circuits in Figure 3-5 are known as common source Hartley VCOs, where
in Figure 3-5(a) the controllable elements are the nonlinear capacitors. These
are generally implemented as reverse-biased diodes, as shown in Figure 3-
5(b) where the bias, VB, changes the capacitance of the reverse-biased diodes.
Changing the capacitance changes the resonant frequency of the feedback
loop formed by the inductors and the diode capacitances (called varactors).

2 The cathode is heated (the heater circuit is not shown) and electrons are spontaneously emitted
  in a process called thermionic emission.
82  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    3.3.4 FM Demodulator

    An FM demodulator is often implemented using a phase-locked loop with
    an error signal used to control the frequency of a voltage-controlled oscillator
    (VCO) with the loop arranged so that the VCO tracks the received signal. The
    desired baseband signal, i.e. the demodulated FM signal, being the loop's
    error signal.

    3.3.5 Superheterodyne Receiver

    The superheterodyne receiver was invented by Edwin Armstrong in 1918 [6].
    The key concept was to heterodyne down in two stages, use fixed filters,
    and use a tunable LO. The receiving antenna was connected to a bandpass
    filter that allowed several channels to pass. This relaxed the demands on the
    receive filter, but also filters with higher selectivity could be constructed if
    they did not need to be tuned. The filtered received signal is then mixed with
    an offset LO to produce what is called a supersonic signal--a signal above
    the audio range--and hence the name of this architecture. The performance
    of the superheterodyne (or superhet) receive architecture has only recently
    been achieved at cellular frequencies using direct conversion architectures.

    3.3.6 Summary

    Early radio used AM and FM modulation and both modulation and
    demodulation could be performed with very simple circuits. However they
    used a lot of spectrum for the information that was transmitted.

    3.4 Receiver and Transmitter Architectures

    The essential function of a radio transmitter architecture is taking
    low-frequency information, the baseband signal, and transferring that
    information to much higher frequencies by superimposing the baseband
    signal on a high-frequency carrier, i.e a sinewave. This could be done by
    slowly varying the amplitude, frequency, and/or phase of the carrier in what
    is called modulating the carrier to produce a modulated carrier (signal). A
    caveat here is that there are other less common ways of transferring the
    baseband information such as rapidly changing the frequency of the carrier
    at a faster rate than the maximum frequency of the baseband signal in a
    scheme called frequency hoping. Frequency hoping is particularly useful
    when operating in hostile situations, such as military communications,
    when the interference environment cannot be controlled. In reality there
    is a very large number of ways of producing a radio signal that carries
    the baseband information. The central theme of this book is to focusing
    on modulation schemes that slowly modulate characteristics of a carrier
    signal and other schemes are introduced as an exception. This section
    describes early architectural developments that led to the development of
    the regulations that still guide modern architectures; concepts that efficiently
    pack as much information as possible into a fixed RF bandwidth.

3.4.1 Radio as a Cascade of Two-Ports

The front end of an RF communication receiver or transmitter combines a
number of subsystems in cascade. The design of the RF front end requires
trade-offs of noise generated by the circuit, of frequency selectivity, and
of power efficiency, which translates into battery life for a communication
handset. There are only a few receiver and transmitter architectures that
achieve the optimum trade-offs. The essentials of these architectures are
shown in Figure 3-6. These architectures achieve frequency selectivity using
bandpass filters (BPFs) and lowpass filters (LPFs) which ideally have the
responses shown in Figure 3-7. The corner frequencies of these filters and,
in the case of the BPFs, their center frequencies, are adjusted to minimize
interfering signals and noise that passes through the system. The three
architectures shown in Figure 3-6 have antennas that interface between
circuits and the outside world. Antennas generally have a broad bandwidth,
much greater than the bandwidth of an individual communication channel.

3.4.2 Heterodyne Transmitter and Receiver

First consider the transmitter architecture shown in Figure 3-6(a). In a
transmitter, a low-frequency information-bearing signal is translated to a
84  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    frequency that can be more easily radiated. The information is contained
    in the baseband signal, which in many modern systems is generated as a
    digital signal within the digital signal processor (DSP). Then the digital-to-
    analog converter, (DAC), converts the digital baseband to an analog signal
    called the analog baseband, identified in Figure 3-6(a) as the intermediate
    frequency (IF) signal at the output of the DAC. Older systems generate the
    IF signal using analog hardware as this reduces the power consumed by
    the digital electronics. The IF then passes through a lowpass filter (LPF)
    to remove the harmonics resulting from the DAC process, and the signal
    is then amplified before being applied to the mixer. There are several
    types of mixers, but the central concept is multiplying the IF signal by
    a much larger local oscillator (LO) signal at frequency fLO. The LO will
    be a single cosinusoid and if its amplitude is ALO, then the LO signal is
    xLO = ALO cos(2fLO). While the IF signal will have a finite bandwidth,
    the operation of the mixer can be illustrated by considering that the IF is a
    single cosinusoid with amplitude AIF and frequency fIF, that is the RF signal
    is xIF = AIF cos(2fIF). Then the output of the mixer is

    xRF = xIF × xLO = AIFALO cos(2fIF) cos(2fLO)                 (3.2)
          = 21 ARFALO {cos[2(fLO - fIF)] + cos[2(fLO + fIF)]} .

    In Equation (3.2) a trigonometric expansion has been used. The LO is chosen
    so that its frequency is close to that of the desired RF so that multiplication
    by the mixer results in an output that has one component at fRF = fLO -fIF
    and one at fRF = fLO + fIF. One of these is selected by the BPF, is further
    amplified, and then delivered to the antenna and radiated.

    3.4.3 Superheterodyne Receiver Architecture

    The first receiver architecture to be considered is the superheterodyne (or
    superhet) receiver architecture shown in Figure 3-6(b). Heterodyning refers
    to the use of a mixer and a superheterodyne circuit has two mixers. The
    antenna collects information from the environment at RF, and immediately
    this is bandpass filtered (by the BPF1 block) to eliminate most of the
    interfering signals and noise. Thus the first BPF reduces the range of voltages
    presented to the first amplifier and so reduces the chance that the amplifier
    will distort the desired signal.

       The RF at the output of the leftmost bandpass filter, BPF1, still has a
    spectrum that is much broader than that of the desired communication
    signal. For example, in 3G radio the communication channel is 5 MHz wide
    but the first BPF could be 50 MHz wide and the RF could be 1 GHz or 2 GHz.
    So it is still necessary to use additional frequency selectivity to isolate the
    single required channel. The optimum choice at this stage is to follow the
    first BPF with an amplifier to boost the level of the signal. This also boosts
    the level of the noise that was captured by the antenna along with the signal,
    but it means that the noise added by the circuitry after the first amplifier has
    much less importance. The next block in the receiver is the mixer that shifts
    the information down in frequency to the first intermediate frequency, IF1.
    The local oscillator, LO1, is chosen so that its frequency is close to that of
    the RF so that multiplication by the mixer results in a low frequency at the
    output (i.e., at fIF1 = fLO - fRF), and one at a frequency nearly twice that of
    the LO (i.e., at the sum frequency, f = fLO + fRF). The center frequency and
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                          85

                                 Figure 3-8: Simple mixer

bandwidth of the second bandpass filter, BPF2, is chosen so that only the
signals around fIF1 pass through. Thus the main function of the first mixer
stage and BPF2 in the superheterodyne receiver is to convert the information
at the RF down to a lower frequency, here at IF1. The operation of the mixer
is shown in Figure 3-8.

   In the superheterodyne receiver architecture the output of the first mixer,
fIF1, is still at too high a frequency for the signal to be directly converted
into digital form where it can be processed. So it is natural to ask why
the frequency translation was not all the way down to baseband. The main
reason for this is that there is substantial noise on an LO at frequencies very
close to the oscillation frequency, fLO1. This noise drops off quickly away
from the oscillation frequency and its level at frequency f is proportional to
(|f - fLO1|)n, n = 1, 2, . . . . This noise will appear at the output of the mixer
and will be substantial if the RF and LO are very close in frequency. So the
optimum trade-off is to shift the frequency of the information-bearing signal
in two stages. Following further amplification, the second stage of mixing
converts the information-bearing component of the signal centered at the
first intermediate frequency, IF1, to the second intermediate frequency, IF2,
which is usually at the baseband frequency or slightly above it. The baseband
signal is now analog and this is converted to digital form by the ADC, and
then the signal, now the digital baseband signal, can be digitally processed
by the DSP.

   Since the second mixer operates at much lower frequencies than the first
mixer, the phase noise on LO2 does not overlap the signal at IF2. The reason
why this architecture is called a superheterodyne receiver architecture is
because when this architecture was first used, IF2 was an audio signal and
IF1 was above the audible range and so was a supersonic signal. Thus the
super in superheterodyne initially referred to the supersonic IF.

3.4.4 Single Heterodyne Receiver

The second receiver architecture shown in Figure 3-6(c) has a single
heterodyne or mixing stage. If the LO has very low noise the IF will be
at a lower frequency than in the superheterodyne architecture shown in
Figure 3-6(b). A high-performance ADC is then required to convert the
signal to digital form and deliver it to the DSP unit. Substantial digital
processing power is required to translate the signal to a digital baseband
signal. Alternatively a high-performance subsampling ADC could be used
that in effect performs mixing during conversion. The advantage of this
architecture is a simplified RF section and is of particular advantage when
multiple RF communication standards are supported as the DSP and ADC
can be common while the analog RF hardware for each band is considerably
simplified.

                     3.4.5 Transceiver

                         The major transistor- or diode-based active elements in the RF front end of
                         both the transmitter and receiver are the amplifiers, mixers, and oscillators.
                         These subsystems have much in common, using nonlinear devices to convert
                         power at DC to power at RF. In the case of mixers, power at the LO is also
                         converted to power at RF. The front end of a typical cellphone is shown in
                         Figure 3-9. The components here are generally implemented in a module
                         and use different technologies for the various elements, optimizing cost and
                         performance.

                            Return now to the mixer-based transceiver (for transmitter and receiver)
                         architecture shown in Figure 3-9. Here, a single antenna is used, and
                         either a diplexer3 (a combined lowpass and highpass filter) or a switch
                         is used to separate the (frequency-spaced) transmit and receive paths. If
                         the system protocol requires transmit and receive operations at the same
                         time, a diplexer is required to separate the transmit and receive paths. This
                         filter tends to be large, lossy, or costly (depending on the technology used).
                         Consequently a transistor switch is preferred if the transmit and receive
                         signals operate in different time slots. In the receive path the low-level
                         received signal is amplified and the initial amplifier needs to have very
                         good noise performance. Once the signal is larger the noise performance
                         of the amplifiers is less critical. The initial amplifier is called a low-noise
                         amplifier (LNA). The amplified receive signal is then bandpass filtered
                         and frequency down-converted by a mixer to IF that can be sampled by
                         an ADC to produce a digital signal that is further processed by DSP.
                         Variants of this architecture include one that has two mixing stages (as in
                         the superheterodyne receiver shown in Figure 3-6(b)), and another with no
                         mixing that relies instead on direct conversion of the receive signal using, as
                         one possibility, a subsampling ADC. In the transmit path, the architecture is
                         reversed, with a DAC driven by the DSP chip that produces an information-
                         bearing signal at the IF which is then frequency up-converted by a mixer,
                         bandpass filtered, and amplified by what is called a power amplifier to
                         generate the tens to hundreds of milliwatts required.

                                3 A duplexer separates transmitted and received signals and is often implemented as a filter
                                  called a diplexer. A diplexer separates two signals on different frequency bands so that they
                                  can use a common element such as an antenna. If the transmitted and received signals are in
                                  different time slots, the duplexer can be a switch.

3.4.6 Hartley Modulator

The Hartley modulator [1, 2], shown in Figure 3-1, results in SSBsingle-

sideband (SSB) modulation or more precisely SSB suppressed-carrier

(SSB-SC) modulation. This is one of the great inventions and variants of
this circuit are used in all modern radios. In the Hartley modulator the
modulating signal m(t) and the carrier are multiplied together in a mixer
and then also 90 phase-shifted versions are also mixed before being added
together. The signal flow is as follows beginning with m(t) = cos(m1t),
p(t) = cos(m1t - /2) = sin(m1t) and carrier signal c1(t) = cos(ct):

      a1(t) = cos(m1t) cos(ct) = 21 [cos((c - m1)t) + cos((c + m1)t)]

      b1(t) = sin(m1t) sin(ct) = 12 [cos((c - m1)t) - cos((c + m1)t)]

      s1(t) = a1(t) + b1(t) = cos((c - m1)t)                                        (3.3)

and so the lower sideband (LSB) is selected. That is, if a finite bandwidth
modulating signal m(t) was mixed only once with the carrier c1(t), the
spectrum of the output a1(t) would include upper and lower sidebands as
well as the carrier as shown in Figure 3-2(a). With the Hartley modulator the

spectrum of Figure 3-2(b) is obtained.
   Every frequency component of m(t) needs to be shifted by 90 and this

can be done using a polyphase circuit or digitally using a Hilbert transform.

To select the upper sideband the summer in Figure 3-1 is replaced by a
subtraction block and then the output becomes s(t) = a1(t) - b1(t) =
cos((c + m1)t).

   Another circuit that implements SSB-SC modulation is the Weaver

modulator [7]. It uses only lowpass filters and mixers and is often used to

implement SSB-SC in a digital-signal processor.

3.4.7 The Hartley Modulator in Modern Radios

In RF engineering, especially when RFICs are used, it is common to

implement the phase shift of the modulating signal digitally using the

Hilbert transform and to use differential signals. Then the Hartley SSB-

SC modulator shown in Figure 3-1 is implemented as shown in Figure
                 +
3-10  where  (m  1  (t),  m  -  (t))  is  the  differential  form  of  the  analog  signal
                             1

corresponding to the modulated signal s(t) at the output of the generic

quadrature modulator in Figure 3-11. With the large number of modulation

formats supported in modern cellular communication standards it is indeed

two bitstreams, Ik and Qk, which are applied
to the multipliers as (possibly filtered) wave-
forms i(t) and q(t). The output of the multi-

pliers (appropriately filtered) are summed to
yield a modulated carrier signal, s(t). The 90
block shifts the carrier by 90.

    component is shifted by 90 usually implemented as the Hilbert transform
    of the digital forms of (m+1 (t), m-1 (t)) (before wave-shaping).

    3.5 Carrier Recovery

    Demodulation requires the generation of a local version of the carrier of a
    received radio signal. This is simple with a DSB RF signal as the carrier is
    sent with the radio signal. DSB FM is a little different as strictly the carrier is
    not sent in the radio signal but the average frequency of the received signal is
    the carrier frequency. With all SSB schemes it is essential to create the carrier
    in a process called carrier recovery. This section considered carrier recovery
    for digitally modulated signals.

       In modern radios carrier recovery is done in two stages. First a crude
    estimate of the carrier is generated and used to crudely demodulate the
    received signal. The crudely demodulated signal is then sampled to yield a
    digital demodulated signal. Then, for 2G and 3G radio, a fine carrier recovery
    procedure using a digital implementation of what has been described is
    used. With 4G and 5G radios the crude carrier recovery procedure is used
    then pilot tones transmitted along with the signal are used to develop a low-
    frequency version of the carrier

    3.6 Modern Transmitter Architectures

    Modern transmitters maximize both spectral efficiency and electrical
    efficiency by using quadrature modulation and suppressing the carrier
    in the radio signal. Electrical efficiency must be achieved together with
    tight specifications on allowable distortion, and designs must achieve
    this with minimum manual adjustments. The discussion in this section
    focuses on narrowband communications when the modulated RF carrier
    can be considered as a slowly varying RF phasor. Modern radios must
    implement various order modulation schemes and also must implement
    legacy modulation methods.

    3.6.1 Quadrature Modulator

    Most digital modulation schemes set the amplitude and phase of a carrier.
    The one exception is frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation, which
    changes the frequency of the carrier and has much in common with FM.
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                         89

by combining I and Q signals.

                              ing intermediate spectra.

So, in most digital modulation schemes, setting the amplitude and phase of
a carrier addresses a point on a phasor diagram. A phasor diagram with
four discrete states is shown in Figure 3-12. The circuit that implements this
digital modulation is shown in Figure 3-11.

3.6.2 Quadrature Modulation

Quadrature modulation describes the frequency conversion process in which
the real and imaginary parts of the RF phasor are varied separately. A
subsystem that implements quadrature modulation is shown in Figure 3-
13. This is quite an ingenious circuit. The operation of this subsystem is
described by what is known as the generalized quadrature modulation
equation:

s(t) = i(t) cos [ct + i(t)] + q(t) sin [ct + q(t)] ,  (3.4)

where, i(t) and q(t) embody the particular modulation rule for amplitude,
i(t) and q(t) embody the particular modulation rule for phase, and c is
the carrier radian frequency. In terms of the signals identified in Figure 3-13,
the quadrature modulation equation can be written as

s(t) =a(t) + b(t)                                     (3.5)

a(t) =i(t) cos [ct + i(t)]                            (3.6)

b(t) =q(t) sin [ct + q(t)] .                          (3.7)

   Figure 3-13 shows that both a(t) and b(t) have two bands, one above and

one below the frequency of the carrier, c. However, there is a difference.
The LO (here designated as the VCO) is shifted 90 (perhaps using an

RC delay line) so that the frequency components of b(t) have a different

phase relationship to the carrier than those of a(t). When a(t) and b(t) are

combined, the carrier content is canceled, as is one of the sidebands provided
that q(t) is a 90 phase-shifted version of i(t). This is exactly what is desired:
90         STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

    the carrier should not be transmitted, as it contains no information. Also, it is
    desirable to transmit only one sideband, as it contains all of the information
    in the modulating signal. This type of modulation is SSB-SC modulation.
    In the next section, frequency modulation is used to demonstrate SSB-SC
    operation.

    3.6.3 Frequency Modulation

    Frequency modulation is considered here to demonstrate SSB-SC operation.
    Let i(t) and q(t) be finite bandwidth signals centered at radian frequency
    m with their phases i(t) and q(t) chosen so that (q(t) - i(t)) is 90 on
    average. This is shown in Figure 3-13, where m represents the frequency
    components of i(t) and q(t). With reference to Figure 3-13,

           i(t) = cos(mt) and q(t) = - sin(mt),                    (3.8)

    and the general quadrature modulation equation, Equation (3.4), becomes

    where  s(t) = i(t) cos (ct) + q(t) sin (ct) = a(t) + b(t),      (3.9)
    and                                                            (3.10)
           a(t) = 1 {cos[(c - m)t] + cos[(c + m)t]}                (3.11)
                    2

           b(t) = 1 {cos[(c + m)t] - cos[(c - m)t]} .
                    2

    Thus the combined frequency modulated signal at the output is

           s(t) = a(t) + b(t) = cos[(c + m)t],                     (3.12)

    and the carrier and lower sideband are both suppressed. The lower sideband,
    cos[(c - m)t], is also referred to as the image which may not be exactly zero
    because of circuit imperfections. In modulators it is important to suppress
    this image, and in demodulators it is important that undesired signals at the
    image frequency not be converted along with the desired signals.

    3.6.4 Polar Modulation

    In polar modulation, the i(t) and q(t) quadrature signals are converted to
    polar form as amplitude A(t) and phase (t) components. This is either
    done in the DSP unit or, if a modulated RF carrier is all that is provided,
    using an envelope detector to extract A(t) and a limiter to extract the phase
    information corresponding to (t). Two polar modulator architectures are
    shown in Figure 3-14. In the first architecture, Figure 3-14(a), A(t) and (t)
    are available and A(t) is used to amplitude modulate the RF carrier, which
    is then amplified by a power amplifier (PA). The phase signal, (t), is the
    input to a phase modulator implemented as a PLL. The output of the PLL is
    fed to an efficient amplifier operating near saturation (also called a saturating
    amplifier). The outputs of the two amplifiers are combined to obtain the large
    modulated RF signal to be transmitted.

       In the second polar modulation architecture, Figure 3-14(b), a low-
    power modulated RF signal is decomposed into its amplitude- and phase-
    modulated components. The phase component, (t), is extracted using a
    limiter that produces a pulse-like waveform with the same zero crossings
    as the modulated RF signal. Thus the phase of the RF signal is captured. This
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                      91

is then fed to a saturating amplifier whose gain is controlled by the carrier
envelope, or A(t). Specifically, A(t) is extracted using an envelope detector,
with a simple implementation being a rectifier followed by a lowpass filter
with a corner frequency equal to the bandwidth of the modulation. A(t)
then drives a switching (and hence efficient) power supply that drives the
saturating power amplifier.

3.7 Modern Receiver Architectures

This section discusses transmitter and receiver architectures in the
generations before software defined radio (as used in 4G and 5G). These are
architectures that could be implemented in analog hardware.

3.7.1 Receiver Architectures

It is more challenging to achieve a high performance for a receiver than it is
for a transmitter.

   Communication receivers most commonly use mixing of the RF signal
with a fixed signal called an LO to produce a lower-frequency replica
of the modulated RF signal. Some receiver architectures use one stage of
mixing, while others use two stages. In cellular systems, the receiver must
be sensitive enough to detect signals of 100 fW or less.

   Some of the architectures used in modern receivers are shown in Figure
3-15. Figure 3-15(a) is the superheterodyne architecture in much the same
form that it has been used for a century. Key features of this architecture
are that there are two stages of mixing, and filtering is required to suppress
spurious mixing products. Each mixing stage has its own VCO. The receiver
progressively reduces the frequency of the information-bearing signal. The
image rejection mixer in the dashed box achieves rejection of the image
frequency to produce an IF (or baseband frequency) that can be directly
sampled. However, it is difficult to achieve the required amplitude and phase
balance. Instead, the architecture shown in Figure 3-15(b) is sometimes used.
The filter between the two mixers can be quite large. For example, if the

                 incoming signal is 1 GHz, the frequency of the signal after the first mixer
                 could be 100 MHz.

                    Filters are smaller and have higher performance at higher frequencies. This
                 is exploited in the dual-conversion receiver shown in Figure 3-15(c). This
                 is similar to the traditional superheterodyne architecture except that the IF
                 between the two mixers is high. For example, if the incoming signal is 1 GHz,
                 the output of the first mixer could be 3 GHz. This architecture also enables
                 broad radio operation with the band selected by choosing the frequencies of
                 the two local oscillators.

                    The low-IF or zero-IF receiver shown in Figure 3-15(d) uses less hardware
                 and is common in less demanding communication applications. In high-
                 performance systems, such as the cellular phone system, this architecture
                 requires more design time as well as calibration circuitry to trim the I and Q
                 paths so that they are closely matched.

down-converted signal in (d). .

3.7.2 Homodyne Frequency Conversion

Homodyne mixing and detection is one of the earliest wireless receiver
technologies and is used in AM radio. In homodyne mixing, the carrier
of a modulated signal is regenerated and synchronized in phase with the
incoming carrier frequency. Mixing the carrier with the RF signal results in
an IF signal centered around zero frequency.

   The signal spectra in homodyne mixing is shown in Figure 3-16. In Figure
3-16(a), the RF signals are shown on the right-hand side and the baseband
signals are shown on the left-hand side. It is usual to show both positive and
negative frequencies at the lower frequencies so that the conversion process
is more easily illustrated. Of course negative frequencies do not exist. The
characteristic of homodyne mixing is that the LO corresponds to the carrier
and is in the middle of the desired RF channel. RF signal components mix
with the LO, and it appears that the entire RF spectrum is down-shifted
around DC. Of course, the actual baseband spectrum is only defined for
positive frequencies, so the negative-frequency baseband signals and the
positive-frequency baseband signals combine to yield the detected baseband
spectrum shown in Figure 3-16(b). With other modulation schemes, this
possible loss of information is avoided using quadrature demodulation.
An amplitude modulated signal has identical modulation sidebands, so the
collapsing of positive and what is shown as negative frequencies at baseband
results in no loss of information. Then a simple amplitude detection circuitry,
such as a rectifier, is used and the rectified signal was (typically) passed
directly to a speaker.

                  3.7.3 Heterodyne Frequency Conversion

                  In heterodyne mixing, the locally generated LO and the main RF channel
                  are separated in frequency, as shown in Figure 3-17(a). In this figure the
                  RF signals (shown as three discrete channels on the right-hand side of
                  the spectrum) mix with the LO to produce signals at a lower frequency.
                  This lower frequency is usually not the final baseband frequency, and so is
                  called the intermediate frequency (IF). The IF of the main channel is at the
                  difference frequency of the RF signal and the LO. There are several important
                  refinements to this. The first of these is concerned with limiting the number
                  of signals that can mix with the LO. This is done using an RF preselect
                  filter. To see the difficulties introduced by the image channel, consider the
                  frequency conversion to an intermediate frequency described in Figure 3-18.
                  Filtering reduces the level of the image channel as shown in Figure 3-18(a).
                  Note that the main channel and its image are equidistant from the LO, see
                  Figure 3-18. Both down-convert to the same IF frequency. In the worst-case
                  scenario, the IF image could be larger than that of the desired channel.

                  3.7.4 Direct Conversion Receiver

                  Zero-IF direct conversion receivers are similar to quadrature homodyne
                  receivers in that the LO is placed near the center of the RF channel The
                  important characteristic of direct conversion receivers is that there is only
                  one level of mixing. The conversion process is described in Figure 3-19.
                  A particular advantage of direct conversion is that the relatively large
                  IF filters are eliminated. They are invariably implemented as quadrature

demodulators, see Figure 3-20. used in cellular phones as it uses uses little
DC power, and hence extends battery life, and is compatible with monolithic
ICs. Direct conversion is now the preferred method of down conversion

   The main nonideality of this design is the DC offset in the down-converted
spectrum. DC offset results mostly from self-mixing, or rectification, of the
LO. This DC offset can be much larger than the down-converted signal
itself. One way of coping with the DC offset is to highpass filter the down-
converted signal, but highpass filtering requires a large passive component
(e.g., a series capacitor), at least to avoid the dynamic range problems
of active filters. Highpass filtering the down-converted signal necessarily
throws away information in the signal spectrum, and it is only satisfactory
to do this if there is very little information around DC to begin with.

   The primary design effort with zero-IF converters is overcoming the
DC offset problem, and to a lesser extent coping with the jitter of the
LO. However there is a scheme used in 4G and 5G that overcomes these
limitations. This will be discussed in following chapters.

3.7.5 Low-IF Receiver

In a low-IF receiver, single-stage heterodyne mixing is used to down-convert
the modulated RF carrier to a frequency just above DC, perhaps a few
hundred kilohertz or a few megahertz, depending on the bandwidth of the
RF channel. In doing this, the DC offset problem of a direct conversion
receiver is avoided. This frequency offset can be just a few hundred hertz
to be effective. Low IF conversion is now the preferred method of down-
conversion in cellular phones as it requires very little batter usage, does not
require large IF filters, and is compatible with monolithic ICs. Sometimes
low-IF conversion is referred to as direct down conversion but there is a
subtle difference.

3.7.6 Subsampling Analog-to-Digital Conversion

Subsampling receivers overcome the DC offset problem typical of other
direct conversion receivers. The idea is to sample the modulated RF signal at
a subharmonic of the carrier of the RF signal to be converted. The sampling
rate must be at least twice the bandwidth of the baseband signal and the
track-mode bandwidth must be greater than the carrier frequency. Thus
the sampling aperture is the critical parameter and must be several times
smaller than the period of the carrier. Fortunately the aperture times of
CMOS tracking circuits are adequate. It is critical that an RF preselect filter be
used to eliminate unwanted interferers and noise outside the communication
band. Aliasing of signals outside the Nyquist bandwidth onto the baseband
signal is a consequence of subsampling. Adjacent channel signals are
converted without aliasing, but these will lie outside the bandwidth of the

    of an emergency or military radio.

    baseband signal. Flicker noise on the sampling clock is multiplied by the
    subsampling ratio and appears as additional noise at baseband. This was at
    one time a very attractive option but has been out-performed by the low-IF
    receiver.

    3.7.7 First IF-to-Baseband Conversion

    In a superheterodyne conversion architecture there are two heterodyne
    stages, with the IF of the first stage in modern systems in the range of 20 to
    200 MHz. The assignment of frequencies is known as frequency planning,
    and this is treated as proprietary by the major radio vendors. This IF is
    then converted to a much lower IF, typically around 100 kHz to a few
    megahertz above the center frequency of the baseband signal. This frequency
    is generally called baseband, but strictly it is not because the signal is still
    offset in frequency from DC. Some direct conversion architectures leave the
    first heterodyne mixing stage in place and use direct conversion of the first
    IF to baseband (true baseband--around DC).

    3.7.8 Bilateral Double-Conversion Receiver

    The receivers considered so far are suitable for narrowband communications
    typical of point-to-point and consumer mobile radio. There are many
    situations where the range of received or transmitted RF signals covers a very
    wide bandwidth, such as with emergency radios, television, and military
    communications. Typically, however, the instantaneous bandwidth is small.
    If narrowband RF front-end architectures are used, a switchable filter bank
    would be required and this would result in an impractically large radio.
    One solution to covering very wide RF bandwidths is the double-conversion
    transceiver architecture shown in Figure 3-21. The frequency plan of a typical
    radio using 0.1 MHz channels between 20 MHz and 500 MHz is shown.
    The key feature of this radio is that bidirectional mixers are used. Following
    the RF chain from left to right, the RF is first mixed up in frequency,
    bandpass filtered using a high-Q distributed filter, and then down-converted
    to a lower frequency that can be sampled directly by an ADC. A much
    higher performance passive (and hence bidirectional) filter can be realized
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                        97

at gigahertz frequencies than at a few tens of megahertz. On transmit, the
function is similar, with the mixers and LO reused. As a receiver, the notch
filter or lowpass filter is used to block the image frequency of the first mixer
so that only the upper sideband IF is presented to the first bandpass filter.
The lowpass or notch filter may be fixed, although, with the plan shown,
there must be at least two states of the filters. On transmit, the lowpass or
notch filters prevent the image frequency from being radiated.

3.8 Introduction to Software Defined Radio

The 2G and 3G cellular radio schemes used very few modulation methods.
With the introduction of 4G and now 5G many modulation methods must
be supported with the highest-order modulation scheme used determined
by the level of noise and interference on a channel. This support for
multiple modulation methods is only possible if most of the demodulation
process is performed in DSP where software controls demodulation. Such
a radio is called a software defined radio (SDR). In an SDR many of the
functions that traditionally would be performed using analog hardware
are instead implemented digitally and only the RF functions close to the
transmit/receive antenna are implemented in analog form. An extreme
concept for the transmitter side of the radio is to implement all of the
functions digitally with a final digital-to-analog converter (DAC) connected
to an antenna. Then the performance is limited by the maximum frequency
and output power of the DAC. This ultimate SDR provides maximum
flexibility, for example, it is easy to change modulation schemes, but would
also contribute to very high battery drain. So instead there is a trade-off with
many aspects such as modulation and fine tuning of the RF carrier frequency
done digitally while, with a transmitter, the final up-conversion done using
analog hardware which only needs to be able to support the bandwidth of
the modulated signal but otherwise is agnostic to the type of modulation
used.

   All radios today use quadrature modulation, a type of digital modulation,
in which the real (in-phase) and imaginary (quadrature-phase) components
of the phasor of the carrier are varied independently. While it is possible to
vary the amplitude and phase of a carrier tone separately this is not common.

   Quadrature demodulation recovers the original signals that varied the
in-phase and quadrature-phase components of the carrier. Demodulation
can proceed in stages with an initial analog separation of RF in-phase and
quadrature signals which are sampled by an analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) and demodulation completed in a digital signal processor.

   The following sections discuss various aspects of an SDR radio. Section
3.9 begins with a description of quadrature modulation in a way that helps
in the understanding of an SDR transmitter. In Section 3.10 a specific example
of an SDR transmitter is presented in which the time-domain and frequency-
domain signals are followed through first a digital signal processor (DSP)
and then an analog up-converter to produce an RF signal. This discussion
is followed by a description of an SDR receiver with the general SDR
quadrature demodulator in Section 3.11 and then a specific example in
Section 3.12.

Each RF sideband has a mix of the

information in i(t) and q(t).

              3.9 SDR Quadrature Modulator

              The SDR transmitter uses two-stage modulation with DSB-SC modulation
              implemented in DSP to produce an IF signal which is output using DACs to
              produce analog I and Q channel IF signals. These IF signals are then input
              to an analog quadrature modulator implementing SSB-SC modulation with
              the resulting radio signal being a DSB-SC radio signal. As of the time of this
              writing the digital portion was implemented in what is called a baseband
              chip and the analog portion implemented in an RF modem chip. One can
              expect that eventually these would be combined into a single chip. As far as
              the RF modem chip is concerned, the IF signals input to the up-converter are
              baseband signals and this is how they are often referred to when the focus is
              on the RF modem chip.

                 Quadrature modulation, see Figure 3-22, comprises two mixer cores which
              are driven by a modulating in-phase component i(t) and a modulating
              quadrature-phase component q(t) where in-phase and quadrature phase
              refer to the phase of the local oscillator input to the mixer cores. Here
              i(t) and q(t) are baseband signals with a spectrum extending from (near)
              DC to fBB and in today's radios they are produced internally in a DSP
              unit. The finite bandwidth i(t) and q(t) signals contain I-channel and Q-
              channel information respectively. The top mixer core is driven directly
              by the local oscillator and the other, the quadrature mixer core, is also
              driven by the local oscillator but now it is phase shifted by 90, i.e. it is
              in quadrature. This scheme produces double-sideband suppressed carrier
              DSB-SC modulation and s(t) is the modulated output signal with each
              sideband having bandwidth fBB. The block-level schematic illustrates the
              basic architecture of a quadrature modulator which is expanded if the signals
              are differential signals with additional variations according to whether the
              mixers are implemented as analog multipliers or as switches controlled by
              the LO. The whole structure shown is referred to as a mixer and each mixer
              core on its own is also often referred to as a mixer. This operation can be
              implemented without error in DSP.

              3.9.1 Analog Quadrature Modulator

              The second stage of an SDR transmitter implements DSB-SC modulation
              using analog circuitry producing an RF signal.

                 An analog quadrature modulator using multipliers is shown in Figure
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                         99

3-23(a) and consists of two multipliers each of which has two inputs and

one output with the outputs summed yielding a modulated output signal
s(t). One particular characteristic of a quadrature modulator is that the LO
at frequency fLO is directly input to one of the multipliers but the second
multiplier is driven by a version of the LO with a 90 phase lag, i.e. the

LO input to the first mixer is in-phase and the LO input to the second
multiplier has quadrature-phase (the phase is shifted by 90). This second
LO is also called the quadrature LO. The 90 phase difference of the two

LOs is where the quadrature in quadrature modulator comes from. So if the
LO is sin(2fLO), i(t) is multiplied by sin(2fLO). Then q(t) is multiplied by
sin(2fLO - /2) = - cos(2fLO). The second inputs of the multipliers in
Figure 3-23(a) are the signals i(t) and q(t) with i indicating that the signal is
driving the in-phase multiplier and q indicating that the signal is driving the
quadrature-phase multiplier. The signals i(t) and q(t) may be independent,
or the frequency components of q(t) may phase lag i(t) by 90 but otherwise
be the same as i(t). These two options yield modulated output signals with

different bandwidths.

Transistor-Based Multiplier

There are several ways to implement the mixer core in Figure 3-23(a) with the
most common being as a multiplier or as a switch. Both can be conveniently
implemented using transistors. The analog multiplier shown in Figure 3-
23(b) is based on a cascode amplifier with one input applied to the gate of
transistor M1. Instead of the gate of M2 being held at a DC voltage as with a
cascode amplifier, the gate of M2 is also an input. Approximately, the drain
current, ID, of M1 is proportional to the gate voltage vIF and the voltage gain
of M2, i.e. vRF/vLO is proportional to ID. Thus the RF output voltage vRF is
proportional to the product of vIF (which in the modulator is either i(t) or
q(t)) and vLO. So when vIF and vLO are sinewaves the output vLO will be the
trigonometric expansion of the product of two sinewaves and this product
will also comprise two sinewaves at the sum and difference frequencies.
Then circuit symmetry is used to select just one of these.

Polyphase Filter

A polyphase filter, such as the one-stage polyphase filter in in Figure 3-
23(c), takes an input analog input signal and outputs two signals that are the
same except that the frequency components are shifted by 90. This circuit
can be used to produce the quadrature LO signal or to shift the frequency
components of a baseband signal. More commonly a polyphase filter is

                         in Figures 3-23(c) and 3-24(a) are narrowband but the bandwidth can be
                         increased using more stages, see Figure 3-24(b).

                         Double Sideband Modulation
                         When i(t) and q(t) are independent, effectively pseudo-random, signals the
                         result is double sideband (DSB) modulation, see Figures 3-25(a-d) with each
                         sideband having the bandwidth of the baseband signals. The amplitude
                         spectra of i(t) and q(t) will be the same as shown in Figure 3-25(a) and each

has a bandwidth fBB.4 As seen in Figure 3-25(b) the frequency components
of the i(t) spectrum are arbitrarily assigned a 45 phase. Since i(t) and q(t)
are independent the phase of q(t) relative to the phase of i(t) is random,
see Figure 3-25(c). The modulated signal s(t) then has a sideband below the
carrier frequency fc and a sideband above fc, see Figure 3-25(d), for a total
bandwidth 2fBB.

   The multipliers in a quadrature modulator are implemented as mixer

circuits and one type of mixer in particular is the multiplicative mixer shown

in Figure 3-23(a). Ideally a multiplicative mixer multiplies two sinewaves

together to produce the trigonometric expansion of the product of two
sinewaves. For example, sin(A) · sin(B) = 12 [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)].
Following the signal paths in Figure 3-23(a) and considering the frequency
component Ai(fi) sin(it) of i(t) at radian frequency i = 2fi and a
frequency component Aq(fq) sin(qt) of q(t) at radian q = 2fq the
modulated signal with the LO frequency replaced by fc (with radian carrier
frequency c = 2fc) is

s(t) = si(t) + sq(t)

= [Ai(fi) sin(it) sin(ct)] + [Aq(fq) sin(qt) sin(ct - /2)]

= [Ai(fi) sin(it) sin(ct)] - [Aq(fq) sin(qt) cos(ct)]

=  1  [Ai(fi) cos c   -  i)t  -  Ai(fi) cos(c  +     i)t
   2

   -Aq(fq) sin(c + q)t + Aq(fq) sin(c - q)t]

=  1  [Ai(fi) cos(c   -  i)t  +  Aq(fq) sin(c  -     q )t]

   -  1  [Ai(fi)  cos(c  +  i)t  +  Aq (fq )  sin(c  +  q )t]  .  (3.13)
      2

The DSB-SC modulated signal is the signal in Equation (3.13) summed for all
fi and fq components from DC to fBB.

   The expansion in Equation (3.13) can be repeated for all of the frequency
components of i(t) and q(t). So while the expansion is only performed for
discrete frequencies, all that is necessary is that the multiplier be practically
ideal, something that is typically achieved by an analog multiplier to better
than 1%. If the DSB-SC signal was produced digitally then multiplication can
be precisely implemented and the DSB-SC modulation is ideal although the
maximum frequency is limited by the capabilities of the digital circuitry. A
DSP-based DSB-SC modulation has a low carrier frequency as keeping the
(digital) carrier frequency low reduces DC power requirements. If i(t) and
q(t) are independent, Equation (3.13) indicates a lower modulated sideband
at the range of frequencies (fLO - fi) and (fLO - fq) and an upper modulated
sideband at the range of frequencies (fLO + fi) and (fLO + fq) for all fi and
fq from 0 (DC) to fBB. That is, this is DSB-SC modulation, as seen in Figure
3-25(d). In demodulation both sidebands are needed to recover i(t) and q(t).

Single Sideband Modulation

When i(t) and q(t) are the same signal except that every frequency
component of q(t) is shifted by 90 the result is single sideband (SSB)
modulation and the modulated output signal has a bandwidth fBB. The

4 The short-term spectra will be different because i(t) and q(t) are different signals but over a
  long time interval the envelope of the amplitude spectra will become similar.
102        STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     carrier itself does not exist in the output with a quadrature modulator

     using multipliers so this modulator implements SSB suppressed-carrier
     (SSB-SC) modulation. The modulated output signal is obtained with q(t) =
     Ai(fi) sin(i - /2) = -Ai(fi) cos(i). Then Equation (3.13) becomes (but
     now fLO is used to distinguish it from the carrier frequency which is defined
     by the characteristics of the modulating signal)

     s(t) = si(t) + sq(t)

     = [Ai(fi) sin(it) sin(LOt)] - [Ai(fi) cos(it) sin(LOt - /2)]

     = Ai(fi) [sin(it) sin(LOt) + cos(it) cos(LOt)]

     =  1  Ai  (f  i  )  {  c  o  s[(  LO  -  i)t]  -  cos[(LO  +  i)t]
        2

        + cos[(LO + i)t] + cos[(LO - i)t]}

     = Ai(fi) cos[(LO - i)]t.                                            (3.14)

     Equation (3.14) indicates that just the lower sideband is present and this
     is SSB-SC modulation as seen in Figure 3-25(h) and the bandwidth of the
     modulated output signal is fBB. The original i(t) signal can be recovered
     from this one sideband but that is because q(t) contains exactly the same
     information as i(t) (although phase shifted).

        If instead the phase of each frequency component of q(t) led the same
     frequency component of i(t) by +90 then s(t) would comprise the upper

     sideband and this is still this would be SSB-SC modulation, see Figures 3-
     25(i-l). For SSB-SC modulation each frequency component of q(t) must have
     a phase that differs from the corresponding component of i(t) by 90. A

     lumped-element circuit that realizes this is the polyphase filter, see Figure

     3-23(c), but the phase shift can also be realized in DSP.
        Earlier, just before Equation (3.14), it was stated that the frequency of

     the carrier was defined by the characteristics of the modulated signal
     which in turn depends on the characteristics of the modulating signal. This
     modulating signal, the i(t) input to the SSB-SC modulator, could also be

     modulated as is usually the case in SDR where DSB-SC modulation in done
     in a DSP and this is followed by SSB-SC modulation done at RF using analog

     hardware. Identifying the correct RF carrier is required for demodulation.

     In identifying the carrier there are two situations to consider. If the input,
     i(t), of the SSB-SC modulator is not modulated, e.g. it is just a baseband

     signal, then the carrier frequency is just the frequency of the LO of the SSB-
     SC modulator as shown in Figure 3-26(a), i.e. fc = fLO. If the input signal
     to the SSB-SC modulator is itself a DSB-SC signal (produced by a DSB-SC
     modulator) so that it has its own intermediate carrier frequency fc,IF, then
     the carrier frequency fc = fLO - fc,IF. This situation is shown in Figure 3-
     26(b). (Note that the carrier frequency would be above fLO if the frequency
     components of q(t) were advanced in phase by 90 relative to the phase of
     the frequency components of i(t).)

     3.9.2 Summary

     This section discussed quadrature modulation and showed how the same
     circuit can be used for DSB and for SSB modulation. The difference is
     in whether or not i(t) and q(t) are related. In modern radios DSB is
     implemented in DSP to produce an IF modulated signal with the spectra

this DSB-SC signal becomes the baseband of an analog SSB modulator that
produces the RF modulated signal. This RF modulated signal is a DSB signal
with a (suppressed) carrier in the middle of the spectrum.

3.10 Case Study: SDR Transmitter

An SDR transmitter combines DSB-SC modulation having a relatively low
intermediate frequency carrier with a broadband analog SSB-SC modulation
to produce a DSB-SC RF signal. There are many possible implementations.
This case study presents system simulations of an SDR transmitter with
specific parameters. First a DSB-SC quadrature modulator is studied with
sinusoidal in-phase and quadrature baseband signals and then a SSB-SC
modulator is examined. This is followed by the study of a direct analog
modulation of a digital signal. The final study corresponds to a typical SDR
transmitter with DSP-based intermediate frequency DSB-SC modulation
followed by SSB-SC analog modulation producing a DSB-SC modulated RF
signal.

The quadrature modulator of Figure 3-23(a) is simulated here with a 10 MHz
sinewave for i(t), a 15 MHz sinewave for q(t), and a 1 GHz sinewave LO.

     output, s(t), is shown in Figure 3-27. The waveform is plotted on a 1 µs scale
     so that there are 10 cycles of i(t) and 15 cycles of q(t) which are modulated

     on 1,000 cycles of the 1 GHz RF carrier.
        The spectra of the signals at the outputs of the two multipliers, i.e. of si(t)

     and sq(t), are shown in Figure 3-28(a). Each spectrum has two peaks offset
     from the 1 GHz LO frequency by 10 MHz for the I signal, si(t), and by 15
     MHz for the Q signal, sq(t). The amplitudes of each spectra are symmetrical
     around the LO frequency but there is a difference in the phase of the Fourier
     transforms of si(t) and sq(t). The phases of the Fourier transforms of the
     signals are shown in Figure 3-28(b). The upper and lower sideband phases
     of the 10 MHz I channel signal are equal but the phases of the upper and
     lower sidebands of the 15 MHz Q channel signal differ by 180, i.e. the upper
     sideband of sq(t) is the negative of the lower sideband of sq(t). In contrast
     the phases of the upper and lower realized sidebands of si(t) are equal.

        The amplitude and phase spectra of the combined signal, s(t) = si(t) +
     sq(t), are shown in Figures 3-28(c and d) and are as expected from combining
     the spectra of the components. The spectrum of s(t), consists of two pairs of

     peaks with the peaks of one pair being above and below the LO frequency

     by 10 MHz, and the peaks of the other pair being offset by 15 MHz. The
     components are in a lower sideband and an upper sideband and hence

     this modulation is DSB modulation. Also there is not a component of the
     output signal at the local oscillator frequency, fLO. The middle of the output
     signal bandwidth is generally the carrier frequency fc which here is the
     same as fLO. Thus the carrier does not exist in the output and so this is
     called suppressed carrier (SC) modulation. Together this is double sideband

     suppressed carrier (DSB-SC) modulation. Suppression of the carrier is a

     property of the multiplicative mixer but some types of modulators, e.g.
     amplitude modulators, have the carrier in the RF output signal and hence

     the suppressed-carrier distinction being used with quadrature modulation.
        Note that each of the sidebands of the DSB-SC modulated signal have both

     I and Q information. With finite and equal bandwidth i(t) and q(t) signals,
     the I and Q information in the RF modulated signal will have overlapping
     lower sideband and upper sideband. It is only possible to recover and
     separate the original i(t) and q(t) signals if both sidebands are used in

     demodulation.

3.10.2 Single-Sideband Suppressed-Carrier (SSB-SC)
           Modulation

Examination of the phase differences of the lower and upper sideband
components with the DSB-SC modulator considered in the previous section
leads to the design of a SSB-SC modulator. This is obtained when i(t) and
q(t) are the same signal except that the frequency components of q(t) lag
those of i(t) by 90. Thus the phase components of sq(t) shown in Figure 3-
28(b) are shifted by -90 so that the lower sideband components of si(t) and
sq(t) (now having the same frequency) combine constructively but the upper
sideband components cancel. The variation of the quadrature modulator
that implements this is shown in Figure 3-29(a) with the baseband signal

     sBB(t) = i(t), and q(t) is the same signal except that q(t) lags i(t) by 90. The
     signals in this modulator will now be examined.

        With sBB = i(t) being a 15 MHz sinusoidal signal, the q(t) is a 15 MHz
     sinewave that lags i(t) by 90. The spectrum at the output of the quadrature
     modulator of Figure 3-29(a and c) is as shown in Figure 3-30(a). Now there is

     only one sideband. Insight into the operation of SSB modulation is obtained
     by examining the spectra of the signals at the output of the multipliers, see
     Figure 3-30(b). It is seen that the amplitude spectra of si(t) and of sq(t) are
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                                     107

essentially the same and both have upper and lower sidebands. However
there is a difference in the phases of their Fourier transforms, see Figure 3-
31. It is seen that at 15 MHz offset from the 1 GHz LO there is no differences
in the phases of si(t) and sq(t) components in the lower sideband but there
is a 180 difference in the upper sideband, see Figure 3-31(b). Thus when
si(t) and sq(t) are summed their lower sideband components add but their
upper sideband components cancel thus suppressing the upper sideband
in the combined signal s(t). This illustrates the most important metric of a
SSB modulator as having I/Q paths that are matched as any imbalance in
implementation that results in an amplitude or phase difference of the I and
Q paths will result in a spurious (upper) sideband. Provided that the balance
is good a filter is not required to suppress an upper sideband.

   The SSB-SC modulator was modeled here with a sinusoidal input signal,
sBB(t), but upper sideband suppression will also be obtained with a finite
bandwidth baseband signal. This is achieved if every frequency component
of sBB(t) is 90 phase-shifted to become q(t) so that q(t) is the quadrature-
phase version of the in-phase i(t). A circuit that implements this is the
polyphase filter and one type is the RC circuit shown in Figure 3-29(b). This
has a finite bandwidth but this can be broadened by using multiple stages,
e.g. see Figure 3-24(b). Incorporating the polyphase filter in the quadrature
modulator leads to the implementation in Figure 3-29(c).

3.10.3 Digital Quadrature Modulation

A digital quadrature modulator is shown in Figure 3-32. The input bitstream
Sk is converted into two independent binary bitstreams Ik and Qk which
are then lowpass filtered, or in general wave-shaped, to provide two
independent analog signals i(t) and q(t). That is, each pair of bits in the Sk
bitstream becomes one Ik bit and one Qk bit. The binary waveforms of Ik and
Qk are then filtered to obtain the analog signals i(t) and q(t) each of which
has the same baseband bandwidth indicated in the spectrum on the lower

00 10 01 00 11 11 10 and taken as (Ik,Qk) pairs. The initial setting is i(0) = 0 = q(0).

                         left in Figure 3-32. The in-phase baseband signal, i(t), is multiplied by the
                         local oscillator signal having frequency fLO. Also, the quadrature baseband
                         signal, q(t), is multiplied by the local oscillator signal having frequency fLO
                         but now the LO is delayed by 90. Summing si(t) and sq(t), the outputs of
                         the multipliers, yields the double sideband suppressed carrier RF signal s(t)
                         which has twice the bandwidth of each of the analog baseband signals as
                         indicated in the lower right in Figure 3-32.

                            The modulator of Figure 3-32 results in four states of the modulated carrier
                         signal. That is, if the modulated carrier signal s(t) is sampled at a time
                         indicated by the common clock of Ik and Qk, the sample of the carrier will
                         have a particular amplitude and phase. Since this is QPSK modulation the
                         amplitudes at these multiple sampling instances will be the same but the
                         phases will have four values addressed by the coordinate (Ik, Qk).

                            Now consider a particular quadrature multiplier where Sk is a 20 Mbit/s
                         random bitstream so that Ik and Qk are the 10 Mbit/s bit streams shown in
                         Figure 3-33(a and b). The Ik and Qk bitstreams are then level shifted so that
                         the transitions are between -1 and 1 instead of between 0 and 1. The level-
                         shifted bitstreams are then lowpass filtered to obtain the analog baseband
                         signals i(t) and q(t) shown in Figure 3-33(c). The lowpass filter used here is a
                         raised cosine filter which is commonly used in digital modulation rather than
                         a lumped-element lowpass filter and here has an effective corner frequency

of 7 MHz. In practice the raised cosine filter is implemented in DSP so that
the signals i(t) and q(t) follow DACs.

   One feature of the raised cosine filter is that the filtered response at the
clock-derived sampling times is exact. That is, if the filtered analog baseband
signals are sampled every 0.1 µs then the sampled values of i(t) and q(t) will
be exactly either +1.00 or -1.00 and (after level-shifting by adding one and
multiplying by half) the original bitstream is exactly recovered as 0 or 1. If
an analog lowpass filter was used the sampled values would not be exactly
right. The raised cosine filter introduces no sampling distortion and also the
transitions are minimal, i.e. they have the minimum bandwidth compared
to what would be obtained if an analog filter was used for wave-shaping.
The bandwidth of the filtered signal obtained using a lumped-element filter
would be 10 MHz or more and even then the carrier samples would never
correspond exactly with the constellation points. Plotting q(t) against i(t)
yields the transitions shown in Figure 3-34. Samples of the baseband signal
every 0.1 µs coincides with one of the four states and enables two bits of
information to be recovered.

   The next stage of the DSB-SC modulator multiplies the i(t) signal by a
1 GHz LO and the q(t) signal is multiplied by a 90 phase-shifted LO. Then
the outputs of the multipliers are summed to produce the modulated RF
signal s(t) shown in Figure 3-35. The LO here is in the middle of the RF
bandwidth and so here the carrier frequency is the same as the LO frequency.

     Sampling the RF signal s(t) every 0.1 µs provides the amplitudes and phases
     of the carrier with each sample coinciding with one of the constellation
     points. This modulation scheme is generally called QPSK modulation for
     quadra-phase shift keying but it is sometimes, but less accurately, called
     quadrature phase shift keying. In QPSK modulation each constellation point
     corresponds to one of four phases of the RF signal: 45, 135, -45, or -135.

        QPSK modulation was originally implemented with simpler hardware
     so the QPSK term is used rather than 4-QAM for four-state quadrature
     amplitude modulation which more accurately reflects the modulation
     process described in this section, it does not have to be done this way if only
     the phase of the carrier is to be adjusted.

        Plotting the phasor of the RF carrier signal will result in a phasor diagram
     identical to the transitions shown in the constellation diagram of Figure 3-
     34 although it may be necessary to scale the amplitude of the phasor signal
     to match the values in the constellation diagram. Note that the constellation
     diagram does not change when the average signal level changes. With the
     sampling clock aligned to the original clock for the Ik and Qk bitstreams,
     samples of the RF phasor will precisely coincide with one of the constellation
     points in Figure 3-34 (and hence s(t) is on the way to being demodulated).

        Digital radio sends data in finite length packets and here the packet is 2048
     bits long. With 2 bits per symbol in QPSK modulation there are 1024 symbols
     and with a symbol interval of 0.1 µs, the duration of the packet is 102.4 µs.

        The spectra of the baseband and the output RF signals in the modulator
     are shown in Figure 3-36. The spectra of i(t) and q(t), Figures 3-36(a and
     b) respectively, are not identical because each bitstreams is independent.
     For each bitstream the spectra extends down to DC. It would be possible
     to use a coding scheme for the bitstreams that ensures that there is not a
     DC component and this aids automatic carrier recovery in pre-4G cellular
     systems. Instead 4G and 5G systems use separate mechanisms enabling
     carrier recovery. The bandwidth of the in-phase and quadrature-phase

analog baseband signals are slightly less than 10 MHz. The spectrum of
the RF output signal is shown in Figure 3-36(c) and the bandwidth of this
double-sideband modulated signal is slightly less than 20 MHz. The RF
signal has two sidebands, one below 1 GHz and one above even though there
is no clear demarcation such as a dip at 1 GHz. The continuous spectrum
through 1 GHz is a consequence of the baseband spectra extending to DC.

   As was noted previously, and in the absence of noise, the constellation
points are faithfully replicated if the RF signal is sampled at 0.1 µs intervals
(provided that the phase and the frequency of the carrier has been replicated
accurately). The replication of the constellation points is a property of the
raised cosine filter which also results in reduced bandwidth baseband analog
signals than would be obtained if analog lowpass filtering was used. Also
note that (with the DSB-SC quadrature modulation described here) the
carrier frequency, the center of the RF signal spectrum, is 1 GHz, the same
as the LO frequency.

   The spectra of all of the RF signals are shown in Figure 3-37. The spectrum
of the RF output, Figure 3-37(a), is centered at 1 GHz and this is the carrier
frequency and is also the LO frequency for this DSB-SC transmitter. A
curiosity is examining the phases of the RF signals, however little insight
is obtained from the phase plots in Figure 3-38.

(DSB-SC) modulation.

                     3.10.4 QAM Digital Modulation

                         The QPSK digital modulator considered in the previous section had only
                         four states. This is a consequence of the digital baseband bitstreams, Ik
                         and Qk, being used one bit at a time. If two or more bits are used at a
                         time to address a constellation point, more data can be sent in the same
                         RF bandwidth. Modulation that does this is called higher-order digital
                         modulation. A higher-order quadrature modulator is shown in Figure 3-39
                         where now groups of two or more Ik bits and Qk bits can be encoded as an
                         analog signal. That is, if there are four possible values of i(t) at the clock ticks,
                         then pairs of Ik bits are encoded as one of four analog values. Such as the Ik

01 being encoded as - 13 V, 10 being encoded as + 13 V, and 11 being encoded
as +1 V. Qk would be encoded the same way. This results in 16 possible
states and this is called 16-QAM modulation. Operation of this quadrature
modulator will be analyzed in the next section in the context of a complete
SDR transmitter.

3.10.5 SDR Transmitter Using QAM Digital Modulation

This section describes a 16-QAM modulator as used in modern communi-

cations systems (4G and 5G). This reflects the capabilities of baseband DSPs

which can perform many of the modulation operations. The architecture of

a QAM quadrature-modulator is depicted in block diagram form in Figure

3-40. This modulator consists of two quadrature modulators, a DSP-based

digital IF quadrature modulator on the left, and an analog RF quadrature

modulator on the right. The digital IF quadrature modulator on the left is a

DSB-SC quadrature modulator taking an input bitstream and partitioning it

by converting from a serial input bit stream, Sk, into two parallel but inde-

pendent bitstreams, Ik and Qk. The output of the IF quadrature modulator,

sIF(t), is a DSB-SC IF signal centered at the IF carrier frequency fc,IF. This is

then modulated by the analog RF quadrature modulator to create a SSB-SC

RF signal which has the IF signal, sIF(t), as its modulating signal. The RF

signal however retains the double sidebands of the IF signal so that s(t) is a

DSB-SC signal with carrier frequency fc = fLO - fc,IF.

The 16-QAM system has the parameters given in Table 3-1. Since pairs

of Ik bits and pairs of Qk bits are used to encode the baseband analog

signals  i    and  q    there  are  16  possible  states  and  16-QAM  modulation

     Figure 3-41(a) with the bit-wise addresses of the constellation points. There

     are 16 constellation points each of which indicates a symbol which provides

     four bits of information. In the case of QAM modulation the constellation

     diagram corresponds to a phasor diagram with each constellation point

     indicating the amplitude and phase of the RF signal at a point in time. The

     difference between the constellation diagram and a phasor diagram is that

     the constellation diagram does not change when the average power of the

     RF signal changes. Thus the constellation diagram of QAM corresponds to a

     phasor diagram that is continuously being re-normalized to the average RF

     power.

     The table in Figure 3-41(b) shows the encoding that enables pairs of Ik

     bits and pairs of Qk bits to address a symbol in the constellation diagram.

     That is, each of these bitstreams is encoded so that two bits are encoded as

     one analog value. Figure 3-42(a) shows the bits in the input bitstream, Sk,

     which are in groups of four bits with the first and third bits of the group

     becoming I bits and the second and fourth bits in the group becoming Q

     bits. The Ik and Qk bitstreams are shown in Figures 3-42(b) and 3-42(c)

     respectively.           A          pair  of  Ik  (Qk)  bits  yields  an  encoded    i    (qB B)  value  every

The baseband values are actually discrete samples. With an oversampling

factor  of  8,  the  i    samples,  the  interpolated  encoded  values,  are  as  shown    in

transmitter baseband filtering is a raised cosine filter implemented digitally

as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter.

The     interpolated      encoded   samples  i    and  q       are  filtered  digitally  using

                                              BB        BB

a finite impulse response (FIR) filter yielding the filtered samples iBB and

qBB shown in Figures 3-43(c and e) respectively. The raised-cosine FIR filter

has a span of 4 symbols (i.e. 0.4 µs) and since the oversampling factor is

8 the FIR filter's response is 33 samples long, see Figure 3-43(a). (With the

0th and 33rd bins being zero, it could be said to be 31 or 32 samples long.)

(Specification of the raised cosine filter filter is completed with a roll-off

factor of 0.7 which describes how quickly the impulse response rolls-off

around its peak response.) The peak response of the filter is at the 16th

sample, after 0.2 µs, and the impulse responses at 0 (-0.2 µs), 8 (-0.1 µs),

24 (0.1 µs), and 32 (0.2 µs) samples are zero. Thus the FIR filter introduces a

0.2 µs delay. There are other types of FIR filters including two-dimensional

FIR filters that operate on the I and Q channels together and can provide

even better management of the bandwidth of the modulated IF signal.

The next stage in the transmitter is multiplying iBB by the IF LO having

                         results in the modulated IF signal, sIF, shown in Figure 3-44(a).

                            The procedure of producing a SSB-SC modulated RF signal from the IF
                         signal is to drive the multipliers in the RF quadrature modulator of the
                         second mixing stage with an in-phase IF signal and its quadrature, i.e. 90
                         phase-shifted version. In this case every frequency component of sIF must
                         be phase shifted by 90. The mathematical procedure that does this is the
                         Hilbert transform operating on a finite number of samples of sIF and here
                         8192 symbols with an oversampling factor of 8 were considered so that the
                         Hilbert transform operates on 65,536 samples. In DSP an FFT can be used
                         so that an FFT of sIF yields the amplitude and phase of discrete frequency
                         components of sIF and then the individual frequency samples are phase-
                         shifted by 90. Then an inverse FFT yields the required Hilbert transform in
                         the time domain. A DAC then converts the digital samples into the analog
                         signals i(t) and q(t). Their waveforms are shown in Figures 3-44(a and b).

time step is 31.25 ps. The RF signal spectrum was calculated using a 222 point FFT.

Then these signals are quadrature modulated using an RF LO of 1 GHz
yielding the RF waveform shown in Figure 3-44(c). The SSB-SC RF analog
modulator has translated the DSB-SC IF signal to RF to produce a DSB-SC
RF signal. Plots of i(t), q(t) and s(t) over a longer time are shown in Figure

   The spectra of the IF and RF signals are shown in Figure 3-46. It is seen
that the bandwidth of the IF modulated signal is just under 20 MHz and
the bandwidth of the RF signal is the same. The carrier of the IF signal is
10 MHz, the center of the DSB-SC modulated IF. The RF signal is centered
around 990 MHz and this is the carrier frequency of the radio signal. That

in the absence of noise and circuit non-idealities.
   The transmitter described here has two modulation stages. The IF
quadrature modulator modulates the baseband signal as a DSB-SC IF signal
with a bandwidth of around 20 MHz on a 10 MHz carrier. The second stage,
the RF quadrature modulator, takes the IF waveform and SSB-SC modulates
it on a 990 MHz carrier and maintains the IF bandwidth. The relationship
between the IF and RF waveforms is easier to see by viewing the waveforms
over a 5 µs span corresponding to 50 cycles of the 10 MHz IF carrier and
approximately 5000 cycles of the RF LO (and 5051 cycles of the RF carrier),
see Figure 3-48.

     Summary

     The SDR transmitter involves many technologies. This interplay was
     best demonstrated using the specific parameters of the SDR transmitter
     considered in this section. The main limitation is on the bandwidth of the
     IF modulated signal as this relates directly to the performance of the DSP
     unit which in turn impacts battery drain. The advantages of implementing a
     first stage using DSP are tremendous and nearly any modulation scheme can
     be supported simply by changing the parameters in the DSP unit. The analog
     RF unit can support very wide bandwidths as fixed frequency filters are not
     needed. The most critical performance parameter is balancing the I and Q
     paths through the entire transmitter chain. With most of the modulation
     occurring in the DSP unit, balancing of the digital portions of the I and Q
     paths is achieved precisely. The challenge then falls to balancing the I and Q
     paths in the analog RF modulator.

     3.11 SDR Quadrature Demodulator

     The SDR circuit used to demodulate an I/Q modulated RF signal is very
     similar to the standard quadrature demodulator. Complete demodulation
     and separation of the I channel and the Q channel is obtained when the LO of
     the demodulator coincides with the RF carrier frequency, see Figure 3-49(a).
     If the LO is not equal to the carrier frequency the RF modulated signal will be
     down-converted to an intermediate frequency signal which corresponds to a
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                          121

band around the difference frequency of the carrier and the LO, and a band
around the sum frequency of the carrier and the LO, see Figure 3-49(a). Then
lowpass filtering would be used to eliminate the higher frequency band. The
signal centered at the intermediate frequency can then be I/Q demodulated
by another quadrature demodulator.

3.12 SDR Receiver

An SDR receiver implements the demodulation shown in Figure 3-49(a) in
two stages with analog RF quadrature demodulation in the first stage similar
to that shown in Figure 3-49(b). There is a lot of detail in this section but this
is required to understand the implementation of an SDR receiver at the level
of design.

   The block diagram of a particular implementation of an SDR receiver
is shown in Figure 3-50 which has a first stage in the analog domain
implemented in an RF modem chip, and a second digital stage that is
implements DSP in the baseband chip. While these are separate chips at the
time of this writing they will probably be combined in a single chip someday.

   The analog portion of the SDR receiver is shown in Figure 3-50. This first
stage separates the I and Q channels and outputs baseband frequency signals
that are sampled and input to a second stage of quadrature demodulation
to produce the final baseband signals. This second stage is implemented
digitally. The signals at the output of the first analog stage are also called
intermediate frequencies. Digital demodulation, on the right in Figure 3-50,
is performed in a DSP unit commonly referred to as a baseband modem chip.
A key attribute is that the LO frequency of the first demodulation stage,
fLO can be set at relatively few discrete values while the LO in the second
stage, fLO,IF is set finely for full carrier recovery. Together fLO + fLO,IF = fc,
the frequency of the carrier of the received signal s(t). The DSP unit can
implement decoding such as CDMA- or OFDM-decoding.

   The rest of this section traces the signal flow through the SDR receiver. The
signal presented to the demodulator is GLs(t) where s(t) is the transmitted

     of interference, s(t) is the transmitted radio signal.

     3.12.1 Demodulation of the I component

     If the transmitted signal is the DSB-SC signal s(t) with carrier fc in
     Equationver (3.13) (replacing LO by fc) then the signal presented to the
     demodulator in the receiver is GLs(t) where GL, which will be very small,
     is the link gain accounting for loss in transmission and receiver gain. The
     spectrum of the received DSB-SC signal, GLs(t), is shown on the bottom left
     of Figure 3-50 with the carrier frequency fc identified by the dash arrow. The
     LO frequency of the first demodulator at fLO is also shown. The in-phase
     component of the demodulated signal after the first quadrature demodulator
     is, see Figure 3-50,

     iIF(t) = GLs(t) sin(LOt)

     =       1  [Ai(fi) cos(c              -   i)t        +     Aq(fq) sin(c     -   q )t
             2

             - Ai(fi) cos(c + i)t - Aq(fq) sin(c + q)t] sin(LOt)

     =       1  [Ai(fi) sin(c              +   LO         -     i)t    -  Ai(fi) sin(c     -  LO  -  i)t
             2

             + Aq(fq) cos(c - LO - q)t - Aq(fq) cos(c + LO - q)t

             - Ai(fi) sin(c + LO + i)t + Ai(fi) sin(c - LO + i)t

             -Aq(fq) cos(c - LO + q)t + Aq(fq) cos(c + LO + q)t] .                                         (3.15)

        Equation (3.15) includes intermediate frequency terms centered at c-LO
     and high frequency terms centered at c + LO. These high frequency terms
     can be eliminated through lowpass filtering leaving the lowpass filtered
     received signal

     iIF(t)  =  1  [-Ai(fi) sin(c                  -      LO     -     i)t  +  Aq(fq) cos(c    -  LO    -  q )t
                2

                + Ai(fi) sin(c - LO + i)t - Aq(fq) cos(c - LO + q)t]

             =  1  Ai  (f  i  )  [-     s  in(  c  -      LO     -     i)t  +  sin(c    -  LO  +  i)t]
                2

                + 12 Aq(fq) [cos(c - LO - q)t - cos(c - LO + q)t]

             =  1  Ai  (f  i  )  [s  i  n(  i  -   c         +  LO)t +        sin(i  +  c  -  LO)t]
                2

                + 12 Aq(fq) [cos(q - c + LO)t - cos(q + c - LO)t]                                          (3.16)

     and this is a DSB-SC signal with a carrier frequency fc - fLO. The location
     of iIF is shown in Figure 3-50 and its spectrum is the middle spectrum at the
     bottom of the figure. Of course Equation (3.16) is a discrete signal and the
     spectrum shows a finite bandwidth signal describing iIF(t) over the range of
     fi components. (That is, the linear sum of iIF(t) in Equation (3.16) for all fi
     components.)

     Single Stage Demodulation with fLO = fc

     The IF signal, iIF(t) is then mixed with the IF LO with radian frequency
     LO,IFt = ct - LOt + i producing the recovered I channel baseband signal

                iBB(t)        =      1  Ai  (f  i  )  [s  i  n(  i  t  +  i)  +  sin(it  -  i)}
                                     2

                                     + 12 Aq(fq) [cos(qt + i) - cos(qt - i)] .                             (3.17)
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                                     123

Then if i = 0, which is when the phase of the signal at fLO,IF has been
recovered correctly, the demodulated baseband signal for the I channel is

                               iBB(t) = Ai(fi) sin(it).                                (3.18)

Two stage demodulation fLO < fc

In an SDR demodulator there is two-stage demodulation with an analog
stage followed by a digital stage and this is what is shown in Figure 3-50.
The analog stage, producing iIF(t) in Equation (3.16), is in a chip commonly
referred to as the RF modem chip. The second stage is usually in a separate
chip called the baseband processing chip. One implementation of an SDR
receiver uses an analog LO adjusted in discrete frequency steps and, with
fLO < fc the resulting down-converted signal iIF(t) is a DSB-SC signal with
a carrier at fc - fLO, see the middle spectrum at the bottom of Figure 3-50.
A second stage of quadrature demodulation operates on iIF. The iIF signal is
sometimes called the baseband signal if the focus is on the RF modem chip.

   The intermediate signal iIF(t) in Equation (3.17) is mixed with an IF carrier
signal at frequency fLO,IF as follows

iBB(t) =     1  Ai(fi)   [sin(i    -       c  +    LO)t  +   sin(i  +  c  -  LO)t]
             2

          + 12 Aq(fq) [cos(q - c + LO)t - cos(q + c - LO)t]}

          × cos(LO,IF)t.                                                               (3.19)

The spectrum of this signal is shown in the bottom right of Figure 3-50 as the

spectrum immediately adjacent to DC.
   The intermediate LO frequency fLO,IF can be set with fine adjustment so

that fLO,IF = fc - fLO which produces a baseband signal iBB(t). Carrier
recovery then becomes the process of determining the phase-synchronized
fLO,IF which is just fc frequency offset by the numerical value of fLO. (Note
that c - LO - LO,IF = 0, -c + LO + LO,IF = 0 , c - LO + LO,IF =
2LO,IF, and -c + LO - LO,IF = -2c,IF. The I channel baseband signal

is then

iBB(t) = iIF(t) cos(LO,IFt)

= GL             1  Ai(fi)         [sin(i  -  c    +  LO)t   +  sin(i  +  c  -  LO)t]
                 2

          + 21 Aq(fq) [cos(q - c + LO)t - cos(q + c - LO)t]

          × cos(LO,IFt)

=         1  GL  Ai  (f  i  )  [s  in(  i  +  0)t  +  sin(i  -  2LO,IF)t
          2

          + sin(i + 2LO,IF)t + sin(i + 0)t]

          + 12 GLAq(fq) [+ cos(q - 2LO,IF)t + cos(q + 0)t

          - cos(q + 0)t - cos(q + 2LO,IF)t] .                                          (3.20)

After lowpass filtering (in the DSP) to eliminate components centered at
±2LO,IF

                            iBB(t) = GLAi(fi) sin(it)                                  (3.21)

This is the final desired signal and its spectrum is shown as the inset on the
middle right of Figure 3-50 (between the two decoders). This analysis has
124                STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     been undertaken with a single tone for the I channel but by extension this
     holds for the actual I channel signal. Sampling iBB(t) at the clock ticks yields
     the sequence of symbols that were transmitted which after decoding yields
     the bitstream Ik.

     3.12.2 Demodulation of the Q component

     Demodulation of the Q channel proceeds similarly. The quadrature-phase
     component is demodulated in a similar way except that the phase of the LO
     signals differ by 90. If the transmitted signal is the DSB-SC signal s(t) with
     carrier fc in Equation (3.13) (and replacing LO by fc) and with a receiver LO
     frequency fLO, the in-phase demodulated signal is

     qIF(t) = GLs(t) sin(LOt - /2)

     = -s(t) cos(LOt)

     =       -  1  [Ai(fi)       cos(c     -      i)t       +  Aq (fq )     sin(c   -    q )t
                2

             - Ai(fi) cos(c + i)t - Aq(fq) sin(c + q)t] cos(LOt)

     =       -  1  {Ai(fi)       cos(c     +         LO     -  i)t       +  Ai(fi)  cos(c      -  LO  -    i)t
                2

             + Aq(fq) sin(c - LO - q)t + Aq(fq) sin(c + LO - q)t

             - Ai(fi) cos(c + LO + i)t - Ai(fi) cos(c - LO + i)t

             -Aq(fq) sin(c - LO + q)t + Aq(fq) sin(c + LO + q)t.} (3.22)

     This includes intermediate frequency terms centered at c - LO and high
     frequency terms centered at c + LO. These high frequency terms can be
     eliminated through lowpass filtering leaving the lowpass filtered receiver
     signal

     qIF(t)  =  -  1  [Ai(fi)        cos(c           -  LO     -   i)t      +  Aq (fq )  sin(c    -  LO  -  q )t
                   2

                - Ai(fi) cos(c - LO + i)t - Aq(fq) sin(c - LO + q)t]

             =  1  Ai  (f  i  )  [-  c  o  s(  c     -  LO     -   i)t      +  cos(c     -  LO    +  i)t]
                2

                + 12 Aq(fq) [- sin(c - LO - q)t + sin(c - LO + q)t]

             =  1  Ai  (f  i  )  [-  c  o  s(  i  -     c   +  LO)t         +  cos(i     +  c  -  LO)t]
                2

                + 12 Aq(fq) [sin(q - c + LO)t + sin(q + c - LO)t] .                                             (3.23)

     Single-Stage Demodulation With fLO = fc

     If the LO frequency equals the carrier frequency but there is an offset of i so
     that LOt = ct + i, then the recovered baseband signal is

                qBB(t)        =  1   Ai    (f  i  )  [-  c  o  s(  i  t  +  i)  +  cos(it   -  i)}
                                 2

                                 + 12 Aq(fq) {sin(qt + i) + sin(qt - i)] .                                      (3.24)

     Then if i = 0 the demodulated baseband signal for the I channel is

                                           qB B(t) = Aq(fq) sin(qt)                                             (3.25)
TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS                                                                    125

Two stage demodulation fLO < fc

When qIF(t) in Equation (3.17) is mixed with an IF LO signal at frequency
fLO,IF the resulting signal is

qB B(t) =  1  Ai(fi)      [sin(i         -      c  +  LO)t  +  sin(i  +  c  -  LO)t]
           2

           + 12 Aq(fq) [cos(q - c + LO)t - cos(q + c - LO)t]}

           × cos(LO,IF)t.                                                             (3.26)

   The intermediate LO frequency fLO,IF can be set with fine adjustment so
that fLO,IF = fc - fLO which produces a baseband signal qBB(t). (Note that
c - LO - LO,IF = 0, -c + LO + LO,IF = 0 , c - LO + LO,IF = 2LO,IF,
and -c + LO - LO,IF = -2LO,IF. The Q channel baseband signal is then

qB B(t) = qIF(t) cos(LO,IFt)

= GL           1  Ai(fi)        [-    cos(i     -  c    +  LO)t   +  cos(i  +  c  -  LO)t]
               2

   + 21 Aq(fq) [sin(q - c + LO)t + sin(q + c - LO)t]

   × cos(LO,IFt)

=  1       GL  Ai  (f  i  )  [  -  c  o  s(  i  +  0)t  +  cos(i  -  2LO,IF)t
   2

   + cos(i + 2LO,IF)t + cos(i + 0)t]

   + 12 GLAq(fq) [sin(q - 2LO,IF)t + sin(q + 0)t

   - sin(q + +2LO,IF)t - cos(q + 0)t] .                                               (3.27)

After lowpass filtering (in the DSP) to eliminate components centered at
±2LO,IF

                          qBB(t) = GLAq(fq) cos(qt).                                  (3.28)

   This can be compared to the original quadrature signal which led to the
DSB-SC modulated signal s(t). The fq frequency component of q(t) was
Aqfq)sin(qt). Thus it is necessary to change the phase of qBB(t) to obtain
the original q(t) signal:

qBB(t) (phase shifted by 90 = GLAq(fq) cos(qt - /2)q(t)                               (3.29)
                                      = GLAq(fq) sin(qt)

and this can be implemented using a Hilbert transform just as was done in
the SDR transmitter.

3.13 SDR Summary

The software defined radio described in this chapter used two stages of
quadrature modulation in the SDR transmitter and two stages of quadrature
demodulation in the SDR receiver. Each of the quadrature modulators and
demodulators used ideal multipliers to multiply signals by an LO signal.
There are other ways of implementing quadrature de/modulators but the
principles of one stage of the quadrature modulator being implemented in
a baseband DSP unit and the final analog RF modulator being analog; and
one of the quadrature demodulator being analog and operating on the RF
signal and the second stage quadrature demodulator being implemented
in DSP operating on an intermediate frequency signal is essential to
implementations of SDR.

3.14 Summary

This chapter considered the architectures of transmitters and receivers and
in particular the implementation of modulators and demodulators. Since the
beginning of radio there has been a tremendous increase in the sophistication
of modulators and demodulators. The earliest AM demodulators required
just a single diode and now the demodulators in software defined radio use
hundreds of millions of transistors. Following early radios the discussion
tracked the development of modulators and demodulators for cellular
systems but the increasingly advanced techniques are used in other radio
and radar systems. The 1G systems used FM modulation to transmit voice
and simple FSK modulation to transmit limited digital data such as phone
such as channel information. The 2G and 3G systems were confined to
using just one or two types of modulation such four-state modulation. The
level of complexity increased tremendously with 4G where now it it was
essential to use software defined radio to support a very large number
of different modulation formats including mostly various orders of QAM
but also supporting legacy modulation formats. The 5G modulation and
demodulation schemes are the same as those used in 4G with the 5G
advances being in the move to millimeter-waves and beam steering. There
is another layer of modulation used in 3G (i.e. wideband CDMA) which
can layer multiple users in the same bandwidth. Strictly this is an access
scheme and will be considered in Chapter 5. The 4G systems uses orthogonal
frequency division modulation (OFDM) modulation. That is not considered
here as it is a hybrid of an access scheme and a modulation scheme. It too
will be considered in Chapter 5.

4.1 Introduction

An antenna interfaces circuits with free-space with a transmit antenna
converting a guided wave signal on a transmission line to an electromagnetic
(EM) wave propagating in free space, while a receive antenna is a transducer
that converts a free-space EM wave to a guided wave on a transmission
line and eventually to a receiver circuit. Together the transmit and receive
antennas are part of the RF link. The RF link is the path between the
output of the transmitter circuit and the input of the receiver circuit (see
Figure 4-1). Usually this path includes the cable from the transmitter to
the transmit antenna, the transmit antenna itself, the propagation path, the
receive antenna, and the transmission line connecting the receive antenna to
the receiver circuit. The received signal is much smaller than the transmitted
signal. The overwhelming majority of the loss is from the propagation path
as the EM signal spreads out, and usually diffracts, reflects, and is partially
blocked by objects such as hills and buildings.

   The first half of this chapter is concerned with the properties of antennas.
One of the characteristics of antennas is that the energy can be focused in
a particular direction, a phenomenon captured by the concept of antenna
gain, which can partially compensate for path loss. The second half of this
chapter considers modeling the RF link and the geographical arrangement
of antennas that manage interference from other radios while providing
support for as many users as possible.

EXAMPLE 4.1 Interference

     In the figure there are two transmitters, Tx1 and Tx2, operating
     at the same power level, and one receiver, Rx. Tx1 is an
     intentional transmitter and its signal is intended to be received
     at Rx. Tx1 is separated from Rx by D1 = 2 km. Tx2 uses the
     same frequency channel as Tx1, and as far as RX is concerned
     it transmits an interfering signal. Assume that the antennas are
     omnidirectional (i.e., they transmit and receive signals equally
     in all directions) and that the transmitted power density drops
     off as 1/d2, where d is the distance from the transmitter.
     Calculate the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at Rx.

     Solution:

     D1 = 2 km and D2 = 4 km.

     P1 is the signal power transmitted by Tx1 and received at Rx.

     P2 is the interference power transmitted by Tx2 and received at Rx.

     So SIR = P1 =    D2 2 = 4 = 6.02 dB.

                4.2 RF Antennas

                Antennas are of two fundamental types: resonant and traveling-wave
                antennas, see Figure 4-2. Resonant antennas establish a standing wave
                of current with required resonance usually established when the antenna
                section is either a quarter- or half-wavelength long. These antennas are
                also known as standing-wave antennas. Resonant antennas are inherently
                narrowband because of the resonance required to establish a large standing
                wave of current. Figures 4-2(a and b) show two representative resonant
                antennas. The physics of the operation of a resonant antenna is understood
                by considering the time domain. First consider the physical operation of a
                transmit antenna. When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the conductor
ANTENNAS AND THE RF LINK                                                           131

                                                           field point P is r.

of an antenna, charges, i.e. free electrons, accelerate or decelerate under the
influence of an applied voltage source which typically arrives at the antenna
from a traveling wave voltage on a transmission line. When the charges
accelerate (or decelerate) they produce an EM field which radiates away from
the antenna. At a point on the antenna there is a current sinusoidally varying
in time, and the net acceleration of the charges (in charge per second per
second) is also sinusoidal with an amplitude that is directly proportional to
the amplitude of the current sinewave. Hence having a large standing wave
of current, when the antenna resonates sinusoidally, results in a large charge
acceleration and hence large radiated fields.

   When an EM field impinges upon a conductor the field causes charges to
accelerate and hence induce a voltage that propagates on a transmission line
connected to the receive antenna. Traveling-wave antennas, an example of
one is shown in Figures 4-2(c), operate as extended lines that gradually flare
out so that a traveling wave on the original transmission line transitions into
free space. Traveling-wave antennas tend to be two or more wavelengths
long at the lowest frequency of operation. While relatively long, they are
broadband, many 3 or more octaves wide (e.g., extending from 500 MHz
to 4 GHz or more). These antennas are sometimes referred to as aperture
antennas.

4.3 Resonant Antennas

With a resonant antenna the current on the antenna is directly related to
the amplitude of the radiated EM field. Resonance ensures that the standing
wave current on the antenna is high.

4.3.1 Radiation from a Current Filament

The fields radiated by a resonant antenna are most conveniently calculated
by considering the distribution of current on the antenna. The analysis begins
by considering a short filament of current, see Figure 4-3(a). Considering the
sinusoidal steady state at radian frequency , the current on the filament
with phase  is I(t) = |I0| cos(t + ), so that I0 = |I0|e- is the phasor of
the current on the filament. The length of the filament is h, but it has no other
132     STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     dimensions, that is, it is considered to be infinitely thin.
        Resonant antennas are conveniently modeled as being made up of an array

     of current filaments with spacings and lengths being a tiny fraction of a
     wavelength. Wire antennas are even simpler and can be considered to be
     a line of current filaments. Ramo, Whinnery, and Van Duzer [1] calculated
     the spherical EM fields at the point P with the spherical coordinates (, , r)
     generated by the z-directed current filament centered at the origin in Figure
     4-3. The total EM field components in phasor form are

     H = I0h e-kr   k 1               sin ,  H¯ = H^             (4.1)

     where  is the free-space characteristic impedance, 0 is the permittivity of
     free space, and µ0 is the permeability of free space. The variable k is called
     the wavenumber and k = 2/ = µ00. The e-kr terms describe the

     variation of the phase of the field as the field propagates away from the
     filament. Equations (4.1)-(4.3) are the complete fields with the 1/r2 and 1/r3

     dependence describing the near-field components. In the far field, i.e. large
     r  , the components with 1/r2 and 1/r3 dependence become negligible

     and the field components left are the propagating components H and E:

     H = I0h e-kr k sin , Er = 0, and E = I0h e-kr µ0 sin .

        Now consider the fields in the plane normal to the filament, that is, with
      = /2 radians so that sin  = 1. The fields are now

        H = I0h e-kr k                and E = I0h e-kr µ0        (4.5)

        Note that the strength of the fields is directly proportional to the
     magnitude of the current. This proves to be very useful in understanding

     as expected. Thus an antenna can be viewed as having the inherent function
     of an impedance transformer converting from the lower characteristic
     impedance of a transmission line (often 50 ) to the 377  characteristic
     impedance of free space. Further comments can be made about the
     propagating fields (Equation (4.4)). The EM field propagates in all directions
ANTENNAS AND THE RF LINK                                                          133

except not directly in line with the filament. For fixed r, the amplitude of the
propagating field increases sinusoidally with respect to  until it is maximum

in the direction normal to the filament.
   The power radiated is obtained using the Poynting vector, which is the

cross-product of the propagating electric and magnetic fields. From this the
time-average propagating power density is (with the SI units of W/m2)

and the power density is proportional to 1/r2. In Equation (4.8) (· · · )
indicates that the real part is taken.

4.3.2 Finite-Length Wire Antennas

The EM wave launched by a wire antenna of finite length is obtained by
considering the wire as being made up of many filaments and the field is then
the superposition of the fields from each filament. As an example, consider
the antenna in Figure 4-3(b) where the wire is half a wavelength long. As
a good approximation the current on the wire is a standing wave and the
current on the wire is in phase so that the current phasor is

                I(z) = I0 cos(kz).                        (4.9)

From Equation (4.4) and referring to Figure 4-3 the fields in the far field are

        H =   /4 I0 cos(kz) e-kr   r k sin  dz            (4.10)
        E =  -/4 4                 r µ0 sin  dz,          (4.11)
              /4 I0 cos(kz) e-kr
             -/4 4

where  is the angle from the filament to the point P . Now k = 2/ and at
the ends of the wire z = ±/4 where cos(kz) = cos(±/2) = 0. Evaluating
the equations is analytically involved and will not be done here. The net
result is that the fields are further concentrated in the plane normal to the
wire. At large r, of at least several wavelengths distant from the antenna,
only the field components decreasing as 1/r are significant. At large r the
phase differences of the contributions from the filaments is significant and
results in shaping of the fields. The geometry to be used in calculating the
far field is shown in Figure 4-4(a). The phase contribution of each filament,
relative to that at z = 0, is (kz sin )/ and Equations (4.10) and (4.11) become

H = I0   k   sin() e-kr    /4 sin(kz) sin(z sin())dz      (4.12)
E = I0  4r   sin() e-kr   -/4 4                           (4.13)

   Figure 4-4(b) is a plot of the near-field electric field in the y-z plane
calculating Er and E (recall that E = 0) every 90. Further from the
antenna the Er component rapidly reduces in size, and E dominates.

   A summary of the implications of the above equations are, first, that the

strength of the radiated electric and magnetic fields are proportional to the
134                               STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

                 current on the wire antenna. So establishing a standing current wave and
                 hence magnifying the current is important to the efficiency of a wire antenna.
                 A second result is that the power density of freely propagating EM fields in
                 the far field is proportional to 1/r2, where r is the distance from the antenna.
                 A third interpretation is that the longer the antenna, the flatter the radiated
                 transmission profile; that is, the radiated energy is more tightly confined to
                 the x-y (i.e.  = 0) plane. For the wire antenna the peak radiated field is
                 in the plane normal to the antenna, and thus the wire antenna is generally
                 oriented vertically so that transmission is in the plane of the earth and power
                 is not radiated unnecessarily into the ground or into the sky.

                    To obtain an efficient resonant antenna, all of the current should be pointed
                 in the same direction at a particular time. One way of achieving this is to
                 establish a standing wave, as shown in Figure 4-5(a) At the open-circuited
                 end, the current reflects so that the total current at the end of the wire is
                 zero. The initial and reflected current waves combine to create a standing
                 wave. Provided that the antenna is sufficiently short, all of the total current--
                 the standing wave--is pointed in the same direction. The optimum length is
                 about a half wavelength. If the wire is longer, the contributions to the field
                 from the oppositely directed current segments cancel (see Figure 4-5(b)).

                    In Figure 4-5(a) a coaxial cable is attached to the monopole antenna below
                 the ground plane and often a series capacitor between the cable and the
                 antenna provides a low level of coupling leading to a larger standing wave.
                 The capacitor also approximately matches the characteristic impedance of
                 the cable to the input impedance Zin of the antenna. If the length of the
                 monopole is reduced to one-quarter wavelength long it is again resonant,
                 and the input impedance, Zin, is found to be 36 . Then a 50  cable can

be directly connected to the antenna and there is only a small mismatch and
nearly all the power is transferred to the antenna and then radiated.

   Another variation on the monopole is shown in Figure 4-6, where the key
component is the phasing coil. The phasing coil (with a wire length of /2)
rotates the electrical angle of the current phasor on the line so that the current
on the /4 segment is in the same direction as on the /2 segment. The result
is that the two straight segments of the loaded monopole radiate a more
tightly confined EM field. The phasing coil itself does not radiate (much).

   Another ingenious solution to obtaining a longer effective wire antenna
with same-directed current (and hence a more tightly confined RF beam) is
the stacked dipole antenna (Figure 4-7). The basis of the antenna is a dipole
as shown in Figure 4-7(a). The cable has two conductors that have equal
amplitude currents, I, but flowing as shown. The wire section is coupled to
the cable so that the currents on the two conductors realize a single effective
current Idipole on the dipole antenna. The stacked dipole shown in Figure
4-7(b) takes this geometric arrangement further. Now the radiating element
is hollow and a coaxial cable is passed through the antenna elements and
the half-wavelength sections are fed separately to effectively create a wire
antenna that is several wavelengths long with the current pointing in one
direction. Most cellular antennas using wire antennas are stacked dipole
antennas.

     Summary

     Standing waves of current can be realized by resonant structures other than
     wires. A microstrip patch antenna, see Figure 4-2(b), is an example, but
     the underlying principle is that an array of current filaments generates EM
     components that combine to create a propagating field. Resonant antennas
     are inherently narrowband because of the reliance on the establishment of a
     standing wave. A relative bandwidth of 5%-10% is typical.

     4.4 Traveling-Wave Antennas

     Traveling-wave antennas have the characteristics of broad bandwidth and
     large size. These antennas begin as a transmission line structure that flares
     out slowly, providing a low reflection transition from a transmission line to
     free space. The bandwidth can be very large and is primarily dependent on
     how gradual the transition is.

        One of the more interesting traveling-wave antennas is the Vivaldi
     antenna of Figure 4-8(a). The Vivaldi antenna is an extension of a slotline
     in which the fields are confined in the space between two metal sheets in
     the same plane. The slotline spacing increases gradually in an exponential
     manner, much like that of a Vivaldi violin (from which it gets its name), over
     a distance of a wavelength or more. A circuit model is shown in Figures 4-8(b
     and c) where the antenna is modeled as a cascade of many transmission lines
     of slowly increasing characteristic impedance, Z0. Since the Z0 progression
     is gradual there are low-level reflections at the transmission line interfaces.
     The forward-traveling wave on the antenna continues to propagate with
     a negligible reflected field. Eventually the slot opens sufficiently that the
     effective impedance of the slot is that of free space and the traveling wave
     continues to propagate in air.

        The other traveling-wave antennas work similarly and all are at least a
     wavelength long, with the central concept being a gradual taper from the

The final aperture is at least one-half wavelength across so that the fields can
curl on themselves (i.e., loop back on themselves) and are self-supporting as
they leave the antenna.

4.5 Antenna Parameters

This section introduces a number of antenna metrics that are used to
characterize antenna performance.

4.5.1 Radiation Density and Radiation Intensity

Antennas do not radiate equally in all directions concentrating radiated
power in (usually) one direction called the main (or major) lobe of the
antenna. This focusing effect is called directivity. The power in a particular
direction is characterized by the radiation density and the radiation intensity
metrics. The radiation density, Sr, is the power per unit area with the SI units
of W/m2, and will be maximum in the main lobe. Referring to Figure 4-9
with an antenna located at the center of the sphere of radius r and radiating
a total power Pr, Sr is the incremental radiated power dPr passing through
the incremental shaded region of area, dA:

                   Sr = dPr .                    (4.14)
                           dA

Sr reduces with distance falling of as 1/r2 in free space. For a practical
antenna Sr will vary across the surface of the sphere. The total power
radiated is the closed integral over the surface S of the sphere:

                   Pr = dPr = SrdA.              (4.15)

                   S      S

   An alternative measure of power concentration is the radiation intensity U

which is in terms of the incremental solid angle d subtended by dA so that
d = dA/r2 and (with the SI units of W/steradian or W/sr)

                   U = dPr = dPr r2 = r2Sr.      (4.16)
                          d dA

Isotropic Antenna

It is useful to reference the directivity of an antenna with respect to a fictitious
isotropic antenna that has no loss and radiates equally in all directions so
138  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     that Sr is only a function of r. Then integrating over the surface of the sphere
     yields the total radiated power

     Pr|Isotropic = dPr = SrdA = Sr dA = Sr4r2 = 4U.          (4.17)

     S                      S  S

     Since the isotropic antenna has no loss the power input to the antenna PIN is
     equal to the power radiated Pr = PIN. Thus for an isotropic antenna

     Sr = 4r2 Pr = 4r2 PIN  (4.18) and U |Isotropic = r2Sr = 4r2 PIN . (4.19)

     Antenna Efficiency

     Antenna efficiency, sometimes called the radiation efficiency, describes
     losses in an antenna principally due to resistive (I2R) losses. Resonant

     antennas work by creating a large current that is maximized through the

     generation of a standing wave at resonance. There is a lot of current, and
     even just a little resistance results in substantial resistive loss. The power that

     is reflected from the input of the antenna is usually small. The total radiated
     power (in all directions), Pr, is the power input to the antenna less losses.
     The antenna efficiency, A is therefore defined as

                               A = Pr/PIN,                    (4.20)

     where PIN is the power input to the antenna and A < 1 and usually
     expressed as a percentage. Antenna efficiency is very close to one for many
     antennas, but can be 50% for microstrip patch antennas.

        Antenna loss refers to the same mechanism that gives rise to antenna
     efficiency. Thus an antenna with an antenna efficiency of 50% has an antenna
     loss of 3 dB. Generally losses are resistive due to I2R loss and mismatch loss
     of the antenna that occurs when the input impedance is not matched to the
     impedance of the cable connected to the antenna. Because of confusion with
     antenna gain (they are not the opposite of each other) the use of the term
     `antenna loss' is discouraged and instead `antenna efficiency' preferred.

     4.5.2 Directivity and Antenna Gain

     The directivity of an antenna, D, is the ratio of the radiated power density to
     that of an isotropic antenna with the same total radiated power, Pr:

                            D = Sr = U                        (4.21)
                                   Sr|Isotropic U |Isotropic

     where Sr and U refer to the actual antenna and the power densities and
     intensities are measured at the same distance from the antennas. For an
     actual antenna D is dependent on the direction from the antenna, see Figure
     4-10. The maximum value of D will be in the direction of the main lobe of
     the antenna and this is called directivity gain.

        The focusing property of an antenna is characterized by comparing the
     radiated power density to that of an isotropic antenna with the same input
     power. The antenna gain, GA, is the maximum value of D when the power
     input PIN = Pr/A to the antenna and the isotropic antenna are the same:

                            GA = Amax(D).                     (4.22)

Losses in the antenna are accounted for by the efficiency term A.
   In Equation (4.22) GA is a gain factor and is often expressed in terms of

decibels (taking 10 times the log of GA) but dBi (with `i' standing for with-
respect-to isotropic) is used to indicate that it is not a power gain in the
same sense as amplifier gain. GA instead is the ratio of power densities for
two different antennas. For example, an antenna that focuses power in one
direction increasing the peak radiated power density by a factor of 20 relative
to that of an isotropic antenna has an antenna gain of 13 dBi. With care GA
can be often used in calculations of power as as with amplifier gain.

   Since it is almost impossible to calculate internal antenna losses, antenna
gain is invariably only measured. The input power to an antenna can be
measured and the peak radiated power density, PD|Maximum, measured in
the far field at several wavelengths distant (at r  ). This is compared to
the power density from an ideal isotropic antenna at the same distance with
the same input power. Antenna gain is determined from

GA =                 Maximum radiated power per unit area

      PIN                                      PIN

The antenna gains of common resonant and traveling-wave antennas are
given in Table 4-1. In free space the antenna gain determined using Equation
(4.22) is independent of distance. Antenna gain is measured on an antenna
range using a calibrated receive antenna and care taken to avoid reflections
from objects, especially from the ground.

   The losses of an antenna are incorporated in the antenna gain which is
defined in terms of the power input to the antenna, see Equation (4.24). Thus
in calculations of radiated power using antenna gain, there is no need to
separately account for resistive losses in the antenna.

   In summary, antennas concentrate the radiated power in one direction so
that the density of the power radiated in the direction of the peak field is
higher than the power density from an isotropic antenna. Power radiated
from a base station antenna, such as that shown in Figure 4-11, is concen-
trated in a region that looks like a toroid or, more closely, a balloon squashed
at its north and south poles. Then the antenna does not radiate much power
into space and will concentrate power in a region skimming the surface of

microstrip antenna.

                  the earth. Antenna gain is a measure of the effectiveness of an antenna to

                  concentrate power in one direction. Thus, in free space due to power spread-
                  ing out the maximum power density (in SI units of W/m2) at a distance r is

                                          PD = 4r2 GAPIN ,                                              (4.25)

                  where 4r2 is the area of a sphere of radius r and PIN is the input power.
                     Measurements of antenna gain are used to derive antenna efficiency. It is

                  impossible to measure or simulate the resistive and dielectric losses of an
                  antenna directly. Antenna efficiency is obtained using theoretical calculations
                  of antenna gain assuming no losses in the antenna itself. This is compared to
                  the measured antenna gain yielding the antenna efficiency.

EXAMPLE 4.2 Antenna Gain

     A base station antenna has an antenna gain, GA, of 11 dBi and a 40 W input. The transmitted
     power density falls off with distance d as 1/d2. What is the peak power density at 5 km?

     Solution:
     A sphere of radius 5 km has an area A = 4r2 = 3.142 · 108 m2; GA = 11 dBi = 12.6.
     In the direction of peak radiated power, the power density at 5 km is

                                  PD = PinGA A = 3.142 · 108m2 40 · 12.6 W = 1.603 µW/m2.

EXAMPLE 4.3 Antenna Efficiency

     A antenna has an antenna gain of 13 dBi and an antenna efficiency of 50% and all of the
     loss is due to resistive losses and resistance of metals is proportional to temperature. The RF
     signal input to the antenna has a power of 40 W.

     (a) What is the input power in dBm?

          Pin = 40 W = 46.02 dBm.
     (b) What is the total power transmitted in dBm?

                             PRadiated = 50% of PIN = 20 W or 43.01 dBm.
                             Alternatively, PRadiated = 46.02 dBm - 3 dB = 43.02 dBm.
     (c) If the antenna is cooled to near absolute zero so that it is lossless, what would the antenna
          gain be?

          The antenna gain would increase by 3 dB and antenna gain incorporates both directivity
          and antenna losses. So the gain of the cooled antenna is 16 dBi.
ANTENNAS AND THE RF LINK                                                                              141

4.5.3 Effective Isotropic Radiated Power

A transmit antenna does not radiate power equally in all directions and for
a receiver in the main lobe of the transmit antenna it is as though there is an
isotropic transmit antenna with a much higher input power. This concept is
incorporated in the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP):

EIRP = PINGA.                             (4.26)

This uses antenna gain to derive the total power that would be radiated by
an isotropic antenna producing the same (peak) power density as the actual
antenna. Regulatory limits on the power levels of transmitters are in terms
of EIRP rather than the total radiated power. Sometimes equivalent radiated
power (ERP) is used instead of EIRP with the same meaning.

4.5.4 Effective Aperture Size

Effective aperture size is defined so that the power density at a receive
antenna when multiplied by its effective aperture size, AR, yields the power
output from the antenna at its connector. Since antennas are linear and
reciprocal it is is to be expected that there is a relationship between effective
aperture size and antenna gain.

   An antenna has an effective size that is more than its actual physical
size. This is because of its influence on the EM fields around it. The power
captured by an antenna is the effective aperture size (or area) multiplied
by the transmitted power density. That is, the effective aperture size of an
antenna is the area of the surface that captures all of the power passing
through it and delivers this power to the output terminals of the antenna.

   The effective aperture area of a receive antenna, AR, is related to the receive
antenna gain, GR, as follows [2, 3] ((note that Ae is often used if it is not
necessary to distinguish antennas):

A G R = R2 ,                              (4.27)
          4

where  is the wavelength of the radio signal1. The effective aperture area of
an antenna can have little to do with its physical size; e.g., a wire antenna has
almost no physical size but has a significant effective aperture size.

   If Sr is the transmitted power density at the receive antenna, the power
received is

P G R = PDAR = PD R2 .                    (4.28)
                           4

1 The derivation of Equation (4.27) invokes a thought experiment with an antenna connected
  to a resistor in thermal equilibrium and each in separate thermally isolated chambers with
  black body walls [4, 5]. The available thermal (Johnson-Nyquist) noise power from the resistor
  is radiated by the antenna (incorporating antenna gain) and absorbed by the walls of the
  antenna's chamber. The same amount of power, as black body radiation from the walls of
  the antenna's chamber, must be received by the antenna (incorporating effective aperture size)
  and delivered to the resistor where it is dissipated as heat. At frequencies up to infrared and at
  room temperature (and hence at radio frequencies) the power density of black body radiation
  increases linearly with temperature and as the square of frequency (i.e. as 1/2) whereas
  Johnson-Nyquist noise is independent of frequency but increases linearly with temperature.
  The derivation is exact for an isotropic antenna and assumed to apply to all antennas.
142            STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     Here PR is the power delivered at the output connector of the receive
     antenna, as loss in the receive antenna is incorporated in GR and AR. The

     total power radiated by the transmit antenna in the direction of maximum

     power density is given by multiplying the power input to the transmit
     antenna, PT ,2 by the antenna gain of the transmit antenna, GT . This can be
     converted to the power density at a distance d (ignoring multipath effects),

                                               Sr = 4d2 PT GT ,            (4.29)
     and the power delivered by the receive antenna is

               PR = SrAR =  PT GT GR2   = PT GT GR                2        (4.30)
                                                                 4d .
                            24d 4

     That is,

                         PR = PT GT GR   2                                 (4.31)
                                        4d .

     This equation is known as the Friis transmission equation or the Friis
     transmission formula.

        Equation (4.31) provides a powerful tool for evaluating the power received
     in a communication system and modifications have been developed to
     account for impairments that are encountered. One of the assumptions in
     the development of Equation (4.31) is that the polarization of the receive
     antenna matches that of the transmitted signal. The transmit antenna will
     radiate a signal with an electric field with a particular polarization, i.e. E field
     orientation. Propagation through air has little effect on the polarization of a
     signal, although atmospheric conditions can rotate the polarization slightly.
     A polarization mismatch factor could be included in Equation (4.31). For
     ground-based communications, such as cellular communications, reflections
     and diffraction have a major impact on the power of the received signal and
     techniques for handling these effects are considered in the next section.

     4.5.5 Summary

EXAMPLE 4.4 Point-to-Point Communication

In a point-to-point communication system, a parabolic receive antenna has an antenna gain
of 60 dBi. If the signal is 60 GHz and the power density at the receive antenna is 1 pW/cm2,

what is the power at the output of the receive antenna connected to the RF electronics?

Solution:

The first step is determining the effective aperture area, AR, of the parabolic antenna. The
frequency is 60 GHz, and so the wavelength () is 5 mm. Also note that GR = 60 dBi = 106.

From Equation (4.27),

                       AR = GR2 = 106 · 0.0052 = 1.989 m2.                        (4.32)
                          4  4

Using Equation (4.28) PD = 1 pW/cm2 = 10 nW/m2, the total power delivered to the RF
receiver electronics (at the output of the receive antenna) is

           PR = PDAR = 10 nW · m-2 · 1.989 m2 = 19.89 nW.                         (4.33)

4.6 The RF Link

The RF link is between a transmit antenna and a receive antenna. Sometimes
the RF link includes the antenna and sometimes it does not, this will be
clear from the context, but usually it includes the antennas. The principle
source of link loss is the spreading out of the EM field as it propagates. In
the absence of any other effects (such as atmospheric loss and reflections),
the power density reduces as 1/d2, where d is distance, and this is called
the line-of-sight (LOS) situation. In this section the propagation path is first
described along with its impairments including propagation on multiple
paths between a transmit antenna and a receive antenna. The resonant
scattering is described as well as multiple fading effects due to reflections,
diffraction, rain, and other atmospheric effects.

4.6.1 Propagation Path

When the radiated signal reflects and diffracts there are multiple propagation
paths that result in what is called fading, as the paths constructively and
destructively combine at the receiver. The direct path and other paths, called
multipaths, which are reflected or diffracted by ground, buildings, and
other objects do not arrive at the receiver in phase leading to time-varying
constructive and destructive combining, called multipath interference. Of
these destructive combining is much worse as it can reduce a signal level
below what it would be if propagation was in free space. In urban areas,
10 or 20 paths can have significant power in them and these combine at the
receive antenna [6].

   When the signal on one of the paths dominates, this is usually the LOS
path, fading is called Rician fading. With LOS and a single ground reflection,
the situation is the classic Rician fading as shown in Figure 4-12(a). This
is a special situation, as the ground changes the phase of the signal upon
reflection, generally by 180. When the receiver is a long way from the base
station, the lengths of the two paths are almost identical and the level of
the signals in the two paths are almost the same. The net result is that these
two signals almost cancel, and so instead of the power falling off by 1/d2, it
144                               STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

              falls off by 1/d3. When there are many paths and all have similar amplitude
              signals, fading is called Rayleigh fading. In an urban area such as that shown
              in Figure 4-12(b), there are many significant multipaths and the power falls
              off by 1/d4 and sometimes faster.

                 Common paths encountered in cellular radio are shown in Figure 4-
              13. As a rough guide, in the single-digit gigahertz range each diffraction
              and scattering event reduces the signal received by 20 dB. The knife-edge
              diffraction scenario is shown in more detail in Figure 4-14. This case is
              fairly easy to analyze and can be used to estimate the effects of individual
              obstructions. The diffraction model is derived from the theory of half-infinite
              screen diffraction [7]. First, calculate the parameter  from the geometry of

Next, consult the plot in Figure 4-14(b) to obtain the diffraction loss (or
attenuation). This loss should be added (using decibels) to the otherwise
determined path loss to obtain the total path loss. Other losses such as
reflection cancellation still apply, but are computed independently for the
path sections before and after the obstruction.

4.6.2 Resonant Scattering

Propagation is rarely from point to point as the path is often obstructed
and so non-LOS (NLOS). One type of event that reduces transmission
is scattering. The level of the effect depends on the size of the objects
causing scattering. Here the effect of the pine needles of Figure 4-15 will be
considered. The pine needles (as most objects in the environment) conduct
electricity, especially when wet. When an EM field is incident an individual
needle acts as a wire antenna, with the current maximum when the pine
needle is one-half wavelength long. At this length, the "needle" antenna
supports a standing wave and will re-radiate the signal in all directions. This
is scattering, and there is a considerable loss in the direction of propagation
of the original fields. As well, there is loss due to a needle not being a very
good conductor, so EM energy is lost as heat. The effect of scattering is
frequency and size dependent. A typical pine needle is 15 cm long, which
is exactly /2 at 1 GHz, and so a stand of pine trees have an extraordinary
impact on cellular communications at 1 GHz. As a rough guide, 20 dB of a
signal is lost when passing through a small stand of pine trees. At 2 GHz, a
similar impact comes from other leaves, and they do not need to look like
wire antennas. Consider an oak leaf having a dimension of 7.5 cm. This is
/2 at 2 GHz, another dominant cellular frequency. So scattering results,
but now the loss is season dependent, with the loss due to scattering being
considerably smaller in winter (when trees such as oaks do not have leaves)
than in summer.

4.6.3 Fading

Fading refers to the variation of the received signal with time or when the
position of transmit or receive antennas is changed. The variation in signal
strength is much greater than would be expected from changes in path
146       STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

distance.

     length. Several forms of fading are identified and associated with different
     physical effects. The most important fading types are flat fading, multipath
     fading, and rain fading.

     Flat Fading

     Temperature variations of the atmosphere between the transmit antenna
     and receive antenna give rise to what is called flat fading and sometimes
     called thermal fading. This fading is called flat because it is independent
     of frequency. One form of flat fading is due to refraction, which occurs
     when different layers of the atmosphere have different densities and thus
     dielectric permittivities increasing or decreasing away from the surface of
     the earth. The temperature profile can increase away from the earth surface
     or reduce depending on whether the temperature of the earth is higher than
     that of the air and is commonly associated with the beginning and end
     of the day. Temperature inversions can also occur where the temperature
     profile in air does not uniformly increase or decrease, thus causing a
     layer with a higher permittivity than that of the air above or below. RF
     energy gets trapped in this layer, reflecting from the top and bottom of
     the inversion layer. This is called ducting. In point-to-point communication
     systems the transmit and receive antennas are mounted high on towers
     and then reflection from ground objects is often small. In such cases flat
     fading is the most commonly observed phenomena and minor fluctuations
     of several decibels in receive signal level are common throughout the day.
     However, when temperature variations are extreme, ducting can severely
     impact communications reducing signal levels by up to 20 dB.

     Shadow Fading

     Shadow fading occurs when the LOS path is blocked by an obstruction such
     as a building or hill. The full signal strength returns when the obstruction
     or receiver has moved to restore the direct path. Shadow fading is also
     called slow fading and the characteristic of the channel is regarded as being
     relatively constant over a short time. The amplitude response varies in time
     and distance and is shown in Figure 4-16. This figure shows both fast fades
     that are 10 to 15 dB deep and slow or shadow fades that are 20 to 30 dB deep.
ANTENNAS AND THE RF LINK                                                              147

Multipath Fading

Multipath fading is the most common fading when either the transmit
antenna or the receive antenna are close to the ground, near obstructing
buildings or terrains, or inside a building. In such situations there are many
reflections that combine destructively and constructively. Multipath fading
is also called fast fading, as the characteristics of the channel can change
significantly in a few milliseconds. Two types of multipath fading--Rician
fading and Rayleigh fading--will be considered.

   Multipath is principally a problem when the line of sight between transmit
and receive antennas is obscured. However, where there is line of sight the
signal reflecting from the ground immediately in front of a receive antenna
can sometimes largely cancel the line-of-sight signal. In time, intervening
objects can move and the propagation characteristics of the various paths
can change due to thermal variations. All this adds to the randomness of
fast fades. Multipath fading of 20 dB can occur for a small percentage of
the time on time scales of many seconds when there are few propagation
paths (e.g. in a rural area) to a large percentage of the time many times
per second in a dense urban environment when there are many paths.
Constructive combining does increase the signal level momentarily, but there
is no advantage to this. Destructive combining can result in deep fades of
20 dB impacting communications and forcing the communication system to
accommodate either by using higher average powers or using strategies such
as multiple antennas or spreading the communication signal over a wide
bandwidth since fades tend to be 500 kHz to 1 MHz wide at all frequencies.

Rician Fading

Rician fading occurs when there is one dominant RF path, usually the LOS
path, and one or more other paths. The main situation is when there is an
LOS path and a ground reflection as shown in Figure 4-12(a). The signal
received is the sum of two signals:

vr(t) = C [cos(ct) + r cos(ct + )] ,  (4.35)

where C cos(ct) is the LOS signal, r is the ratio of the amplitude of the
signal reflected from the ground and the LOS signal, and  is the relative
phase. When the distance between the transmitted and received signal is
large, the ground reflection will be a glancing reflection and the LOS and
reflected path will be almost exactly the same length. Ground reflection will
usually introduce a 180 phase rotation in the reflected signal and r could be
0.8-0.9. Thus there will be nearly complete cancellation of the signal [8].

Rayleigh Fading

Rayleigh fading, or fast fading, in a multipath environment results from
destructive cancellation as individual paths of similar amplitude drift in and
out of phase as the receiver and sources of multiple reflections, diffractions,
and refractions move. With multiple paths between a transmitter and a
receiver, different components of the received signal arrive at different times.
When the line of sight is blocked, the received signal on as many as 20 of
these paths can have appreciable signal power. The time between when the
first significant received signal is received and the last is received is called the
148  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     Figure 4-17: Two receive antennas used to
     achieve space diversity and overcome the
     effects of Rayleigh fading.

     delay spread. The delay spread is largest inside buildings. A typical office
     building has a delay spread of 30 ns, and an office building with highly
     reflective walls and large open spaces has a delay spread of up to 250 ns
     [9-11], similar delay spreads are obtained at all RF frequencies [12]. Rayleigh
     fading is the type of fading that occurs when the inverse of the delay spread
     is small compared to the bandwidth of the received signal. Then when the
     multipaths combine destructively the entire signal within a bandwidth of
     500 kHz to 1 MHz is suppressed. This bandwidth is experimentally observed
     and is related to the delay spread of individual paths, each with random
     amplitude and phase. If a communication signal has a bandwidth that is
     entirely within the suppression bandwidth of a Rayleigh fade, the situation is
     called frequency flat fading. Some communication signals have bandwidths
     greater than the Rayleigh fade bandwidth, so it is possible to recover from
     Raleigh fades if error correction is used.

        The result of Rayleigh fading is rapid amplitude variation with respect to
     frequency. In Figure 4-16(a) the amplitude varies in time depending on the
     speed of moving objects. This graph could just as well be a plot of amplitude
     versus distance or amplitude versus frequency. A measured amplitude
     response is shown in Figure 4-16(b). Although somewhat random, the fades
     occur over distances roughly 12  apart and 500 kHz wide. The 500 kHz width
     is almost independent of frequency from hundreds of megahertz to 100 GHz.
     The probability of receiving a signal x dB below the time-averaged received
     signal power is approximately 10-x [13]. Rayleigh fading is named after the
     statistical model that describes this.

        Fortunately deep Rayleigh fades are very short, last a small percentage of
     the time, and slight changes to the propagation environment can circumvent
     their effects. One strategy for overcoming fades is to use two receive
     antennas as shown in Figure 4-17. Here the signals received by two antennas
     separated by several wavelengths will rarely fade concurrently. In practice,
     the required separation for good decorrelation is found to be 10 to 20.

        In an LOS wireless system (e.g. a point-to-point link without multipath),
     Rayleigh fading is due to rapidly changing atmospheric conditions, with
     the refractive index of small regions varying. These fades occur over a few
     seconds.

     Rain Fading

     Rain fading is due to both the amount of rain and the size of individual
     rain drops and fading occurs over periods of minutes to hours. Propagation
     through the atmosphere is affected by absorption by molecules in the air, fog,
     and rain, and by scattering by rain drops. Figure 4-18 shows the attenuation
     in decibels per kilometer from 3 GHz to 300 GHz. Curve (a) shows the

attenuation in dry air at 0C with very low attenuation at a few gigahertz
with several attenuation peaks as frequency increases. The first peak in
attenuation is due to the resonance of water molecules in water vapor. The
resonance peaks at 23 GHz but loss starts increasing before that. The next
absorption peak is at 60 GHz due to the resonance of oxygen molecules.
Two other absorption peaks are observed going up to 300 GHz. Curve (b)
is for a less dry atmosphere at 20C. The dotted curve shows the additional
effect of fog on attenuation and then a family of curves shows the effect
of rain on propagation. Below 10 GHz the effect of rain is very little and
is safely ignored below 5 GHz. The attenuation due to rain increases with
frequency and this derives largely from scattering and is related to the RF
signal's wavelength relative to the circumference of rain drops.

Fading Due to Ducting

Normally the temperature and density of air, and thus its refractive
index, drops with increasing height above earth. As a result, radio waves
will be refracted toward the earth as shown in Figure 4-19(a). However,
during periods of stable weather characterized by a high-pressure system,
the temperature can rise with increasing height before eventually falling,
creating what is called temperature inversion. This can occur at heights
of tens to hundreds of meters. Temperature inversion is most common in
summer, but can also occur when the temperature is dropping quickly, such
as at sunset. At sunset the inversion layer may occur at a meter or so above
the ground as the earth cools rapidly. The denser colder air above the ground
has a higher permittivity than the air above and this results in an inversion
layer that has a higher refractive index than the air above and below. RF
waves can become trapped in the inversion layer, as any RF energy leaving
the temperature inversion layer is refracted back into the layer. This effect is
called ducting. Ducting can also occur when a cold air mass is overrun by
warm air.

   Fading due to ducting occurs when the receiver wanders in and out of the
ducting layer, as the ducting layer is not stable, increasing and decreasing in

     Summary of Fading

     The fades of most concern in a mobile wireless system are the deep fades
     resulting from destructive interference of multiple reflections. These fades
     vary rapidly (over a few milliseconds) if a handset is moving at vehicular
     speeds but occur slowly when the transmitter and receiver are fixed. Fades
     can be viewed as deep amplitude modulation, and so so modulation is
     restricted to phase shift keying schemes when a transmitter and receive
     moving at vehicular speeds relative to each other.

     4.6.4 Link Loss and Path Loss

     With transmit and receive antennas included in the RF link, the usual case,
     link loss is defined as the ratio of the power input to the transmit antenna
     (PT ) to the power delivered by the receive antenna (PR). Rearranging
     Equation (4.31) and taking logarithms yields the total line-of-sight (LOS) link
     loss, LLINK,LOS, between the input of the transmit antenna and the output of
     the receive antenna separated by distance d is (in decibels):

     LLINK,LOS|dB = 10 log       PT = 10 log PT                                     (4.36)
                       = 10 log  PR             PD AR                               (4.37)
                       = 10 log                                                     (4.38)

ANTENNAS AND THE RF LINK                                                            151

The last term includes d and is called the LOS path loss (in decibels):

LPATH,LOS|dB = 20 log 4d  .                                              (4.40)

This is the preferred form of the expression for path loss, as it can be used
directly in calculating link loss using the antenna gains of the transmit and
receive antennas without the exercise of calculating the effective aperture
size of the receive antenna.

   An alternative definition of path loss comes directly from Equation (4.25)
and is called the LOS path loss of the first kind:

    1LPATH,LOS = 4d2,                                                    (4.41)

but this is not commonly used.
   Multipath effects result in losses that are proportional to dn [14, 15] so that

the general path loss, including multipath effects, is (in decibels)

LPATH|dB = LPATH,LOS|dB + excess loss|dB

= 20 log 4d + 10(n - 2) log d
                                          1m

= 20 log 4(1 m) + 10(2) log d                 + 10(n - 2) log             d
                                          1m                             1m

= 10n log[d/(1 m)] + C,                                                    (4.42)

where the distance d and wavelength  are in meters, and C is a constant that
captures the effect of wavelength. Here,

  C = 20 log [4(1 m)/] .                                                 (4.43)

Combining this with Equation (4.39) yields the link loss between the input
of the transmit antenna and the output of the receive antenna:

LLINK|dB = -GT |dB - GR|dB + 10n log[d/(1 m)] + C.                       (4.44)

As you can imagine, a few constants, here n and C, cannot capture the
full complexity of the propagation environment. Many models have been
developed to capture particular environments better and incorporate mast
height, experimental correction factors, and statistical parameters.

   The path loss between two antennas is exactly the same in both directions
when the frequency of the signal in each direction is the same. This is radio
link reciprocity. Many communication systems use different frequencies in
the two directions, and then the links are not reciprocal.

EXAMPLE 4.5 Power Density

     A communication system operating in a dense urban environment has a power density roll-
     off of 1/d3.5 between the base station transmit antenna and the mobile receive antenna. At
     10 m from the transmit antenna, the power density is 0.3167 W/m2. What is the power

     density at the receive antenna located at 1 km from the base station?

     Solution:

     PD(10 m) = 0.3167 W/m2 and let dc = 10 m, so at d = 1 km, the power density PD(1 km) is
     obtained from

     and a receive antenna with an antenna gain GR of 6 dB. If the distance between the antennas
     is 200 m, what is the link loss if the power density reduces as 1/d3? The link loss here is

     between the input to the transmit antenna and the output from the receive antenna.

     Solution:

     The link loss is provided by Equation (4.44),

                LLINK|dB = -GT - GR + 10n log[d/(1 m)] + C,

     and C comes from Equation (4.43), where  = 5.36 cm. So

                C = 20 log 4 = 20 log 4                      = 47.4 dB.
                                                    0.0536

     With n = 3 and d = 200 m,

                LLINK|dB = -35 - 6 + 10 · 3 · log(200) + 47.4 dB = 75.4 dB.

EXAMPLE 4.7 Radiated Power Density

     In free space, radiated power density drops off with distance d as 1/d2. However, in a
     terrestrial environment there are multiple paths between a transmitter and a receiver, with
     the dominant paths being the direct LOS path and the path involving reflection off the
     ground. Reflection from the ground partially cancels the signal in the direct path, and in
     a semi-urban environment results in an attenuation loss of 40 dB per decade of distance
     (instead of the 20 dB per decade of distance roll-off in free space). Consider a transmitter that
     has a power density of 1 W/m2 at a distance of 1 m from the transmitter.

     (a) The power density falls off as 1/dn, where d is distance and n is an index. What is n?
     (b) At what distance from the transmit antenna will the power density reach 1 µW·m-2?

     Solution:

     (a) Power drops off by 40 dB per decade of distance. 40 dB corresponds to a factor of 10,000

          (= 104). So, at distance d, the power density PD(d) = k/dn (k is a constant).
          At a decade of distance, 10d, PD(10d) = k/(10d)n = PD(d)/10000, thus

                k               1k                  10n = 10, 000  n = 4.
                10ndn = 10, 000 dn ;

(b) At d = 1 m, PD(1 m) = 1 W/m2. At a distance x,             and so x = 31.6 m.
                PD(x) = 1 µW/m2 = x4 k m2 = x4 k  x4 = 10-6 1

4.6.5 Fresnel Zones

In long-distance wireless communications from one fixed site to another, the
intent is to use the LOS path and avoid reflections. Such systems are called
point-to-point links. Thus avoiding reflections is an important consideration
in design. The dominant propagation paths in a point-to-point system are
shown in Figure 4-20. The refracted wave path arises because of density
variations in the air producing a permittivity profile that varies with height,
as shown in Figure 4-21(a). This effect is called beam bending. The other
important propagation path to consider is the reflected wave from the
ground, which can be important if the ground is too close to the propagation
path. Both of these effects will be considered in this section.

   As radio waves propagate, they spread out in a plane perpendicular to
the direction of propagation, the power density of the radio waves then
reduces with distance from the centerline. One of the consequences of
this is that an obstruction that is not in the LOS path can still interfere
with signal propagation. The appropriate clearance is determined from the
Fresnel zones, which are shown in Figure 4-22. The direct LOS path between
the antennas has a length d. If there is a reflecting object near the LOS path,
then there can be a second path between the transmit and receive antennas.
The path from the first antenna to the circle defined by the first Fresnel zone
and then to the second antenna has a path length d+/2, and so at the receive
antenna this signal is 180 out of phase with the LOS signal and there will be

                                    Fn =  nd1d2 ,                                              (4.47)
                                          d1 + d2

     where d1 is the distance from the first antenna to P , d2 is the distance from
     the second antenna to P (so d = d1 + d2), and  is the wavelength of the
     propagating signal. Ninety percent of the energy in the wave is in the first
     Fresnel zone. A guideline is that an obstacle should be separated from the
     direct path by a distance more than the radius of the first Fresnel zone.
     Antenna heights are increased so that the beam achieves one or more Fresnel
     zone clearances.

        The above analysis can be used even with beam bending. A convenient
     way of accommodating beam bending is to use a curved-earth model,
     as shown in Figure 4-21(b), so that subsequent calculations can use LOS
     considerations [16]. The amount of beam bending to account for comes from
     experimental surveys. In Figure 4-21(b) the original clearance from a hill to
     the first Fresnel zone is z. With beam bending the clearance increases to y.

        Since a receive antenna is unlikely to be large enough to capture all of the
     energy contained in the first Fresnel zone, the effect of signal blocking by an
     obstruction that encroaches the first Fresnel zone is of little concern. What is
     of concern is the destructive combining of a reflected signal with the signal
     in the main LOS beam.

EXAMPLE 4.8 Fresnel Zone Clearance

     A transmit antenna and a receive antenna are separated by 10 km and operate at 2 GHz.

     (a) What is the radius of the first Fresnel zone?
     (b) What is the radius of the second Fresnel zone?
     (c) To ensure LOS propagation, what should the clearance be from the direct line between

          the antennas and obstructions such as hills and vegetation?

     Solution:

     The radius of the Fresnel zone is calculated at
     the midpoint so that d1 = d2 = d/2 = 5 km.
     Also f = 2 GHz,  = 15 cm.

     (a) The radius of the first Fresnel zone is, from Equation (4.47),

     r1 = F1 =   d1d2 =             d =   (0.15)(104) = 19.36 m.

(b) At the midpoint the radius of the second Fresnel zone is

      r2 = F2 =           2d1d2 =  d =  (0.15)(104) = 27.39 m.
                          d1 + d2  2          2

(c) Ninety percent of the energy in the beam is contained within the first Fresnel zone of
     radius r1. Obstructions within the first Fresnel zone will result in a significant fraction of
     the beam being blocked. In addition, reflections from the obstruction could destructively
     combine with the main beam and reduce the received signal level even beyond the
     reduction caused by part of the beam being blocked. Two criteria are commonly used
     to determine the clearance required to avoid signal obstruction.
     One criterion used is that the minimum clear-
     ance between the direct beam and an obstruc-
     tion is 0.6r1. So the minimum clearance is
     0.6r1 = 11.6 m.
     A more conservative criterion is that the min-
     imum clearance should be r1 = 19.36 m.

4.6.6 Propagation Model in the Mobile Environment

RF propagation in the mobile environment cannot be accurately derived.
Instead, a fit to measurements is often used. One of the models is the
Okumura-Hata model [17], which calculates the path loss as

LPATH|(dB) = 69.55 + 26.16 log f - 13.82 log H + (44.9 - 6.55 log H) · log d

+ c,                                                          (4.48)

where f is the frequency (in MHz), d is the distance between the base station
and terminal (in km), H is the effective height of the base station antenna (in
m), and c is an environment correction factor (c = 0 dB in a dense urban area,
c = -5 dB in an urban area, c = -10 dB in a suburban area, and c = -17 dB in
a rural area, for f = 1 GHz and H=1.5 m).

   More sophisticated characterization of the propagation environment uses
ray-tracing models to follow individual propagation paths. The ray-tracing
models are based on deterministic methods using terrain data and calculate
paths accounting for obstruction and reflection analyses. Each refraction and
reflection event is characterized either experimentally or through detailed
EM simulations. Appropriate algorithms are applied for best compliance
with radio physics. Commonly required inputs to these models include
frequency, distance from the transmitter to the receiver, effective base station
height, obstacle height and geometry, radius of the first Fresnel zone, forest
height/roof height, distance between buildings, arbitrary loss allowances
based on land use (forest, water, etc.), and loss allowances for penetration
of buildings and vehicles. Such a technique was used to calculate the radio
coverage diagrams on the inside front cover of this book.

   There are many propagation models for different frequency ranges and
different environments. The considerable effort put into developing reliable
models is because being able to predict signal coverage is essential to efficient
design of basestation layout.

     4.7 Multipath and Delay Spread

     Multipath was discussed previously in Sections 4.6.1 and 4.6.3 in the context
     of reduction in signal amplitude due to the destructive interference of a
     signal traveling on several paths. Another effect of multipath is that instances
     of a signal traveling from a transmitter to a receiver on different paths will
     arrive at a receiver with various delays. These delays can differ by tens
     or thousands of nanoseconds which is much longer than the period of a
     microwave signal, e.g. a 1 GHz signal has a period of 1 ns.

     4.7.1 Delay Spread

     Each of the paths supports what is called a signal instance. For a single-tone
     signal the effect of various delays is for the signal instances to arrive at the
     receiver with very different phases. As well, the signal instances invariably
     have different amplitudes resulting in a composite received signal that is
     an unpredictable combination of constructive and destructive interference.
     Sometimes the constructive interference will result in a stronger composite
     received signal but this is not that important. What is much more significant
     is the destructive interference which will result in signal fades with the signal
     received being very small at times. Consider two signal instances y1(t) and
     y2(t), traveling from a transmitter to a receiver on paths 1 and 2 respectively.
     If y1(t) and y2(t) have the same amplitude and phase then the combined
     signal will only be increased by 6 dB over a signal that travels on just one
     path. However if y1(t) and y2(t) have the same amplitude but phases that
     differ by 180 then there will be total cancellation and no composite signal
     will be received. So destructive interference is much more significant than
     constructive interference.

        For cellular radio, in a rural area there can be two or three significant
     paths, usually taken as paths having signal instances that are within 20 dB
     of the largest signal instance. In an urban environment there can be tens
     of significant paths because there are many reflections from buildings and
     often there is not an LOS path which would otherwise have the largest signal
     instance. With multiple paths it is unlikely that there will be total cancellation
     of the received signal but it is very likely that the received signal will be
     smaller than if there was one path.

        Early cellular radio had narrow bandwidths, e.g. 200 kHz for 2G's GSM
     cellular system, and low-order modulation, e.g. 2 bits per symbol and it was
     sufficient to use the phase-based concepts of constructive and destructive
     interference to understand the effects of multipath. As channel bandwidths
     increased and the order of modulation increased it was necessary to consider
     the actual physical effect of the paths having different delays.

        If there is an LOS path, say with no building in the way, then the LOS signal
     instance will be stronger than a signal instance that travels on any other
     path. It will also have the smallest delay. This is partly because each non-LOS
     (NLOS) path will travel further and hence spread out more, and also because
     there will be signal loss at reflections. If there is scattering or diffraction on a
     path the amplitude of this signal instance on that path will be even smaller.
     Even if there is an LOS path, if there are multiple NLOS paths then the
     combined NLOS signal instances could indeed be larger than the LOS signal
     instance. If there is not an LOS path then one of the NLOS paths will become

the largest received signal instance and it may not have the shortest delay.
Generally only signal instances that are within 20 dB of the largest signal
instance must be considered and then the delay, also referred to as `delay
(20 dB)', that matters is the excess delay, d, which is the difference between
the earliest and latest arriving signal instances within that 20 dB window. It
is essential that a communications link be maintained a certain percentage of
the time, e.g. 99%, for a specified level of service. This minimizes the number
of times packets must be re-transmitted and assures acceptable operation
of a system. Thus the maximum excess delay, d,max becomes an important
metric and determines the interval for which the received signal is not valid,
the required guard band to prevent signals from an earlier symbol interval
overlapping with the current symbol interval, and also the maximum useful
bandwidth of a signal.

   It is found that the delay spread increases with distance between the
transmitter and receiver, the Tx-RX distance, increases with frequency, and
increases with a richer multipath environment. For example, a rural area has
few paths but large cell sizes are used and the Tx-Rx distance is relatively
large resulting in a large excess delay but a dense urban area has small
cells but a rich multipath environment with many reflections from buildings.
Measured excess delays for various situations are given in Table 4-2. There is
a lot of variation in excess delays but it is clearly reduced with smaller cells
and a less rich multipath environment.

   It is also found that as a mobile unit moves the excess delay and the
number of significant paths varies tens or hundreds of times per second
depending on the environment but also the mobility, e.g. pedestrian versus
highway speeds. However over a millisecond the propagation is found to
be effectively fixed and consequently systems are designed with data sent in
packets that are usually no longer than a millisecond.

   Examining Table 4-2 further it is observed that the 2G and 3G cellular
bands are below 2 GHz and the delay spreads can be several milliseconds
158  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     and even larger with larger Tx-Rx distances in an urban area. At the higher
     microwave frequencies up to 6 GHz covering the operating frequency range
     of 4G, the delay spread is smaller.

        The 28 GHz and 38 GHz bands are where 5G operates with short Tx-Rx
     distances. Here the number of paths above 20 dB is around 4 to 8 for Tx-Rx
     separations of 35 to 193 m [27, 28].

        The spreads are relatively low and this is largely a result of using high
     gain steerable antennas which are essential to 5G operation. The high gain
     antennas reduce the spread of multipath path lengths, and hence reduce the
     excess delay spread, concentrating the reflected paths close to the transmit
     and receive antennas.

        The prior discussions on multipath effects and the RF link consider a single
     frequency tone propagating from a transmit antenna and a receive antenna.
     When a single-tone signal travels on multiple paths there will be destructive
     and/or constructive interference.

     4.7.2 Intersymbol Interference

     Intersymbol interference (ISI) occurs when a symbol traveling on one path
     interferes with the symbol traveling on another path. This is the result of
     the paths having different delays. The effect of excess delay on the received
     composite signal is indicated in Figure 4-23. Consider the situation where
     there are four paths with the excess delay of path 1 being 0 by definition,
     i.e. d,1 = 0, the excess delay of path 2, d,2 = 100 ns, and so on, d,3 =
     200 ns., and d,4 = 300 ns. The 2G-5G cellular systems transmit a series of
     symbols, here A, B, C, D, and E, which have a symbol duration which differs
     by standard. In Figure 4-23 four paths are considered and the four signal
     instances each travel on a different path and are combined in the receiver's
     antenna to yield a composite received signal. The symbols of each of the
     signal instances overlap causing ISI.

        With the 2G GSM system symbol lengths are 3690 ns and the first 300 ns of
     a symbol instance traveling on the first path to arrive has interference from
     the previous symbol traveling on the other three paths, see Figure 4-23(a).
     In this case the first 300 ns of the 3690 ns of the symbol is garbled. In this
     example the delay spread is just 300 ns but this is conservative. Table 4-2
     indicates that in some environments that the excess delay spread 1% of the
     time can be as long as the symbol interval for 2G/GSM (operating below
     2 GHz). So even if the signal strength is high reception may not be possible
     because of ISI.

        With 3G the packet length is 260 ns so with an excess delay spread of
     300 ns for the four path example the symbol interference is severe, see Figure
     4-23(b), and as noted 300 ns is a very conservative estimate of the excess
     delay spread. One of the features of 3G is a method for separating out the
     individual signal instances. Only when there are a very large number of
     significant paths does 3G have problems. In an urban area sometimes a
     communication link cannot be established with 2G and 3G even though the
     signal strength is high.

        The 4G system minimizes the problem of ISI by having a very long symbol
     interval of 71.35 µs and a 300 ns excess delay spread is a small fraction
     of the symbol length. The symbol interval is considerably longer than any
     of the maximum delay spreads given in Table 4-2. Also the 4G standard

symbol duration of 260 ns, and the 4G OFDM standard has a symbol duration of 71.35 µs. The
situation with 5G is similar to that for 4G.
160  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     has a guard time band known as a cyclic prefix. (The cyclic prefix is a bit
     more than a guard band as it involves repeating the end of symbol but this
     extra feature will be discussed latter.) The cyclic prefix can be either 4.7 µs,
     5.2 µs, 16.7 µs, or 33.3 µs accommodating various excess delay spreads. This
     is more than enough to avoid the problem of ISI as any of the maximum
     excess delays listed in Table 4-2 are less than the maximum cyclic prefix
     length. The long symbol interval implies a very narrow bandwidth or sub-
     channel bandwidth. A 4G system communicates with a user using a very
     large number of sub-channels thus supporting high data rates.

     4.7.3 Summary

     Various excess delays on different paths causes intersymbol interference.
     High levels of intersymbol interference results in the failure to establish
     a communication link. Excess delay is a fundamental limitation with the
     2G/GSM system and the only solution is to use very small cells in urban
     environments which have many significant signal paths. The 3G system
     employs a coding technique that enables the first few different paths to be
     resolved thus limiting the problem of ISI but not eliminating it. The 4G
     system, and 5G operates similarly, employs a long guard time, the cyclic
     prefix, to avoid ISI completely.

     4.8 Radio Link Interference

     The two major source of interference in a cellular system are self-interference
     resulting from excess delay spreads as discussed in the previous section,
     and interference, called radio link interference, from radios in other cells
     operating on the same frequency channel. This section discusses radio link
     interference and how it is controlled by using a frequency reuse plan.

     4.8.1 Frequency Reuse Plan

     Radio systems using the same channel are geographically spaced to control
     interference. In a cellular system, the coverage areas are arranged in cells
     represented by the hexagons in Figure 4-24. The actual shape of the cells is
     influenced by obstructions such as hills and buildings. In 1G and 2G cellular
     systems the cells are arranged in clusters such as the 3-, 7-, and 12-cell clusters
     shown, and the total number of channels available is divided among the cells
     in a cluster with the full set of frequency channels repeated in each cluster.
     (More about 3G-5G arrangements later.) The size of the clusters is the major
     component of what is called the frequency reuse plan. So a three-cell cluster
     has a spacing of approximately one cell diameter to the next cell using the
     same frequency channels. The signal level transmitted from the original cell
     will interfere with the signal in its corresponding cell in adjacent clusters. The
     level of interference is reduced with 7-cell and then 12-cell clusters. There
     is also background noise coming from cosmic sources as well as artificial
     sources, but in a cellular system, interference from other radios operating in
     the same system nearly always dominates.

        The use of directional antennas at the base station increases the SIR. The
     interference pattern obtained using a trisector antenna (each segment of the
     antenna providing 120 of coverage) is shown in Figure 4-25. The trisector
     antenna can be arranged so that the transmit and receive antennas are

separated (see Figure 4-26), and can also be arranged to tilt the coverage
toward the ground (e.g., see the antenna in Figure 4-2(l)). It is also possible
to use higher-order antenna sectoring and to have smaller cells (achieved
possibly by relatively low-power transmissions) to provide higher levels of
coverage at critical regions such as intersections of roads. These smaller cells
are referred to as microcells or picocells.

EXAMPLE 4.9 Cellular Interference

     In a cellular system, a signal is intentionally transmitted from a base station nominally
     located in the center of a cell to a mobile unit in the same cell. However, nearby transmitters
     using the same channel cause interference. In Figure 4-27, a mobile unit is located at
     the edge of a cell and uses frequency channel A. Many nearby transmitters also operate
     using channel A and the six nearest transmitters can be considered as causing significant
     interference. Consider that the mobile unit is a distance r from its cell's transmitter along
     the line connecting two channel A base stations, that the transmitters all operate at the same
     power level, and that the distance between base stations operating using channel A is 3r. This
     three-cell cluster operates in a suburban area and the power density drops off with distance
     d as 1/d3 due to multipath effects. What is the SIR at the mobile unit?

     Solution:

     There are seven close towers transmitting
     signals on the same channel. Call these A1-
     A7 (M = mobile unit, A = transmitters). A1 is
     the desired signal and A2-A7 are interferers.
     The distances from the transmitters to the
     mobile unit are d1-d7, and the powers from
     the transmitters received at the mobile unit
     are P1-P7.

     Now SIR =  P1 .
                P2 + P3 + P4 + P5 + P6 + P7

     This problem requires d2-d7 to be determined.

Consider the diagram to the right with d1 = r. Also, the

distance from A2 to A7 is 3r. Now d3 = 3r + r = 4r,

                                                                                       1

d6 = 3r - r = 2r. So d2 = (X + r)2 + Y 2 2 =
 2.52 + 2.62 r = 3.607r = d4. (X = 3r sin 30 = 1.5r
and Y = 3r cos 30 = 2.6r.) Similarly,

                                                           1

d7 = d5 = (1.5 - 1)2 + 2.62 2 = 2.648r.

P2 P = d1 = 1 d2 3.6073 1 = 0.0213 = P4 P1  P3 P = d1 = 1 d3 43 1 = 0.0156.
P7 P = d1 = 1 d7 2.6483 1 = 0.0539 = P5 P1  P6 P = d1 = 1 d6 23 1 = 0.1250.

SIR = (0.0213 + 0.0156 + 0.0213 + 0.0539 + 0.1250 + 0.0539)-1 = 3.44 = 5.36 dB.

4.8.2 Summary

The clustering of cells as described above applies most directly to 1G
and 2G cellular systems. The 3G system does not use clusters of cells
but instead uses high frequency codes to separate users. There is a
system awareness of managing interference but more complicated than
the clustering arrangements. The 4G and 5G systems take frequency
reuse algorithms to a whole new level performing global minimization of
interference of wide areas. Still there is the basic concept that radios in
adjacent cells operating on the same frequency channel can interfere with
each other and careful attention must be given to frequency reuse.

   The region of signal coverage by a basestation is greatly influenced by
terrain and is not a neat hexagon. See for example the coverage map for a
rural area shown in Figure 4-28(a). To ensure adequate coverage basestations
must be placed on a terrain-aware grid and not a regular grid. A wasted
expense in operating a cellular system would be installing more basestations
than are needed for optimum coverage. Thus cellular service providers
simulate coverage before installing basestations. A significant characteristic
of urban coverage as shown in Figures 4-28(b and c) is the "urban canyon
effect" whereby coverage is concentrated along roads with signals bouncing
off buildings directing signal propagation down the roadway. Even areas
close to a transmitter but behind buildings are shadowed while distant
areas near roads can have good coverage. This effect is also known as the
urban wave-guiding effect or wave-channeling effect.. The signal blocking
by buildings is shown in Figure 4-28(e) where it is seen that there is
some diffraction over buildings but shadowing is severe after two or more
diffraction events. The indoor environment also affects coverage as shown in
Figure 4-28(d) for WiFi.

4.9 Antenna array

An antenna array comprises multiple radiating elements, i.e. individual
antennas, and focuses a transmit beam in a desired direction. In Figure
4-29 the field pattern in the plane of the earth produced by an array of
30 antenna elements arranged horizontally is shown. The fields from each

                          The sidelobe levels are about 40 dB below the
                          power level of the main lobe. The same signal
                          is presented to the antenna elements except that
                          phases of the signal at each antennas is adjusted
                          to produce a main beam directed at 20 degrees.
                          The signals to each antenna are thus correlated.

antenna element combined to narrow and strengthen the main beam. Side
(or grating) lobes are produced and these will result in some interference but
their level here is 40 dB below that of the main beam. This is another way
of managing interference in a cellular system but the direction to the mobile
unit must be known. Antenna arrays are used in 5G. The affect of the array
is to increase the power density of the main beam and the density relative to
that of an isotropic antenna is called the directional gain of the array, DArray,
and is the product of the antenna gain, GA, of an individual antenna element
and the array gain, GArray:

DArray = GArrayGA.               (4.49)

The maximum value of GArray is N for an N element array. So the maximum
directional gain of the array in dBi is

DArray|dBi = GA|dBi + 10 log N.  (4.50)

4.10 Summary

This chapter discussed the impacts on communication integrity of imperfec-
tions in the RF link from the output of the transmitter to the input of the
receiver. Prior to cellular communications becoming so important, only the
LOS communication path was considered and the impact of fading, multi-
ple reflections, and delay spread was regarded as bothersome. Most com-
monly the solution to the problems introduced by these effects was either to
shift to another frequency, to increase the operating power, or install more
basestations. With the advent of cellular communications, and digital com-
munications in general, techniques have been developed to overcome the
negative impacts of fading without boosting signal levels to the level where
they severely impact the operation of other radios. So while many aspects
of RF propagation are random, concepts and statistical models have been
developed that enable design choices to be made that permit digital com-
munication systems to operate in what would have once been regarded as a
hostile environment.

5.1 Introduction

In the history of wireless communication, radar, and sensor systems there
have been many standards and different types of systems. Following the
development of the main cellular radio systems is a good proxy for the
evolution of nearly all RF systems. Mobile radio up to and including 1G
cellular radio was essentially analog with only simple signaling using tones
or FSK modulation. There were many incompatible mobile radio and 1G
systems as little thought was given to worldwide interoperability and radio
companies were content with proprietary standards.

   The situation continued with 2G cellular radio as there were many
incompatible 2G systems with each only able to support one modulation
method. Most of the radio functionality was in the analog hardware but
VLSI was starting to become mature and it was possible to do limited
error correction coding. At the basestation there was enough computing
power to dynamically manage interference and implement simple system-
level optimization. In the evolution to 3G there were many proposals all
exploiting the increasing capability of VLSI. With the introduction of 3G,
174  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     communication providers enforced the adoption of a single word-wide
     standard. Perhaps `single' is a stretch as there were still several variations
     of the 3G implementation but a core set of standards supporting worldwide
     connectivity was adopted.

        The path forward was becoming unmanageable so following the
     introduction of 3G an international consortium focused on developing a
     strategy to support cellular communications that was more capable and
     upwards compatible.

        For the first time, with 4G a large number of modulation methods were
     supported with most of the modulation and demodulation functionality
     implemented in a DSP unit called the baseband processor. Changing
     modulation and demodulation formats was a simple procedure of running
     different code. This is software-defined radio with analog circuitry
     implementing just the translation from an analog baseband signal, really a
     modulated signal on a low-frequency intermediate frequency carrier, to the
     high-frequency RF signal. Modulation by the baseband data produced the
     baseband analog signal with the baseband processor implementing a digital
     version of an analog modulation format. With 5G additional capability is
     provided with the 4G standard becoming a subset of the 5G standard.

        An understanding of systems is required to understand the specifications
     for RF hardware. This is particularly important as the actual performance
     required of hardware is often not directly related to the specifications
     developed by system designers. For example, one of the most important
     characteristics of digital radio systems is the bit error rate (BER). The BER
     is a quantity that cannot be determined until the components of a system
     are integrated. Thus in the design of subsystems, indirect measures such as
     intermodulation distortion (IMD) (referring to the generation of spurious
     signals when discrete tones are applied to a subsystem) are specified. The
     relationship between IMD and BER is weak. Clearly higher IMD tends to
     indicate a higher BER for the same technology, but the relative performance
     of different technologies cannot be evaluated this way. Thus an essential
     system design problem is developing sufficient and tractable criteria that
     enable subsystems to be locally designed and optimized, leading to an
     overall optimized system.

     5.2 Broadcast, Simplex, Duplex, Diplex, and Multiplex
            Operations

     One would think that defining these terms would be a simple matter.
     However, there have been different conventions in various segments of the
     telecommunications industry. Now that telecommunications are converging,
     universal definitions that accommodate all earlier uses are not possible.
     There is now standardization by the International Telecommunications
     Union (ITU) of the terms broadcast, simplex, duplex, diplex, and multiplex,
     as they relate to wireless communications [1, 2] (see Table 5-1). National
     Standards, however, do not need to conform to the ITU definitions. Examples
     of slightly different definitions come from the Telecom Glossary established
     as part of an American National Standard (ANS) [3]. There is greater
     specificity to radio in the ITU usage of the terms. In general the ITU definition
     should be used if the context is radio communications, but be careful if the
     interpretation of the terms is critical.

5.2.1 International Telecommunications Union Definitions

The ITU is the agency of the United Nations that coordinates the shared
global use of the radio spectrum and establishes worldwide standards.

   Broadcast operation refers to one-way communication in which there is
only one transmitter and at least one, and perhaps more, receivers. The ITU
defines broadcasting as [1, 2]:

       a form of unidirectional telecommunication intended for a large
       number of users having appropriate receiving facilities, and
       carried out by means of radio or cable networks.

   Simplex operation is defined by the ITU as [1]

       designating or pertaining to a method of operation in which
       information can be transmitted in either direction, but not
       simultaneously, between two points.

So simplex operation is when there is communication from a first unit
to a second unit. This is followed by a hand-off procedure and then
communication from the second unit to the first. So the push-to-talk Family
Radio Service (FRS) is an example of simplex communication as two people
on opposite ends of the link cannot talk simultaneously. Simplex operation
may use either one or two frequencies. That is, the forward link (from
user 1 to user 2) may use the same frequency channel as the reverse link
(from user 2 to user 1). However, simplex operation may use different
frequency channels for the forward and the reverse link. The ITU defines
"half duplex" as being synonymous with simplex, but the use of the term
"half duplex" is deprecated (not recommended) [1, 2]. An early radio using
simplex operation is shown in Figure 5-1(a).

   Duplex Operation is defined by the ITU as [2]

       the operating method in which transmission is possible simulta-
       neously in both directions of a telecommunication channel.

   Simultaneous two-way communication uses duplexing. In analog radio
the links must be simultaneous and so operation requires two frequencies.
But in digital radio with compression and expansion of digitized speech and

                 transmission of data, duplex operation can involve transmission of data in
                 time slots that may not be simultaneous in each direction. If the time slots are
                 short enough, say less than ten milliseconds, the effect will be that two-way
                 voice communication is simultaneous. This is still called duplex operation.
                 Early examples of radios using duplex operation are shown in Figure 5-1(b
                 and c). A modern example is the cell phone.

                    The two predominant duplex schemes are frequency-division duplex
                 (FDD) and time-division duplex (TDD), as illustrated in Figure 5-2. In these
                 diagrams the mobile unit is shown communicating with a basestation, in
                 which case transmission from the mobile unit to the basestation is called
                 the uplink (UL), or less commonly the reverse link (RL), or reverse path.

                                                                                  ers are diplexers.

Communication from the basestation and received by the mobile unit is
called the downlink, (DL), forward link (FL), or forward path. In FDD it
is necessary to use a filter to separate the uplink and downlink signals, as
shown in Figure 5-3, as the two links are in use simultaneously.

   In TDD, see Figure 5-2(a), the uplink and downlink are separated in time
and a switch connects the antenna to the transmitter to send the uplink and
then to the receiver to receive the downlink. The sequence is then repeated.

   In FDD the uplink and downlink are at different frequencies and the
transmitter and receiver are connected permanently to the antenna, see
Figures Figure 5-2(b) and 5-3. FDD requires a diplex filter, which is a special
filter with three ports that looks like a lowpass filter (usually for a handset)
for the uplink when the transmitter is connected to the antenna (the uplink
is generally at a lower frequency than the downlink) and a highpass filter for
the downlink when the receiver is connected to the antenna.

5.2.2 Duplex Versus Diplex

The term duplex refers to a way of handling two communication channels.
It derives from the term multiplexing (or MUXing) defined as [3]

       the combining of two or more information channels onto a com-
       mon transmission medium. Note: In electrical communications,
       the two basic forms of multiplexing are time-division multi-
       plexing (TDM) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). Syn-
       onym: multiplex.

Duplexing, or duplex operation, is used when there are two channels and
in radio communications it nearly always refers to one transmit channel and
on receive channel.

   Diplex operation is defined as [3]:

       the sharing of one common element, such as a single antenna
       or channel, for transmission or reception of two simultaneous,
       independent signals on two different frequencies. Note: An
       example of diplex operation is the use of one antenna for two
       radio transmitters on different frequencies.

   A diplexer is defined as [3]

       a three-port frequency-dependent device that may be used as a
       separator or a combiner of signals.

   So in the context of cellular communications, a diplexer is a filter (see
178  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     Figure 5-3). It is a three-port filter that separates the transmitted and received
     signals, which are at different frequencies.

     5.3 Cellular Communications

     Cellular communications, as the name implies, are based on the concept of
     cells in which a terminal unit communicates with a basestation at the center
     of a cell. Each cell can be relatively small and a terminal unit travels smoothly
     from cell to cell with a connection transferring using what is called a hand-
     off process. For communication in closely spaced cells to work, interference
     from other radios must be managed. This is facilitated using the ability to
     recover from errors available with error correction schemes and the use of
     antenna beam-forming technology.

     5.3.1 Cellular Concept

     The cellular concept was outlined in a 1947 Bell Laboratories technical
     memorandum [4]. It described a system of frequency reuse with small
     geographical cells, and this remains the key concept of cellular radio. This
     was elaborated on in two articles published in 1957 and 1960 [5, 6]. The first
     widespread cellular radio system was the Advanced Mobile Phone System
     (AMPS), one of many 1G cellular radio systems, and was fully described
     by Bell Laboratories in a submission to the U.S. Federal Communications
     Commission (FCC) and in a patent filed on December 21, 1970 [7]. Bell
     Labs petitioned the FCC in 1958 for a frequency band around 800 MHz
     for a cellular system. The FCC, believing that it was better to allocate
     spectrum for the public good (such as radio, television, and emergency
     services) was reluctant to act on the petition. In 1968, pressure on the
     FCC became too great and an agreement was reached in principle to make
     frequencies available. Thus began the research and development of cellular
     systems in the United States. In 1961, Ericsson reorganized to address mobile
     radio, including cellular radio systems. Nokia did not begin developing 1G
     cellular systems until the 1970s. NTT was working away as well and began
     developing cellular radio systems in 1967 [8]. Meanwhile, in January 1969,
     the Bell System launched an experimental cellular radio system employing
     frequency reuse for the first time to achieve optimum use of a limited number
     of RF channels. The first commercial cellular system was launched by the
     Bahrain Telephone Company in May 1978 using Matsushita equipment. This
     was followed by the launch of AMPS by Illinois Bell and AT&T in the United
     States in July 1978.

        In 1979 the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) allocated
     the 862-960 MHz band for mobile radio, leading to the FCC releasing, in
     1981, 40 MHz in the 800-900 MHz band for "cellular land-mobile phone
     service." The service, as defined in the original documents, is (and this is
     still the best definition of cellular radio)

            a high capacity land mobile system in which assigned spectrum
            is divided into discrete channels which are assigned in groups to
            geographic cells covering a cellular geographic area. The discrete
            channels are capable of being reused within the service area.

     The key attributes here are
RF SYSTEMS  179

                                                                                          Figure 5-4: Cells arranged
                                                                                          in clusters.

    · High capacity. Prior to he cellular system, mobile radio users were not
       always able to gain access to the radio network and frequently access
       required multiple attempts.

    · The concept of cells. The idea is to divide a large geographic area
       into cells, shown as the hexagons in Figure 5-4. The actual shape of
       the cells is influenced by obstructions such as hills and buildings, but
       the hexagonal shape is used to convey the concept of cells. The cells
       are arranged in clusters and the total number of channels available
       is divided among the cells in a cluster and the full set is repeated in
       each cluster. In Figure 5-4, 3-, 7-, and 12-cell clusters are shown. As
       will be explained later, the number of cells in a cluster affects both
       capacity (the fewer cells the better) and interference (the more cells per
       cluster, the further apart cells operating at the same frequency are, and
       so interference is less).

    · Frequency reuse. Frequencies used in one cell are reused in the
       corresponding cell in another cluster. As the cells are relatively close, it
       is important to dynamically control the power radiated by each radio,
       as radios in one cell will produce interference in other clusters.

   The shape of a cell depends on many factors. In a flat desert the coverage
area of each basestation would be circular, so that with a cluster of cells
there would be overlapping circles of coverage. (Power levels are adjusted to
minimize the overlap of these circles.) Buildings, hills, lakes, etc., affect cell
size. In a city, what is called the urban canyon effect, or urban waveguide
effect greatly distorts cells and creates havoc in managing cellular systems
[9-11]. In the urban canyon effect, good coverage extends for large distances
down a street (see the inside front cover).

   Achieving maximum frequency reuse is essential in achieving high
capacity. In a conventional wireless system, be it broadcast or the mobile
telephone service, basestations are separated by sufficient distance such that
the signal levels fall below a noise threshold before the same frequencies are
reused, as shown in Figure 5-5. There is clearly poor geographical use of the

ventional radio system. The two
transmitters, 1, are at the centers
of the coverage circles defined by
the background noise threshold.

                         spectrum here. The geographic areas could be pushed closer to each other at
                         the expense of introducing what is called cochannel interference--a receiver
                         could pick up transmissions from two or more basestations operating at the
                         same frequency. This is strictly avoided so that interference in conventional
                         radio systems results solely from background noise. In a cellular system,
                         there is a radical departure in concept from this. Consider the interference in
                         a cellular system as shown in Figure 5-6. The signals in corresponding cells in
                         different clusters interfere with each other and the interference is much larger
                         than that of the background noise. Generally only in rural areas and when
                         mobile units are near the boundaries of cells will the background noise level
                         be significant. Interference can also be controlled by dynamically adjusting
                         the basestation and mobile transmit powers to the minimum acceptable
                         level. Tolerating interference from neighboring clusters is a key concept in
                         cellular radio.

                            The analog 1G AMPS system, which uses frequency modulation, has a
                         qualitative minimum SIR of 17 dB (about a factor of 50) that was determined
                         via subjective tests with a criterion that 75% of listeners ranked the voice
                         quality as good or excellent. The seven-cell clustering shown in Figure 5-
RF SYSTEMS                                                                      181

strength indicator (RSSI) during movement of a mobile unit through cells; and (c) RSSI of a
mobile unit showing the handoff triggering event.

6 does not yield this required minimum SIR. So either a 12-cell cluster is
required or directed antennas are used, as these provide enough SIR.

   The 2G and 3G digital cellular systems use error correction coding and can
tolerate high levels of interference and can reuse frequency channels more
efficiently. Indeed, in the 3G CDMA system the tolerance to interference is
so high that the concept of clustering is not required and every frequency
channel is available in each cell.

   In 4G and 5G cellular radio interference must be low to enable high-order
modulation to be used. The high modulation efficiencies more than makes
up for the reduced frequency reuse.

5.3.2 Personal Communication Services

The personal communication services (PCS) concept was implemented
in the early 1990s and was a development in the thinking of cellular
communications. In PCS, the concept is that communication is from person
to person, whereas in cellular radio communication as originally conceived,
it was from terminal-to-terminal. The idea is that when a call is placed, an
individual is being contacted rather than a piece of hardware. One way this
is achieved is by using a card, a subscriber identification module (SIM
card), to identify the user. A user can insert his or her SIM card into any
(appropriate) handset and the handset becomes personalized. The term PCS
is not commonly used now, as the concept has been incorporated in all
evolved cellular systems.

5.3.3 Call Flow and Handoff

Mobile users can be expected to move frequently between cells and thus
handoff procedures for transferring connections from one cell to the next
are necessary. The triggering events that initiate handoff are shown in Figure
5-7. The main aspect is monitoring of the signal strength, the received signal
strength indicator (RSSI), both in the handset for the signal received from a
182  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     basestation and in the basestation for the signal received from a handset. If
     either of these falls below a threshold, computers in the basestation initiate
     a handoff procedure by polling nearby basestations for the RSSI they have
     for the user. If a suitable RSSI is found handoff proceeds and the other
     basestation takes control of the RF link to the mobile terminal.

     5.3.4 Cochannel Interference

     The minimum signal detectable in conventional wireless systems is
     determined by the received SIR. In cellular wireless systems the dominant
     interference is due to other transmitters in the cell and adjacent cells.
     The noise that is produced in the signal band from other transmitters
     operating at the same frequency is called cochannel interference. The level
     of cochannel interference is dependent on cell placement and the frequency
     reuse pattern. The degree to which cochannel interference can be controlled
     has a large effect on system capacity. Control of cochannel interference is
     largely achieved by controlling the power levels at the basestation and at the
     mobile units.

     5.4 Multiple Access Schemes

     Many schemes have been developed to enable multiple users to share a
     frequency band. The simplest scheme requiring the least sophistication in
     channel management is the frequency division multiple access (FDMA)
     scheme, shown in Figure 5-8(a), where the numerals indicate a particular
     user. In FDMA the available spectrum is divided by frequency, with each
     user assigned a narrow frequency band that is kept for the duration of a call.
     This can be conveniently implemented in analog radio. In duplex operation
     a frequency channel is assigned for the uplink as well as the downlink. An
     example of where FDMA is used is AMPS, where 30 kHz is assigned to each
     channel. Clearly this is wasteful of spectrum, as not all of the band is used
     continuously.

        In the first digital access technique, time division multiple access
     (TDMA), shown in Figure 5-8(b), a bitstream is divided among a few users
     using the same physical channel. In the GSM mobile phone system,1 a
     physical channel is divided into eight time slots and a user is allocated to
     each so that eight users can be supported in each physical channel. Thus the
     logical channels are divided in both frequency and time. In a TDMA system,
     the basestation transmits a continuous stream of data containing frames
     of time slots for multiple users. The mobile unit listens to this continuous
     stream, extracting and processing only the time slots assigned to it. On the
     reverse transmission, the mobile unit transmits to the basestation in bursts
     only in its assigned time slots. This is yet another complication to the RF
     design of TDMA systems. The RF circuitry operates in a burst mode with
     constraints on settling time. One of the advantages of GSM is that multiple
     slots can be assigned to the same user to support high data rates and time

     1 GSM stands for the 2G Global System for Mobile Communications and was formerly known as
       Groupe Spe´cial Mobile. The system was deployed worldwide in 1991. An interesting footnote
       is that the GSM group began discussions leading to the system in 1982. By the mid-1980s
       there were many different versions of the GSM system in Europe. The European Union (EU)
       intervened and all member countries adopted a single standard.

slots can be skipped.
   Another technique that can be used in digital radio is spread spectrum

(SS [12]), the invention of which is attributed to Hedwig Kiesler Markey2.
Most of the development of spread spectrum was secret up until the mid-
1970s. There are two main types of spread-spectrum techniques used in
multiuser communication: direct sequence, and frequency hopping. It is both
an access technique and a way to secure communications. Direct sequence
code division multiple access (DS-CDMA)3 is shown in Figure 5-8(c). DS-
CDMA mixes the baseband signal with a broadband spreading code signal
to produce a broadband signal that is then used to modulate an RF signal
[13-15]. This process is illustrated in Figure 5-9. The rate of the spreading
code is referred to as the chip rate rather than the bit rate, which is reserved
for the rate of the information-bearing signal. A unique code is used to

  render radio-guided torpedoes immune from jamming using a piano roll to hop among 88
  carrier frequencies.

     "scramble" the original baseband signal, and the original signal can only
     be recovered using that particular code. The system can support many users,
     with each user assigned a unique code, hence the term code division multiple
     access (CDMA). Another interpretation of the DS-CDMA process is shown
     in Figure 5-10(a). One of the unique characteristics is that different users are
     using the same frequency band at the same time. CDMA is used in the 3G
     wideband CDMA (WCDMA) system.

        Another form of CDMA access is the frequency-hopping CDMA scheme
     (FH-CDMA) shown in Figures 5-8(d) and 5-10(b). This scheme uses
     frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) to separate users. For one
     particular user, a code is used to determine the hopping sequence and hops
     can occur faster than the data rate. The signal can only be reassembled at the
     receiver if the hopping code is known. FH-CDMA is useful in unregulated
     environments, such as an ad hoc radio network, where it is not possible to
     coordinate multiple users. In this case, two users can transmit information
     in the same frequency band at the same time with error correction for
     occasional errors. FH-CDMA is commonly used in radios for emergency
     workers and by the military.
RF SYSTEMS                                                                       185

   Another multiple access scheme is carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA),
which is used in the WiFi system (IEEE 802.11). The access scheme is
illustrated in Figure 5-8(e). This scheme is also used in hostile environments
where various radios cannot be well coordinated. In CSMA, users transmit
at different times, but without coordination. A terminal unit listens to
the channel and transmits a data packet when it is free. Collisions are
unavoidable and data are lost, requiring re-transmission of data, but the
terminals use a random delay before re-transmitting data. In the case of WiFi
there are several channels and if collisions are excessive another channel can
be selected either as the preferred start-up channel or in evolved systems
under central unit control.

   Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is used in
worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) and in 4G
and 5G cellular radio. It overcomes many of the performance limitations
encountered with CSMA as assignment of effective channels is used.
OFDMA builds on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
introduced in Section 5.10.2.

5.5 Spectrum Efficiency

The concept of spectral efficiency is important in contrasting digital radio
systems. Spectral efficiency has its origins in Shannon's theorem, which
expresses the information-carrying capacity of a channel as [16-18]

            C^ = Bc log2(1 + SNR),                           (5.1)

where C^ is the capacity in units of bits per second (bit/s), Bc is the channel
bandwidth in hertz, and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio. N is assumed to
be Gaussian noise, so interference that can be approximated as Gaussian can
be incorporated by adding the noise and interference powers, and then it is
more appropriate to use the SIR. Thus Equation (5.1) becomes

            C^ = Bc log2[1 + S/(N + I)] = Bc log2(1 + SIR).  (5.2)

   Shannon's theorem is widely accepted as the upper limit on the
information-carrying capacity of a channel. So the stronger the signal, or
the lower the interfering signal, the greater a channel's information-carrying
capacity. Indeed, if there is no noise and no interference, the information-
carrying capacity is infinite. Shannon's capacity formula indicates that
increasing the interference level (lower SIR) has a more weakened effect on
the decrease in capacity than may initially be expected; that is, doubling
the interference level does not halve C^. This is the conceptual insight that
supports the use of closely packed cells and frequency reuse, as the resulting
increase in interference, and its moderated effect on capacity, is offset by
having more cells and supporting more users.

   Shannon's carrying capacity limit has not been reached, but today's radio
systems are very close. Current systems operate with SNRs only a few
decibels away from the limit [16]. Different modulation and radio schemes
come closer to the limit, and two quantities will be introduced here to
describe the performance of different schemes. From the capacity formula,
a useful metric for the performance of modulation schemes can be defined.
This is the modulation efficiency (also referred to as the channel efficiency,
186  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     channel spectrum efficiency, and channel spectral efficiency),

     c = Rc/Bc,                                                      (5.3)

     where Rc (in bit/s) is the bit rate transmitted on the channel, so c has the
     units of bit/s/Hz. The unit is dimensionless, as hertz has the units of s-1.

        In a cellular system, the number of cells in a cluster must be incorporated
     to obtain a system metric [19]. The available channels are divided among
     the cells in a cluster, and a channel in one cell appears as interference
     to a corresponding cell in another cluster. Thus the SIR is increased and
     the capacity of the channel drops. System throughput increases, however,
     because of closely packed cells. So the system throughput is a function of
     the frequency reuse pattern. The appropriate system-level metric is the radio
     spectrum efficiency, r, which incorporates the number of cells, K, in a
     cluster:

     r = Rb = c Rb ,                                                 (5.4)
            BcK K Rc

     where Rb is the bit rate of useful information Rc, (Rc is higher than Rb
     because of coding). Coding is used to enable error correction, assist in
     identifying the start and end of a packet, and also to provide orthogonality of
     users in some systems that overlap users as with CDMA. The units of r are
     bit/s/Hz/cell. The decrease in channel capacity resulting from the increased
     SIR associated with fewer cells in a cluster (i.e., lower K) is more than offset
     by the increased system throughput.

        So there are two definitions of spectral efficiency: the channel spectrum
     efficiency (also known as the modulation efficiency), c, which characterizes
     the efficiency of a modulation scheme, and the radio spectrum efficiency, r,
     which incorporates the added interference that comes from frequency reuse.
     Commonly both measures of efficiency are referred to as spectral efficiency,
     and then only the units identify which is being referred to.

        One may well ask why efficiency is not expressed as a ratio of actual bit
     rate to Shannon's limit for a given set of conditions. There are several reasons:

        1. The historical use of bits per hertz to characterize a modulation scheme
            was used long before cellular systems came about.

        2. Shannon's capacity limit is so high that back in the 1950s people would
            have been talking about extremely low efficiencies if performance was
            referred to the capacity limit.

        3. Only additive white noise is considered, but this does not capture
            all types of interference, which can be multiplicative or partially
            correlated with the signal. Shannon's limit is not really a theoretical
            limit, there is no proof. In the digital communications world, much
            has been published about how close Shannon's capacity limit can
            be approached. In a direct LOS system, such as a point-to-point
            microwave link, the limit is now approached within a few percent.
            In MIMO systems, (see Section 5.10.5) the limit has been exceeded,
            prompting a redefinition of the limit when multiple transmit and
            receive antennas are used.

EXAMPLE 5.1 Modulation Efficiency

A radio uses a modulation scheme based on 16-QAM but the four constellation points
corresponding to the largest signal are not used. Consequently the distortion that would
occur in RF amplifiers is reduced. Even though there are 4 bits of information per symbol
for the symbols that are actually used, not every possible combination of the bits is used.
Ignoring error correction coding all of the bits modulated are information bits.

Solution:

     diagram.

         (c) On average, how many bits of information are transmitted per symbol?
              It takes 8 symbols to transmit 3 bits of information and 16 symbols to transmit 4 bits. With
              12QAM 8 symbols are sent in the first clock tick interval and 4 symbols are borrowed
              from the second clock tick interval to provide 16 symbols combined and hence 4 bits
              of information. There are 8 symbols left over in the second clock tick interval and these
              can be used to send 3 bits. Thus over two clock tick intervals 7 bits of information are
              sent. Thus in one clock tick interval 3.5 bits are transmitted. So the number of bits of
              information sent by each symbol is 3.5 bits.

         (d) What is the maximum possible modulation efficiency, c, in bit/s/Hz?
              Ideally c is equal to the number of bits per symbol. However not all of the symbol
              transitions are of equal length and the bandwidth must be high enough to allow the
              longer transitions to take place in the same amount of time as the short transitions.
              However the maximum possible modulation efficiency is 3.5 bit/s/Hz.

5.6 Processing Gain

In digital radio the demodulated signal is a binary signal that includes
information bits, coding bits, as well as bits that are in error which
contributes to a raw bit error rate (BER). In the receiver decoding creates a
smaller bitstream with just the information bits and which has a relatively
low BER. Another way of looking at what happens is that the signal-to-
interference ratio (SIR) of the decoded signal divided by the SIR of the
raw signal represents a gain and this gain is called the processing gain.
In 2G cellular radio this processing gain is also called the coding gain.
With 3G spreading codes are used in addition to error correction codes
with both reducing the bit error rate but now the gain from despreading
is called spreading gain and the gain from error correction coding is called
coding gain. The processing gain is now the product of spreading gain and
coding gain. With 4G and 5G the functions of the spreading codes and error
correction codes merge so just the term processing gain is used.

5.6.1 Energy of a Bit

Processing gain (GP ) occurs when demodulating and recovering an
information bitstream and is the ratio of the SIR of the processed signal
to the SIR of the unprocessed signal so GP captures the amount that the
SIR increases. GP is a measure of the additional noise immunity obtained

information, baseband, and channel bit rates, respectively.

                         through decoding and demodulation. There are various formulas for GP
                         depending on whether the processed signal is the baseband bitstream with
                         or without error correction coding, and whether the unprocessed signal is
                         the analog RF signal, the channel bitstream, or the channel symbol (i.e. chip)
                         stream. Processing gain is an essential concept in cellular radio and really
                         is what makes it work. In the following, reference will be made to three
                         bitstreams in the transmitter which will be recovered in the receiver. The
                         first is the information bitstream with a bit rate Ri (in units of bit/s). To
                         this error correction coding can be used to produce a baseband bitstream
                         with baseband bit rate Rb > Ri. In some generations of radio the baseband
                         bitstream is modulated on a carrier and the baseband bitstream is the same
                         as the channel bitstream. The bitstreams are shown in the depiction in Figure
                         5-11(a) of the information flow in 2G cellular radio.

                            In 3G cellular radio relatively fast spreading codes merged with the
                         baseband bitstream to produce a much faster channel bitstream with bit
                         rate Rc  Rb. The introduction of this separate third bitstream is the
                         depiction in Figure 5-11(b) of the information flow in 3G cellular radio.
                         The third bitstream is the channel bitstream with bit rate Rc and this
                         is the bitstream that is modulated to produce a modulated signal with a
RF SYSTEMS                                                                                        189

constellation diagram where each symbol representing b bits.
   In 4G and 5G cellular radio error correction codes are merged with the

information bitstream to produce a baseband bitstream and this is spread
during a first stage of the modulation process which produces an analog
intermediate frequency modulated signal. Details of this process will be
given later. There is not a separate spreading code so that the baseband and
channel bitstreams are the same and Rc = Rb.

   Derivation of the coding, spreading, and processing gains is based on the
energy of a bit and the energy of the noise in the interval corresponding to
a bit. The energy of a bit in the xth bitstream (x = i, b, c for information,
baseband, and channel respectively) is denoted Eb,x and the energy of the
noise corresponding to the duration of the bit is denoted No,x. The digital
equivalent of the analog SIR is Eb/No (pronounced E-B-N-O for EBNO) and
the effective SIR of the xth bitstream is

            SIReff,x = Eb,x .                   (5.5)
                          No,x

A bitstream of course is a binary signal and the noise in the bitstream is
manifested as binary errors in the bitstream. Consider a sequence of 7 bits,
ideally 1001110, with one of the bits being in error so that the bitstream
recovered is 1001010 where 1 bit in 7 is in error so SIReff = 7.

5.6.2 Coding Gain

There are many types of error correction coding schemes with some schemes
better for certain types of errors4. Generalizing, with each extra error
correcting bit added to an information bitstream to produce the baseband
bitstream, one error in the recovered bitstream can be corrected. Thus the
processing gain due to coding (and often called just coding gain) in going
from the baseband to the information bitstream is

            GP C = SIReff,i = Eb,i/No,i = Rb .  (5.6)
                      SIReff,b Eb,b/No,b Ri

This is a bit-wise processing gain as it applies to bitstreams. The coding
gain here is not restricted to error correction coding as there are other
types of codes called spreading codes that have a similar property of
providing redundancy that can be used to remove errors. Not codes are 100%
effective. However Equation (5.6) is the best simple measure of processing
gain when only bitstreams are considered. It provides the coding gain of
one bitstream derived from a second bitstream to which coding has been
used to randomize and increase the rate of a bitstream and thus introduce
redundancy.

4 The error codes used in cellular radio are forward error correction (FEC) codes also called
  channel codes. There are many FEC codes broadly categorized as either block codes (because
  they work on blocks of data) or convolution codes (because they work on arbitrary-length
  bitstreams). The various FEC codes use different models (i.e. assumptions) about the types
  of errors encountered. The selection of the FEC code to use is a design choice based on the
  available computing power and the nature of the errors, e.g. random or long strings of errors.
190  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     5.6.3 Spreading Gain

     Equation (5.6) can be rearranged so that the information EBNO is

     Eb,i = GP C Eb,b .                                                    (5.7)
     No,i   No,b

        The processing gain determined in Equation (5.6) applies to bitstreams and
     does not include the effect of modulation. A second form of the processing
     gain relates the SIR of the analog RF signal, i.e. SIRRF, to the EBNO of the
     baseband bitstream. To include the effect of modulation it is recognized that
     what is modulated and transmitted are symbols and the transitions from one
     symbol to another. The energy of a symbol is denoted Es and this energy
     is shared by the b bits associated with the symbol. Thus a channel bit will
     have the energy Eb,c = Es/b. In digital radio power levels of transmitted
     signals are adjusted so that at most one received channel bit can be in error
     per received symbol. Thus if received noise results in a symbol error it will
     affect just one bit. That is, the symbol noise will be the same as the bit noise,
     No,c = No where No is the noise energy in the duration of one symbol. Thus
     the effective SIR of the channel bitstream is

     SIReff,c = Eb,c = Eb,c = Es/b .                                       (5.8)
            No,c No         No

     Development is completed by relating the energy of a symbol to the RF
     signal energy. For PSK modulation all of the symbols have the same energy.
     (The energy of each symbol is not the same for modulation formats such as
     QAM where symbols have different energy levels and a more sophisticated
     derivation is required than that provided here.) Also the noise energy in the
     duration of a symbol is the same for all symbols for all modulation formats.
     Thus the effective SIR of a symbol is

            SIRRF = Es .                                                   (5.9)
                        No

     Thus the effective SIR of the channel bitstream is (combining Equations (5.8)
     and (5.9),

     SIReff,c = Eb,c = 1 SIRRF.                                            (5.10)
                   No,c b

        The processing gain relating the EBNO of the recovered baseband
     bitstream to the SIR of the RF signal can be defined as the processing gain due
     to spreading and modulation and this is sometimes called just the spreading
     gain GP S. It is defined here as the ratio of the effective SIR of the baseband
     bitstream and the RF SIR (and using Equation (5.10)):

     GP S = Eb,b/No,b = 1 Eb,b/No,b = 1 SIReff,b .                         (5.11)
     SIRRF  b SIReff,c b SIReff,c

     This can be rearranged so that the EBNO of the baseband bitstream is

     Eb,b = GP S SIRRF.                                                    (5.12)
     No,b

                                                  is not changed but the despread signal is
                                                  confined to a narrower bandwidth called
                                                  the baseband bandwith; (c) a signal with

                                                  spreading where the power of the interferer
                                                  spread across the the original bandwidth.

   Equation (5.11) includes the ratio of the effective SIRs of two bitstreams
and this was related to the bit rates of the bitstreams in Equation (5.6) where
the faster bitstream is coded (or spread) to enable recovery from errors. Using
the result in Equation (5.6), Equation (5.11) can be written as

                  GP S = 1 SIReff,b = 1 Rc .                (5.13)
                            b SIReff,c b Rb

Using this the EBNO of the baseband bitstream is

            Eb,b = SIReff,b = 1 Rc SIRRF = 1 GP C SIRRF.    (5.14)
            No,b  b Rb                         b

Then the EBNO of the information bitstream is

Eb,i = GP C Eb,b = GP C GP S SIRRF = GP SIRRF = 1 Rc SIRRF  (5.15)
No,i        No,b                                  b Ri

where the processing gain GP = GP C GP S.                   (5.16)

5.6.4 Spreading Gain in Terms of Bandwidth

The spreading gain that results from spreading a baseband bitstream in a
transmitter and then despreading in a receiver is illustrated graphically in
Figure 5-12. The modulated signal shown in Figure 5-12(a) is the "spread
signal" which here has a power density which is below that of the noise.
Following despreading all of the energy in the modulated RF signal is
correlated with the spreading code (it was spread using the spreading
code) and is collapsed to the despread signal shown in Figure 5-12(b). Only
the signal correlated to the despreading code is collapsed to the smaller
baseband bandwidth. Noise is rearranged with the spectral density of the
noise unchanged so that the total noise energy in the baseband for the
duration of a bit of data, i.e. the noise in the baseband bandwidth Bb, is
192  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     greatly reduced by the ratio of the modulated bandwidth to the baseband

     bandwidth.
        In Equation (5.13) Rc is related to the bandwidth Bm of the modulated

     carrier by the modulation efficiency as c = Rc/Bm(see Equation (5.3)). Also
     the minimum bandwidth of a baseband bitstream with a bit rate Rb is the
     baseband bandwidth Bb = Rc. So Equation (5.13) becomes

     GP S = c Bm .                                  (5.17)
                b Bb

     Ideally for a modulation scheme c = b so that

     GP S,ideal = Bm .                              (5.18)
                     Bb

        For all modulation schemes other than BPSK where c can be very close
     to b, the spreading gain will be less than GP S,ideal as in reality c < b, see
     Table 2-2. If both spreading and error correction coding are used the two
     processing gains in Equations (5.6) and (5.17) can be multiplied.

     5.6.5 Symbol Error Rate and Bit Error Rate

     With digital modulation, symbols (i.e., groups of bits) are transmitted rather
     than individual bits. As the modulation order increases, the number of
     symbols increases and there is a smaller margin between the symbols. That
     is, on a constellation diagram there are more symbols and the symbols are
     closer together. For the same signal and noise levels, as the modulation order
     increases the probability of a symbol error will increase and thus the symbol
     error rate (SER) increases. However the bit error rate (BER) increases more
     slowly than the SER. This is because if the SIR is high enough, the only
     possible errors will be nearest-neighbor errors (on a constellation diagram).
     If there are at least b bits per symbol the BER will be less than the symbol
     error rate by a factor of b as errors are at most one bit per symbol since the
     modulation order or the signal power level are adjusted to ensure this. If
     it is not possible to achieve a maximum of one bit error per symbol error
     then communication is lost. The rest of this section treats this analysis more
     mathematically.

        The discussion begins with the SIR of the incoming RF signal. Through
     sampling of the RF signal at appropriate times (determined by the recovered
     carrier) discrete symbols are obtained. The digital form of SIR relates the
     energy of a symbol, Es, to the noise and interference energy corresponding
     to the symbol (the noise and interference in the duration of the symbol). The
     height of the double-sided noise spectral density is conventionally taken as
     No/2, so the noise power corresponding to a symbol is No. Thus [16-18]

     Es = SIR.                                      (5.19)
     No

     Error in a digitally modulated communications system is first manifested
     as a symbol error that occurs when a symbol selected in a receiver is not the
     symbol transmitted. The probability of a symbol error is a function of Es/No.
     However it is not always possible to develop a closed-form expression
     relating the two. For a BPSK system it can be derived. The probability of
RF SYSTEMS                                                                                193

where Q(x) is known as the Q function [16] and is the integral of the tail of
the Gaussian density function (see Figure 5-13). It can be expressed in terms
of the error function erf(x) and complementary function erfc(x) [16, page 63]:

                         1       x        1             x
            Q(x) = 2 erfc  = 2 1 - erf  .                       (5.21)
                                    2                   2

For M -PSK [16, page 191] the SER is

         SERM-PSK = Prs     M -PSK         2Q       2Es sin  ,  (5.22)

                                                    No     M

where M is the number of symbols (e.g. for 8-QPSK M = 8). To see the effect
of higher-order modulation (i.e., higher M ) consider Equation (5.22). As the
order of modulation increases, M increases, and the argument of Q reduces,
thus increasing SER.

   The per-bit SIR is obtained after noting that each symbol can represent
several bits. With a uniform constellation and the same number of bits per
symbol, b, the signal energy received per bit is

          Eb = Es/b,     b = log2 M,                            (5.23)
and M = 2b.                                                     (5.24)

For high SIR, a symbol error is the erroneous selection of a nearest neighbor
symbol by the receiver. So with Gray code mapping (also called Gray
mapping), such a symbol error results in only a single bit being in error.
Thus the probability of a bit error, the BER, is

                         Pr[bit error] = Prb = 1 Prs.           (5.25)
                                                     b

The final results are the bit error probabilities for BPSK and M-PSK [16, page

Thus for the same SIR the probability of bit errors, the BER, grows with
higher-order modulation (i.e., larger M ), but not as fast as SER. At the same
time the number of bits transmitted increases. These extra bits are use to
194                 STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

                       embed error correction codes. The net gain in throughput can be tremendous
                       as long as the SIR is high enough.

EXAMPLE 5.2 Symbol Error Rate

     Calculate the SER and BER for QPSK and 8-PSK if the SIR is 10 dB.

     Solution:
     SER is found by evaluating Equation (5.22). For SIR = 10 dB, Es/No= 10(SIRdB/10) = 10.
     For QPSK, M = 4 and b = 2, and the SER is

     SERQPSK = PrsM -PSK   2Q                    2Es sin   = 2Q 20 sin

     = 2Q(3.162) = 1 - erf(3.162/ 2) = 0.001565.

     For 8-PSK, M = 8 and b = 3, and the SER is

     SER8-PSK = PrsM-PSK  2Q                     2Es sin   = 2Q 20 sin

     The corresponding BERs are
        BERQPSK = 21 SERQPSK = 0.000783 and BER8-PSK = 31 SER8-PSK = 0.0290. (5.30)

     5.6.6 Summary

     The formulas for processing gain developed above are only approximate
     as many simplifications were made. One assumption is that the error
     correction coding is fully randomized bits but in practice there are many
     error correction codes that address particular types of errors. The aim of
     error correction coding is to recover from errors not necessarily to achieve
     processing gain.

        Another caveat to the processing gain formulas developed here is that it
     considered the energy of a symbol as being the same for all symbols. While
     this is true for PSK modulation it is not true for all modulation formats.
     Considerable effort is put into developing better estimates that capture the
     essence of processing gain but in a more rigorous manner. Still the simple
     formulas provide the required insight into the effect of using error correction
     and spreading codes.

        In 2G cellular radio processing gain is achieved using error correction
     codes alone and a separate spreading code is not used. Thus in 2G the
     baseband bits are also the channel bits used directly in modulating the
     RF carrier. The extra bits provide redundancy and the ability to recover
     from some errors resulting from noise. In 3G spreading codes as well as
     error correcting codes are used. A spreading code greatly increases the bit
     rate of the channel bitstream above that of the baseband bitstream and the
     bandwidth of the modulated carrier is much greater than that needed to
     transmit the baseband bitstream. Generally error correcting codes do not
     increase the bit rate by more than a factor of 2. Thus in 3G the processing gain
     achieved with the error correction codes is almost insignificant compared to

that obtained from spreading the signal.
   In 4G and 5G error correction coding also provides spreading and there is

not a separate spreading code. The 4G and 5G systems have great complexity.
   A summary of the key results for processing gain is given in in Table 5-2.

EXAMPLE 5.3 Processing Gain

A new communication system is being investigated for sending data to a printer. The system
will use GMSK modulation and a channel with 10 MHz bandwidth and the baseband bit
rate will be 1 Mbit/s. The modulation format will result in a spectrum that distributes (i.e.
spreads) power almost uniformly over the 10 MHz bandwidth.

(a) What is the processing gain?
     The most efficient way to spread the signal across the 10 MHz of available bandwidth is
    to use a combination of error correction and spreading. Referring to Table 2-2, GMSK
     has a modulation efficiency c of 1.354 bit/s/Hz, so that the channel bit rate Rc =
     13.54 Mbit/s. Each symbol in GMSK represents two bits so b = 2. The information
     bit rate Ri = 1 Mbit/s and so coding at the rate of 12.54 Mbit/s will be used and
     Rb = (Ri + 12.54 Mbit/s) = 13.54 Mbit/s.
     There are two processing gains. The coding gain is determined using Equation (5.6):

            GP C = Rb = 13.54 Mbit/s = 13.54 = 11.31 dB.
            Ri                                 1 Mbit/s

The spreading gain, using Equation (5.13), is

            GP S = 1 Rc b R = b 21 1 Mbit/s 1 Mbit/s = 0.5 = -3 dB.

Thus the processing gain
                                   GP = GP C GP S = 6.77 = 8.31 dB.
196  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     Another way of calculating the spreading gain is to consider the modulated bandwidth,
     Bm = 10 MHz and the baseband bandwidth Bb = 1 MHz (taken to be numerically
     equal to Rb). The processing gain due to spreading, from Equation (5.17):

     GP S = c Bm = 1.354 10 MHz = 6.770 = 8.31 dB.
     b Bb                           2 1 MHz

     (b) If the received RF SIR is SIRRF = 6 dB, what is the effective system SIR (or Eb/No) after

     the digital signal processor?

     Effective SIR = Eb,i = GP SIRRF = 8.31 dB + 6 dB = 14.32 dB.
                           No,i

EXAMPLE 5.4 Signal-to-Interference Ratio

      At the output of a receiver antenna, the level of interfering signals is 1 pW, the level of
      background noise is 500 fW, and the level of the desired signal is 4 pW.

      (a) What is the SIR? Note that SIR includes the effect of the signal, interference, and noise.
      (b) If the processing gain is 20 dB and 16-QAM is the modulation scheme used, what is the

           effective system SIR, that is, what is the signal energy in a bit versus the noise energy in
           the duration of the bit (i.e., Eb/No)?

      Solution:

      (a) Interfering signal PI = 1 pW, noise signal PN = 500 fW, and signal PS = 4 pW.

                             SIRRF = PS /(PI + PN )
                                       = 4 pW/(1 pW + 0.5 pW) = 4/1.5 = 2.667 = 4.26 dB.

      (b) Processing gain GP = 20 dB so, from Equation (5.15),

                         Effective SIR = Eb,i =GP · SIRRF = 20 dB + 4.26 dB = 24.26 dB.
                                                No

                   5.7 Early Generations of Cellular Phone Systems

                       The evolution of cellular communications is described by generations of
                       radio. The major mobile communication systems are outlined in Table 5-3.
                       No 0G and 1G systems remain and 2G systems are being phased out with
                       only the 2G GSM system still in use. Third generation (3G) offers a significant
                       increase in capacity and is optimized for broadband data access. The 0G-
                       2G systems were plagued by many incompatible systems. Even with 3G
                       there were several incompatible systems but the system known as WCDMA
                       became overwhelmingly dominant. With 4G the evolution coalesced and
                       while there were many modulation methods a standardized interface was
                       developed with the physical interface defined as common. The 4G radio,
                       and also 5G, support many modulation methods and frequency bands and
                       cellular radios support a large number of these combinations. In part this is
                       because the bulk of the modulation is now performed in a DSP unit making
                       the switching of modulation methods a simple process of using a different
                       algorithm. The development of 4G, 5G (and beyond) has been guided by
                       the Third Generation Partnership, 3GPP, which developed a plan called long
                       term evolution (LTE) that ensured upwards compatibility as the capability of
                       the systems were enhanced every year or two eventually becoming 5G.

generation systems handled analog 3 kHz voice transmissions with very
limited ability to transmit digital information limited to signaling.

5.8.2 2G, Second Generation: Digital Radio

The second generation (2G) of cellular radio is characterized by digitization.
Many different types of 2G digital systems were installed around the world.
The 2G systems can transmit data and voice at rates of 8-14.4 kbit/s.
This can be contrasted to the wireline phone system where, once signals
reach the exchange, the 3 kHz analog signals are sampled at 64 kbit/s to
achieve an undistorted signal representation. These cellular systems sacrifice
some voice quality but use reasonably sophisticated algorithms that use the
characteristics of speech to achieve greater than a factor of four compression.

   In North America the first digital system introduced was the digital
advanced mobile phone system (DAMPS) (originally known as North
American Digital Cellular [NADC] and as the EIA/TIA interim standard
IS-54). The system was designed to provide a transition from the then
current 1G analog system to a fully digital system by reusing existing
spectrum. The idea was that system providers could allocate a few of their
channels for digital radio out of the total available. As analog radio was
phased out, more of the channels could be committed to digital radio. The
main motivation behind this system is that it provided three to five times
the capacity of the analog system for the same bandwidth. The 2G GSM
system provides a similar increase in capacity, and is compatible with the
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) which was the protocol used
with the wired telephone system. The GSM system was initially (early 1990s)
dominant in Europe and had the advantage that it did not need to coexist

                  system are shown in Tables 5-5 and 5-6.

                     From an RF design perspective, the main differences between analog and
                  digital standards are

                     1. The RF envelope. In AMPS, FM was used, which produces a constant
                         envelope RF signal. Consequently, high-efficiency saturation mode
                         amplifiers (such as Class C) can be used. In most digital modulation
                         schemes the modulation results in a nonconstant envelope. This
                         is true for PSK modulation, as the transition from one symbol to
                         another does not follow a circle on the constellation diagram. The
                         information contained in the amplitude of the RF signal is just as
                         important as the information contained in the phase or frequency of
                         the signal. Consequently, with digital radio saturation mode amplifiers
                         that severely distort the amplitude characteristic must be avoided.

                     2. Bursty RF. In an analog system, RF power is continually being
                         transmitted. In a digital system, transmission is intermittent and the
                         RF signal is bursty. Therefore an RF designer must be concerned about
                         turn-on transients and thermal stability of the power amplifier.

5.9 3G, Third Generation: Code Division Multiple Acces
       (CDMA)

Originally there were multiple 3G cellular radio systems but the one that
became dominant uses code division multiple access. This section begins
with a precursor to 3G and which is now called 2.5G cellular radio and this is
relatively narrowband, 1.23 MHz-wide, CDMA. The 3G system uses 5 MHz-
wide wideband CDMA (WCDMA).

5.9.1 Generation 2.5: Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple
         Access

CDMA, or more specifically CDMAOne, was initially promoted as being
third generation, but the definition now is that data rates of at least 2 Mbit/s
must be supported in 3G. Thus CDMAOne is now referred to as 2.5G. A
depiction of spread spectrum is shown in Figure 5-14, in which a very fast
code is superimposed on a slower data sequence and the combined code is
used to modulate a carrier. The same fast code is used to extract the baseband
signal from the received bitstream. The effect of the fast code is to greatly
spread out the baseband signal, transforming perhaps a 12 kbit/s baseband
bitstream into an RF signal with a bandwidth of 1.23 MHz.

   The key feature of the DS-CDMA system is the use of lengthy codes
to spread the spectrum of the signal that is to be transmitted. In the case
of voice, an 8 kbit/s bitstream, for example, with error correction coding
becomes a 12.5 kbit/s baseband bitstream that is mixed with a much faster
code that is unique to a particular user. Thus the 8 kbit/s bitstream becomes
a 1.23 MHz-wide analog baseband signal. This signal is then modulated up
to RF and transmitted. On the receiver side, the demodulated RF signal can
only be decoded using the original fast code. Use of the original code to
decode the signal rejects virtually all interference and noise in the received
signal. Despreading distributes the signal and noise components differently.
Upon despreading, the noise is still distributed uniformly in frequency while
the information-bearing signal is concentrated in a narrow bandwidth, the
bandwidth of the baseband signal. Tremendous processing gain is available
using this spreading and despreading approach.

   The mechanism that increases SNR in DS-CDMA is shown in Figure 5-
12. The SNR is enhanced by grouping the signal energy in a narrower
bandwidth and the noise is reduced, as only the noise in a narrower

is the same as data A with some corruption by noise.

               Transmit power control    1 dB power control

               bandwidth is important. In despreading a signal with a single-tone interferer,
               as seen in Figure 5-12(c), the interferer is spread as noise while the signal
               energy is concentrated in the bandwidth of the baseband signal. Since
               orthogonal codes are used, many radio channels can be supported on the
               same radio link. CDMA can support approximately 120 radio channels on
               the same physical channel. Another important feature is that the same 120
               channels can be reused in adjacent cells, as the information bitstream of each
               user can still be extracted. Thus there is no need for clustering as in the 2G
               systems. The attributes of the cellular 2.5G CDMAOne system, an immediate
               precursor to the 3G WCDMA system, are given in Table 5-7.

               5.9.2 Multipath and Rake Receivers

               In a line-of-sight CDMA system the code must be aligned with the data
               stream received so that the stream can be decoded correctly to reveal the
               original data. If there are multiple paths then the paths will, in general,
               have different delays and often the delay differences are more than the chip
               duration (the time allocated to transition from one symbol to another). The
               CDMA signal is then said to be transmitted over a dispersive multipath
               channel. This introduces complexity in aligning codes. The problem that
               arises is shown in Figure 5-15. The original data are shown in (a) and this

                                                                                       excess delay tD. The inte-

is coded using the code in (c) yielding the stream in (d). The stream is just
the exclusive or (XOR) of the data and code. On receiving, the coded data
stream, (d), is despread using the original code (c). If the code and the data
stream are aligned, then an XOR operation results in the data being recovered
correctly by XORing (c) and (d) to obtain (b), the original data A. However, if
the stream is delayed, as shown in (e), then XORing the delayed stream and
the code (which is not delayed) will result in recovered data B, (g), which has
no relationship to the original data in (a). The solution to this problem is to
appropriately delay the despreading code for each propagation-delay path.

   When there are reflections of the transmitted signal, versions of the signal
followig different paths will arrive at the receiver with different delays.
The rake receiver, introduced in the 1950s, recovers the data from each
propagation delay path and combines the signal from each path to produce
a combined signal with a higher SNR than that obtained using just the line-
of-sight component of the signal [20-23].

   A two-path version of the rake receiver is shown in Figure 5-16. The
transmitter spreads the data using a code C1(t) to produce a stream at A
that is transmitted over two paths C and B. Path C is delayed with respect to
path B by a time tD and the signal at the receive antenna, D, is a combination
of the signal following the two paths. On the top path of the receiver, called
a finger, the direct signal (that followed path B) is despread by the original
code C1(t) and, if it is appropriately aligned with the signal that followed
path B, it produces a signal at E that will contain the low-frequency user data
plus a high-frequency component resulting from the wrong code being used
to despread the delayed data stream that followed path C. The signal at E
is lowpass filtered to produce the original data at F as the high frequency
component is eliminated. Since the operation is implemented in DSP, an
integrator is used over the duration of a data bit. The combined received
signal, D, is despread using a delayed code, C1(t - tD), to produce a signal
at G that is integrated so that the data at H is the original D due to the
component that followed path C. The signals at F and H, sampled after the
duration of a bit, will both contain the original data plus some noise and the
noise at the two points will be uncorrelated. When F and H are combined,
the signal will combine coherently while the noise will combine incoherently,
thus improving the SNR.

   The rake receiver can be generalized to have many fingers. After
despreading in each finger of the rake receiver, each delayed component is
demodulated and the results are combined. The rake receiver is so named
because each finger sweeps up information, resembling the tines on a
garden rake collecting leaves. Since each component contains the original
information, if the magnitude and time of arrival (phase) of each component
is computed at the receiver (through a process called channel estimation),

     then all the components can be added coherently to improve the information
     reliability. This method of combining is called maximal-ratio combining
     (MRC), a method of receiver diversity combining in which

        1. the signals from each channel are added together,
        2. the gain of each channel is made proportional to the rms signal level

            and inversely proportional to the mean square noise level in that
            channel, and
        3. different proportionality constants are used for each channel.

     It is also known as ratio-squared combining and predetection combining.
     MRC is optimum combining for independent AWGN channels.

        CDMA, WCDMA, and WLAN (WiFi) units use multipath signals and
     combine them to increase the SNR at the receivers. In contrast, the
     narrowband 2G systems cannot discriminate between the multipath arrivals,
     and multipath has negative impact. The rake receiver in Figure 5-16 has two
     fingers, but the practical limit on the number is based on the expected delay
     spread of the multipaths divided by the chip duration. Only delays that are
     an integer multiple of a chip duration are needed in a rake receiver [21, 22].
     A trade-off must be made in terms of the amount of circuitry and the DC
     power available. In the original CDMA cell phone system (circa 2000), three
     fingers were used in handsets and four to five in basestations. Many more
     are used today.

     5.9.3 3G, Wideband CDMA

     Third-generation radio, (3G), is coordinated by the Third Generation
     Partnership Project (3GPP). This is a collaborative agreement of standards
     development organizations and other related bodies for the production of
     a complete set of globally applicable technical specifications for mobile
     communication systems (see http://www.3gpp.org). Initially the efforts of
     3GPP were directed at establishing the 3G standards but the scope has
     expanded and it develops evolving standards for the transition to 4G and
     now 5G systems. Some of the attributes of 3G are given in Table 5-8.

        The 3G mobile systems support variable data rates depending on demand
     and the level of mobility. Switched-packet radio techniques are required to
RF SYSTEMS                                                                     205

support this bandwidth-on-demand environment. Here the physical channel
is shared (i.e., packet switched) rather than the user being assigned a
physical channel for exclusive use (referred to as circuit switched).

   The drive for 3G systems was partly fueled by the saturation of 2G systems
in many places and a desire to increase revenues by supporting high-speed
data. Prior to the rollout of 3G systems, the increased demand primarily
resulted from an increased consumer base rather than the emergence of
significant data traffic. The increased subscriber base was addressed by
2.5G systems, which have some of the 3G concepts but only partially
implemented. The driving concept of 3G was the development of a standard
that supports high-speed data, global roaming, and supports advanced
features including two-way motion video and internet browsing.

   Third-generation cellular radio is defined by the International Telecom-
munications Union (ITU) [24] and is formally called International Mobile
Telecommunications 2000 (IMT-2000). The basic requirements are for a sys-
tem that supports data rates up to 2 Mbit/s in fixed environments rang-
ing down to 144 kbit/s in wide area mobile environments. In 1999 the ITU
adopted five radio interfaces for IMT-2000:

   1. IMT-DS direct-sequence CDMA, more commonly known as WCDMA;
   2. IMT-MC multi-carrier CDMA, more commonly known as CDMA2000,

       the successor to CDMAOne (specifically international standard IS-95);
   3. IMT-SC time-division CDMA, which includes time division CDMA

       (TD-CDMA) and time division synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA);
   4. IMT-SC single carrier, more commonly known as EDGE; and
   5. IMT-FT frequency time, more commonly known as DECT.

The dominant choice for 3G is WCDMA. In October 2007 the ITU Radio-
communication Assembly included WiMAX-derived technology, specifically
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA, see Figure 5-
8(d)) and MIMO, in the set of IMT-2000 standards as the sixth radio inter-
face. 3GPP [25] provides a migration strategy for cellular communications
through a process called long-term evolution LTE and through a number of
releases each building on prior infrastructure and adding capabilities.

   EDGE has intermediate data speeds between those of GSM and WCDMA.
The following terms are also used to describe networks using the
3G WCDMA specification: Universal Mobile Telecommunication System
(UMTS) (UMTS, in Europe), UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
(UTRAN), and Freedom of Mobile Multimedia Access (FOMA, in Japan).
UMTS is the 3G successor of the GSM standard, with the air interface now
using WCDMA. The terminology used in UMTS, listed in part in Table 5-9, is
based on the terminology used in GSM, with subtle differences. UMTS was
first deployed in Japan in 2001. The term WCDMA describes the physical
interface and protocols that support it, while UMTS refers to the whole
network. A large number of frequency bands are designated for 3G, see
Tables 5-10 and 5-11.

   The 3GPP timeline is summarized in Figure 5-17. The CDMA2000 and
WCDMA paths become the single LTE path beyond 3G. The CDMA2000 (the
IS-2000 standard) path builds on the original CDMA system defined by the
IS-95 standard and commonly known as CDMAOne (the IS-95 standard).
CDMA2000 1xEV-DO is the first evolution of CDMA2000 that meets the ITU
basic specification for 3G. Evolution-data optimized (EV-DO), combines
CDMA and TDMA for higher data throughput.

               The WCDMA and LTE evolution is defined by releases beginning with
            an initial release in 2000 known as Release 99 (Rel-99) [26]. This saw the
            beginning of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifying
            and controlling the evolution of cellular communications through 3G, 4G,
            and now 5G. The releases are designed to protect the installed investment in
            cellular systems while providing a migration path.

            5.9.4 Summary

            WCDMA 3G and 4G are widely deployed. While 3G/WCDMA it will be
            gradually replaced by 4G and 5G it has particular aspects that could see the
            system remain for many years.

     5.10 4G, Fourth Generation Radio

     The 4G cellular system provides downlink data rates of 100 Mbit/s while
     mobile and 1 Gbit/s while stationery. The uplink data rates are much lower
     at 50 Mbit/s. The maximum rates are assigned to a cellular service area and
     are shared but rely on a user's average data rate being much lower. Providing
     these data rates relies on a number of significant advances over 3G:

         · Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Using a very
            large number of narrowband channels, e.g. 1200, with each narrow-
            band channel having the highest-order modulation possible. Each nar-
            rowband channel has its own subcarrier which is individually modu-
            lated. Gets around the multipath problem where poor channel charac-
            teristics affecting a narrow range of frequencies does not limit overall
            bit rates.

         · High-order modulation. A terminal unit supports a very large number
            of modulation formats, several PSK modulation methods and QAM
            methods ranging from 16-QAM to 1024-QAM. Modulation and
            demodulation are implemented in a DSP unit.

         · Cyclic prefix (CP). Enables the use of efficient discrete Fourier
            transforms in the transmitter. Simplifies hardware by yielding lower
            PMEPR than would be obtained if a zero-level guard band was
            provided to overcome interference caused by multipath.

         · Multiple input, multiple output (MIMO). MIMO uses multiple
            antennas to transmit and receive signals exploiting independent
            transmit-receive paths to increase the total capacity between a
            basestation and terminal unit. Multiplies data rates by the number of
            transmit or receive antennas (which ever is less).

         · Pervasive access. Terminal units support many access technologies
            (e.g., 2G-4G, WiFi, Bluetooth etc.) and seamlessly switching among
            them. Since 4G is an IP-based system data can be sent on any network,
            e.g. WiFi utilization reduces the demands on the cellular network.

     These advances require tremendous computing power made available by
     advanced low-power VLSI and developments in low-power RF modems.
     Another critical aspect of 4G (and now 5G) is deployment of a well thought
     out road map called Long Term Evolution (LTE) that enables incremental
     (although significant) advances building on previously implemented
     enhancements.

        The LTE timeline is shown in Figure 5-17, 4G effectively began with
     Release-9 implemented first at the end of 2010 with this release introducing
     MIMO and OFDM (to be defined latter). There are fundamental changes
     to the physical interface, and 4G uses Internet Protocal (IP) exclusively
     including for voice (voice over IP--VoIP). Subsequent releases introduced
     more concepts and increased data coverage. 4G and now 5G can not coexist
     with 3G systems and separate bands must be allocated. Eventually 3G will
     go away. It is worth noting that 5G is upwards compatible with 4G.

        The ITU World Radiocommunication Conference has allocated many
     bands to 4G ranging from 450 MHz to 5850 MHz. There is not a single band
     that can be used world-wide but cellular handsets are designed to support

multiple bands. The features of representative bands are shown in Table 5-
12. Channel bandwidth, with a channel having a single carrier, range from
1.4 MHz to 20 MHz, see Table 5-13. Each carrier has correlated subcarriers
each modulated to produce a subchannel with a 15 kHz-wide bandwidth.

5.10.1 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing

In OFDM, data is divided into many bitstreams with each bitstream
modulating a subcarrier producing a relatively narrowband subchannel and
a user being assigned multiple subchannels. In 4G these subchannels are
15 kHz-wide in normal operation and 7.5 kHz wide in a rich multipath
environment with a large excess delay spread as described in Section 4.7.
The concept behind this is that having a narrow bandwidth, the duration of
a symbol is long and will exceed the excess delay spread. This minimizes
the impact of intersymbol interference (ISI) when a symbol traveling on a
fast path overlaps with the component of a previous symbol traveling on
a longer path. Also each subchannel can be modulated with the maximum
order modulation enabled by that particular channel's characteristics. For
this to work the subcarriers must be orthogonal and precisely spaced in
frequency and time. The orthogonality is shown in the spectrum of Figure 5-
18, where the arrows at the top indicate sampling points for two subcarriers.
The orthogonality of the subcarriers is seen by noticing that the peak of one
subcarrier is at the zeros of the other subcarriers. When one subcarrier is
sampled, the contribution from all other carriers is zero; they are orthogonal.
210  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     The spectra of the subcarriers overlap, but this does not matter.
        In 4G groups of 12 subcarriers lasting 0.5 ms are grouped in a resource

     block which is the minimal allocation to a user. In communications with a
     handset, a basestation (called a B node in 4G and 5G) allocates a specific
     number of subcarriers. These may not be contiguous on the downlink, as
     shown in Figure 5-8(d), but are contiguous on the uplink. The number of
     subcarriers allocated to a particular user varies according to the data rate
     requirements and the order of modulation used with each subcarrier being
     adjusted to accommodate the subchannel characteristics including fading
     and interference.

        In communicating to a single user, the total bitstream is error encoded
     and then the bitstream is divided up so that different parts of the bitstream
     are sent over multiple subchannels thus spreading the coded data. As a
     result 4G implements spectrum spreading but at a much lower coding rate
     than the spreading in 3G. This further mitigates the impact of multipath
     which can affect the integrity of individual subchannels. Signal strength
     and interference, and hence SIR, can differ for each channel and this is
     compensated for by having different bit rates in each subchannel and
     spreading the data plus error correction coding.

        A second effect of multipath is referred to as delay spread. Transmitted
     signal components following different paths arrive at a receiver at different
     times. If the time duration of a symbol is short, which is the case if wideband
     modulation is used, then the components of a signal, corresponding to
     one symbol, following longer paths could arrive at the same time as the
     components of the next symbol following shorter paths. This causes inter-
     symbol interference. With the longer symbol duration with OFDM and a
     guard band interval (which is now relatively short) between symbols, inter-
     symbol interference can be greatly reduced.

     Implementation

     OFDM could be implemented by using separate modulators and demodula-
     tors for each subcarrier. Instead the separate modulators and demodulators
     are replaced by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and an inverse FFT (iFFT),
     respectively, implemented in a DSP unit called the baseband processor. In
     the transmitter the iFFT produces a modulated signal at a low intermediate
     carrier frequency. For example, a 1.4 MHz bandwidth OFDM signal could be
     a DSB-SC signal with a center frequency, i.e. IF carrier frequency, of 700 kHz
     but otherwise look identical to the final transmitted OFDM signal. Then a
     SSB-SC up-converter translates the OFDM signal to a radio frequency signal.
     Each of the time-varying frequency inputs of the iFFT is centered at a sub-
     carrier frequency. Each of the frequency inputs is a sequence of time-samples
     of a slowly varying modulated signal implementing the selected modulation
     method for that subchannel. On receive the input of the FFT is the sequence
     of time samples of the modulated signal centered on the IF carrier which has
     been down-converted from RF. Each of the outputs of the FFT correspond to
     a time sample of an individual modulated subcarrier.

        Since the OFDM signal combines many individually modulated subcarri-
     ers the PMEPR of OFDM is large but grows relatively slowly with the num-
     ber of subcarriers. The higher PMEPR, compared to a single modulated car-
     rier, introduces microwave design challenges especially for mixers and am-

plifiers. However, since most of the heavy lifting is done in DSP which being
numerical is distortion-free, the up-converter is simplified .

Resource Blocks

The way that OFDM is implemented in 4G is illustrated in Figure 5-19 for a
1.4 MHz-bandwidth modulated signal. The subchannels in 4G are organized
in a frame that is 10 ms long. Within the frame subchannels are grouped into
resource blocks each of which has a duration of 0.5 ms and a bandwidth of
180 kHz. The resource block is the smallest unit allocated to a user and a user
can have many simultaneous resource blocks and many sequential resource
blocks. A resource black has many subcarriers and symbol intervals and the
exact length and bandwidth of a single symbol-subcarrier segment has a
normal mode used most of the time, and two extended modes that handle
severe multipath environments. In the normal mode, each resource block has
seven 71.4 µs-long symbols per subcarrier and there are 12 subcarriers. (The
extended modes have longer symbol duration and 7.5 kHz bandwidth.)

   In OFDM there are subchannels that are reserved for pilot tones that send
known data streams and these can be used to characterize the channel. The
pilot subchannels are denoted as P in Figure 5-8(d). The dedicated pilot
subchannels enable carrier recovery. Therefore it is not necessary to restrict
modulation by avoiding transitions through the origin of the constellation
212  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     diagram (or more precisely the phasor of the modulated subcarrier). Thus
     near-ideal modulation efficiency is possible for the data subcarriers.

     Summary

     OFDM has been tremendously successfull and only had to wait for
     the capabilities of low-power VLSI to advance. It is now widely used
     in communications including WiFi, wired communications (e.g. digital
     subscriber line (DSL)) as well as in 4G and 5G.

     5.10.2 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access

     Orthogonal Frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), also known
     as multiuser OFDM, is the multiuser version of OFDM that supports
     simultaneous communication by multiple users and so is an access
     technology. The access scheme is illustrated in Figure 5-8(d) where one
     channel is illustrated and could have a bandwidth ranging from 1.4 MHz
     to 20 MHz. There could be 1201 subchannels so not all of these are shown.
     The subchannels are grouped in contiguous groups of 12 subchannels to
     form a 1 ms-long resource block (24 7.5 kHz-wide subchannels in extended
     mode used with a very rich multipath environment). So what are numbered
     in Figure 5-8(d) are resource blocks. In OFDMA, generally one or more
     resource blocks are assigned to a particular user and these do not need to
     be contiguous in the downlink but are contiguous in the uplink as then the
     PMEPR is lower

        This lessens the demand on the power amplifier in the terminal unit.
     Effectively there is a single carrier on the uplink and hence the uplink access
     scheme is also called single-carrier frequency division multiple access
     (SC-FDMA) or single-carrier orthogonal frequency division multiple
     access (SC-OFDMA). On the downlink the basestation is using all of the
     subchannels simultaneously communicating with multiple terminal units
     but in the uplink each terminal unit only uses a few. Users share pilot
     subchannels, designated as P in Figure 5-8(d).

     5.10.3 Cyclic Prefix

     The cyclic prefix (CP) refers to the scheme used to accommodate excess
     delay spread resulting from multipath. Since symbols sent on different paths
     arrive at the receive antenna with various delays, there can be overlap of a
     symbol arriving on a fast path with a previous symbol arriving on a longer
     path. This could result in intersymbol interference (ISI). In 4G there could
     have been a zeroed (i.e. no signal) guard interval to eliminate ISI. Instead,
     in 4G, a cyclic prefix (CP) is used whereby a symbol is prefixed repeating
     the end part of a symbol. One symbol of a resource block is shown at the
     bottom of Figure 5-19. Each symbol of the resource block is 66.7 µs long
     with a cylic prefix which normally is 4.7 µs long but longer for the first
     symbol of the resource block and when in extended mode which is used
     in severe multipath environments.5 The 4.7 µs long CP corresponds to a

     5 In the normal mode the first CP is 5.2 µs long and there are two extended modes. One is 16.7 µs
       long and another is 33.3 µs long and then the bandwidth of each subchannel is reduced to
       7.5 kHz. In normal mode the overhead is 7% and in extended mode the CP overhead is 25%.
       If the first extended CP is used then there are 6 OFDM symbols per resource block.

difference in path lengths of 1.4 km. This cyclic prefix provides the required
guard interval. There are several advantages to copying the end of a symbol
and repeating it before the symbol. This reduces the PMEPR that would
result if the guard interval had no signal, and it enables a discrete Fourier
transform to be used in processing the signal. This is essential to efficient
VLSI implementation of OFDM.

   The repetition of the cyclic prefix for each symbol in a resource block is
equivalent to repeating the end of each OFDM symbol at the start of an
OFDM symbol (the aggregate of symbols across all 12 subcarriers constitutes
an OFDM symbol). The repetition enables the start of each OFDM symbol
to be determined as the CP is correlated to the end of the symbol. The
cyclic prefix also helps in characterizing the channel and removing distortion
within the OFDM symbol

5.10.4 FDD versus TDD

Frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) are two
duplex schemes supported in 4G although only one mode or the other
is supported in a particular band, e.g. see Table 5-12. FDD and TDD are
arranged in frames of 10 ms comprising ten subframes of 1 ms duration,
see Figure 5-20. In FDD, Figure 5-20(a), there are separate uplink, denoted
U, and downlink, denoted D, frequency bands and uplink and downlink
transmissions are simultaneous. The use of paired spectrum requires a good
diplexer to isolate the receiver and transmitter. In TDD, Figure 5-20(b),
uplink and downlink use the same band and there are separate uplink,
denoted U, and downlink, denoted D, transmissions in different frequency
bands. In TDD, uplink and downlink transmissions are simultaneous.
Channel propagation is the same in both directions at least over 10 ms as
long as mobility is not too high. TDD allows dynamic allocation of uplink
and downlink capacity.

5.10.5 Multiple Input, Multiple Output

Multiple input, multiple output (MIMO, pronounced my-moe) technology
uses multiple antennas to transmit and receive signals. The MIMO concept
was developed in the 1990s [27, 28] and implemented in 4G and 5G, and
several WLAN systems. There are several aspects to MIMO. First, each
transmit antenna sends different data streams simultaneously on the same
frequency channel as other transmit antennas. The most interesting feature
214  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

Figure 5-21: A MIMO system showing multiple paths between each transmit antenna and each
receive antenna.

                         is that MIMO relies on signals traveling on multiple paths between an array
                         of transmit antennas and an array of receive antennas. In a conventional
                         communications system the various paths result in interference and fading,
                         but in MIMO these paths are used to carry more information. In a MIMO
                         system, each path propagates an image of one transmitted signal (from one
                         antenna) that differs in both amplitude and phase from the images following
                         other paths. Effectively there are multiple connections between each transmit
                         antenna and each receive antenna, see Figure 5-21. For simplicity, three
                         transmit antennas and three receive antennas are shown. However, MIMO
                         can work with as few as two transmit antennas and two receive antennas.
                         In MIMO a high-speed data-stream is split into several slower data streams,
                         shown in Figure 5-21 as the a, b, and c bitstreams. The distinct bitstreams
                         are separately modulated and sent from their own transmit antenna, with
                         the constellation diagrams of the transmitted modulated signals labeled A,
                         B, and C. The signals from each of the transmit antenna reaches all of the
                         receive antennas by following different uncorrelated paths.

                            The output of each receive antenna is a linear combination of the multiple
                         transmitted data streams, with the sampled RF phasor diagrams labeled M,
                         N, and O. (It is not really appropriate to call these constellation diagrams.)
                         That is, each receive antenna has a different linear combination of the
                         multiple images. In effect, the output from each receive antenna can be
                         thought of as the solution of linear equations, with each transmit antenna-
                         receive antenna link corresponding to an equation. Continuing the analogy,
                         the signal from each transmit antenna represents a variable. So a set of
                         simultaneous equations can be solved to obtain the original bitstreams.
                         This is accomplished by demodulation and mapping using knowledge
                         of the channel characteristics to yield the original transmitted signals
                         modified by interference. The result is that the constellation diagrams W,
                         X, and Y are obtained. The composite channel can be characterized using
                         known test signals. Special coding called space-time (or spatio-temporal)
                         coding embedded in the transmitted data-stream also enables estimation
                         of the communication matrix. Space-time coding encodes each transmitted
                         data-stream with information that can be used to update the channel
                         characterization.

                            The capacity of a MIMO system with high SIR scales approximately
                         linearly with the minimum of M and N , min(M, N ), where M is the number

of transmit antennas and N is the number of receive antennas (provided
that there is a rich set of paths) [29, 30]. So a system with M = N = 4
will have four times the capacity of a system with just one transmit antenna
and one receive antenna. Table 5-14 presents the capacity of a MIMO system
with ideal PSK modulation and two transmit and two receive antennas.
This is compared to the capacity of a conventional (non-MIMO) system. The
capacity is presented in bits per second per hertz and it is seen that significant
increases in throughput are obtained when SIR is high. MIMO is a successful
way to increase capacity and is included in modern WiFi, radars, and other
communication systems.

   In summary, MIMO systems achieve throughput and range improvements
through four gains achieved simultaneously:

   1. Array gain resulting from increased average received SIR obtained
       by coherently combining signals. To exploit this the channel must be
       characterized. This increases coverage and quality of service (QoS).

   2. Diversity gain obtained by presenting the receiver with multiple
       identical copies of a given signal. This combats fading. This also
       increases coverage and QoS.

   3. Multiplexing gain by transmitting independent data signals from
       different antennas to increase throughput. This increases spectral
       efficiency.

   4. Cochannel interference reduction. This increases cellular capacity.

5.10.6 Carrier Aggregation

Carrier aggregation (CA) is one of the main features that 4G introduced. In
carrier aggregation bitstreams on different carriers are combined to yield
a higher overall bit rate than one carrier can support. This enables short-
term high bit rates to be transmitted to a terminal. The full concept supports
combining of bit-streams with carriers that are in different frequency bands
(called inter-band CA), the same frequency band (called intra-band CA),
different cells, and even in a combination of licensed and unlicensed (think
WiFi) bands. It is 4G LTE-A combining carrier aggregation and MIMO that
achieves, and can even surpass, the peak 1Gbit/s goal of 4G. A typical goal
of 4G LTE A is to combine five carriers. The 4G standards, 3GPP release 13,
supports 32-carrier aggregation and up to 3 Gbit/s.

5.10.7 IEEE 802.11n

The IEEE 802.11n WiFi system is not 4G but this is discussed here to
indicate that many of the concepts that are incorporated in wireless systems

Table 5-15: Data rates used in the 802.11n standard. MCS is the modulation and coding
scheme index. GI is the guard interval. With a 20 MHz-wide channel there are 52 data
subcarriers, and an additional 4 subcarriers, called pilots, enable carrier recovery and monitor
the channel characteristics. With a 40 MHz-wide channel there are 108 data subcarriers and 6
pilot subcarriers. Ri = information bit rate, Rc = coded bit rate. Rc is the bit rate of information
bits plus bits added for error correction. Thus a coding rate of 5/6 means that for every 5
information bits there is an additional (redundant) code bit.

            first appear in WiFi. IEEE 802.11n is an example of a data communication
            system that combines many advanced concepts. The 802.11n system uses
            MIMO, OFDM, and many dedicated subcarriers for continuous channel
            characterization and carrier recovery. The 802.11n standard uses several
            modulation types, as shown in Table 5-15, and it supports the use of either
            a 20 MHz- or 40 MHz-wide channel. There can be one, two, three or four
            spatial streams and these are equal to the minimum of the number of
            transmit and receive antennas. If the number of transmit or receive antennas
            is more than the number of spatial streams, the extra antennas are used for
            receiver or transmit diversity. Under the best conditions with high SNR,
            negligible correlation of the transmit-to-receive antenna paths, and four
            transmit and four receive antennas, the modulation and coding scheme
            (MCS) index 31 is used. With this index, modulation uses 64-QAM and 5/6

coding. This mode supports a data rate of 600 Mbit/s if a 400 ns guard
interval is used. This guard interval, rather than the 800 ns guard interval,
is used when there is low delay spread. If the SNR is lower, a lower-order
modulation scheme is used.

5.10.8 OFDM Modulator

The basic structure of an OFDM modulator is shown in Figure 5-22. From
the perspective of a single user, a bitstream Sk is divided up by a serial-
to-parallel converter to produce multiple slower bitstreams each of which
is mapped onto complex signals xi which become the frequency inputs
of an iFFT. The outputs of the iFFT are real and imaginary time-domain
baseband signals iBB(t)and qB B(t). At each symbol interval (iBB(t),qB B(t))
indicates a symbol. The iBB(t)and qB B(t) pass through a cyclic prefix
generator that copies the end of the symbol and prefixes it to the beginning
of the symbol. Then the output of the cyclic prefix generators are shaped
by an FIR filter (generally a raised cosine filter) to produce the shaped
I/Q signals iBB(t)and qBB(t) which are input to a quadrature modulator
with an intermediate carrier frequency to produce a DSB-SC intermediate
frequency signal modulated signal sIF(t). For example, if the frequency
range of iBB(t)and qBB(t) range from just above DC to just below 700 kHz
the choice of fc,IF = 700 kHz results in a 1.4 MHz wide modulated signal
sIF(t) which is a DSB-SC OFDM modulated signal. The entirety of the OFDM
modulator in Figure 5-22 is implemented digitally in a DSP unit.

5.10.9 Summary of 4G

At the physical layer the 4G standard introduces and combines OFDM,
carrier aggregation (CA), and MIMO to achieve tremendous data rates that,
218  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     Figure 5-23: Data rate capacity of 4G as the long term evolution of 3G.

     in a fully implemented 4G system achieves low-latency data download at
     mobile rates up to 100 Mbit/s and rates while stationary of 1 Gbit/s. OFDM
     is the technology that sends many relatively slow bitstreams over narrow
     bandwidth sub-channels to efficiently support multiple users making best
     use of the channels available and circumventing many multipath effects. It
     replaces the use of spreading codes in CDMA to support multiple access
     and circumvent some multipath problems. CA combines multiple bitsteams
     sent on different carriers and even from different basestations to increase the
     short term overall bit rate. MIMO uses multiple, i.e. M , transmit antennas,
     at the basestation, and multiple, i.e. N , receive antennas, at the handset,
     and exploits uncorrelated communication paths between pairs of transmit
     and receive antennas. The (ideally) zero correlation is made possible by
     multipath and the correlation is lowest if there is no line-of-sight path. If
     the de-correlation is complete the data capacity is increased by a function of
     the minimum of the number of transmit antennas, i.e. MIN(M, N ). If there
     is some correlation, perhaps due to coupling between the receive antennas,
     then a MIMO capacity factor H  MIN(M, N ) is defined. With MIMO it is
     necessary to modify Shannon's capacity limit as MIMO systems can exceed
     the limit defined for a single channel. Shannon's capacity limit for a MIMO
     system becomes [29]

     C^ = Bc log2(1 + SIR · H).                                               (5.31)

     This indicates that the channel carrying capacity is greatly increased,
     especially when the SIR is high. The data rate capacity of 2G systems (GSM
     and CDMA) is contrasted with the capacity of 3G (WCDMA) and 4G systems
     in Figure 5-23.

5.11 5G, Fifth Generation Radio

As with 4G there will be long term evolution of the 5G standard and
this will be upwards compatible with 4G. Even though 4G was touted as
the long term evolution of 3G, at the physical layer it was fundamentally
incompatible. 5G is fundamentally compatible with 4G at the physical layer
and it is expected that cellular phone services will continue to function much
the same as if 4G was being used. The first iteration (i.e. evolution) of 5G is
called Next Radio (NR) and begins with 3GPP Release 15, see Figure 5-17,
and operation began in the second half of 2018.

   The full 5G standard supports three use cases and a significantly improved
level of service over 4G. One of the uses cases is enhanced mobile
broadband (eMBB) with peak data rates of 20 Gbit/s and sustained data
rates of 100 Mbit/s. High mobility of up to 500 km/s is supported.
Another use case is massive machine-to-machine communication (mMTC)
supporting the internet of things (IoT) with high density of devices (up
to 106/km2, long range, low data rate (1 kbit/s-100 kbit/s), and enabling
10 year battery life. The third use case is ultra reliability and low latency
(URLLC) with less than 1 ms air interface latency and less than 5 ms overall
end-to-end latency, 99.9999% reliability, data rates up to 10 Mbit/s, and
supporting high mobility.

   Many scenarios require ultra-reliable and very low end-to-end latency,
perhaps as low as 1 ms. The early deployments of 4G had latencies of 80 ms
or more and varied considerable across service providers. Over the years
since 4G was launched latencies have reduced considerably but in 4G it is
not possible to have air-interface latencies less than the 10 ms frame rate of
4G. A fundamental limit in 4G is due to the 0.5 ms time duration of a slot,
see Figure 5-19. One concept in 5G is to have more slots per 1 ms subframe
maintaining the subframe for upwards compatibility. In 4G there are two
slots per subframe. Possible developments in 5G are 1) to have more slots
per subframe and 2) (what seems to be similar) to have more symbols per
slot. With 16 slots per subframe the slot duration is 0.0625 ms. The long-term
evolution of 5G will continue and achieve overall latencies of 1 ms or less.

   An important concept of 5G is to be fully compatible with the 4G
infrastructure and the only new infrastructure required is that to support
new services. There were two central ideas behind 4G: OFDM and MIMO
and these are used in 5G OFDM. OFDM in 4G used two fixed sub-carrier
spacing, but 5G has a number of different sub-carrier bandwidths including
a subchannel bandwidth of 480 kHz, and a low bandwidth subchannel
bandwidth of 7.5 kHz to accommodate high speed mobility As with 4G,
carrier aggregation is used but now the bitstreams on up to 32 carriers are
combined. Also channel bandwidths are up to 400 MHz compared to the
20 MHz RF bandwidth maximum of 4G.

5.11.1 Mesh Radio

In 5G a wireless mesh removes the need for a fixed basestation to
communicate directly to an end unit [32]. If there is a node between
the basestation and a mobile user, an intervening node, possibly another
mobile user, can be used effectively as a relay. This reduces overall power
requirements and levels of interference, which in turn leads to greater data
220  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     carrying capacity. This concept can be extended to use multiple intervening
     nodes forming a dense mesh with considerable tolerance to multipath and
     interference effects. One significant benefit of this can be seen by noting
     that in an urban environment power can fall off by the fourth power of
     distance. Another benefit is that the impact of fading can be greatly reduced,
     as the paths in the mesh will fade independently. This will be augmented
     by many small cells called femtocells and picocells handling traffic in small
     geographic areas such as buildings, airports, and sporting facilities.

     5.11.2 Cognitive Radio

     Cognitive radio exploits the fact that much of the EM spectrum remains
     unused even while the bands reserved for cellular communications have
     reached capacity. This situation is a consequence of the allocation of
     bands for dedicated services that may not be active at a particular time
     and place. Examples are unused bands reserved for broadcast television
     channels and bands reserved for communication in times of emergencies.
     A cognitive radio senses its environment and adapts in real time to a
     user's communication needs by temporarily borrowing unused spectrum
     [33, 34]. As a result spectrum is used more efficiently. A cognitive radio
     avoids causing interference with the communications of other users by
     sensing spectrum use, changing frequency, adjusting power level, and
     altering transmission protocols. If a licensed band is borrowed, then a
     cognitive radio discontinues use of this part of the spectrum if the licensee
     of the band becomes active. This behavior is also called dynamic spectrum
     management.

     5.11.3 Massive MIMO

     MIMO in 4G uses multiple antennas at the basestation and at terminals to
     increase overall data rates provided that there are multiple paths between
     the transmitter and receiver. For example, with two basestation antennas
     transmitting separate bitstreams but in the same frequency band and
     two uncorrelated receive antennas, known as 2x2 MIMO, the theoretical
     maximum data rate is twice what could be supported by line-of-sight
     communication. In 5G there can be a very large number of transmit antennas
     even though there are few receiver antennas per terminal unit as multiple
     terminal units mean that there can effectively be a very large number of
     receive antennas.

        5G operates at frequencies below 6 GHz and at millimeterwave
     frequencies. Below 6 GHz 8x8 MIMO is supported in the standard but
     there can be a hundred or more basestation antennas. For example. With
     128 basestation antennas and four receiver antennas per terminal unit, 32
     terminal units can be supported in the same frequency band. Overall the
     system has much higher throughput, theoretically a maximum of 128 times
     more than a single line-of-sight link could support. This concept, i.e. not all of
     the receive antennas need be on the same platform, is called massive MIMO.

        Massive MIMO uses characterization of the channel as in conventional
     MIMO but uses this information to form multiple beams each directed
     at each terminal unit. This situation is shown in Figure 5-24 where there
     are multiple transmit/receive antennas at each basestation but relatively
RF SYSTEMS  221

                                                                                                   Figure 5-24: A mas-

                                                                                                   basestation antennas
                                                                                                   to each terminal
                                                                                                   unit.

few transmit/receive antennas at each terminal unit. At the start of each
correlation interval, i.e. the time over which a channel does not change
significantly, each terminal unit transmits a code to the basestation. Each
terminal unit uses an orthogonal code and so the basestation is able to
characterize the channels from each of the terminal units to the basestation.
The basestation is then able to use its antennas in a phased array to form a
beam to transmit data just to the intended terminal. The real situation is a
little different as a single beam is not formed but instead a weighted signal
is broadcast from each of the basestation antennas with the effect being that
all of the power following multiple paths comes together at the intended
terminal unit. Still this process is called beamforming. Different beams are
used for each basestation. In the second half of the correlation interval the
terminal unit transmits back to the basestation and the basestation uses its
beamforming in reverse to effectively create multiple receive beams each
directed at a terminal units. Of course these are not strictly beams but use
the channel model to combine the signals from each of the basestation receive
antennas to effectively receive signals with the highest signal-to-interference
ration from each terminal.

   Massive MIMO has a performance advantage even with line-of-sight as
long as the terminal units are not on top of each other as the paths from each
of the basestation antennas to each of the terminals will be uncorrelated.
Beam steering can be also used to concentrate transmitted energy in a
particular direction.

5.11.4 Active Antenna Systems

Adaptive antennas, or active antenna systems (AAS), are also known as
smart antennas and adapt an array of antennas to either direct an antenna
beam between a transmitter and a receiver, eliminate interference, or use the
spatial signatures provided by diverse propagation paths to transfer more
information than can be sent over a single link [35]. All this is done using
signal processing rather than hardware reconfiguration.

   In one approach a smart antenna is used to switch between a number
of fixed, usually narrow, antenna beams in what is analogous to a highly
sectored antenna array. Switching requires knowledge of the angle of arrival
and the beams track a mobile unit. A simple version of this concept is
used in 3G and 4G radio. As well as focusing the available power on the
intended communication nodes, beam forming through beam switching also
minimizes interference.

   Adaptive antennas increase data transfer rates, reduce interference, and
reduce the amount of transmit power required.
222  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

     5.11.5 Microwave Frequency Operation

     Low frequency operation refers to 5G operating below 6 GHz. The bands
     being adopted for early stage deployment are the 700 MHz, 3300-4200 MHz
     and 4400-5000 MHz bands but the full coverage is not available in all
     countries. Many are predicting that the bulk of 5G communication will be
     at these frequencies, particularly at 3.5 GHz, up until the mid or late 2020s.
     It is important to 5G that there be globally available spectrum. The 700 MHz
     band is of particular interest as it will provide wide area coverage and
     deep penetration into buildings and so is a candidate for providing high
     reliability links important for the 5G mMTC applications. At this frequency
     5G is compatible with 4G but with evolved characteristics such as supporting
     up to 32 carrier aggregation and 8 × 8 MIMO instead of the five carrier
     aggregation and (usually) maximum 3 × 3 MIMO of 4G. Also 5G in the low
     frequency range supports 256 QAM modulation but then the order of QAM
     modulation supported with 4G has evolved with latter 3GPP releases.

     5.11.6 Millimeter-Wave Operation

     The very high data rates of 5G are obtained by operating at millimeter-
     wave (mm-wave) frequencies where much more bandwidth is available.
     The bands being focused on are the 24.25-29.5 GHz and 37-40.5 GHz.
     (Yes, technically 24.25-29.5 GHz is not millimeter-waves which requires a
     wavelength to be 10 mm or less, but that is being called mm-waves in the
     5G community.) At mm-wave frequencies very tight beamforming can be
     achieved if the same overall antenna size is used. However there is a penalty,
     signal attenuation is high and it is not possible to send signals through walls
     and into buildings. As such window mounted units are required to receive
     signals. Millimeter-wave operation is envisioned to use 2×2 MIMO only, but
     still use massive MIMO, be useful for low speed mobility, but provide very
     high data rates.

     5.11.7 Non Orthogonal Multiple Access

     One of the distinguishing features of 4G and 5G is OFDMA, an orthogonal
     multiple access (OMA) scheme. OFDMA in (both both 4G and) 5G allocates
     a dedicated resource block to each user and orthogonality ensures that there
     is almost no inter-user interference. The system utilization is optimum when
     each resource block is fully utilized. However this is not the case with IoT
     devices, the support for which is one of the main features of 5G. When IoT
     devices communicate very little information is usually exchanged and so
     most of the resource block used by an IoT device is unused. The expected
     growth of 5G will see a great proliferation of IoT devices with these devices
     having diverse data rate and latency requirements. Communicating with
     each IoT device by allocating a dedicated resource block does not use the
     capacity effectively. In addition, using the same basestation transmit power
     for each user is said to be `unfair' in that each user typically has a different
     channel quality with a user having a poorer channel quality needing to
     operate with lower-order modulation. The `unfairness' arrises because the
     channel capacity is not equally shared but it would be if the the basestation
     transmitted higher powers to the user with a poorer channel. Non orthogonal
     multiple access (NOMA) is designed to addresses this imbalance and to
RF SYSTEMS                                                                      223

ensure optimum use of each resource block and hence of the communication
system.

   The key concept of NOMA is that low-rate devices will share a resource
block, they will use differing symbol rates, and the transmit power level
from the basestation to each user will be adjusted according to the quality of
the communication channel [36, 37]. In NOMA, and in contrast to OFDMA,
there will be inter-user interference and schemes have been developed that
will enable individual users to be separated. One possible NOMA scheme to
separate users by using code domain multiplexing with each user sharing a
resource block being assigned a unique code. The concept is very similar to
that used in WCDMA but applied at the level of a resource block.

   The dominant NOMA scheme in 5G and the one to be first deployed (as
of the time of writing this book) in a future 3GPP release of the 5G standard
is multi-user superposition transmission (MUST). Successive interference
cancellation (SIC) is the scheme used to separate users.

   In MUST users are allocated different power levels and will use different
symbol rates. For example, a distant user with a poor quality channel will
receive more power in NOMA and a user with a good channel will receive
less since the maximum power available from the basestation transmitter is
fixed. The result is that the throughput of the close and distant users will
be similar. This is called `fairness' and is particularly important when the
system is operating at or near capacity. A further advantage of NOMA is
that the demands on the basestation transmitter hardware is reduced. One
of the consequences of having a common symbol rate in OFDMA is that
the PMEPR is higher than it would be if there was a range of symbol rates.
Thus NOMA will result in the total RF signal being transmitted from the
basestation having a lower PMEPR.

   It is expected that there will be a significant increase in throughput as
many users, think of IoT devices, only need to communicate at very low data
rates. Current cellular systems reach an abrupt limit on their throughput. In
NOMA overload is supported at the cost of inter-user interference. Studies
have shown that a threefold increase incapacity is possible with NOMA
schemes that tolerate overload and inter-user interference [37].

5.11.8 Summary

The 5G system introduces many system optimization strategies and a high-
level of system optimization across perhaps hundreds of basestations is
required to achieve full potential. The 5G systems will inevitably be followed
by 6G and this is the subject of current research. The defining characteristic
is that 6G is being targeted to operate above 100 GHz and provide enormous
bandwidths since very wide bandwidths are available.

5.12 6G, Sixth Generation Radio

Sixth generation radio will operate in the 95 GHz to 275 GHz range, and will
provide data rates of 100 Gbit/s [38]. While 5G hopes to provide these data
rates at 60 GHz this may not come to pass as the required spectral efficiency
of 14 bits/s/Hz and requires 60 GHz hardware with very high dynamic
range and this is unlikely to be available for some time. With 6G these data
rates will be possible with much lower-order modulation and hence reduced
224                STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

      demands on hardware Regulatory bodies have allocated several bands in
      this range. In the USA these bands are 116-123 GHz, 174.8-182 GHz, 185-
      190 GHz, and 244-246 GHz for a total of 21 GHz of spectrum. Atmospheric
      losses can be large at these frequencies but, except for a peak of absorption
      around 140 GHz, this is more than compensated by the pencil-like beams
      generated by many-element phased array antennas possible at these high
      frequencies. The 100+ GHz frequencies have wavelengths of 3 mm or less
      enabling functionality not available at 60 GHz and below. These include
      precise positioning with millimeter resolution, near visual-quality imaging
      through fog and clouds, wireless cognition (off-loading large data sets from
      a mobile units for fixed computation), and unique sensing modalities by
      exploiting the many molecular resonances that occur above 100 GHz. The
      overwhelming challenge is the development of physical hardware and the
      development of array processing technologies [38].

      5.13 Radar Systems

      Radar uses EM signals to determine the range, altitude, direction, and speed
      of objects called targets by looking at the signals received from transmitted
      signals called radar waveforms. Common radar bands and applications are
      given in Table 5-16. The earliest use of EM signals to detect targets was
      demonstrated in 1904 by Christian Hu¨ lsmeyer using a spark gap generator
      [39]. This system was promoted as a system to avoid collisions of ships
      and detected the direction of targets only. Research contributed to further
      developments, with a significant acceleration during World War II. Radar is
      now a word in its own right, but in 1941 the term RADAR was created as an
      acronym for radio detection and ranging.

   In a radar system, typically a high-gain antenna such as a parabolic
antenna is used to transmit a radar signal, but always a high-gain antenna
is used to receive the signal. If the same antenna is used for transmit and
receive (possibly two similar antennas at the same site) the system is called
a monostatic radar (see Figure 5-25(a)). Radar with transmit and receive
antennas at different sites is called bistatic radar (shown in Figure 5-25(b)).

   In a monostatic radar using the same antenna for transmit and receive,
the space is painted with a radar signal and the received signal is captured
after a propagation delay from the antenna to the target and back again.
A radar image can then be developed. In many radars the receive antenna
is mechanically steered and often a regular rotation is used. With so-called
synthetic aperture radars, a platform such as an aircraft moves the radar in
one direction and a one-dimensional mechanical or electrical scan enables a
two-dimensional image to be developed.

   The categories of radar waveforms are shown in Figure 5-26. The
continuous wave (CW) waveform shown in Figure 5-26(a) is on all or most of
the time and is used to detect a reflection from a target. This reflected signal
is much smaller than the transmitted signal and it can be difficult to separate
the transmitted and received signals. A monostatic CW radar architecture is
shown Figure 5-27(a), where a circulator6 is used to separate the transmitted
and received signals. The received signal is converted to digital form using

6 For the circulator shown, power entering port 1 of a circulator leaves at port 2 and power
  entering port 2 is delivered to port 3. So ports 1 and 3 are isolated.

     an ADC and the bandwidth of the ADC with the required dynamic range
     determines the limit on the bandwidth of the radar signal. Generally the
     broader the bandwidth, the better the radar system is at identifying objects. A
     CW signal can be used to develop an image, but it is not good at determining
     the range of a target. For this, a pulsed radar waveform, as shown in Figure
     5-26(b), is better. The repetition period, TR, is more than the round-trip time
     to the target, thus the time interval between the transmitted signal and the
     returned signal can be used to estimate range. Direction is determined by the
     orientation of the antenna.

        The CW architecture can also be used with pulsed radar. In pulsed radar,
     the signal received contains the desired target signal, multipath and echoes,
     and clutter, as shown in Figure 5-28(a). These effects also appear in the
     signal received in CW radar, but it is much easier to see in pulsed radar.
     Identifying clutter and multipath effects is a major topic in radar processing.
     Alternative waveforms, especially digitally modulated waveforms, aid in
     extracting the desired information. The frequency modulated waveform, or
     chirp waveform, in Figure 5-26(c), will have a reflection that will also be
     chirped, and the difference between the frequency being transmitted and
     that received indicates the range of the target, provided that the target is not
     moving. The radar architecture that can be used to extract this information
     is shown in Figure 5-27(b). The directional couplers tap off a small part
     of the transmit signal and use it as the LO of a mixer with the received
     signal as input. A similar architecture is shown in Figure 5-27(c), but now
     separate transmit and receive antennas are used to separate the transmitted
     and received signals rather than using a circulator. Better separation of the
     transmitted and received signals can be obtained this way. The frequency of
     the IF that results is proportional to the range of the target.

        An important concept in radar is that of radar cross section (RCS) denoted
      (with SI units of m2). The RCS of a target is the equivalent area that

intercepts the power of a transmitted signal and re-radiates all of that power
isotropically to produce the observed power density at a receiver [40]. The
RCS therefore depends on the frequency of the transmitted signal, the size
of the target, the incident and reflected angle of the signal reflected by the
target, and the reflectivity of the target.

   The power of the signal reflected by the target and captured by the receive
antenna is given by the radar equation [40]:

            PR =  PT GT ARF 4
                      22 2,                     (5.32)
                  (4) RT RR

where PT is the transmit power delivered to the transmit antenna, GT is
the antenna gain of the transmitter, AR is the effective aperture area of the
receive antenna, F is the pattern propagation factor, RT is the distance from
the transmitter to the target, and RR is the distance from the target to the
receiver. F captures the effective loss due to multipath, which was captured
in communications by introducing a signal dependence of 1/dn, where n
ranges from 2 to 4 depending on the environment. In free space, F = 1.

If the same antenna is used for transmit and receive, and multipath is not

important (so F = 1), then Equation (5.32) becomes

            PR = (4)2R4 PT GT AR ,              (5.33)

where R = RT = RR. In Section 4.5.4 the antenna effective area was related
to the antenna gain. From Equation (4.27),

            A G R = R2 ,                        (5.34)
                      4

and so, with GR = GT , Equation (5.33) becomes

        If a signal of frequency fT is transmitted and reflected from a moving
     target there is a Doppler shift,fD, and the received signal will be at
     frequency

            fR = fT + fD                  (target moving toward the radar)      (5.36)
            fR = fT - fD                  (target moving away from the radar),  (5.37)
            fD = 2vRfT /c.                                                      (5.38)
     where

     In Equation (5.38) vR is the radial component of the speed of the target
     relative to the radar, and c is the speed of light. Typical Doppler shifts are
     shown in Table 5-17.

        If the target is moving, there will be a Doppler shift. If the target is moving
     toward a CW radar, then the frequency of the returned signal will be higher,
     as shown in Figure 5-28(b). A similar architecture to that used with chirp
     radar can be used (see Figures 5-27(bc)). The concept can be extended to
     bistatic radars, but now the local oscillator reference must be generated. As
     was seen previously, the frequency of the transmit carrier can be recovered
     for digitally modulated signals such as the PSK-encoded signals shown
     in Figure 5-26(d). Advanced high-end radars use digital modulation and
     CDMA-like waveforms and exploit space-time coding. Typically the radar
     waveforms to be transmitted are chirped, which is a technique that takes the
     desired transmit waveform and stretches it out in time so that it can be more
     efficiently amplified and more power can be transmitted. At the receiver,
     the radar signal is compressed in time so that it corresponds to the original
     transmit signal prior to chirping.

        It should be apparent that radars and radar waveforms can be optimized
     for imaging or for exploiting Doppler shifts to track moving targets. Imaging
     is suitable when there is little clutter, such as looking into the air. However,
     it is difficult to detect targets such as cars that are moving on the ground.
     So-called ground moving target indication (GMTI) radar relies on Doppler
     shifts to discriminate moving targets, and then the ability to image accurately
     is compromised. Considerable effort is devoted to developing waveforms
     that are difficult to detect (stealthy) and are optimized for imaging or GMTI.

     5.14 Summary

     Radio frequency and microwave design continues to rapidly evolve,
     responding to new communication, radar, and sensor architectures. The
     long-term evolution also exploits opportunities made available with larger-
     scale monolithic integration and by advances in high-performance, low-
     power digital signal processing.

        If filters and other hardware in a communication receiver are ideal,
     the final Eb/No and BER achieved are directly related to the RF SIR
     as described in this chapter. With practical filters and analog hardware
     there is a performance degradation and an SIR higher than the theoretical
     SIR is required to achieve a particular BER, or Eb/No. The difference is

captured by the implementation margin, k, usually specified in decibels.
To achieve a specific BER, SIR must greater than the theoretical SIR by
k. The implementation margin is therefore a measure of the performance
of RF hardware and is an important metric in design and in planning
design. The implementation margin captures many imperfections. A design
group and a company learns what it can achieve, e.g. see Table 5-18, and
uses this in budgeting design costs and planning design effort. The design
cost of RF systems are considerable and the ability to manage the design
process and be able to estimate design effort is critical to timely success.
Higher implementation margins result from the choice of lower-performing
technologies, perhaps resulting from a compromise of performance, cost, and
design effort.

5.A Mathematics of Random Processes

This appendix presents the essential mathematics required to describe the statistical properties of a
random process such as noise. Also, it is difficult to analyze circuits with digitally modulated signals
unless the signals are treated as being random with high-order statistics. Several statistical terms are
introduced to describe the properties of a random variable X and how its value at one time is related to
its value at other times. So X will, in general, vary with time (i.e., it can be written as X(t)) and its value
at a particular time will be random.

   This section presents all of the probability metrics required to describe noise, interference, and digitally
modulated signals. A random process in time t is a family of random variables {X(t), t  T }, where t
is somewhere in the time interval T . The probability that X(t) has a value less than x1 is denoted by
P {X(t)  x1}. This is also called the cumulative distribution function (CDF), and sometimes called just
the distribution function (DF):

            FX (x1) = P {X  x1}.                                                                   (5.39)

In general, since X(t) varies with time, the CDF required to handle noise, that is, random voltages and
currents, will depend on time. So the CDF used with noise and interference in communications will have
two arguments, and the multivariate CDF is

            FX (x1; t1) = P {X(t1)  x1}.                                                           (5.40)

That is, FX (, t) = 1 and F (-, t) = 0. FX is being used with two arguments, as it is necessary to
indicate the value of X at a particular time. FX (x1; t1) is said to be the first-order distribution of X(t).

   Another probability metric often used is the probability density function (PDF), f , which is related
to the CDF as

                           x1

            FX (x1; t1) =      f (x, t1).dx .                                                      (5.41)

                           -

Another property that needs to be captured is the relationship between the value of the random variable
at one time, t1, to its value at another time, t2. Clearly, if the variables are completely random there
would be no relationship. The statistical relationship of x at t1 and at t2 is described by the joint CDF,
FX (x1, x2; t1, t2), which is the second-order distribution of the random process:

            FX (x1, x2; t1, t2) = P {X(t1)  x1, X(t2)  x2}.                                        (5.42)

This is the joint CDF, or probability, that X(t1) will be less than x1 at time t1 and also that X(t2) will
be less than x2 at time t2. So in the case of noise, the joint CDF describes the correlation of noise at two
different times. In general, the nth order distribution is

            FX (x1, . . . , xn; t1, . . . , tn) = P {X(t1)  x1, . . . , X(tn)  xn}.                (5.43)

   If the random process (i.e., X) is discrete, then the probability mass function (PMF) is used for the
probability that x has a particular value. The general form of the PMF is

            pX (x1, . . . , xn; t1, . . . , tn) = P {X(t1) = x1, . . . , X(tn) = xn},              (5.44)

and the general form of the PDF, used with continuous random variables, is (from Equation (5.41))

            f nF X (x1, . . . , xn; t1, . . . , tn) = X (x1, . . . , xn; t1, . . . , tn) .         (5.45)
                                                             x1 . . . xn

   The statistical measures above describe the properties of random variables and capture the way a
variable is related to itself at different times, and how two different random processes are related to
each other at the same time and at different times. Such characterizations are based on the expected value
of a random variable. The expectation of a random variable X(t) is the weighted average of all possible
236                                     STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS

              Figure 5-29: Gaussian distribution.

values of the random variable. The weighting is the probability for a discrete random variable, and is the
probability density for a continuous random variable. So the expected value of the random variable X(t)
is

                                 -   x(t)pX(x, t)        for a discrete random variable                             (5.46)
                   E[X(t)] =                             for a continuous random variable.

                                      - x(t)pX (x, t)dx

This is just the mean of X(t) defined as                                                                            (5.47)
                                              µX (t) = X¯ (t) = X(t) = E[X(t)].

The mean is also called the first-order moment of X(t). E[ ] is called the expected value of a random
variable and the term is synonymous with the expectation, mathematical expectation, mean, and first
moment of a random variable. The symbols   are a clean way of specifying the expectation. In general
a computer program would need to be used to calculate the expected value. However, for some assumed
probability distributions there are analytic solutions for E[ ].

   The nth-order moment of X(t) is just the expected value of the nth power of X(t):

                                                         -   xn(t)pX (x, t)      for a discrete                     (5.48)
                                                                                 random variable
                    = E[Xn(t)] = Xn(t) =   n                                     for a continuous
                   - µn x (t)pX (x, t)dx                                         random variable.

                                                        

                                                                                         2                       2
Thus the second moment, sometimes called the second raw moment, is µ2 = X (t) = E[X (t)]. A

more useful quantity for characterizing the statistics of a signal is the second central moment, which is

the second moment about the mean. The second central moment of a random variable is also called its
variance, written as 2 or as µ2:

                      2 = µ2 = E[(X - µ)2] = E[X2 - 2µX + µ2] = E[X2] - 2µE[X] + µ2                                 (5.49)
                                 = E[X2] - 2µ2 + µ2 = E[X2] - µ2 = E[X2] - (E[X])2
                                 = X2(t) - µ2 = X2(t) - X2(t) .

The variance is a measure of the dispersion of a random variable (i.e., how much the random variable

is spread out). Variance is one of several measures of dispersion, but it is the preferred measure when

working with noise and digitally modulated signals. The standard deviation, , is the square root of the

variance  2.  It  is  also  common  to  denote  the  variance  of  X  as    2  and  in  general,  the  variance  can  be  a

function of time, 2(t).                                                   X ,

     It is common to approximate the statistical distribution of a digitally modulated signal as a Gaussian

or normal distribution. This distribution is shown in Figure 5-29 and is mathematically described by its

probability distribution

                                        p [X(t)] =  1 e-(X(t)-µ)/(2 , 2)                                            (5.50)
                                                         2

where the mean of the distribution is µ and the variance is 2. The third and higher moments of the
Gaussian distribution are zero. That is one of the reasons why this distribution is so commonly used
as an approximation. Analysis using the Gaussian distribution is much simpler than it would be for
other distributions. More realistically, a digitally modulated signal has I and Q components and the
RF SYSTEMS                                                                                    237

distribution of each of these should be approximated as a Gaussian distribution. Such a distribution is
called a complex Gaussian distribution and the analysis of the distortion produced by an amplifier using
the complex Gaussian distribution is more accurate. Using a more sophisticated distribution, e.g. using
the moments calculated from the actual digitally modulated signal, provides even greater accuracy in
analysis [43] but now the complexity is beyond manual calculation.

   If a digitally modulated signal is completely random, then there would be no correlation between the
value of the signal at one time and its value at another time. However, there is a relationship and the
relationship is described by the signal's autocorrelation function. The autocorrelation function is used
to describe the relationship between values of a function separated by different instants of time. For a
random variable, it is given by

                               RX (t1, t2) = E[X(t1)X(t2)].                                   (5.51)

When the random variable is discrete, the one-dimensional autocorrelation function of a random
sequence of length N is expressed as

                                                  N -1

                               RX (i) =                 xj xj+i,                              (5.52)

                                                  j=0

where i is the so-called lag parameter. The autocovariance function of X(t) is given by

            KX (t1, t2) = E[{X(t1) - µX (t1)}]E[{X(t1) - µX (t1)}]                            (5.53)
                          = RX (t1, t2) - µX (t1)µX (t2)

while the variance is given by                                                                (5.54)
                                         X (t) = E[{X(t) - µX (t)}]2 = KX (t1, t1).

A random process X(t) is stationary in the strict sense if

            FX (x1, . . . , xn; t1, . . . , tn) = FX (x1, . . . , xn; t1 + , . . . , tn +  )  (5.55)

ti  T , i  N. If the random process is wide-sense stationary (WSS), then it is stationary with order 2.
This means that in most cases only its first and second moments (i.e., the mean and autocorrelation) are
independent of time t and only dependent on the time interval  . More precisely, if a random process is
WSS, then

                    E[X(t)] = µ (i.e., its mean is a constant)                                (5.56)
            and RX (t, s) = E[X(t)X(s)] = RX (|s - t|) = RX ( ).

Note that the autocorrelation of a WSS process is dependent only the time difference  . A random process
that is not stationary to any order is nonstationary (i.e., its moments are explicitly dependent on time).

   The discussion now returns to the properties of a Gaussian random process. A Gaussian random
process is a continuous random process with PDF of the form

                                               1               -µ(x, t)2
                               fX (x, t) =         exp               2,                       (5.57)
                                            2(t)2              2(t)

where µ(x, t) represents the mean of the random process and (t) represents the variance. A normal
random process is a special case of a Gaussian random process in that it has a mean of zero and a variance
of unity. A Poisson random process is a discrete random process with parameter (t) > 0 and has a PDF
given by

                               pX (k) = P (X(t) = k) = et (t)k ,                              (5.58)
                                                                      k!

where (t) is generally time dependent. The mean and variance of a Poisson random process is (t). So,

for a Poisson random process,

                               µX = E[X(t)] = (t)                                             (5.59)
                                                                                              (5.60)
                                 2          =  Var(X (t))   =  (t).

                               X

   The statistical measures above are those necessary to statistically describe digitally modulated signals
and also describe most noise processes.

MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: RADIO SYSTEMS                     Third Edition

Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems is a circuits- and systems-oriented approach to modern microwave
and RF systems. Sufficient details at the circuits and sub-system levels are provided to understand how
modern radios are implemented. Design is emphasized throughout. The evolution of radio from what is now
known as 0G, for early radio, through to 6G, for sixth generation cellular radio, is used to present modern
microwave and RF engineering concepts. Two key themes unify the text: 1) how system-level decisions affect
component, circuit and subsystem design; and 2) how the capabilities of technologies, components, and
subsystems impact system design. This book is suitable as both an undergraduate and graduate textbook, as
well as a career-long reference book.
