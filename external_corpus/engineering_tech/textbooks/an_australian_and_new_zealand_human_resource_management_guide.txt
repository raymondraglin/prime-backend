Preface

This open educational resource is the culmination of my
work health and safety (WHS) management teaching and
research from 2010 until 2023 spanning two universities;
the University of Wollongong (Australia) and the
University of Otago (New Zealand). This resource was
therefore produced, in part, on Dharawal country
(Wollongong, Australia) and in tepoti, Te Waipounamu,
Aotearoa (Dunedin, South Island, New Zealand). Please
note that when teaching in New Zealand I often use the
terms Aotearoa and New Zealand interchangeably,
however, for the purposes of this publication I have only
used the term New Zealand. This choice has been made
as effectively I am solely referring to the WHS jurisdiction
established by "the Crown" in the legislation which does
not, unfortunately, incorporate mtauranga Mori
perspectives on safety management. However, where
possible and appropriate, I have sought to proffer insights
on how British colonial perspectives on Australia and
Aotearoa have impacted modern Human Resource
Management practices (see Past Influencing the Present in
Chapter 1).

   As an important, yet emerging field, WHS research will
continue to evolve at a rapid pace so this resource is unable
to address all currently emerging ideas in this field but,
instead, is designed to provide a clear historical context to
the approaches (Part I) and processes that contemporary
organisations are drawing on today (Part II and Part III);
as such this resource is mainly is derived from a Safety

                                             xvii
xviii Lynnaire Sheridan

I perspective but acknowledges, and integrates where
possible, the emergence of Safety II.

   In Part II, the chapters focus on establishing,
implementing, and closing the loop in a WHS system in an
attempt to outline what occurs in each phase of the safety
management system, rather than exactly how to achieve
every aspect, given each organisation, due to its
jurisdiction and context, will likely adopt unique
approaches. Please do accept my apologies for any
oversights on aspects of safety management
implementation, as these are likely due to either the innate
constraints of publishing or reflect the limitations of my
personal knowledge.

   Thank you for taking the time to read this open
educational resource and I sincerely hope that it enhances
your work health and safety practice.

   Stay safe!

Introduction

Worldwide there are an estimated 2.78 million work-
related deaths per year (ILO, 2023), with work-related
injury and disease impacting on many more surviving
workers. The monetary and emotional cost to families,
organisations and societies means quality work health and
safety management has impact nationally, regionally and
internationally. When implemented effectively, workplace
health and safety reduces loss of life and injury in
organisations worldwide.

   An Australian and New Zealand Human Resource
Management Guide to Work Health and Safety is designed
to:

         · Outline the historical and philosophical
            evolution of the work health and safety theories,
            principles and approaches used today.

         · Delineate Human Resource Managers' work
            health and safety responsibilities.

         · Empower Human Resource Managers to lead
            work health and safety by providing examples
            from actual workplace settings.

History: Exploring the origins
of labour rights and worker
safety

This section presents a socio-historical review of human
`labour'. It outlines foundational knowledge on the
intertwined origins of worker labour and safety rights
while contextualising the formation and role of unions in
securing labour rights that, today, are standard in
Australian and New Zealand contexts. It will enhance
your understanding of the historical origins of the
contemporary disciplines of Employment Relations and
Work Health and Safety (WHS) to explain why, although
today treated as separate domains, there are commonly
shared assumptions and principles.

1.
The emergence of 'labour': Human
subsistence through to the Scientific
Revolution

This chapter presents a brief history of human labour
beginning with early human subsistence models and
concluding with western concepts of `labour' as emerging
during the Scientific Revolution.

   Learning Objectives

      By the end of this chapter, we will have explored:
              · The transition of human activity from
                 subsistence living through to the division of a
                 society's tasks into different roles that, over
                 time, become increasingly specialised and come
                 to be undertaken by specific community
                 members as their `work'.
              · The links between an emerging scientific
                 paradigm and its use in the judgement of some
                 humans as `lesser' than others, leading to the
                 devaluation of their labour as a justification for

                                      5
6 Lynnaire Sheridan

                 slavery.

For most of human history, people have not worked - they
have simply laboured to survive. In early communities,
humans hunted and gathered to ensure their daily survival.
As agricultural techniques developed in the Neolithic Era
(5000-3000BC), some people were freed up from
subsistence food production which enabled them to
develop role specialisations (Baysal, 2013; Violatti, 2018).
As communities divided up the work, people took on
different tasks, and even some free time was eked out.
In Neolithic Greece, beads for decorative necklaces
demonstrate a specialised craft activity that emerged when
access to raw materials combined with leisure time (Perlès,
2021). Come the end of the Neolithic Era in ancient Egypt,
the division of roles was so sophisticated that social
hierarchies defined everyone's place in society determining
the labour they were eligible to perform and, consequently,
the lifestyle they could aspire to (see Figure 1.1).

The hierarchical centralisation of power in societies led
to the rise of conquests by historical figures including
Alexander the Great (Macedonian, b. 356BC, d. 323BC)
who conquered Greece then Egypt through to modern day
India (Wasson, 2016), Caesar Augustus (Roman, b. 63BC,
d. 14AD) who expanded the Roman Empire from the
Italian peninsula to Egypt, Central Europe and parts of
the Middle East (Appleton, 2022) and Genghis Khan
(Mongolian, b. 1162AD, d. 1227AD) who aspired to
control the `silk road' trading route between Asia and
Europe (Appleton & Willis, 2022). Taking command of
other societies enabled the conquerors to seize both natural
resources and the labour of the conquered peoples (Spoden,
2019).

   Indeed, slavery was pivotal to the expansion of the
8 Lynnaire Sheridan

Roman Empire creating "one of the few `genuine slave
societies' in the western experience" (Harper, 2011, p. 3).
While war led to some direct enslavement of the enemy,
it mainly created conditions that stimulated the slave trade
such as orphaned children, who could be easily enslaved,
and cashed up `victors' (wealthy from the spoils of war)
who could afford to buy slaves at markets (Wickham,
2014). Harper concludes that, at the peak between 275
- 425AD, "the top 1.356 percent of Roman society thus
owned the bottom 5% of Roman society" (Harper, 2011, p.
59-60) and slaves comprised 10% of the Roman Empire's
population (Harper, 2011). This represented a considerable
amount of unpaid slave labour, with slaves in rural
settings engaged in agricultural production and mining
while those in urban areas were household servants, in
public service and craft production (Hunt, 2010). Perhaps
surprising is that there some were highly educated, for
example, being a physician (doctor) was predominantly an
occupation undertaken by slaves in Roman times (Mohler,
1940).

After the collapse of the Roman Empire in Europe, came
the Middle Ages (circa 500-1500AD) where social status,
and work roles, were organised according to a Medieval
feudal system (see Figure 1.3). This ranked King and
Church at the top and cascaded through levels of wealth
down to independent peasants and serfs (forced labourers)
at the bottom (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023a).

By the time of the Elizabethan period (1558-1603), British
social structures had shifted towards a more simplified
class system with the nobility, the gentry, the yeomanry and
the poor. The nobility held power, while the gentry's status
10 Lynnaire Sheridan

was achieved through properties and fortunes; these two
groups did not work for a living. The yeomanry strived
to improve their lives through improving their lands to
generate the necessary savings to buffer them from poverty
in difficult times. The poor worked for others, according to
their ability and opportunities, but they struggled to secure
food and a place to live (Historical Association, n.d.).

   Europe's noble class, similar to previous historical
empires, came to increase their power and wealth through
territorial expansion (Spoden, 2019). The Age of
Discovery (1450-1550) began with Portuguese exploration
of Africa. Later Christopher Columbus, who was
exploring on behalf of the Spanish, reached the Americas.
The Dutch, the French and the English were also all
striving to establish trade, secure new resources and, over
time, colonised new lands (Brown Mitchell, 2023). In
Britain, for example, the "transformation of the English
mercantile economy from its previous dependence upon
a single commodity into a diversified entrepôt [port] that
transshipped dozens of domestic and colonial products was
one of the most significant developments of the century"
(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023b, para 3). However the
newfound wealth came at a cost to some. In conquering
the Americas during the 16th Century, the Spanish "forced
the indigenous people to work in exchange for
`protection'. The system of forced labour used by the
Spanish in the New World decimated the native
population...The Spanish and Portuguese authorities
encouraged their traders to use Africans for this work
instead" (Mohamud & Whitburn, 2018, para. 4). The
British followed suit, buying African slaves from Dutch
traders and relocating them to their British colonies (in the
Caribbean and America) to work on plantations (Mohamud
& Whitburn, 2018).

Interestingly then, European (Western) efforts to explore,
claim and colonise coincided with the Scientific
Revolution (1500-1700): "Since its birth around the same
time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the
world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled
with colonisation, especially British imperialism." (Deb
Roy, 2018, para. 5) Early in the Scientific Revolution, Sir
Francis Bacon (b. 1561, d. 1626) challenged the traditional
ways of `knowing' established in ancient Greece
(Sylvester, 1994) by promoting empiricism: "A conclusion
or piece of evidence derived from observation,
investigation, or experiment; an empirical result or
generalization" (Oxford English Dictionary, 2022, para. 2)
12 Lynnaire Sheridan

thereby forming the foundations of modern experimental
science.

   Come the 1700s, natural science had become a popular
pastime of the educated British leisure class (gentry).
"'Natural philosophy' was mainly an amateur activity
pursued by English gentlemen during their leisure."
(Sylvester, 1994, p. 1) Some, such as Sir Joseph Banks
(see Box 1.1), paid to join large explorative expeditions
and use scientific principles to understand, via observation,
the plants, animals and peoples of the places they
`discovered' (Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 2023).
Lawrence (2015, para. 2) reflects:

   In the eighteenth century many famous expeditions were
   despatched from Europe. These were often explicitly
   colonising enterprises, particularly involving the annexation
   of various regions in South America, India, Australasia and
   the Pacific Ocean. Historians now acknowledge that these
   expeditions mostly appropriated local objects and
   information in order to enhance Western knowledge.

The geo-political expansion of the British Empire was a
source of opportunity for gentlemen to engage in natural
science which, Lawrence (2015) suggests, was principally
the acquisition and subsequent display of curiosities.

          Box 1.1: Joseph Banks the botanist onboard
       Captain Cook's Endeavour voyage

              Joseph Banks came from that enviable class the
           landed gentry; close enough to the land to draw
               ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 13

   common sense from it, and with enough of it to draw
   from it also a handsome revenue; with brains
   enough, indeed, unlike some country gentry, to repay
   education, and with wealth more than enough to
   allow of a town as well as country existence, and of a
   standing in society which no mere rural squire could
   claim. (Beaglehole, 1962, p. 3)

   As natural science was a relatively new field of
study, Joseph Banks learned Botany at Eton by
paying local women to teach him about the plants
they gathered for herbal medicines. At Oxford, he
wished to continue his study of plants so paid one of
Cambridge University's botanists to teach him (Te
Papa, 1998). His most famous expedition was on
the Endeavour with Captain Cook exploring Tahiti,
Huahine, Borabora, Raiatea, New Zealand and
Australia (Beaglehole, 1974). "The Endeavour
voyage was his second major field trip...It was
estimated to have cost him about £10,000 (worth
more than NZ$1.5 million)." (Te Papa, 1998, para.
4). According to ship records, Banks funded fellow
travellers including naturalist Daniel Solander, a
secretary, two artists and four servants (Captain
Cook Society, 2023). Beaglehole (1962) points out,
"It must have been a truly exciting experience for
the botanists to find themselves in a land where
every species of plant was new to them". Banks'
silver fern specimen from the Endeavour voyage
(Figure 1.5) is part of Te Papa's (Museum of New
Zealand) collection.

   However, there was a dark side to this natural
science. The artists onboard the Endeavour did not
simply sketch the plants but, see Figure 1.6, also the
peoples of these then remote places. "The drawings
and paintings made by the artists during the
expeditions formed the basis for dozens of artworks,
which brought to life areas of the world that had
previously been little known the Europeans."
(Anderson, 2017, para. 1)

          This image depicting an Indigenous Australian,
       and other similar drawings, would go on exhibition
       for the British elite and were then made more
       widely available via their reproduction in
       publications including The Gentleman`s Magazine.
                    ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 17

    They came to shape British perceptions of the
    peoples encountered (Anderson, 2017).

Activity 1.1

   The Grand Tour was "a practice that introduced
Englishmen, Germans, Scandinavians, and also Americans,
to the art and culture of France and Italy...possible only for
a priviledged class--the same that produced gentlemen
scientists, authors, antiquaries, and patrons for the arts."
(Sorabella, 2003, para. 1)

   This `tour' of European cultural highlights occurred from
the late sixteenth century for over three hundred years.
Visiting Italian cities, with their roman statues and
architecture, had a lasting impact on the socially powerful
young men of the Grand Tour and thus influenced many
aspects of British life at that time (Sorabella, 2003).

   Consider then how an artist's worldview, strongly
influenced by their Grand Tour and ancient Rome, might
influence how they depict the peoples they encountered on
their colonial expeditions.

When British slavery peaked between 1660 and 1838
(Carey, 2016), the entire British society benefited from
slave labour. "The British state, and the nation as a whole,
reaped the benefits from the duties collected on slave-
produced colonial goods...The consumption of cheap
slave-produced colonial commodities was widespread"
(Donington et al, 2016, p 1-2) Interestingly, it was these
duties (taxes) that led to the American Revolution against
the British (1765-1783), with those living in the British
Americas perceiving the taxing as signalling the beginning
of efforts towards their entire enslavement (Rothschild,
2018).

   Past influencing the present

      Like the sugar being consumed in English tea rooms -
   our contemporary society also benefits from slave labour.
   Modern slavery describes the ways in today's economy
   that labour or services are being extracted from people,
   including children, unwillingly and without appropriate
   compensation. In 2021, World Vision reported that New
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 19

   Zealanders unknowingly spend approximately NZ$34
   dollars a week on products `implicated' in modern slavery
   (World Vision, 2021).

Once successfully independent of Britain, citizens of the
United States constantly debated the morality of slave
labour in their society (Conlin, 2015). The Declaration
of Independence, signed by the original 13 states on the
4th July 1776, stated, "all men are created equal, that
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit
of Happiness" (Jefferson, 1776, para. 2). In 1861, a tipping
point was reached between northern states that had
abolished slavery in the early 1800s and the southern states
that sought to retain it; the American Civil war
(1861-1865) was based on the premise of abolishing
20 Lynnaire Sheridan

slavery in the USA (Conlin, 2015). Abraham Lincoln
(16th President of the United States 1861-1865) supported
the emancipation (liberation) of America's slaves and the
abolishment of slavery via his Emancipation Proclamation
during the American Civil War in 1863 (see Figure 1.8).
The emancipation of slaves and the implications for labour
markets conditions during the American Industrial
Revolution are a focus of Chapter 3.

From this chapter, we have learned that human survival
tasks evolved into specialised roles undertaken by, and
often limited to, particular community members as their
work. As societies expanded, there was a desire to take
over other human settlements and harness their peoples in
the further expansion of the conqueror's empire. With this
emerged slavery; sometimes as ownership of the slave or,
at least, as forced labour.

   Past influencing the present

      While slavery has been recorded far back in history, the
   intertwined histories of colonisation with the Scientific
   Revolution in the 1700-1800s is critical to understanding
   contemporary cultural and diversity perspectives in Human
   Resource (HR) management in workplaces today.

      Linda Tuhiwai Smith, in Decolonizing Methodologies:
   Research and Indigenous Peoples, writes:

         The ways in which scientific research is implicated in the
      worst excesses of colonialism remains a powerful
      remembered history for many of the world's colonized
      peoples. It is a history that still offends the deepest sense of
      our humanity. Just knowing someone measured our
      `faculties' by filling the skulls of our ancestors with millet
      seeds and compared the amount of millet seed to the capacity
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 23

      for mental thought offences our sense of who and what we
      are. (2021, p. 1)

      We can now see how science and colonisation frame
   slavery as:

         In the 1700s and early 1800s, scientists in Europe and the
      Americas studied "race science" --the idea that humankind
      is divided into separate and unequal races. They tried to
      explain the contradiction between the belief in human
      equality expressed during the American and French
      Revolutions and the emergence of slavery in the United
      States and several European countries. (Facing History &
      Ourselves, 2017, para. 1)

      Today HR managers are striving to address the legacy of
   colonisation in HR and Employment Relations practices
   through initiatives such as equitable recruitment strategies
   (anti-discrimination) through to proactive strategies to
   attract, and support, indigenous employees as they
   overcome years of inter-generational discrimination based
   on `principles' of natural science that justified their slavery
   and de-valued their labour.

Chapter 2 will now examine how, parallel to the natural
sciences, the scientific fields of physics and mechanics
led to machines and new industries during the Industrial
Revolution creating the conditions that founded workplace,
health and safety from within the unionised `labour' rights
movement.

The British Industrial Revolution 1730
until the early 20th Century

As part of the Scientific Revolution, concurrent with the
`explosion' of the natural sciences among the British upper
class, there were also theoretical scientists such as Isaac
Newton (b.1643, d. 1727) who "unified the terrestrial and
celestial mechanics...and transformed the mechanical
philosophy...by adding to it mathematically expressed
laws" (Schuster, 1996, p. 217). These scientific `laws',
or perhaps the subsequent emerging scientific paradigm,
fostered invention and the `labour-saving' machines of the
Industrial Revolution (Dennis, 2017). Machines came to
`revolutionise' the production of iron, steel and textiles
which had a cascading effect across the British economy
and society (Newton, 2021, p. 2366). The scientific
method, as enacted in a culture of applied science and
technology, led to the development of labour-saving
machines resulting in the British Industrial Revolution
(Jacob, 2014). This chapter will explore British
experiences of industrialisation through until the early 20th
century.

      By the end of this chapter, we will have explored:

              · How the Scientific Revolution enabled the
                 British Industrial Revolution (1730 - 1850)
                 through the creation of labour-saving machines.

              · How rapid industrialisation and a population
                 boom in Britain resulted in low wages for
                 dangerous work and how these poor working
                 conditions became the origins for labour
                 (employment) relations, trade unionism and
                 workplace health and safety.

              · The emergence, in the early 20th Century, of
                 the British Labour Party from the trade union
                 movement.

The journey from ancient civilisations to the Scientific
Revolution took thousands of years. However, the British
Industrial Revolution (1730 - 1850) was a period of
accelerated change and, in just over 100 years, remarkable
shifts took place that impacted "demographics, politics,
social structures and institutions, and the economy"
(Newton, 2021, p. 2367). As Zhao explains, "in the 17th
century, Britain was still a peaceful agricultural country.
However, in the industrial revolution...manufacturing
factories rose up along river valleys, canals and
railways...[this] greatly changed the face of British towns"
(Zhao, 2019, p. 107); thus the British landscape was
rapidly transformed (see Figure 2.1).

However, the large-scale adoption of machines during the
Industrial Revolution created a different type of work.
The craftsmanship developed over many generations, since
the division of roles during the Neolithic Era (see Figure
1.1), was replaced by the division of labour "the extent to
which jobs in an organization are subdivided into separate
tasks" (Heery & Noon, 2017, para. 1). No longer would
one craftsperson work from beginning to end on an item,
the labour would be divided among many workers most
of whom were responsible for only one task in the item's
production.
28 Lynnaire Sheridan

          Box 2.1: English Bobbin Mill
          In this video we see machines making mass
       production a possibility. Machines revolutionised
       this work as the craftsmen who would have
       previously handmade timber items, such as the
       bobbins used to hold thread during textile
       manufacturing, could be replaced by machines
       operated by less skilled labourers. This was
       particularly efficient given the increasing demand
       for bobbins during the industrial revolution's textile
       industry boom.

Influenced by Newton's scientific laws, Scottish economist
Adam Smith (b. 1723, d. 1790) sought out similar general
economic principles (Montes, 2008) and observed that the
division of labour "increases production and makes it more
efficient by dividing the separate tasks of making an object
among different individuals and thereby simplifying the
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 29

job each person must perform" (Wolf, 2019, para. 3).
Smith then conceptualised production's fixed costs as raw
materials, plant equipment and human capital (Spengler,
1977), where human capital was "the economic value of a
worker's experience and skills" (Kenton, 2023a, para 1).
Smith perceived there to be an "unnecessary costliness of
human capital as well as its suboptimal use" (Spengler,
1977, p. 25). Smith highlighted the considerable economic
potential that could be harnessed from the efficient
utilisation of raw materials, machines and workers. With
this assertion, Adam Smith shifted both economic thought
and precipitated the field of management (and
subsequently HR management).

However, the rapid change of industrialisation created
great challenges; the intensification of production, enabled
by machines, often led to terrible conditions for the people
operating the machinery. As Newton recounts:

   Work places were often poorly ventilated, overcrowded, and
   replete with safety hazards. Men, women, and children alike
   were employed at subsistence wages in unhealthy and
   dangerous environments. Workers were often able to afford
   no more than the simplest housing, resulting in the rise of
   urban slums. Stories of the unbelievable work conditions
   in mines, textile factories, and other industrial plants soon
   became a staple of Victorian [1837 - 1901] literature. (2021,
   p. 2368)

Poor working conditions led to the craft guilds, who had
protected crafts and trades since the Middle Ages, re-
organising to raise awareness of the work conditions--this
was the beginning of the trade union movement
(Cartwright, 2023).

   However, it is an outbreak of malignant fever at a cotton
30 Lynnaire Sheridan

mill near Manchester in 1784 that marks the true
beginnings of employment relations and workplace health
and safety. Dr Thomas Percival determined that, "the
epidemic was due to overwork for inordinately long hours,
poor food, wretched clothing, bad ventilation, and
overcrowding in insanitary houses and factories, especially
by children" (Meiklejohn, 1958, p. 2). The absentee
factory owner, Sir Robert Peel, was a parliamentarian who
was both surprised and devastated by the conditions at his
mill; he championed the Health and Morals of Apprentices
Act of 1802. The legislation applied to any textile mill or
factory with more than three apprentices, or over twenty
workers, and required ventilation and cleaning of the
workplace. Specific to apprentices was a maximum
12-hour work day, no work between 9pm and 6am,
provision of work clothing and an education including
reading, writing, maths and Christian religion.

   Sir Robert Peel had been particularly concerned about
apprentices and made them the focus of the legislation
because, at the time, orphans and pauper children were
often sent to live and work as apprentices at factories in
compliance with the "Poor Law", an act that ensured they
were sheltered, fed and clothed. However, Sir Robert Peel
disagreed with the poor conditions of the work they were
exposed to in order to earn their up-keep (UK Parliament,
n.d.). To contextualise this, it is important to understand
that in one facility alone, that of Robert Owen's New
Lanark mill in 1799, 70% of the workforce were under
18 years old but the majority were under 13 (Bolin-Holt,
1989, as cited in Innes, 2002). On average children began
working at eight and a half years old, often in cleaning
roles that required them to manoeuvre around working
machinery, "working for very low pay, performing work
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 31

that was dirty and dangerous, and usually working long
hours as well" (Griffin, 2014, para. 2).

          Box 2.2: Harrowing lives of children sent to work

          Professor Rebecca Gowland has studied the
       skeletal remains of 154 people buried in a North
       Yorkshire cemetery, many of whom were children

       that the children "were forced to sacrifice
       themselves to conditions that were detrimental to
       their physical and mental wellbeing, in some
       instances leading to death within a few years of
       apprenticeship" (Gowland et. al., 2023, para. 56).

The Health and Morals of Apprentices Act of 1802 is the
first piece of labour and safety legislation in the world
but, unfortunately, it was poorly enforced (Innes, 2002).
Preceded by the Combination Acts (1799-1800), which
banned collective wage negotiations as any worker "who
combined with another to gain an increase in wages or
a decrease in hours" could be penalised (Encyclopaedia
Britannica, 2017, para. 1), the Health and Morals of
Apprentices Act of 1802 also coincided with rapid
population growth. Agricultural improvements resulted in
greater population health and wellbeing (Komlos, 1990),
effectively providing employers with a limitless supply of
willing workers (Cartwright, 2023). With no tangible legal
consequences for employers, and an inhibition of worker
collectives, there was little actual possibility for improved
labour and safety outcomes for workers at this time.

   Over the following decades, political tolerance for non-
compliance by factory owners waned as members of
Britain's parliament, some of whom were also factory
owners themselves, took a paternalistic view towards their
workers. The Health and Morals of Apprentices Act of
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 33

1802 signalled an important shift in labour health and
safety management with the introduction of factory
inspectors who could enforce infringement notices,
however, there were too few inspectors to enforce the Act
with just four inspectors being responsible for 4000 mills
(UK Parliament, n.d.). Political efforts continued with
Lord Ashley-Cooper campaigning for the Mines Act of
1842, which banned all women and girls from mining and
excluding boys under 10 years of age, and again he
championed the Ten Hours Act of 1847 which sought to
reduce the workday in mills to ten hours (Encyclopaedia
Britannica, 2023c).

   In the emerging industrialised environment, legally it
was becoming challenging for workers and employers to
effectively negotiate wages without being at risk of
contravening the Combination Acts. In 1859, Judge
Rupert Kettle began advocating for legal mechanisms, such
as arbitration, to resolve industrial disputes with a view that
laws should "be used to foster negotiation between masters
and men, not to quash collective action by either side"
(Cornish, 2010, p. 668). The 1868 Royal Commission
into Organisation and Rules of Trades Unions and Other
Associations followed. It produced a majority report
supporting the status quo of unions as illegal while a
minority report favoured the regulation of trade unions,
the latter came to be adopted by government (Cornish,

2010). This led to the Trade Union Act 1871 which
decriminalised the formal association of workers
for wage bargaining, however striking was still
illegal (Cornish, 2010).

   It is important to recognise that these times and events
are both shaped by, and influence, societal and government
debate. Why, for example, would the government of the
day choose to support the minority rather than the majority
34 Lynnaire Sheridan

report? Historical figures, such as Karl Marx who was
based in London during these times, were shaping
intellectual debate on capitalism, communism, and
human labour. Such societal debates would naturally
influence political leaders. Box 2.3 provides a very brief
overview of Karl Marx's perspective on labour.

          In 1867, while based in London, Karl Marx
       published Das Capital. In critiquing Adam Smith's
       conceptualisation of production as being solely a
       capitalist approach, Marx focused specifically on
       the labour component. He proposed that "there are
       two major flaws inherent in capitalism that lead to
       the exploitation of workers by employers: the
       chaotic nature of free market competition and the
       extraction of surplus labour" (Kenton, 2023, para.
       9). Marx argues that profit is achieved when
       employers pay staff less than the value of their
       labour, not by selling items at a higher price
       (Liberto, 2021). This conceptualisation of the
       relationship between labour exploitation and
       employer profit likely shaped the subsequent
       government decision to establish the Trade Union
       Act 1871 to counteract the imbalance of power
       between employers and workers.

In concluding our understanding of the impact of the
British Industrial Revolution on labour (employment)
relations, unions and safety, it would be remiss not to
mention the Fabian Society. The Fabian Society was
established in January of 1884 to achieve socialist
objectives in a slow and methodical manner, as opposed
to revolutionary, manner and this non-violent approach to
change arguably enabled their positive engagement with
36 Lynnaire Sheridan

government (Fabian Society, n.d.). In 1900, the Fabian
Society became a founding member of the British Labour
Party (The Labour Party, n.d.) and in the 1906 elections
there were 26 voted representatives who considered
themselves to be for `labour'. In 1906, the Fabians,
together with the `labour' representatives, had successfully
lobbied to establish a minimum wage and by 1911, they
had established foundations for the British universal
healthcare system (Fabian Society, n.d.).

   Crucial founders and actors in the Fabian Society were
Beatrice and Sidney Webb who wrote many of the
Society's foundational publications, including the History
of Trade Unionism in 1894. While their contributions in
this arena are many, they are renown for having coined
the term `collective bargaining', in the aforementioned
publication (Webb & Webb, 1898, p. 33). At the end of
the 19th century "free bargaining between the capitalist and
his workmen became the sole method of fixing wages"
(Webb & Webb, 1898, p. 77), disadvantaging the workers
and creating the aforementioned legal quandaries (Cornish,
2010). The Webbs' acknowledged that it was
approximately 50 years before the Act of 1825 provided
the "right of collective bargaining, involving the power to
withhold labour from the market by concerted action" in
Britain (Webb & Webb, 1898, p. 111).

   The British Industrial Revolution, at its conclusion, had
led to massification of production, with the assistance of
`labour-saving' machinery (see Figure 2.4). Its beginnings
saw the most vulnerable of workers labouring in the
harshest of conditions. We also saw initial efforts from
paternalistic owners, some of whom were in parliament,
to reduce child labour and increase regulation around the
hours of workers. A demographic population `boom', and
the associated availability of labour, made achieving better
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 37

working conditions, and particularly better wages,
particularly difficult throughout this period. Come the turn
of the 20th century, however, efforts were underway to
enable the collective association of workers, underpinning
the formation of the British Labour Party which would,
over time, led to the modern British trade union
movement.

While the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, it was
not geographically constrained and it moved rapidly across
Europe. Moreover, it reached the Americas via Britain's
colony as approximately 6000 people emigrated from
Britain between 1773 and 1776, and "with these
immigrants came some textile workers who were familiar
with the latest innovations in spinning wool and cotton"
(Weightman, 2007, p. 37). Chapter 3 pivots from this
38 Lynnaire Sheridan

examination of the British context, to consider the impact
of industrialisation on the United States (sometimes known
as the Second Industrial Revolution) and the uniquely
American phenomena that have implications for workplace
health and safety today.

Industrial Revolution in the United
States from 1793 until the early 20th
Century

The beginning of the United States' Industrial Revolution
is attributed to an English immigrant opening a textile
mill in Rhode Island in 1793 (Weightman, 2007). Like
in Britain, mass industrialisation and production followed,
but in America, a labour shortage led to more union activity
and a greater emphasis on productivity. This, in turn, led to
studies of management and, more specifically, scientific
management.

   Learning Objectives

      By the end of this chapter, we will have explored:
              · The unique circumstances within the United
                 States and how these influenced
                 industrialisation in this new nation.
              · The role of the American Civil War, and its
                 anti-slavery movement, in generating a labour
                 shortage which enabled worker collectives to

                                     39

                 establish.

              · The emergence of Taylorism, Scientific
                 Management and Fordism as employer
                 responses to managing worker productivity in
                 the face of labour shortages and labor union
                 movement strikes.

The European master-apprentice model transferred from
Britain, via its colony, to America. By 1792, craft guilds,
such as the Association of Shoemakers in Philadelphia,
were already establish (Freeman, 2020). British
craftspeople dominated the British labour market well into
the British Industrial Revolution because their collective
movements fought to protect skilled (trade or craft) worker
rights (Walling, 1905). In America, the labour market
transition was swifter and, for example, master craftsmen
dominated Boston's labour market in 1790 but were
considerably outnumbered by journeymen (unskilled day
labourers) by 1815 (Tomlins, 1993).

   Walling's (1905) explains that in the American context
reduced demand for skilled workers was paired with an
inflow of less skilled workers. The emphasis in America
came to be on skilled and unskilled workers associating
to collectively negotiate better conditions. While initially,
displaced skilled craftspeople comprised the membership
of worker collectives, by the middle of 1800s unions for
everyone were forming in mining, railroads, and factories
because "many workers saw the development of these
kinds of unprecedented concentrations of wealth as
threatening not just their employment situation but the very
nature of American democracy" (Freeman, 2020, para. 6).

This said, similar to in Britain, there were also
paternalistic employers who were innovative in their
approaches towards workers, Lowell Mills (see Box 3.1) is
one such example.

          Box 3.1: Lowell Mills

          In 1814, a mill opened in Massachusetts whose
       operation was to be based in the Protestant work
       ethic. Francis Cabot Lowell and his Boston
       Associates decided to overcome potential labour
       shortages by offering work to women. "For many
       of the mill girls, employment brought a sense of
       freedom. Unlike most young women of that era,
       they were free from parental authority, were able to
       earn their own money, and had broader educational
       opportunities" (Gilder Lehrman Institute, 2023,
       para. 3). Lowell insisted that, in addition to
       housing, the young women be provided with an
       education. However, it is also important to
       recognise that hiring an all-female workforce was
       good financial decision with their lower wages.

          When conditions changed in the 1830s, a drop in
       the price of textiles meant that the Lowell Mills
       sought to cut wages. The `mill girls' successful
       went on strike against the decision and, as a result,
               ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 43

sustained their wage. They came to form the First
Union of Working Women (American Federation of
Labor, 2023). The Lowell Mill girls are also
renown for reducing their six day, 75 hour week,
down to a ten-hour day (see Figure 3.2) as part of
the ten-hour day movement (Nicholson, 2004).

        Figure 3.2: Lowell `mill girls' lobby for a ten hour day
          Source: Voice of Industry Project, Public Domain

   To contextualise this, by 1835 Boston Artisans
were lobbying against long work hours with
paternalist employers (likely the Boston
Associates who were also involved in the Lowell
Mill). These skilled craftspeople fought for the ten-
hour day by refuting arguments of Protestant-ethic
employers that these workers would "spend all our
hours of leisure in drunkenness and debauchery if
the hours of labor are reduced" (cited in Irving &
Schwaab, 1952, p. 342-343). Some success came
44 Lynnaire Sheridan

       in 1840 when President Martin Van Buren, by
       executive order, "directed the observance of the ten-
       hour system for laborers and mechanics employed
       on the [federal] government's public works" (Kelly,
       1950). However, it took until 1847 for the first state
       legislated ten-hour day for non-government workers
       and this took place in the State of New Hampshire.
       The New Hampshire legislation, although not
       strictly enforced, demonstrates the influence of
       Lowell Mill girls on their geographical region and
       overall on the United States Labor Movement
       (American Federation of Labor, 2023).
       Interestingly, 1847 is when the British Ten Hours
       Act was introduced (Encyclopaedia Britannica,
       2023).

   Past influencing the present

      Have you ever considered how the Industrial Revolution
   impacts on our lives today?

      When a school bell rings, it seems normal and timeless
   that school students will collect their belongings and move
   on to their next class. However, many facets of modern life
   are, in fact, based on practices established by the Industrial
   Revolution. For example, using a school bell to signal a
   shift in activity or the start of a lunch break, is based on a
   factory model of education (Shaw, 2016, para. 1).

      In response to the tight control of their working hours
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 45

   (and lives) women of the Industrial Revolution wrote
   poems of protest, such as The Factory Bell, as "The bells
   woke the operatives up, called them into the mills; they
   rang at breakfast, called them back into the mills, again at
   lunch, at closing time, and finally at curfew" (Voice of
   Industry Project, 2012, para. 3).

The power of the collective in America was strengthened
by a labour shortage induced by the emancipation of
slavery. In 1803, as calls to emancipate slaves increased in
the northern states:

   The United States [federal government] abolished the
   international slave trade [importation of slaves], creating a
   labor shortage. Under these circumstances, the domestic
   slave trade increased as an estimate one million enslaved
   people were sent to the Deep South [southern states of the
   United States] to work in cotton, sugar and rice fields."
   (Elliott & Hughes, 2019, para. 14)

The American Civil War (1861-1865), fought on
abolishing slavery altogether (see Abraham Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation, Figure 1.8), stimulated
manufacturing which then required more workers (Clinton,
2008) but concurrently removed males from the labour
force, as they became soldiers (or even casualties),
therefore reducing the available working population
(Clinton, 2008). Increased taxes, taken by government to
pay for the war, led to inflation which, in turn, encouraged
workers to organise to increase their wages to protect their
standard of living (Commons, 1918). The conclusion of
the war then abruptly removed slave labour, leading to a
complete restructuring of economies in the southern states
(Ransom, 1989), which exacerbated the existing labour
46 Lynnaire Sheridan

shortage and would, post-war, empower the union
movement. Notably these uniquely American conditions
were quite a distinct from the British Industrial Revolution
experiences given their rapidly growing British population
had provided a ready source of workers thereby thwarting
attempts by workers to collectively negotiate better wages
and conditions.

   Collective worker groups, even those devastated by the
Civil War, rapidly reformed when subsequent peace-time
industrialisation occurred. In 1865, William Sylvis had
high ambitions for these newly formed collectives to
combine into a national union so as to influence
government laws on labour (Commons, 1918; Foner,
1947). As leader of the National Union of Iron Molders,
he wrote to the Ship Caulker's union saying, "what we
need is a Department of government attending exclusively
to Labor matters, with its head in the president's Cabinet
to speak for us" (cited in Lombardi, 1942, p. 19). Union
lobbying for this cause appears to have been somewhat
successful as, in 1867, Congress established the Committee
on Education and Labor (Committee on Education and the
Workforce, 2023). However, this committee had a wide
gamut, ranging from addressing the emergence of industry,
through to post Civil War developments, such as the
establishment of an education system as a means to
integrate former African American slaves into mainstream
society, particularly for the employment options education
could afford them (McKinney, 2013). When Sylvis headed
the National Labor Union (1866-1873) he "placed its
reliance primarily on legislative action" as opposed to the
"economic coercion" of traditional labour unions
(Lombardi, 1942, p. 17). When he died in 1869, however,
the legislative approach discontinued as he'd been its
driving force (Lombardi, 1942).
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 47

   Despite their existence, unions were not formally
endorsed and their economic coercion approach (strikes)
led to a period of violent clashes between organised
workers and those who sought to quell their `illegal'
activities. "Between 1875 and 1910, state militias - which
is what today we would call the National Guard - were
called out nearly 500 times to deal with labor unrest"
(Freeman, 2020). In response, in 1883, the Committee
on Education and Labor was specifically charged with
addressing labour unrest across the country (McKinney,
2013). One outcome of that year's sitting of the
Committee was the establishment of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, and this was followed in 1888 by a Bureau of
Labor (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). Notably,
neither of these entities reach Sylvis' aspirations; they were
not directly overseen by the U.S. President (Lombardi,
1942).

   In the context of a labour shortage, and strengthening
union activity, employer approaches to the `management
of labour' emerge--these are the origins of the modern
discipline of management. As a "result of the rapid and
chaotic growth of many organizations, it became clear that
a more systematic approach to management was needed"
Witzel (2011, p. 6-7). Henry Towne was an American
engineer who, in 1886, wrote:

   The organization of production labour must be directed and
   controlled by persons having not only good executive ability,
   and possessing the practical familiarity of a mechanic or
   engineer with the goods produced and the processed
   employed, but having also, and equally, a practical
   knowledge of how to observe, record, analyze and compare
   essential facts in relation to wages, supplies, expense
   accounts, and all else that enters into or affects the economy
   of production and the cost of the product. (Towne, 1986)
48 Lynnaire Sheridan

While echoing Adam Smith's assertion that efficiency
could further unlock the economic potential of industrial
production, this statement was designed to validate the role
of industrial engineers in the `management' of production
workers and was a call to action, to which American
engineer Frederick Taylor responded via his
conceptualisation of Scientific Management.

   Scientific Management may be defined as:

   An approach to management, based on the theories of F.W.
   Taylor, dealing with the motivation to work. It sees it as a
   manager's duty to find out the best way to do a given job,
   by a process of work measurement, then give each worker
   individual instructions which have to be strictly followed.
   The individual is thus seen as the extension of his or her
   machine, and his or her rewards are also to be allocated
   mechanically, with more pay expected to produce more
   output regardless of any other factors. (Statt, 1999, p. 150)

It is the practical use of scientific methods, gained from
the Scientific Revolution, to enhance production outcomes
amidst the rapid changes derived from industrialisation.

   Frederick Taylor read Henry Towne's 1886 article and,
after garnering considerable workplace experience,
presented his own perspective in 1895 focused on
rewarding employees based on the work performed, rather
than the hours worked. He justified his stance with
scientific data derived from undertaking:

   Time trials with a stopwatch, measuring how long it took
   workers to perform tasks, and set up a small department to
   record and analyse the results. By creating a run of data
   through these time studies, Taylor was able to arrive at
   optimum times for each task. (Witzel, 2011, p. 85)

Taylor felt paying workers for the work they achieved
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 49

was the fairest way to compensate their labour while
maximising production.

   However, unions had long advocated "A fair day's
wages for a fair day's work"--a popular slogan used by
worker collectives since philosopher Thomas Carlyle
coined it in 1843 (Carlyle, 1843, p. 17). Taylor was
arguing that what comprises a fair day's work should be
determined through Scientific Management as he felt that
many unions deliberately had their members work slower
on day pay rates (McKelvey, 1952, p. 15). Around the
same time, public awareness on the conditions of workers
was increasing due to the efforts of people such as
sociologist Lewis Hines who, using a camera (see Figure
3.3), sought to capture the experiences of the working
class, including the plight of child labourers, to create
awareness among the general population on the human
cost behind the increasingly affordable products they were
purchasing (Sutherland, 2012).

While Taylor's pay-per-piece did incentivise the worker
to produce more (Thompson, 1913), unions continued to
raise concerns about the injuries to workers caused by
fast, repetitive, work. At the 1911 American Federation of
Labor convention, their President Samuel Gompers stated,
"organized labor would always be hostile...to any system
which ruined the worker's health and lowered wages by
substituting unskilled for skilled operatives" (McKelvey,
1952, p. 17). However, Taylor's approach to timing staff,
and paying the most efficient workers more, was popular
with business owners and production supervisors as it
provided a credible and logical response to collective
(union) pay claims--you get paid for what you do--but,
from this point, The International Association of
Machinists and the American Federation of Labour became
"implacable enemies of Scientific Management" (Nelson,
1992, p. 9)--more money per piece did not redress their
concerns.

   In fairness to Taylor, it is important to note that his
perspective was influenced by the Protestant ethic, "the
value attached to hard work, thrift, and efficiency in one's
worldly calling, which, especially in the Calvinist view,
were deemed signs of an individuals' election, or eternal
salvation" (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2020, para. 1). In
the current day, it is difficult to understand Taylor's view
on work as `Godly' and that his desire to ensure employees
worked to their fullest capacity was linked to everyone
receiving a righteous reward in Heaven. Indeed, timing
worker outputs in today's world, with greater awareness
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 51

of the risks of repetitive work under pressure, seems
inappropriate but Taylor saw it as a noble pursuit:

   The principle objective of management should be to secure
   the maximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the
   maximum prosperity for the employe [sic]...throughout the
   industrial world, a large part of the organisations for
   employers, as well as for employes [sic], is for war rather
   than peace, and that perhaps the majority on either side do
   not believe it is possible so to arrange their mutual relations
   so that their interests become identical. (Taylor, 1911, p.
   9-10)

Essentially, maximum prosperity was associated with
maximum efficiency, and this was a Godly pursuit that
Unitarists (unitarism) such as Taylor believed, this should
not be interfered with by unions (Boddwyn 1961).
Taylor's work culminated in 1911 with the publication of
his book The Principles of Scientific Management (Taylor,
1911).

   Given he was credible, with experience designing
machinery and in industrial supervisory roles, "Taylor's
imagery evoked an enthusiastic response from engineers
and factory managers and from a larger group whose
interested extended to virtually every institution" (Nelson,
1992, p. 6). He certainly appears to have influenced Henry
Ford (b. 1863, d. 1947), of the Ford Motor Company,
as Ford used time and motion studies to reduce the
complexity of making a car into many steps that could
take advantage of the efficiency of the division of labour
(Hounshell, 1988). Subsequently, in 1913, Ford became
known for revolutionising manufacturing by innovating
assembly line production - with work being brought to the
worker rather than the worker going to the object being
built. The assembly line, together with the overall division
52 Lynnaire Sheridan

of labour, significantly reduced the cost of the cars Ford
was producing and made these a widely available
consumer item (Ford Motor Company, 2020). However,
Nyland asserts that an important point of different between
Taylor and Ford exists; Ford actively de-skilled workers
as a wage reducing mechanism, whereas Taylor sought
worker efficiency (Nyland, 1998).

   As its implementation evolved, Scientific Management
and Fordism (as Henry Ford's manufacturing system came
to be known) was not without its critics because of the
expectations it placed on workers. The fast and repetitive
nature of work at the Ford Motor Company initially led
to high worker turnover because "workers found the
assembly line work boring as they were now doing only
one or two task(s)...workers did not like the strict timing
that the moving assembly line required" (Ford Motor
Company, 2020, para. 3). To address this, Ford increased
his wages to double the average wage ($5 an hour) which
made the pace more attractive to existing workers and
incentivised others to seek work at Ford Motor Company;
this provided Ford with a constant source of replacement
labour (Ford Motor Company, 2020). This 1914 wage
increase was designed to ensure unions could not establish
themselves in Ford's premises and to ensure the cost of
human capital would not keep going up indefinitely
(Cwiek, 2014). The division of labour, established early
in the British Industrial Revolution, enabled Ford to exert
considerable control over his workers as anyone could do
the unskilled work required on the Ford production line.

So why this push for productivity? To Taylor it was
`Godly', to Marx (see Box 2.3) it was profit driven with
employers cashing in on the gap between the cost and
value of labour, and, for others, it was simply because of
the labour shortage. One `solution' to the labour-shortage
issue was to introduce immigration, President Lincoln
endorsed this strongly in his third address to Congress in
1863:

   I again submit to your consideration the expediency of
   establishing a system for the encouragement of
   immigration...there is still a great deficiency of laborers in
   every field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our
   mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals.
   (Lincoln, 1863, para. 18)
54 Lynnaire Sheridan

He was successful in his lobbying. The Immigration Act
of 1864 established a Commissioner of Immigration to
facilitate employment-centric immigration (Migration
Policy Institute, 2013). The resulting migrants were
welcomed until the 1880s when anti-immigrant sentiments
began to emerge, one example being the Alien Contract
Labor Law of 1885 whereby employers could not contract
foreign labour (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services,
2020), however overall immigration from Southern Europe
continued in large numbers until World War I (Wittke,
1949). This very briefly contextualises what would come
to form the United States' historical narratives around
being built on migrants and, by working hard, these
migrants too would be able to achieve economic prosperity
offered by the American Dream , "a better, richer, and
happier life for all our citizens of every rank" (Adams,
1931, Preface, para. 2).

However, the reality for these migrants was harsh working
conditions with few safety provisions. The New York
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 55

Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911 impacted mainly
recent Italian and Jewish migrant women with 123 women/
girls and 23 men dying when exits were blocked in order
to prevent workers taking unauthorised breaks (Trasciatti,
2022). Public pressure led to the establishment of a State
of New York Factory Investigating Commission which
heard reports from field agents, and directly from a variety
of related stakeholders, including workers about conditions
in manufacturing (Golding, 1989). Resulting from this
investigation, in 1913 a federal Department of Labor was
established "to foster, promote and develop the welfare of
working people, to improve their working conditions and
to enhance their opportunities for profitable employment"
(MacLaury, 1988, para. 2, citing the legislation). Finally,
Sylvis' aspirations for a Department of Labor that would
truly represent the voice of the worker directly to the
President were realised (Lombardi, 1942).

The industrialisation of the United States saw craftsmen
displaced by low-skilled workers, but the unique
conditions, including a labour shortage, resulted in quite
different outcomes than in Britain. From its beginnings,
the United States had a culture of worker collectives (such
as the Lowell Mill girls), which tended to adopt economic
coercion methods to achieving labour rights (such as
strikes) more than the political approaches seen in Britain
with the establishment of the Fabian Society and,
subsequently, the British Labour Party. A number of
factors, including the tight labour market, then led to
employers seeking the maximum productivity from the few
workers they had; this became the impetus for Taylorism.
Scientific Management then emerged as America's
response to `managing' the rapid change that
industrialisation brought and making the best `use' of the
interaction between workers and machines.
                    ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 57

Past Influencing the present

   The cost savings achieved by replacing craftsmen with
unskilled labourers benefited those producing the goods,
but also the consumers. The Industrial Revolution sowed
the seed for a growing middle class who could aspire to
own products they had never previously imagined possible.
Henry Ford, for example, reduced his cost of labour and
increased his efficiencies through adopting a moving
assembly line to make cars that were affordable to middle
class Americans (see Figure 3.4).

      Importantly, the challenges Britain and the United States
   faced in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries have, in
   recent times, simply been transferred to the developing
   economies today. While we continue to benefit from access
   to imported cheap consumer goods, in the places where
                    ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 59

these items are manufactured there is still child labour, long
hours, low wages and threats to everyday health (Min et al.,
2019). So, while we live the legacies of the Industrial
Revolution in our daily lives through school bells in our
educational system, others are still more immediately
impacted on a daily basis by realities of industrialisation in
their countries today. A photograph of a Pakistani child
removing dust from a cotton production machine (see

of children working in the American cotton mills in 1916
(see Figure 3.6).

   This section of the book, History: Exploring the origins
of labour rights and worker safety, was designed to
highlight the historical origins of modern day perspectives
on Work Health and Safety by seeing how the development
of the concept of `labour' has evolved into domains: labour
(employment) relations, the union movement and
workplace health and safety. Worker entitlements, worker
safety and the right to collective representation of workers
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 61

to employers, exist in contemporary NZ and Australian
legislation as longer-term consequences of the British and
American industrial revolutions. It is a period in history
that fundamentally shaped our current perspective. Having
now established key links between the past and the present,
the following section will specifically focus on workplace
health and safety from the perspective of HR managers.

Theory: A systems approach
to work health and safety
management

This section defines key concepts for work health and
safety (WHS) management. It explains James Reasons'
Swiss Cheese Model of safety incident causation as a
systems-based approach to WHS management; a model
proposing that it is the combining of active failures
(human errors) and latent conditions that lead to the
WHS incidents that harm workers. Subsequently, safety
management systems are proposed as a mechanism to
identify, and actively resolve latent factors, before
introducing safety culture as fundamental to effective
WHS management.

What is work health and safety?

Understanding how to achieve effective work health and
safety (WHS) management is complex. Also, when we
start to think about WHS, it could mean many different
things to different people. This chapter is designed to help
you understand some key concepts in WHS by exploring
some of its complexities and defining important terms.
This will set you up to explore theories that try to explain
why certain approaches are useful, while others lead to
serious injuries for workers.

   Learning Objectives

       This chapter introduces:
              · Key work health and safety (WHS) concepts
                 and definitions.

Defining WHS

What is WHS management? In it's simplest sense, WHS
management comprises the actions employers undertake to
ensure a safe workplace for workers.

               Figure 4.1: Workplace health and safety terminology
                      Source: Lynnaire Sheridan, CC BY-SA 4.0

There is a lot of technical terminology involved in WHS
management (see Figure 4.1); let's cover the basics. The
World Health Organization defines work (occupational)
health and safety as "all aspects of health and safety in the
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 67

workplace...[with a] strong focus on primary prevention of
hazards" (World Health Organization, n.d., para. 1) where,
health is "a state of complete physical, mental and social
well-being and not merely the absence of disease or
infirmity" (World Health Organization, 1946, p. 1). What
then is a hazard? A hazard may be defined as "anything
with the potential to harm life, health or property" (Dunn,
2012, p. 53).

   WHS management is then any action taken by
responsible parties to ensure a healthy and safe workplace.
This means protecting the people, plant, and environment
from hazards that potentially could cause harm. In simple
terms, it can be considered to be the approaches, processes,
tools and techniques used by organisations to keep their
workers safe so they can achieve their work. Notably,
taking into account the World Health Organizations
definition of `health', WHS is not just preventing illness
or injury, but proactively helping workers to be, and stay,
well.

   What then does `safety' mean in this WHS management
context? Safety is a "state in which the risk of harm (to
persons) or damage is limited to an acceptable level" where
risk is defined as the "likelihood and consequence of injury
or harm occurring" (Standards Australia & Standards New
Zealand, 2001, p. 5). This means that an employer is only
expected to manage health and safety to an `acceptable
level' of risk for injury or harm to occur to their
workers--that which is reasonably practicable or
"reasonably able to be done" (Safe Work Australia, 2023,
part 18).

   While WHS has traditionally been about health and
safety in a `workplace', the notion of ` workplace' is
changing and evolving over time. To address this, the
focus and responsibility is placed on a PCBU, a person
68 Lynnaire Sheridan

conducting a business or undertaking (NZ Parliament,
2015; Safe Work Australia, 2023). WorkSafe New Zealand
explains, "a PCBU may be an individual person or an
organisation. This does not include workers or officers
of PCBUs, volunteer associations, or home occupiers that
employ or engage a tradesperson to carry out residential
work" (WorkSafe, 2019, p. 4). This shift towards PCBUs
being responsible for workers, rather than a workplace,
means PCBUs are responsible for managing worker health
and safety wherever workers are engaged in work.

   Who then is a `worker'? A worker is a person
undertaking work for a PCBU (Safe Work Australia,
2023). Notably, a worker does not have to be an
employee--contractors, sub-contractors, interns and, in
certain situations, volunteers are all considered workers
(NZ Parliament, 2015; Safe Work Australia, 2023).

   Note: While notionally the same, there are some
nuanced differences between Australia and New Zealand
legislated definitions of a worker so it is important to
follow the legislation that applies in your jurisdiction.

   In summary, WHS management is designed to keep
workers (people who undertake work for a PCBU ) in
good health (not just unharmed) and safe (to an
acceptable, reasonably practicable, level) from any
foreseeable hazards that could present as they undertake
their work. However, what should a PCBU actually
manage?

Managing WHS

What WHS management comprises for a PCBU, in any
given context, is determined by the legislation that applies
in that jurisdiction, the existence or adequacy of WHS
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 69

regulators and, very importantly, the attitude of the
organisation and its people towards WHS (safety culture).

Managing worker health

In most legal contexts, PCBU WHS responsibilities extend
to occupational diseases (health) and workplace incidents
(safety). Let's start with occupational disease which is
"any illness associated with a particular occupation or
industry. Such diseases result from a variety of biological,
chemical, physical, and psychological factor that are
present in the work environment or are otherwise
encountered in the course of employment" (Kazantzis,
2022, para. 1). From a WHS perspective, these diseases
are preventable through the control of employee exposure
to the hazards that cause disease (Kazantzis, 2022).

   While some occupational disease can occur through
immediate exposure, detection of most occupational
disease is done via occupational epidemiology which is
the investigation of the occurrence of disease and clusters
of impacted people having their exposure linked back to
specific workplaces or industries (Merletti et al., 2014). It
can take many years to identify the hazard associated with
an illness, given it requires accumulated exposure over
time before it presents as disease in a worker. For example,
asbestos was first industrially manufactured in the 1880s
with the first recorded case of asbestosis disease being
documented in 1906. Many deaths subsequently occurred
before, in the 1970s, there was enough epidemiological
evidence to conclude that asbestos was a carcinogen
(cancer causing) and that those working with asbestos were
at most risk (Lemen et al., 1980). The need for long-term,
epidemiological evidence, means that occupational disease
identification is often beyond what is reasonably
70 Lynnaire Sheridan

practicable for an individual HR practitioner or their
organisation; to identify and control these hazards requires
collaboration between public health agencies, WHS
regulators and specialists in occupational health (Ahrens
et al., 2014). The United State's Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), "the nation's leading
science-based, data-driven, service organization that
protects the public's health" (CDC, 2023a, para 1.), is a
public health entity that incorporates worker health in its
remit. The CDC's National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) operates through partnerships
with employers to enhance worker health outcomes (CDC,
2023b).

   Past influencing the present

      Occupational health, as a specialisation within WHS, has
   its modern-day origins in the Industrial Revolution. In
   Chapter 2, we saw that Dr Thomas Percival identified the
   crucial link between the congested, unsanitary, conditions at
   a cotton mill and the outbreak of malignant fever
   (Meikeljohn, 1958) which, in turn, led Sir Robert Peel to
   introducing Britain's first WHS legislation, the Health and
   Morals of Apprentices Act of 1802 (UK Parliament, n.d.).

      Occupational health had its modest beginnings in first aid
   and disease controls for high risk heavy industry
   workplaces, such as mines. It gained greater recognition in
   the 1970s when the World Health Organization
   acknowledged its contribution to the identification of
   workplace-derived factors causing occupational illness,
   suggesting its remit be broadened to encompass public
   health. As such, many occupational health specialists now
                    ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 71

have more of a public health, rather than `occupational',
focus (Schilling, 1989).

  Figure 4.2: Occupational nurse, Sharnice Johnson, checks a patient's vital signs.

     210525-N-QA097-201" by Navy Medicine, Flickr.com, Public Domain

   Schilling (1989) notes that historical WHS occupational
health challenges are simply repeating themselves today in
developing economy contexts:

      The health problems arising from industrial progress in
   developing countries today are, in many aspects, similar to
   those during industrialization in the nineteenth century; these
   countries also have to face major threats from endemic
72 Lynnaire Sheridan

      disease and generalized poverty. Weakly organized labour
      with a large work force available places little pressure on
      employers to provide anything more than wages and basic
      services. (Schilling, 1989, p. 4)

If you have ever had a workplace medical examination,
or you schedule these regularly for your employees, these
are likely part of a health monitoring initiative designed to
identify any early-onset symptoms of occupational disease
but may also be seeking to identify repetitive strain injuries
(WorkSafe, 2022). In this aspect of occupational health,
you would be likely to work with ergonomists, "someone
who studies the design of furniture or equipment and the
way this affects people's ability to work effectively"
(Cambridge Dictionary, 2023a, para. 1), to ensure office
set up avoids the poor posture or unnecessary movements
leading to strain injuries. However, if someone incurs a
workplace illness or strain injury, or you wish to employ
someone already living with a disability, you will likely
collaborate with an occupational therapist who will make
reasonable adjustments:

   The concept of reasonable adjustments reflects the
   understanding that a worker with an injury, ill health or
   disability can often perform tasks if adjustments are made
   to accommodate the effects of their injury, ill health or
   disability. The aim of any reasonable adjustment is to
   minimise the impact of the injury, health problem or
   disability to enable the worker to fully take part in work-
   related programs and effectively undertake the inherent
   requirements of their job. (ComCare, 2013, para. 1)

Where an illness or injury is temporary, return to work
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 73

plans will be designed with occupational therapists to
enable the worker to return to work in a reduced or
different capacity that, over time, ideally will see them
return to good health and their full original work role
(Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety,
2022). Reasonable adjustment is also important when
employing a person already living with a disability:

   Reasonable adjustments are changes an employer makes to
   remove or reduce a disadvantage related to someone's
   disability. For example: making changes to the workplace,
   changing someone's working arrangements, finding a
   different way to do something, providing equipment,
   services or support. Reasonable adjustments are specific to
   an individual person. They can cover any area of work.
   (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, 2022, para.
   1)

Considerations for this cohort of workers is often also
addressed in legislation relating to disability
discrimination (Mason, 2017).

   As you can see, occupational injury tends to involve HR
managers more than occupational disease control. Often it
is these WHS practitioners who become embedded, or at
least quite closely affiliated, with HR departments within
organisations. The following Contemporary WHS
challenge explores how HR and occupational therapists
can collaborate together to address the transition to
retirement for workers who experience the emergence of
dementia symptoms in the workplace.

   Contemporary WHS Challenges: Dementia in the workplace
74 Lynnaire Sheridan

      What is dementia? According to the World Health
   Organization, "dementia is a term for several diseases that
   affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily
   activities" (n.d., para. 2). The occurrence of dementia
   increases with age (Dementia Australia, 2022). Workforce
   participation by Older Australians (65+ years) has doubled
   from 6.1% in 2001 to 15% in 2021 (Australian Institute of
   Health and Welfare, 2023). The aging of the Australian
   workforce increases the likelihood that some employees
   will have dementia. However, as Alzheimers New Zealand
   points out, "although dementia tends to affect older people,
   for younger people with dementia or those who choose to
   stay in the workforce at older ages, dementia can affect
   their capacity to work" (Alzheimers New Zealand, 2017, p.
   45). So, no matter the age of the worker, if they have
   dementia it will impact on their work performance.

   The challenge with dementia in a workplace is that it
generates risks, particularly when the worker is expected to
undertake a highly skilled role such as driving (Andrew et
al., 2015) but, at the same time, it can present to a manager
simply as poor work performance (Andrew et al., 2018).
When identified and managed effectively by an
occupational therapist, people with dementia can continue
to work and generate great outcomes for the business while
having their own lives positively enhanced through the
financial and social benefits that work generates (Andrew et
al., 2018). Finally, when it is time for a person with
dementia to finish up at work, it can be incredibly
beneficial that they have access to a medical retirement,
compared to being managed out of an organisation via a
disciplinary processes, as medical retirement can enable
access to critical retirement savings at the very time they
need and can enjoy these funds (Ministry for Business,
Innovation and Employment, n.d.). Quite simply, as New
Zealand's Ministry for Business, Innovation and
Employment explains, "medical retirement allows an
employee to leave an organisation with dignity" (Ministry
for Business, Innovation and Employment, n.d., para. 21).

Managing worker safety

Prevention of workplace incidents of any scale is a strong
focus of day-to-day WHS management in organisations.
In the WHS context, "an incident is an unplanned event
or chain of events that results in losses such as fatalities
or injuries, damage to assets, equipment, the environment,
business performance or company reputation" (Wolters
Kluwer, n.d., para. 1). It is important to distinguish an
incident from an accident which is defined as "something
bad that happens that is not expected or intended and that
often damages something or injuries someone"
(Cambridge Dictionary, 2023b, para. 1) or "something that
happens by chance or without expectation; an event that
is without apparent or deliberate" (Oxford English
Dictionary, n.d., para. 6). Both appear very similar, but
what distinguishes them is that, under the law, accidents are
considered Acts of God: "The operation of uncontrollable
natural forces, an instance or result of such forces,
frequently in the context of insurance" (Oxford Dictionary,
n.d., para. 3)--they are uncontrollable--whereas incidents,
with effective WHS management, are considered
potentially controllable (and therefore potentially makes
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 79

organisations legally liable for negligence for poor WHS
practice).

Now technically understanding what comprises WHS
management, it is useful to understand how different
organisations, and even regions of the world, approach it.
80 Lynnaire Sheridan

Differing perspectives on WHS and its
management

As mentioned earlier, the World Health Organization
defines work (occupational) health and safety as "all
aspects of health and safety in the workplace and has a
strong focus on primary prevention of hazards" (World
Health Organization, n.d., para. 1). So, at the
organisational level, why might one organisation be very
proactive about WHS, to the extent of doing worker
wellbeing activities, and another may only do the minimum
or try to avoid any focus on worker safety? Some factors
to consider might be:

         · Size - the number of employees and/or financial
            capacity.

         · Danger - some jobs might be physically or
            psychologically more dangerous than others. So
            some businesses - just to get the job done - may
            need a stronger safety focus than others.

         · Legislation - different parts of the world have
            different laws, so WHS requirements might be
            different.

As such, there may be some scenarios where an employer
could get the job done more cheaply without safe work
practices (perhaps in developing economies without
legislation and with many available workers; a similar
situation to Britain during the Industrial Revolution in
Chapter 2), alternatively, in a knowledge economy (where
employees are valued for thoughts and ideas) an employer
might want to support wellbeing as they require relaxed
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 81

and thriving employees to achieve the company's aims.
Every situation, and response to WHS, will be different
depending on historical and contemporary contexts.

Likewise, employees come to work with different attitudes
towards health and safety. Together employer and
employee values--the attitudes and beliefs towards
WHS--will either prioritise or deprioritise it in a particular
business. Values and goals are a combination of top-
down, employer, values but also bottom-up, worker,
behaviours. Hopkins & Palser (1987) suggest that
organisations and their workers either blame-the-victim,
and believe that the worker causes the situation and/or
injury, or blame-the-system, and believe that the situation
and/or injury occurred because of a series of workplace
errors. Every decision from then on is based on which of
82 Lynnaire Sheridan

these two approaches an organisational has towards WHS
management and, subsequently, creates a proactive or
reactive safety culture. We will address the concept of
safety culture in more depth in Chapter 6.

WHS management is not applied consistently between
organisations or in different regions of the world.
Organisational and worker values will prioritise or de-
prioritise safety management. This is because there are
different philosophical perspectives towards WHS
management. At this point you may be asking yourself, as
an HR manager, how can I possibly manage WHS in my
organisation? In the next chapter you will be introduced to
conceptual models, together with practical know-how, that

The Swiss Cheese model of safety
incident causation

In the previous chapter, we learned that PCBUs are
responsible for the health and safety of workers, wherever
they undertake this work. Occupational health was
identified as a specialist field requiring PCBUs to stay
engaged with public health, WHS regulators, and to hire
occupational health expertise as needed, ranging from
consulting ergonomists through to occupational
therapists. We also learned the difference between
accidents, which we cannot control, and incidents which
we, as HR managers involved in WHS management, seek
to control to a reasonably practicable level. This chapter
will specifically focus on incidents and their potential
prevention through adopting James Reason's theorical
Swiss Cheese Model of safety incident causation.

              · James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model of
                 safety incident causation.

A WHS incident is "an unplanned event or chain of events
that results in losses such as fatalities or injuries" (Wolters
Kluwer, n.d., para. 1), however, incidents (lost time
injuries/disease events) are only one of three types of
potential WHS events:

           · Lost time injuries/diseases: Those occurrences that
               resulted in a fatality, permanent disability or time
               lost from work of one day/shift or more.

           · Injuries without lost time: Those occurrences that
               were not lost time injuries and for which first aid
               and/or medical treatment was administered.

           · Near-misses: Unplanned incidents that occurred
               at the workplace that, although not resulting in
               any injury or disease, had the potential to do
               so.(Archer et al., 2015, p. 86)

Injuries without lost time and near misses, as we will learn
across this chapter, can be useful indicators of the
functionality and effectiveness of WHS management in
your business.

   Notably, most WHS theory has emerged from in-depth
analysis of large-scale WHS incidents. These critical
incidents may be defined as a "sudden, unexpected and
overwhelming event, that is out of the range of expected
experiences" (UNHCR, 2019, para. 1); these are low
probability-high risk events that unfold rapidly across a
specific point of time (Reason, 1997a).

   James Reason is a preeminent WHS scholar who has
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 87

examined the role of human factors in large-scale WHS
incidents. He noted that most WHS managers were
focused on human errors, the "errors and violations
committed at the `sharp-end' of the system...likely to have
a direct impact on the safety of the system and, because
of the immediacy of their adverse effects, these acts are
termed active failures" (Reason, 1997a, p. 10). Reason,
and other scholars such as Hopkins & Palser (1987) and
Hudson (2007), identified that critical incidents were never
just one person's fault, there were different issues in and
around organisations that affected the people involved and
led to the incident. Reason wanted to prove that we really
should not blame-the-victim for system failures.

   Reason then observed that every workplace has hazards,
but they are not injuring workers all the time or at the same
rate - some organisations have catastrophes while others
have low rates of injury even when workers are doing the
very same job with exposure to the same hazards.

   Reason concluded that it depends on the effectiveness of
the organisation to identify the hazard, assess its risk--the
actual potential for injury to occur to a worker--and
undertake measures to reduce the risk to the workers
through hazard control (Reason, 1997a). This led him
to him conceptualising the Swiss Cheese Model of safety
incident causation to explain this phenomenon (Figure
5.1).

Reason proposes that safety in a workplace may be
conceptualised as a block of cheese comprised of slices that
act as layers of defence against hazards. Given the internal
and external factors putting pressure on organisations and
their workers, weaknesses will develop in these defence
layers. These weaknesses, `holes', are not always
predictable or static; they pop up when safety issues arise
and disappear when safety issues are resolved.
Weaknesses can occur in different defence layers, within
different parts of the organisation. As such, Reason argues,
work safety looks more like Swiss cheese (Reason, 1997a).

   In the model, we can visualise a hazard as an arrow.
If the arrow is able to pass through holes in all the safety
defence layers, an incident occurs leading to worker injury
or harm. Essentially, when multiple layers of safety
defences are weak, there are more holes in the cheese
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 89

and a greater probability that the hazard arrow can shoot
straight through to cause more incidents (Reason, 2000).
In contrast, a near miss, "an event that could have
potentially resulted in...losses, but the chain of events
stopped in time to prevent this" (Wolters Kluwer, n.d.,
para. 1), is when at least one of the safety defence layers
stops the hazard passing through, therefore preventing the
hazard from having contact with worker or at least
minimising the harm. Ideally, as depicted in Figure 5.1,
most hazards would be stopped and losses prevented.

   Returning to consider Archer's definition of WHS
events (Archer et al., 2015), injuries without lost time
and near misses can then be re-conceptualised as key
performance indicators (KPIs) measuring the
effectiveness of an organisation's safety defence system.
Reason's Swiss Cheese Model infers that the more
incidents you have, the weaker your safety defences, and
that the more near misses you have, the greater the
likelihood of an incident occurring, unless interventions are
adopted to strengthen the safety defences (Reason, 1997a).
Measuring WHS events, even the low impact ones, then
becomes useful to effectively managing WHS (National
Safety Council, 2013). Notably, organisations striving for
good safety management would try to repair the holes in
the Swiss cheese as promptly as possible to minimise the
probability of all the holes lining up and the hazard arrow
shooting through.

   What comprises the defence layers? Reason (1997a, p.
7) states that the defences in the model are designed to:

           · create understanding and awareness of the local
               hazards

           · give clear guidance on how to operate safely

           · provide alarms and warnings when danger is
90 Lynnaire Sheridan

               imminent

           · restore the system to a safe state in an off-normal
               situation

           · interpose safety barriers between the hazards and
               the potential losses

           · contain and eliminate the hazards should they
               escape this barrier

           · provide the means of escape and rescue should
               hazard containment fail.

Clearly this model is based on a blame-the-system, rather
than a blame-the-victim, approach as the defence layers
are comprised of more than solely addressing the errors
made by individual workers.

   A key assumption of the Swiss Cheese Model of safety
incident causation is that:

   Fallibility is an inescapable part of the human condition, it
   is now recognized that people working in complex systems
   make errors or violate procedures for reasons that generally
   go beyond the scope of individual psychology....poor
   design, gaps in supervision, undetected manufacturing
   defects or maintenance failures, unworkable procedures,
   clumsy automation, shortfalls in training, less than adequate
   tools and equipment...may be present for many years before
   they combine with local circumstances and active failures
   to penetrate the system's many layers of defences. (Reason,
   1997, p. 10)

Workers are not to blame, according to Reason, because it
is the latent conditions that fail to protect workers and lead
to incidents.

   So perhaps we could consider managing active failures,
the human errors, as only one layer of safety defences--a
people layer--whereas the majority of safety defence
                        ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 91

layers may seek to uncover and resolve the latent
conditions, issues that otherwise would lay dormant in
the system until the active error occurs. If we reconsider
Reason's (1997) latent conditions, these might cluster
around engineering (poor design, clumsy automation, less
than adequate tools and equipment), procedural (gaps in
supervision, unworkable procedures) and administrative
(shortfalls in training). For our purposes, in an HR context,
we might reconfigure these to think about an organisation's
internal systems as potential overarching safety defence
layers:

         · A people layer - safety focused workers with
            relevant values, behaviours and safe decision
            making (we will discuss safety culture in
            Chapter 6).

         · An engineering layer - with alarms, physical
            barriers and automatic shutdowns.

         · A procedural layer - with instructions on safe
            work practices.

         · An administrative layer - ensuring people are
            hired with the right skills and provided the right
            training to perform tasks safely and are also, for
            example, given a safe work uniform.

Avoiding human error then only corresponds to only one
layer of safety defences because, as Reason observed via
his investigations of large-scale WHS disasters, you cannot
blame-the-victim and achieve better organisational safety
outcomes (Reason, 1997a). His Swiss Cheese Model
illustrates that when there are weaknesses (latent
conditions) in the safety defences layers (such as the
engineering, procedural and administrative systems within
92 Lynnaire Sheridan

an organisation) and these converge with human error, an
incident will occur. Taking this view means that the
Swiss Cheese Model of safety incident causation can see
that it can be used two different ways:

         · After an incident has occurred to help
            understand what went wrong, to learn from
            mistakes and improve the health and safety
            defences.

         · Before an incident occurs to help us identify any
            weaknesses in our safety defences, to intervene
            and fix these before an incident occurs.

For example, we can now understand the preceding
discussions of occupational health (Chapter
4)--particularly health monitoring--as being situated in
the people safety defence layer and striving to reduce the
risk of human errors (active failures), but clearly there are
many other safety imperatives in our organisations that
require a blame-the-system philosophy in order to manage
them.

When used proactively, the Swiss Cheese Model presents
opportunities to examine the unique latent conditions that
exist within our workplaces that, if we simply blamed the
victim, we would not be able to identify, learn from and
address in order to reduce the risk of hazards inflicting
harm on workers. The following Contemporary WHS
challenge, considers a culture of care leading to aged care
staff incurring injuries. This was only discoverable by
adopting a blame-the-system approach to understand why
care workers were deliberately putting themselves at risk
of harm when undertaking their duties of care towards the
elderly.

                                   Source: pxhere.com, CC0

   Due to the demographic aging of Australia, the demand
for aged care services has, and will continue, to increase
(Australian Government, 2023). The same trend is
occurring in New Zealand (StatsNZ, 2022). The 2021
Australia Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and
Safety revealed serious concerns about the quality of care
being provided to elderly people in aged care facilities, in
part, because of the increased casualisation of work, the
`gig economy', and a lack of oversight of these workers
with regards to their education and training (Royal
Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, 2021).
This lack of training, as a latent condition, has potential
serious implications for managing WHS in aged care.

   The aged care sector is, by its very nature, a challenging
workplace with hazards and risks including "lifting,
supporting and moving patients, moving and handling
equipment such as beds, mattresses, trolleys and
96 Lynnaire Sheridan

   wheelchairs, occupational violence, work-related stress and
   bullying and harassment" (WorkSafe Victoria, n.d.).
   Ensuring adequate training for staff to manage these
   hazards, and their risks, is a challenging but important task.
   However, the nature of care work presents other, less
   obvious, challenges that still need to be managed.

   conundrum of ensuring care workers provide optimal care
   to your elderly residents while sustaining their compliance
   with your organisation's WHS policies?

   In conclusion, active failures are complex human-centric
factors which makes them difficult to predict and control.
However, latent conditions can be identified and fixed
before an incident occurs. It is here that HR managers have
a pivotal role to play in WHS management; in supporting
all the policies, procedures, training and performance
management that leads to effective identification of the
pre-determinable hazards and the fortification of safety
defences that prevent the occurrence of incidents. Keeping
latent conditions under control is key to effective safety
management. To achieve this, most organisations will
come to choose a coordinated, cyclical, approach; they will
adopt a safety management system --and these are the
focus of the next chapter.

A systems and safety culture approach
to work health and safety management

In Chapter 4, we learned that some organisations will adopt
a blame-the-victim approach and will place little
importance on WHS management. In Chapter 5, we came
to understand that it is only through blaming the system
that organisations can move beyond examining human
error (active failures) to uncover the latent conditions
that, according to James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model
of safety incident causation, increase the risk of a hazard
causing harm to workers via a WHS incident.

   James Reason's model then explained why WHS
incidents occur but, most importantly, indicated that
through addressing latent conditions, incidents can be
prevented. However, achieving this concept in practice
is complex as notionally each safety defence layer must
be unpacked to identify hazards, interventions must be
implemented to reduce the risk, and then ongoing
monitoring is required to ensure that existing weaknesses
(holes in the Swiss cheese) do not recur or new ones do not
emerge before they can be rectified.

   The goal of this chapter is to give you the systems-based
approaches that enable the best possible safety outcome,
within the limits of what is reasonably practicable. We
will then explore how a safety culture can both embed
the safety management system within the organisation, and

                                     99
100 Lynnaire Sheridan

help avoid, as much as possible, the active human errors
associated with poor safety attitudes and behaviours at
work.

   Learning Objectives

      This chapter introduces:

              · Systems-based standards for workplace
                 health and safety management.

              · The components of a WHS system
                 framework and what each is designed to
                 achieve.

              · Safety culture theory.

A system-based approach to WHS

While there are many ways to implement WHS
management, we adopt a systems-based approach aligned
with James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model. As WHS
management is complex, and WHS incidents expose
organisations to business risk, many businesses choose
to adopt a standardised framework to assist them in
establishing their organisation-specific WHS management
system. There are many standardised frameworks used
by businesses and they cover different aspects of their
operations (environmental management, quality, WHS
etc.). These are known as standards.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 101

          Box 6.1: What are standards?
          In the following video, the International
       Organization for Standardization (ISO) explains
       what a standard is and their approach to producing
       international standards.

                             One or more interactive elements has
                             been excluded from this version of the
                             text. You can view them online here:
                  https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/conceptual-
                  guide-whs-hr-managers-nz-au/?p=83#oembed-3

                 Source: "What ISO standards do for you" by the International
                           Organization for Standardization, Vimeo

Standards are agreed to principles and approaches
established by panels of experts (International
Organization for Standardization, 2023; European Agency
for Safety and Health and Work, n.d.). The organisations
that establish the standards can then accredit experts to
independently audit businesses against these standards and,
in turn, businesses that demonstrate compliance with the
standards can be certified (United Kingdom Accreditation
Service, n.d.). This independent certification can be
valuable to businesses who need to demonstrate their effort
towards good practice to their stakeholders, such as
102 Lynnaire Sheridan

organisations up or down-stream in their supply chains,
because, as Jenks explains, "companies that are able to,
at a glance, display brand and strategic value, are more
appealing to collaborate with" (2017, para. 20).
Certification is also useful as "standards often align with
regulatory requirements, and certification can
help...demonstrate compliance and avoid potential legal
or financial penalties" (Best Practice Certification, 2023,
para. 5). At a minimum, adopting standards encourages
a coordinated approach to addressing WHS issues and
generate the documentation that legal authorities may draw
upon in audits or investigations to determine if due
diligence requirements have been met.

   There are different standards bodies operating in
different regions of the world. For example there is the
ISO, with it's origins in establishing uniform adoption of
the Metric System (International Organization for
Standardization, 1997), but there is also the European
Union's standards that underpin trade agreements
(European Agency for Safety and Health and Work,
n.d.). The standards framework a business chooses to
adopt may be based on common practice in their industry,
what is required to supply the product to a market (i.e.
meeting European Union standards) or the cost and/or the
practicability of implementation and certification.

   In Australia and New Zealand, many businesses will be
familiar with WHS management standard is AS/NZS ISO
45001:2018 (Occupational health and safety management
systems - Requirements with guidance for use) and its
predecessor AS/NZS 4801:2001. Endorsed by regional
standards bodies, Standards Australia and Standards New
Zealand, this particular standard is identical to the
international-level ISO 45001:2018 standard (Standards
Australia & Standards New Zealand, 2018, p. ii). This
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 103

means that Australian and New Zealand businesses that
achieve AS/NZS ISO 45001:2018 certification, have met
international expectations as set by the experts via the ISO.

   No matter the WHS standards framework, a safety
management system should be designed to "continuously
improve safety performance through the identification of
hazards, the collection and analysis of safety data and
safety information, and the continuous assessment of safety
risks" (Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand, 2023,
p. 12). Standardised systems help develop a common
language that enable a shared understanding of WHS
within the business, and across industries (International
Organization for Standardization, 2021). Through
fostering collaboration, WHS standards seek to reduce
workplace illness, injury and the associated financial, and
social costs, of workplace incidents.

Components to a safety management
system

At its core, AS/NZS ISO 45001:2018 provides guidance
to organisations on how to set up a safety management
system, how to `build in' continual improvement
mechanisms and, finally, it helps businesses identify the
resources they will need to achieve effective safety
management (Standards Australia, 2018). However, in
trying to understand current approaches to WHS
management systems, it is useful to step back to the prior
AS/NZS 4801:2001 to understand what worked and what
developments had to take place to establish AS/NZS ISO
45001:2018 as current `best practice'. AS/NZS 4801:2001
helped organisations break down the complexity of a safety
management system by approaching it in five steps:
104 Lynnaire Sheridan

       1. Commitment and policy

       2. Planning

       3. Implementation

       4. Measurement and evaluation

       5. Review and improvement

Rather than being linear, as presented in the list above, it
was proposed as a series of repeatable phases (see Figure
6.1) that organisations would continue to undertake over
and over again, with the outcome being continuously
improved safety outcomes for their business.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 105

                              Source: AS/NZS 4801:2001

What does each step comprise? Standards Australia &
Standards New Zealand (2001) explain simply that safety
management starts at the top. Commitment and policy:
Senior leadership teams must commit to safety
management and support it's undertaking through policy
and resourcing. Planning: A safety management system's
processes, procedures and measures (key performance
indicators (KPIs), lead and lag indicators etc.) must be
designed in consultation with key stakeholders before they
can be enacted. Implementation: The operationalisation
of the planned activities encompassed in the safety
management system. Measurement and evaluation: This
phase requires reporting from the safety management
system on safety outcomes, as measured by the KPIs.
Review and improvement: Senior leadership must be
informed of the actual safety outcomes, positives and
negatives, to determine what improvements must be made
to safety management to enhance safety outcomes by the
end of the following safety management cycle.

   The conundrum for AS/NZS 4801:2001 was that it was
heavily focused on the latent, specifically system-based,
factors outlined in James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model
(see Figure 5.1). Many businesses became so focused on
the administration of the safety management system (the
administrative and procedural safety defence layers) that
they became "remote from the processes they manipulate
and, in many cases, from the hazards that potentially
endanger their operations" (Reason, 1998, p. 296). In
essence, safety management systems were becoming very
bureaucratic and burdensome for the employees, this
discouraged reporting of near miss incidents which
106 Lynnaire Sheridan

inevitably diminished the quality of the decision making
data (Hudson, 2007). The very high risk-low probability
critical incidents that safety management systems were
designed to avoid, were still occurring despite safety
management system documentation making it appear like
the organisation was effectively blocking the holes in their
Swiss Cheese Model (Reason, 1998).

   This likely occurred because, even today, WHS is a
rapidly developing field with practice informing theory,
often before theory can inform practice. To address this
conundrum scholars, including James Reason, sought to
understand the critical role of worker attitudes, beliefs and
behaviours (safety culture) in safety management
(Hudson, 2007). While active human errors are known to
be associated with poor safety attitudes and behaviours at
work, these researchers additionally identified that latent
conditions were not resolving unless the organisation had
a positive safety culture that genuinely sought to enact
change.

Components of a safety culture

Reason conceptualises a safety culture as comprising "a
reporting culture, a just culture, a flexible culture and a
learning culture" (Reason, 1997b, p. 196). By focusing
on the development of these individual subcomponents, he
believed that a safety culture would emerge via a process
of "collective learning...ways of doing, thinking and
managing that have enhanced safety health as their natural
byproduct" (Reason, 1997b, p. 192).

   A reporting culture, where employees report incidents
(including near misses), is important to attaining the
necessary data to determine which safety defence layers
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 107

in the Swiss Cheese Model (see Figure 5.1) need actions
taken to reduce the probability of a repeat incident.
However, organisations notoriously make reporting
hazards and incidents difficult, with time-consuming
paperwork and processes. Businesses can also be punitive
with negative consequences for anyone who reports an
incident that was, in part, due to their error. In contrast,
organisations that have a functioning reporting culture
make reporting easy, provide confidentiality to those who
report, and separate business functions that undertake
disciplinary processes in the organisations, from those
that action WHS continuous improvement. Essentially a
reporting culture is based on trust (Reason, 1997b).

   A just culture requires workers to "share the belief that
justice will usually be dispensed" (Reason, 1997b, p. 205).
As outlined by Hopkins & Palser (1987), in a systems-
based approach, blaming the victim is rejected. Reason
argues instead that a just culture will be lenient towards
unforeseen human error, yet provide consequences for
"reckless, negligent or even malevolent behaviour of
particular individuals" (Reason, 1997b, p. 205).

   A flexible culture means the organisation is "able to shift
from centralized control to a decentralized mode in which
the guidance of local operations depends largely upon the
professionalism of first-line supervisors" (Reason, 1997b,
p. 218). Reason argues that high quality day-to-day
leadership (including usually hierarchical leadership) will
often enable a quick and effective transition to those who
have the expertise when having to "perform complex and
exacting tasks under considerable time pressure" (Reason,
1997b, p. 214). This would, of course, include scenarios
such as emergency responses (see Chapter 12).

   Finally, a learning culture is where WHS observations,
reflections and actions take place. Reason argues that
108 Lynnaire Sheridan

while embedding learning can be easy, achieving actions
based on authentic learning derived from observations and
reflections is difficult in practice (Reason, 1997b).
Theoretically, it is this component of the safety culture that
would underpin the continuous improvement aspired to in
safety management systems (such as step 5 "Review and
Improvement" in AS/NZS 4801:2001).

   While Reason's Safety Culture theory was useful, as
it outlined the behaviours of businesses with an effective
safety culture, it did not provide organisations with
guidance on how to achieve this ideal safety culture. For
example, Agim & Sheridan (2013) investigated the
subcomponents of Reason's safety culture in practice and
found that just culture is an enabler of a reporting culture.
This alone demonstrates that this safety culture theory is
useful, but has not yet been fully conceptualised as a
working model.

   Other scholars therefore examined the characteristics of
culture specific to high reliability organisations--those
organisations that had implicitly dangerous work but very
few incidents. Weick & Sutcliffe identified that these
organisations are `mindful' and their safety culture can
be understood as a "preoccupation with failure, reluctance
to simplify interpretations, sensitivity to operations,
commitment to resilience and deference to expertise"
(Weick & Sutcliffe, 2001, p. 30). This is a very useful
insight but difficult to operationalise without examples
from practice, and guidelines on the steps that must be
taken to achieve it.

   Patrick Hudson progressed this field by proposing a
diagnostic tool; a safety culture ladder model (see Figure
6.2) that organisations can use to critically reflect and
determine the current status of their safety culture (Hudson,
2007). Ideally, the safety culture would become so
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 109

embedded that it would be `how we do business round
here' but could start from lower levels, such as being
reactive, and progress towards becoming `generative'.

Importantly, Hudson identified that his diagnostic tool (the
ladder) needed to be matched with an improvement tool
(based on Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical
model, see Figure 6.3) to ensure that, "the culture ladder
and the change model, define (i) where an organisation
might go and (ii) how it might go there" (Hudson, 2007, p.
705).

While today it is common to read statements such as:

   Organisations with an effective SMS typically show genuine
   management commitment, creating a working environment
   where staff are encouraged to engage in and contribute to
   the organisation's safety management processes. These
   organisations benefit from having an active Just Culture
   policy, supported by regular feedback on what has been
   done in response to staff reports, and from effective controls
   to manage the identified risks. Hazard identification, risk
   assessment, evaluation, and control have therefore become
   an integral part of day to-day business. Managers and staff
   understand that supervision of the operations, and therefore
   safety, is the responsibility of all, not just the Safety
   Manager. (Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand, 2023,
   p. 12)

Acknowledgment of the importance of safety culture, and
112 Lynnaire Sheridan

its integration into a safety management system, is clearly
relatively recent.

   Returning now to consider AS/NZS ISO 45001:2018
(see Figure 6.4), the essence of a safety management
system remains similar to that outlined in AS/NZ
4801:2001 but the five phases of a safety management
system are now reduced to four (planning, support and
operation, performance evaluation and improvement), all
enabled through leadership and worker participation
which exists within the context of the organisation
(external and internal issues as well as the needs and
expectations of workers and other interested parties). In
the diagram below, the shaded area external to the system's
activities represents these internal and external factors that
are constantly acting on the organisation.

Notably, safety culture is still not explicitly integrated into
the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle of ISO 45001:2018
but it is referred to in its guidance for use:

   A culture that supports an organization's OH&S [WHS]
   management system is largely determined by top
   management and is the product of individual and group
   values, attitudes, managerial practices, perceptions,
   competencies and patters of activities that determine
   commitment to, and the style and proficiency of, its OH&S
   [WHS] management system. (Standards Australia and
   Standards New Zealand, 2018, p. 27)

ISO 45001:2018 still only focuses on only the reporting
culture and just culture sub-components of James Reason's
safety culture theory, as seen in the standards where they
state "An important way top management demonstrates
leadership is by encouraging workers to report incidents,
hazards and risks [reporting culture] and opportunities and
by protecting workers against reprisals [just culture], such
as the threat of dismissal or disciplinary action, when they
do so" (Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand,
2018, p. 27). In the standards, however, we do see
elements of Hudson's (2007) making the plans, do it and
improve on it reflected through the integration of PDCA
into the diagram (see Figure 6.4). Overall, this suggests
that WHS safety management system standards are still
only coming to grips with how to embed safety culture into
the operationalisation of a safety management system.

   At this point, it is important to acknowledge that there is
a movement among some scholars to abandon the systems
114 Lynnaire Sheridan

approach to WHS because of the innate challenges of
sustaining a data-driven system, while enacting it via a
safety culture. One example is Sidney Dekker, who wrote
the book The Safety Anarchist: Relying on human expertise
and innovation, reducing bureaucracy and compliance
(Dekker, 2018). He argues for anarchy, rather than
hierarchy. He advocates for horizontal coordination of
WHS focused on `doing' rather than reporting. He
suggests that the "novelty, diversity and complexity" of
WHS incidents are least effectively managed by the
bureaucracy that safety management systems create
(Dekker, 2018, p. iv). Past influencing the present
considers the influence of the Industrial Revolution on
contemporary WHS management and the limitations this
may present.

   Past influencing the present

      According to Sidney Dekker, many present-day
   approaches to WHS (sometimes referred to as Safety I)
   emerged in response to Industrial Revolution conditions but
   today constrain our capacity to effectively implement safety
   management:

         For sure, bureaucratic initiatives from the last
      century--regulation, standardization, centralized
      control--can take credit for a lot of the progress on safety
      we've made. Interventions by the state, and by individual
      organizations, have taken us away from the shocking
      conditions of the early industrial age. We had to organize, to
      standardize, to come together and push back on unnecessary
                  ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 115

   and unacceptable risk. We had to solve problems
   collectively; we had to turn to the possibility of coercion by a
   state or other stakeholders to make it happen...Bureaucracy
   and compliance may well have taken us as far as they can.
   (Dekker, 2018, p iv)

   If we consider that Scientific Management emerged
during the American Industrial Revolution (see Chapter 3),
it makes sense that contemporary workplaces--those now
heavily influenced by Human Relations School
approaches to management--might imagine new ways of
organising safety practices that acknowledge the expertise
of the worker and seek to harness their intrinsic
motivation. Indeed, the opening of Dekker's film Safety
Differently features a worker emphasising the importance of
autonomy. If we consider this in the context of the Self-
Determination Theory which "proposes that all human
beings have three basic psychological needs--the needs for
competence, autonomy, and relatedness" (Deci & Ryan,
2015, para. 1), we can see that this modern theoretical lens,
derived from the Human Relations School, is influencing
contemporary approaches to safety management.

   Another worker questions why efforts to enhance safety
outcomes focus on failure, rather than success. This
perspective aligns with a related contemporary WHS
approach known as Safety II. Safety II shifts from
blocking the holes in the Swiss cheese, to examining what
works in the organisation and replicating that success
(Hollnegal et al., 2015).

As an important, yet emerging field, WHS research will
continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Most businesses either
directly, or indirectly, will be engaging in practices derived
from James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model and safety
culture theories. Many will be adopting standards-based
approaches to developing safety management systems.
However, in many ways, Weick & Sutcliffe's (2001)
observations are correct; being vigilant and taking safety
seriously is perhaps the only way to achieve effective
safety management. We now know that employees
internalising personal and collective responsibility towards
safety, is vital to achieving this. While progress has been
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 117

made on how to achieve a safety culture we've learned here
that it is very much still under development.

This section of the book, Theory: A systems approach to
work health and safety management, introduced key WHS
concepts, adopted a systems-based theoretical approach to
safety management and outlined how organisations can use
standards to establish their safety management systems.
James Reason's Swiss Cheese Model of safety incident
causation was used to conceptualise the relationships
between hazards, risk, and safety defence layers in
organisations. Safety culture was identified as pivotal to
embeding a safety system within a business, and enacting
the change required to resolve latent conditions. The next
section unpacks each component of safety management
systems to understand their enactment in practice.

Practice: Establishing,
implementing and closing the
loop in a safety management
system

This section examines the leadership commitment,
policies, procedures, planning, and compliance
competency required before a safety management system
can begin. It explains the implementation of hazard
identification, risk assessment, and hazard control
procedures before outlining the importance of emergence
response procedures as a final safety defence layer. It
concludes with `closing the loop', effectively using
measurement and evaluation data to ensure adequate
commitment to, and resourcing of, the next iteration of the
safety management system cycle.

Establishing: Leadership commitment,
policies, procedures and planning

Organisations that blame-the-victim will not prioritise
safety management (see Chapter 4); they only consider
the active failures (human error) within their businesses
and will not genuinely adopt systems-based approaches
to address latent conditions. As James Reason would
explain it through his safety culture theory, a learning
culture will not exist within these businesses; as Patrick
Hudson would explain it, they are likely pathological or,
at best, reactive (see Figure 6.2). In contrast, this chapter
takes the perspective of a business that has adopted a
blame-the-system philosophy and is now seeking to
establish a safety management system.

   Learning Objectives

      As outlined in ISO 45001:2018, this chapter introduces:
              · Leadership commitment as an enabler of
                 safety management.
              · The role of policy and procedures in

                                     123
124 Lynnaire Sheridan

                 establishing safety management in an
                 organisation.

              · The vital importance of planning before
                 establishing a safety management system.

Leadership Commitment

In ISO 45001:2018, leader commitment to safety is
fundamental to achieving safety management system
success because it ensures the resourcing required to enact
the system and establish the safety culture (Standards
Australia & Standards New Zealand, 2018). However,
even when taking a blame-the-victim approach,
organisational levels of commitment to safety do vary. As
a WHS professional, it is vitally important to determine
the extent to which your organisation's leadership team
values, and is committed to, safety otherwise you may
face "tensions and burdens due to...general management
not embracing ethical values, and safety being regarded as
a value while facing financial and economic constraints"
(Lindout & Reniers, 2021, p. 8518). If your leaders are
not committed to safety, your ability to enact safety and
develop a safety culture, is limited (Hudson, 2007).

   So how can you determine an organisation's level of
commitment to safety? Patrick Hudson's Safety Culture
Ladder (see Figure 6.2) is one tool (Hudson, 2007).
Discussions with staff are likely to reveal if a blame-the-
victim or blame-the-system approach prevails within the
business. Reviewing an organisation's safety record would
likely position the organisation on one rung of the ladder
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 125

(pathological, reactive, calculative, proactive and
generative) and would highlight any pathological
recidivism (repeat offending).

   So how do organisations make decisions regarding their
commitment to safety? Again, analysing Hudson's Safety
Culture Ladder it appears that pathological and generative
organisations make moral choices, whereas reactive,
calculative and proactive organisations adopt a risk-
centric, cost-benefit analysis, approach. Examining the
moral versus business risk approach is therefore useful.

A moral commitment to safety

Morality may be defined as "'what is right?' ...respect
for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice"
(Lindout & Reniers, 2021, p. 8515). The decision by
senior leaders to commit to safety is a moral judgement,
the "evaluation of actions with respect to moral norms
and values established in society" (Thoma et. al. 1991
cited in Li et al., 2017, p. 122). In making their choice,
some senior leaders will take a relativistic stance; they will
make their judgement based on the situation or individuals
involved. In contrast, those who "value moral principles of
harm/care and fairness/reciprocity more highly...are more
likely to experience distress toward harm and outrage
toward injustice" (Li et al., 2017, p. 135) and would
support safety as a moral impetus.

   HR managers engaged in safety management likely have
little influence over a senior leader's moral commitment to
safety. Depending on your moral stance, the value placed
on safety may be an important consideration in selecting
your place of work. This said, moral decision-making is
not the only driver for the implementation of WHS
126 Lynnaire Sheridan

management, often the impetus is business risk avoidance
enabling a business case to be made for safety.

A business-risk derived commitment to safety

Not to be confused with safety-specific risk, business risk
may be defined as the "exposure a company or
organization has to factors that could lower its profits or
lead it to fail" (Kenton, 2022, para. 1). Kenton (2022)
suggests that business risk is comprised of four principal
risks: strategic, compliance, operational or reputational.
Safety management, at least in its early stages within many
organisations, is likely prioritised according to the risk
poor safety management presents in the each of these four
domains. However, WHS management also presents good
business opportunities, as effective safety practices should
mitigate:

         · compliance risk: averting prosecution for
            negligence.

         · operational risk: with continuous safety
            improvement enhancing productivity through
            design efficiencies (better ergonomics), better
            control of maintenance regimes etc.

         · reputational risk: averting WHS incidents.

Up until this point, we have viewed WHS management
as a people-centric HR business function. This is because
the origins of safety management are derived from the
Industrial Revolution concurrent with employment
relations (labour rights) and unions (see Chapters 1-3).
However, the subsequent evolution of WHS management
theory (see Chapters 4-6) has led to a systems-based
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 127

philosophy which, increasingly, aligns WHS with
environmental and quality risk management approaches
(Kauppila et al., 2015). This risk-centric response
recognises that businesses need a social licence to operate,
an "ongoing acceptance of a company or industry's
standard business practices and operating procedures by its
employees, stakeholders, and the general public" (Kenton,
2023, para. 1). WHS is being drawn into an alternate
philosophical frame grounded in sustainability and the
triple bottom line, there is now an expectation that business
should be reporting on "their social and environmental
impact--in addition to their financial performance--rather
than solely focusing on generating profit, or the standard
`bottom line'" (Miller, 2020, para. 5). WHS management,
and its performance outcomes, through this lens are then
perceived as a social good sustaining an organisation's
social licence to operate, rather than a worker entitlement.

Sustainability reporting is one approach taken by
organisations to foster their social licence to operate.
Sustainability reporting requires businesses to provide "an
overview of the economic, environmental, social and
cultural impacts, caused by an entity's activities" (External
Reporting Board, 2023). Compiling these reports, usually
undertaken for compliance and reputational reasons, can
be exceedingly complex. One strategy to simplify their
operationalisation is to have the key performance
indicators (KPIs) aligned and managed across business
functions within management systems.

   Similar to safety management systems (Chapter 6), there
are standards are used to manage the business risks
associated with the natural environment (ISO 14001) or
product quality (ISO 9001) (International Organization for
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 129

Standardization, n.d.). Again, these standards are likely
to be operationalised via environmental or quality systems
before they are audited and certified to independently
demonstrate an organisation's fulfilment of the social
licence to operate. One organisation adopting the
combined systems approach to safety management is
Unilever (see Box 7.2).

          Box 7.2: Unilever, a systems-based approach to
       managing business risk

                                   Figure 7.1: Unilever's brand logo

          Unilever is a large multinational organisation
       operating in more than 190 countries (Unilever,
       n.d.-a). Given their cross-border operations, they
       use a standards-based approach to ensure
       compliance in all jurisdictions where they operate
       (Unilever, n.d.-b). Ideally, they would be adopting
130 Lynnaire Sheridan

       practices from their most demanding legislative
       jurisdictions and applying these across the entire
       business.

          The sustainability performance data collected by
       Unilever is categorised into environmental and
       occupational [work] safety (emissions, waste, water,
       and occupational safety incidents), planet (climate
       action, waste, water, and environmental fines),
       society (safety at work, nutrition, community
       investment), and people (recruitment, workforce
       composition, gender diversity, learning and
       development, and retention). All these KPIs are
       verified through independent auditing and
       certification. Management of quality is implied
       across their business indicators with references to
       being a good employer (Unilever, .n.d-c) and their
       focus on producing high quality consumer products
       (Unilever, n.d.-d).

Seeing safety through the business risk lens--rather than
solely through the HR lens--explains why safety
management is showcased on the international stage via
initiatives such as the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals where safety is implicit in Goal 3:
Good Health and Well-being and Goal 8: Decent Work
and Economic Growth (United Nations Department of
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 131

Economic and Social Affairs, n.d.). As explained by the
Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (UK):

   Workplace health and safety is all about sensibly managing
   risks to protect your workers and your business. Good
   health and safety management is characterised by strong
   leadership involving your managers, workers, suppliers,
   contractors and customers. In a global context, health and
   safety is also an essential part of the movement towards
   sustainable development. (2021, para. 1)

          Box 7.3: Air New Zealand, Sustainability
       Reporting

          In its sustainability reporting, Air New Zealand is
       attempting to communicate all its KPIs in one table
       that encapsulates environmental, safety and quality
       risk management at the local level (New
       Zealanders) through to a global level (UN
       Sustainable development Goals).
132 Lynnaire Sheridan

               Figure 7.2: Extract, Air New Zealand 2023 Sustainability Report
                               Source: Air New Zealand (2023, p. 11).

          In this holistic sustainability framework, the first
       column `Caring for New Zealanders' positions
       caring for workers as the top priority. This care is to
       be achieved, in part, through organisational and staff
       alignment with the key values of diversity and
       equity. There is no specific mention of WHS, but it
       does infer that Air New Zealand is promoting a just
       culture which, in turn, can foster a positive safety
       culture according to James Reason's Safety Culture
       theory (Reason, 1998).

          The KPI for care towards New Zealanders
       (employees) is a staff engagement score (output
       indicator) that is benchmarked against a global
       measure (Glint's Global Top Engagement Index
       with 750+ organisations surveyed) together with
       input indicators including employee uptake of their
             ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 133

Employee Assistance Programme. The latter metric
demonstrates proactive mental health support for
workers to address issues, including those outside of
work, and is then paired with bullying / harassment
prevention programmes (likely input indicators, i.e.
number of training attendees) to reduce work-based
issues. Beyond employees, the organisation's care
extends to customers and New Zealand
communities, each with their own respective
metrics (see Figure 7.2).

   Air New Zealand's local-level care for New
Zealanders is then linked to United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals to demonstrate a
contribution towards global collective efforts: Goal
3: Good Health and Wellbeing, Goal 4: Quality
Education, Goal 5: Gender Equality, Goal 8:
Decent Work and Economic Growth plus Goal 10:
Reduced Inequalities. These goals are all WHS
related directly (Goal 3 and Goal 8), or indirectly
(Goal 4, Goal 5, and Goal 10) as they support
positive workplace environments.

   The second column "Climate Action" reflects Air
New Zealand's environmental performance
commitments. The focus is clearly on the de-
carbonisation of their business activities together
with offsetting them, via forestry inputs, as a form
of climate impact mitigation. First, they outline
how they will create scientifically developed
measures to evaluate any carbon reduction followed
by a net zero 2050 target and a 10% uptake of
sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. Likewise, the
third column is environment-centric "Driving
134 Lynnaire Sheridan

       towards a circular economy" and focuses on the
       potential good that can be achieved through
       procurement supply chains, from an environmental
       and social perspective. The final column
       "Sustainable Tourism" seeks to balance the
       environmental impacts of tourism, including their
       impacts in providing air travel, with the socio-
       economic benefits that tourism can offer. Air New
       Zealand links these aspirations to United Nations
       Sustainable Development Goal 7: Affordable and
       Clean Energy, Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and
       Infrastructure, Goal 12: Responsible Consumption
       and Production, Goal 13: Climate Action and Goal
       15: Life on Earth. Goal 8: Decent Work and
       Economic Growth is also mentioned, and is likely
       associated with Sustainable Tourism's potential
       positive socio-economic outcomes.

          Overall, the Air New Zealand Sustainability
       Framework identifies both global and local
       sustainability priorities. As an organisation that
       operates across national and regional boundaries,
       this dual perspective is fundamental to its social
       license to operate; domestically it will be critiqued
       for its positive or negative impacts on local
       communities, and, internationally, its environmental
       performance will be evaluated relative to other
       global airlines.

While some organisational leaders adopt a relativistic
moral stance towards safety and decide "who cares as long
as we're not getting caught" (Hudson, 2007, p. 704; see
Figure 6.2), the strategic, compliance, operation and
reputational business risks can make a compelling
business case for safety management. Surely even those
who take a relativistic stance would see the potential
benefits that effective safety management might generate
(see pro-safety management arguments as presented in Box
7.4).

          Box 7.4: Creating a business case for safety

          The Institution of Occupational Safety and Health
       (UK) motivates PCBUs to undertake safety
       management by explaining that safety is important
       to their business because:

                    1. It is morally right to ensure your

                           workers return home safe and healthy at
                           the end of every working day.

                    2. By protecting your workers, you

                           reduce absences, ensuring that your
                           workplace is more efficient and
                           productive.

                    3. Research shows that workers are

                           more productive in workplaces that are
                           committed to health and safety.

                    4. Reducing down-time caused by

                           illness and accidents means less
136 Lynnaire Sheridan

                           disruption - and saves your business
                           money.

                    5. In some countries, health and safety

                           legislation is criminal law and you are
                           legally obliged to comply with it. Legal
                           breaches can result in prosecution, fines
                           and even imprisonment of senior
                           executives.

                    6. To attract investors and partnerships

                           you may need to demonstrate your
                           commitment to sustainability and
                           corporate social responsibility, which
                           will include how you protect your
                           workers.

                    7. Increasingly, customers want to buy

                           products and services that are produced
                           ethically - so you also need to think
                           about the work practices throughout
                           your supply chain and deal only with
                           ethical suppliers that protect their
                           workforce.

                    8. More and more, job

                           hunters--particularly Millennials and
                           Generation Z--seek roles with
                           employers who share their values, so
                           without strong corporate responsibility
                           and sustainability practices you may
                           struggle to attract or retain the best
                           employees.

                    9. A good health and safety record is a

                           source of competitive advantage: it
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 137

                           builds trust in your reputation and
                           brand, while poor health and safety
                           performance will directly affect
                           profitability and can result in loss of
                           trade or even closure of the business.

                  10. Good health and safety at work

                           secures long-term benefits for you, your
                           business and the wider community.
                           (2021, para. 2)

          Point 1 adopts a moral stance whereas points
       2-10 justify safety management using business risk
       as the motivator.

However, we should be cautious in judging an organisation
as reactive if they adopt a business-risk based approach
to safety management, as it be a methodological approach
to safety that co-exists with a strong moral commitment
to safety. Dubbink & Van Liedekerke (2020) suggest we
should not to misconceive an organisation's sense of duty
as purely being relativistic, in this case as solely being
compliance driven. Fundamentally, what is important here
is that you understand that safety management cannot
happen without leadership commitment, but also that you
consider your moral stance towards safety because this will
define how you enact safety management.

Policies and procedures

Once senior leadership commitment is secured, it is time
138 Lynnaire Sheridan

to establish the policies and procedures that will outline
the organisation's interpretation and boundaries for safety
management. These will then establish the behavioural
parameters that will underpin the organisation's safety
culture. Policies may be defined as "rules and guidelines
that define and limit action, and indicate the relevant
procedures to follow" (Heery & Noon, 2017, para. 1);
policy takes a top-down approach. In contrast, procedures
are "step-by-step sequences of actions that should be taken
to attain particular objectives" (Heery & Noon, 2017, para.
1), and should take a bottom-up approach, as they will
only be adopted if are actionable in practice.

   While safety concepts may be integrated into broad
business policy documents, procedures should be very
specific to the safety activity, for example outlining the
responsibilities and expected actions of staff during an
emergency response. Policy should set the tone of the
organisation's expectations around safety, while the
procedures are how, in practice, to get it done.

   Note: At this stage, the procedures being discussed are
focused on how to operationalise the safety system, not to
be confused with standard (safe) operating procedures
that can only emerge via worker consultation when
undertaking hazard control (see Chapter 11).

Planning

Once policy is in place, formally establishing the
organisation's intention to enact safety management, the
planning (P in the Plan-Do-Check-Act) stage of the
systems-based safety management cycle begins; often this
requires recruitment of staff into key safety-specific roles.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 139

These organisational safety pioneers must have knowledge
and experience in the comprehensive end-to-end planning
of safety management systems; to evoke success these
practitioners begin with the end in mind--the requirements
of management reporting that enables continuous safety
improvement--and work backwards identifying what is
reasonably practicable to achieve. These staff principally
design and manage the system: compliance with the
standards, determine the measurable KPIs to adopt, set
up internal and external audit cycles to facilitate safety
certification, and also continue to engage with senior
leadership to ensure the ongoing commitment to safety
management and its improvement within their
organisation.

   Importantly, these safety professionals recognise that it
is easy to worry and immediately seek to identify hazards
and manage their risks, however, they know that a lack
of a coordinated approach quickly turns this into an
overwhelming task. Moreover, they understand that taking
this approach could damage the emerging safety culture
of the business; by not figuring out how to involve staff
in determining what is reasonably practicable and
communicating this, workers may become disillusioned
when their safety expectations are not met.

   Planning comprises designing literally every component
of the system, from determining who is responsible for
which parts of the organisation's policy and procedures,
through to the specific tools and techniques that workers
are to adopt to reduce the possibility of active failures
(human errors) combining with latent conditions. Planning
identifies everything required to reduce worker exposure
to occupational health and safety (incident-centric)
hazards. While coordinated by systems safety staff,
specialist roles may also be established to enable this, such
140 Lynnaire Sheridan

as hiring in occupational health specialists or hazard and
risk assessment experts.

   Once the plan for how to operationalise the safety
management system has been established, the organisation
must begin by reviewing the legislative requirements
applicable to their jurisdiction; the next chapter focuses
on achieving the compliance competency necessary before
establishing a safety management system.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 141

8.

Establishing: Compliance competency

Identifying the WHS-related legislation and regulations
that organisations must comply with in their jurisdiction,
is a critical step in establishing a safety management
system. While legislation is "a law or set of laws suggested
by a government and made official by a parliament"
(Cambridge Dictionary, n.d., para. 1), regulations "are
rules made by a government or other authority in order
to control the way something is done or the way people
behave" (Collins Dictionary, n.d., para. 1). It is the
regulations that establish the role of any WHS regulator,
as an enforcer of WHS legislation.

Legislation

In Australia, since the 1970s, there have been calls for a
uniform approach to WHS legislation between all states
and territories, with unions seeking to ensure equitable
nation-wide safety benchmarks for workers, and all levels
of government seeking to enhance business productivity
through streamlining of WHS expectations for companies
(Windholz, 2013). In 2009 a national review, involving
extensive consultation with employer groups, WHS
regulators, legal experts, and worker representatives
(unions), recommended an "optimal structure and content
of a model OHS [WHS] Act that was capable of being
adopted in all [Australian] jurisdictions" (Safe Work
Australia, n.d.-a, para. 9).

   By April 2010, a committee comprised of workplace
relations ministers from federal and state jurisdictions
endorsed a model bill--a prototype draft--that could be
presented in each jurisdiction and, in due course, be passed
legislation. This collaborative piece of work became
known as the Model Work Health and Safety Bill. At
October 2023 all jurisdictions, except the State of Victoria,
have implemented legislation fundamentally derived from
the Model Act (Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations, 2023). Table 8.1 summarises each Australian
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 143

jurisdiction's WHS legislation, WHS regulator, and
workers' compensation entity.

As each Australian jurisdiction is different, nuanced
changes--distinct from Model Act-- have been made
when it has been legislated. Box 8.1. contains resources
that enable comparison of legislation between Australian
146 Lynnaire Sheridan

jurisdictions with regards to their implementation of key
elements of the Model Act.

          Box 8.1: Safe Work Australia's comparative
       legislation resources

          Safe Work Australia summarises WHS Acts
       across Australia's jurisdictions, these can be
       obtained by visiting their Law and Regulation
       website.

          Safe Work Australia compares interpretations of
       the Model Act between state and territory
       legislation, it is available via a downloadable file on
       their Model WHS Laws website.

In New Zealand, a 2013 WHS taskforce concluded that
"New Zealand's work health and safety system was
failing" (WorkSafe, 2019a, para. 3). This timing coincided
with Australia's WHS legislative reformation and
harmonisation efforts. New Zealand adopted many
elements from Australia's Model Work Health and Safety
Bill in it's Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, with
careful adaptations for the New Zealand context
(WorkSafe, 2019a). To this end, Australia and New
Zealand safety legislation share a common objective which
is articulated in Box 8.2.
             ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 147

   Box 8.2: The objective of the Work Health and
Safety Act 2011 (Cth) s3

      3.(1) The main object of this Act is to provide for
   a balanced and nationally consistent framework to
   secure the health and safety of workers and
   workplaces by:

      (a) protecting workers and other persons against
   harm to their health, safety and welfare through the
   elimination or minimisation of risks arising from
   work; and

      (b) providing for fair and effective workplace
   representation, consultation, co-operation and issue
   resolution in relation to work health and safety; and

      (c) encouraging unions and employer
   organisations to take a constructive role in promoting
   improvements in work health and safety practices,
   and assisting persons conducting businesses or
   undertakings and workers to achieve a healthier and
   safer working environment; and

      (d) promoting the provision of advice,
   information, education and training in relation to
   work health and safety; and

      (e) securing compliance with this Act through
   effective and appropriate compliance and
   enforcement measures; and

      (f) ensuring appropriate scrutiny and review of
   actions taken by persons exercising powers and
   performing functions under this Act; and

      (g) providing a framework for continuous
   improvement and progressively higher standards of
   work health and safety; and
148 Lynnaire Sheridan

              (h) maintaining and strengthening the national
           harmonisation of laws relating to work health and
           safety and to facilitate a consistent national approach
           to work health and safety in this jurisdiction.

          Note: As replicated in Health and Safety at Work
       Act 2015 (New Zealand) s.3.

In practice, PCBUs responding to the legislative
requirements are mostly involved in:

       1. Managing hazards and risks: Keep workers,
            and other persons, safe from work or workplace
            derived harm (subsection a)

       2. Consulting on health and safety: Ensure
            worker consultation within the business is fair
            and effective (subsection b) and that
            engagement with employer and worker
            representative bodies (unions) is constructive
            (subsection c)

       3. Educating on health and safety: Ensure
            workers are informed and capable (education
            and training) to undertake their WHS
            responsibilities, as corresponding to their roles
            (subsection d)

Subsection (e) refers to the establishment of a WHS
regulator to enact compliance with the Act, and subsection
(f) builds in checks and balances to ensure the appropriate
enactment of legislation by regulators so they do not breach
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 149

their powers. Subsection (g) states that continuous
improvement is imperative (this supports a systems-based
approach to safety management). Finally, and only
specific to Australia, is the goal expressed in subsection (h)
of unifying national WHS legislation through adoption of
the Model Act.

   PCBU obligations to manage hazards and risks will be
the focus of Chapter 9: Hazard Identification, Chapter 10:
Risk Assessment, Chapter 11: Hazard Control, and Chapter
12: Emergency Response, as compliance with subsection
(a) comprises the majority of an organisation's WHS
management activities. Consulting and educating on
health and safety will be explained briefly here but, more
importantly, will be contextualised within Chapters 9 to
12, given this is when these interventions would roll out.
Subsequent to this, the discussion will explain the role
of regulations and, specifically, the WHS regulator and
any legislated or regulated bodies that enact worker
compensation rights.

Consulting on Health and Safety

What comprises worker consultation that fulfils the legal
and moral requirements of WHS management? Good
safety consultation:

   Enables workers to respond and contribute to issues that
   directly affect them, and provide valuable information and
   insights. It's a two-way process where information and
   views are shared between PCBUs and workers. PCBUs can
   become more aware of hazards and issues experienced by
   workers, and involve them in finding solutions or addressing
   problems. (Safe Work South Australia, n.d, para. 8)

Consultation can range from extensively planned strategies
150 Lynnaire Sheridan

for complex organisations, through to hazard and risk-
based chats in smaller, lower risk, settings. The extent
of worker consultation that is reasonably practicable is
determined by factors such as:

           · the size of the business and how it is structured,

           · the way work is arranged and where workers are

                located,

           · what suits workers - ask your workers how they

                would like to be consulted and consider their
                needs, and

           · the complexity, frequency and urgency of the

                issues that require consultation. (Safe Work
                Australia, n.d.-b, para. 1)

For due diligence purposes, the terms of reference and
composition of any committees should be documented
along with minutes of meetings that capture any safety
concerns raised and, in subsequent meetings, how these
were addressed in a reasonably practicable manner. As
such, staff need to be aware that they are fulfilling an
obligation under the WHS legislation, so the PCBU and
workers should take this responsibility seriously.

   Businesses should consult with workers regarding
safety because "workers often notice issues and practices,
or foresee consequences, that might otherwise be
overlooked" (Safe Work South Australia, n.d, para. 8),
leading to better overall hazard identification (see Chapter
9), risk assessment (see Chapter 10), and hazard control
(see Chapter 11) i.e. safety outcomes. As Reason (1997)
points out, when endorsing a flexible culture, it is
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 151

important that the people who do the task, and know it
well, are those who are most empowered to control its
safety management. From Dekker's perspective, it is only
through having worker-driven WHS that safety can
actually ever be achieved (Dekker, 2018).

   So genuine attempts to consult with workers will ensure
representation of workers from all parts of the business and
across all work shifts (Safe Work Australia, n.d.-b); this
will be further explored across Chapters 9-12 in examples,
such as, Risk Assessment Example 1: Exposure to sunlight
(and Glastonbury Festival!) in Chapter 10.

Educating on Health and Safety

Organisations have a legislated (legal) responsibility to
inform, educate, and train workers regarding their safety
rights and responsibilities; it is useful to understand the
obligations of inform, educate and train specifically.

   To inform is to "impart knowledge of some particular
fact, occurrence, situation, etc." (Oxford English
Dictionary, n.d.-a, part 1.2). This communication is likely
in one direction, from the organisation to the worker. The
inform-ation will predominantly be top-down, generated
centrally and broadly across the organisation (see Figure
8.1). From an HR perspective, informing can occur when:

         · Inducting a worker to a workplace, including
            when they change roles or sites, to ensure they
            are aware of relevant organisational policies and
            procedures as part of due diligence.

         · Keeping workers up to date on safety initiatives
            or safety outcomes. This supports an
152 Lynnaire Sheridan

            organisation's learning culture but also
            reinforces its reporting culture as workers will
            see how their reporting of data generates safety
            initiatives.

                    Figure 8.1: An informational communication
  Source: "Lightning Safety infographic" by State Farm, flickr.com, CC BY 2.0

To educate is to "help or cause (a person, the mind, etc.)
to develop the intellectual and moral faculties in general;
to impart wisdom to; to enlighten" (Oxford English
Dictionary, n.d.-b, part 5). The goal of educate is
ambitious as it seeks to establish awareness to evoke
cognitive and behavioural change (Arlinghaus & Johnson,
2018). In the WHS management context, education will
predominately involve adults, which likely requires two-
way engagement between the educator, as an
organisational representative, and workers, the participants
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 153

in the course, to enable learning that encourages
individuals to change their perceptions or perspectives.
This moral and behavioural aspect is particularly important
if the educational intervention seeks to establish or align
workers with the organisation's desired safety culture (see
Box 8.3). From an HR perspective, education is likely to
take place:

         · Prior to hiring an employee, if formal studies are
            required to be eligible for recruitment into a
            specific role.

         · As part of a worker's continuing professional
            development by an external tertiary education
            provider, or run internally if tailored to address
            organisational issues or work conditions.

          Box 8.3: Educating workers on the importance of
       safety

          This video uses humour to educate workers that a
       poor attitude towards safety management practices
       leads to incidents. Cleverly, it leads the viewer to
       expect one type of hazard to be a potential source of
       harm but swaps it out for a less expected one.

To train is to "subject to discipline and instruction for
development of character, behaviour, or skill" (Oxford
English Dictionary, n.d.-c, part 11.10). Training is
developing a specific skill to achieve targeted competency.
From an HR perspective, training can include:

         · Familiarising a worker with machinery to ensure
            their competency (due diligence). A new recruit
            may have used a different model at their prior
            workplace or training institution, or, if the
            organisation upgrades machinery, all operators
            will require re-training.

         · Familiarising a worker with a new job role to
            ensure competency (due diligence), such as
            when they transition to become a supervisor.

   Legislative requirements to inform, educate and train
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 155

are designed to pre-emptively strengthen an organisation's
safety defence layers (see Swiss Cheese Model, Figure
5.1). To achieve this, every worker must be, and stay,
informed. Education can happen without training, for
example this publication is an educational, not a training,
resource. While training can occur without education, this
is strongly cautioned against. A worker who has the skill
to operate a machine, without any intellectual or moral
understanding of safety, is vulnerable to an incident. Only
pathological and reactive businesses (see Figure 6.2;
Hudson's Safety Culture Ladder) would train without
educate, whereas generative businesses would never
separate safety education from training.

          Box 8.4: Why a safety education is important
          The following video demonstrates workers who
       competently know how to operate a piece of
       machinery (they are trained) but clearly have not
       been educated on its use.

                             One or more interactive elements has
                             been excluded from this version of the

To achieve subsection (a), protecting workers and others
from harm (see Box 8.2), the potential role of information,
education and training in an organisation is embedded in
further discussions of hazard identification (Chapter 9),
risk assessment (Chapter 10) and hazard control (Chapter
11), and is central to the enactment of and emergency
response (Chapters 12). The effectiveness of inform,
educate and train should be evaluated, as required by
subsection (g), as part of continuous improvement (Chapter
13).

Regulation and the WHS regulator

Legislation is delegated as regulations to a minister or
government department. These entities are then
responsible for monitoring and, when necessary, updating
the regulations (Parliament Counsel Office, n.d.).
Legislation establishes the WHS regulator, an entity
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 157

responsible for implementation of fines and penalties as
specified in the regulations (see Box 8.5, where the role
of a WHS regulator is defined in Australia). Essentially,
WHS regulators are responsible for ensuring an
organisation's due diligence.

   In New Zealand, the WHS regulator is WorkSafe who
consider that their job:

   Isn't just about compliance with the rules. We also aim
   to promote and embed positive health and safety practices
   around the country, and to do this, we collaborate with
   persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs),
   workers, health and safety representatives, and industry
   bodies." (WorkSafe, 2018, para. 3)

This educative, versus punitive, approach recognises the
innate challenge that WHS regulators face; there is always
likely to be more businesses requiring inspection than
inspectors available to conduct visits. This was even the
case during the British Industrial Revolution when the
Health and Morals of Apprentices Act of 1802 was
introduced, but only four inspectors were employed to
inspect over 4000 mills (see Chapter 2). Moreover, it
makes sense that regulators would be more effective if they
focus on shifting reactive or calculative organisations up
Hudson's Safety Culture Ladder (see Figure 6.2), rather
than solely focusing on pathological businesses. Box 8.5
defines the role of the WHS regulator, as implemented
in full from the Model Health and Safety Bill, in the
Australian federal legislation.
158 Lynnaire Sheridan

          Box 8.5: Establishment of a regulator's role in the
       Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (Cth) S 152.

              In Australia, a WHS regulator is a legally
           established government body whose functions are:

              (a) to advise and make recommendations to the
           Minister and report on the operation and
           effectiveness of this Act;

              (b) to monitor and enforce compliance with this
           Act;

              (c) to provide advice and information on work
           health and safety to duty holders under this Act and
           to the community;

              (d) to collect, analyse and publish statistics
           relating to work health and safety;

              (e) to foster a co-operative, consultative
           relationship between duty holders and the persons to
           whom they owe duties and their representatives in
           relation to work health and safety matters;

              (f) to promote and support education and training
           on matters relating to work health and safety;

              (g) to engage in, promote and co-ordinate the
           sharing of information to achieve the object of this
           Act, including the sharing of information with a
           corresponding regulator;

              (h) to conduct and defend proceedings under this
           Act before a court or tribunal;

              (i) any other function conferred on the regulator
           by this Act.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 159

In practice, PCBUs will engage with their WHS regulator
in some of the following ways:

       1. Collaborating: Working together to enhance
            worker safety through exchanging information
            on occupational health issues (see Chapter 4) or
            best practice hazard and risk assessment.

       2. Inspecting: Receiving a site visit and this can
            include unannounced workplace inspections if
            potential safety breaches have been reported by
            a whistle-blower (see Box 8.6).

       3. Notifying: Reporting on scheduled or
            completed work as required by legislation; or
            reporting on their hazardous substances; or
            notifying illnesses, injuries or incidents (see Box
            8.7).

       4. Investigating: Receiving a site visit specifically
            designed to investigate active failures and
            latent conditions (causes) of a WHS incident
            to determine if safety management was
            reasonably practical or negligent.

       5. Prosecuting: Defending due diligence against
            accusations of negligence in a court of law.

          Box 8.7: What is a notifiable incident?
          A notifiable incident is an incident that must be
       reported to the WHS regulator and are usually
       "occurrences that resulted in a fatality, permanent
       disability or time lost from work of one day/shift or
       more" (Archer et al., 2015, p. 86). For example,
       WorkSafe in New Zealand expects to be informed
       of a death, serious illness or injury, or any incidents
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 161

       associated with work, and defines a notifiable
       incident as "where someone's health or safety is
       seriously endangered or threatened" (WorkSafe,
       n.d., para. 4). Notification is for serious situations
       including amputation, serious head injury, serious
       eye injury, a serious burn, skin separating from
       tissue, a spinal injury, loss of a bodily function,
       serious lacerations, exposure to an injury or illness
       requiring treatment within 48 hours, contracting a
       serious infection (particularly if associated with a
       known workplace biological hazard), and illnesses
       for specific work sites (i.e. mining), as scheduled in
       regulations. Note: Different legislations can have
       different jurisdictions. In New Zealand, incidents
       related to work aboard ships are reported to
       Maritime New Zealand, that industry's safety
       regulator rather than WorkSafe.

Both WHS regulators and PBCUs should strive to engage
via collaboration. Investigations and prosecution are very
undesirable given it likely involves a tragic incident and,
from the organisation's perspective, is associated with
considerable business risk. Box 8.8 contains a short news
podcast on an investigation undertaken when two port
workers died within a week of each other at two different
ports in New Zealand.

       Committee report into the deaths of Atiroa Tuaiti
       (Port of Auckland) and Don Grant (Port of

   While poor regulatory compliance does exist, there are
businesses that choose to go above and beyond compliance
and adhere to voluntary compliance initiatives, such as
those endorsed by the United Nations as is now discussed
in Past Influencing the Present.

   Past influencing the present

      The International Labour Organization was created by
   the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 , but is now a specialist
   organisation of the United Nations, devoted to "advancing
   opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and
   productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security
   and human dignity" (International Labour Organization,
   n.d.-a). They achieve their goals through alliances with
   member-states (national governments) who sign
   conventions that governments then uphold through
   voluntary compliance demonstrated via voluntary
164 Lynnaire Sheridan

   reporting. In this way, the International Labour
   Organization strives to influence national legislation to
   protect worker rights, including their safety, and therefore
   indirectly influence organisations.

      New Zealand was a founding member of the
   International Labour Organization and, by passing the first
   legislation enabling women to vote in 1893 and later laws
   to restrict working hours, is recognised as critical to
   establishing a foundational international Hours of Work
   (Industry) Convention, 1919 (International Labour
   Organization, n.d.-b). As the Ministry of Business,
   Employment and Innovation explain, International Labour
   Organization conventions are ratified by the New Zealand
                  ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 165

government and a "tripartite partnership of government,
employers and workers is fundamental to New Zealand's
ILO activities. A tripartite delegation attends the annual
International Labour Conference and all reporting to the
ILO is undertaken on a tripartite basis" (Ministry of
Business, Employment and Innovation, n.d.-a, para. 3);
enactment of international conventions is via national-level
collaboration between government, industry/employer
professional bodies and unions. All actions are, however,
voluntary.

   While Australia and New Zealand have both ratified the
International Labour Organization's Protocol 2014 to the
Forced Labour Convention of 1930, only Australia has
implemented a corresponding piece of modern slavery
legislation. Even then, the Modern Slavery Act 2018
[Australia] only requires compliance by organisations with
revenues over $100 million per year and, for most
businesses, reporting is voluntarily.

   In New Zealand, non-governmental organisations
continue to advocate for modern slavery legislation using
the convention as a lever, for example World Vision's
report Risky Goods: New Zealand Imports (World Vision,
2021). The Ministry of Business, Employment and
Innovation suggests that future legislation would:

      Require all organisations to take action if they become
   aware of modern slavery or worker exploitation; Medium and
   large organisations would be required to disclose the steps
   they are taking; Large organisations and those with control
   over New Zealand employers would be required to undertake
   due diligence." (Ministry of Business, Employment and
   Innovation, n.d.-b, para. 3)

   So, again, different levels of organisations will have
different requirements to either comply, or voluntarily
comply, with modern slavery initiatives.

      Overall, the International Labour Organization has an
   important role in highlighting issues and trends associated
   with worker labour and safety rights worldwide. Together
   with broader United Nation initiatives, including the United
   Nations Sustainable Development Goals (with Goal 3 Good
   Health and Wellbeing and Goal 8 Decent Work and
   Economic Growth being specific to WHS management),
   this organisation creates a social impetus for legislative and
   voluntary compliance and sets expectations for
   organisations' social licence to operate.

Worker Compensation Rights Regulation

In many jurisdictions, legislation will afford workers the
right to be compensated for any work-derived injury or
illness. This `workers' compensation' emerged as a
response to limitations in British common law that
previously required employees to sue for compensation
(see the following Past Influencing the Present for more
details). The goal of most modern workers' compensation
schemes is to ensure that workers, who offer their labour to
an employer, are compensated for the costs of any illness
or injury associated with the provision of their labour.

   In turn, employers pay levies into a scheme that should
seek to fairly compensate worker costs, without exposing
the business to safety liability (Safe Work Australia, 2011).
The WHS regulator, rather than workers, retains the
capacity to prosecute businesses for safety negligence (see
Box 8.5). Moreover, levies can incentivise good safety
practice as payments can be reduced according to "a good
record of managing worker safety and recovery at work"
(Icare, n.d.).
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 167

   Where possible, the goal for all parties in workers'
compensation schemes is that the worker return to work
because this is good for business but, importantly, for
workers as "work is one of the most effective ways to
improve wellbeing" because it supports "participation,
independence and social inclusion" (Comcare, 2023a, para.
2).

   Past influencing the present

      In early 20th Century Britain, the unions formally
   became involved in the political system through the Fabian
   Society founding the British Labour Party (Fabian Society,
   n.d.). In the United States this was not the case and this
   fragmented efforts towards achieving workers'
   compensation rights (Guyton, 1999). The British
   government established the Employer's Liability Act 1880
   whereby the "employer had a general duty to take
   reasonable care to select competent employees and not to
   expose workers to unreasonable risks such as directing the
   use of a dangerous machine or unsafe work conditions"
   (Veljanovski, 2021, p. 661). This was followed by the
   Workmens' Compensation Act 1897, a `no-fault' approach
   to managing compensation (Guyton, 1999). Subsequently,
   the Fabian Society--through the British Labour
   Party--enacted a universal healthcare system in Britain
   (Fabian Society, n.d.) which now works alongside
   workplace compensation schemes that today ensure British
   workers are compensated for work injuries (UK Parliament,
   n.d.-a).

      In the United States, this `care' for workers was achieved
168 Lynnaire Sheridan

   through lobbying for Worker's Compensation and
   emerged as the Federal Employee's Compensation Act
   1916 (Norlund, 1991). "All U.S. workers' compensation
   programs are the products of the American Industrial
   Revolution" (Nordlund, 1991, p. 3). Historically caring for
   injured workers, or the families of deceased workers, was
   undertaken by the local communities, most often through
   their churches. The scale of the Industrial Revolution, and
   the migration of workers away from their communities,
   meant this was no longer a tenable approach (Nordlund,
   1991). After observing European efforts to ensure the
   welfare of workers and their families (particularly that of
   Germany which set up the first scheme), in 1916 the United
   States established an act for federal employees to include
   "compensation for all civil employees of the Federal
   Government injured or killed in the performance of duty"
   (Nordlund, 1991, p. 7). It compensated work-derived
   injury and disease. However, it exempted employers from
   being sued for negligence and poor safety conditions
   (Guyton, 1999).

Even today, as influenced by their histories, different
countries' jurisdictions will tend more towards a universal
health approach or adhere strictly to workers'
compensation schemes. As we will now find out, New
Zealand has a more universal health approach and
Australia has a workers' compensation scheme.

Worker compensation rights in New Zealand

New Zealand has a universal coverage approach to injury:

   If someone in New Zealand has an accident and we cover
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 169

   their injury, we use this money to help pay for and support
   their recovery. This includes treatment, health, rehabilitation
   and support services, loss of income or financial help and
   injury prevention in the community. (Accident
   Compensation Corporation, 2018, para. 2)

This coverage applies to anyone who incurs an injury,
including visitors, within New Zealand (see Box 8.9). This
compensation is administered via the Accident
Compensation Corporation (ACC).

Unlike overseas workers' compensation schemes, where
levies may be solely collected from businesses, in New
Zealand the accident compensation scheme is funded via
a broad base including business, income, fuel and vehicle
levies, and broader government funded via tax. However,
like in other workers' compensation schemes, business
premiums are linked to business safety performance with
a poor claims record leading to higher levies (Accident
Compensation Corporation, 2018). While having
universal accident cover can be considered positive, in
the context of workplace health and safety it is noted by
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 171

WorkSafe that "New Zealand has high rates of workplace
fatalities, serious harm injuries, and work related illness
compared to other OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development] member countries"
(WorkSafe, 2023, para. 2). This infers that the accident
compensation scheme may be so (cost) effective that it
may inadvertently be leading to an over-reliance on
prosecution to address business safety negligence.

   In contrast to worker's compensation schemes, there is
no coverage provided for worker illness and "every year,
more than 100,000 New Zealanders are made redundant,
laid off, or have to stop working because of a health
condition or a disability" (Ministry of Business,
Employment and Innovation, 2022, p. 4). Those who lose
their jobs can experience considerable disadvantage if not
eligible for redundancy payments or welfare therefore, in
2022, the New Zealand Government put out a discussion
document to consider if an income insurance scheme might
be viable to introduce (Ministry of Business, Employment
and Innovation, 2022).

Worker compensation rights in Australia

In Australia, workers receive compensation for "medical
treatment, rehabilitation or time off to recover after being
injured at work" (Health Direct, 2021, para. 2). It also
provides compensation for those who have a work-
acquired occupational disease (Health Direct, 2021).
Notably, "to be eligible, workers only have to prove that
their injuries were work related--they do not need to prove
negligence on the part of an employer" (Safe Work
Australia, 2011, p. 5). This means it only addresses
workplace illness or injuries (unlike the accident cover in
172 Lynnaire Sheridan

New Zealand), but still embeds a `no fault' (no blame-the-
victim or blame-the-system) approach.

   Australian-based workers' compensation are managed
as insurance schemes and "under Australian law,
employers must have insurance to cover their workers in
case they get sick or injured because of work" (Safe Work
Australia, n.d.-c, para. 1). Businesses pay levies that are
calculated according to the risk their industry poses to
workers and worker compensation claims are linked to
the specific business (Icare, n.d.). The compensation to
workers can include some wages while recovering, medical
costs (including those associated with rehabilitation or care
being provided), lump sums for permanent disability (to
enable reasonable adjustments around home), or
compensation to families in the case of a fatality (Safe
Work Australia, 2011).

PCBU engagement with compensation schemes

In practice, PCBUs will engage with the compensation
regulator, or their delegated insurer, in some of the
following ways when an employee is injured:

       1. Registering: Confirm that the effected worker is
            registered with the scheme to ensure their
            medical care is sufficient and all costs are
            compensated.

       2. Administrating: Provide any required details,
            and process any relevant documents, to enable
            the worker's care.

       3. Monitoring: Engage with the compensation
            body to monitor the progress of recovery and
            stay engaged with your worker(s) to enhance
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 173

            their wellbeing.

       4. Collaborating: Working together with the
            compensation body, occupational health
            professionals and the worker to develop a
            return to work plan to make reasonable
            adjustments so they can work until their full, if
            possible, recovery.

   This chapter has broadly outlined the compliance
expectations established by the Model Work Health and
Safety Bill (Safe Work Australia, n.d.-a), which has
subsequently been brought into law via legislation in all
jurisdictions, except for the State of Victoria, and in New
Zealand. This chapter is not designed to replace the
`compliance' checking phase of any organisation's safety
management system but, instead, it seeks to explain the
rationales behind the act, some of the implications for
practice and to cite reliable information sources that could
be accessed and further considered.

   With compliance notionally understood, implementation
will be the focus on the next five chapters which will
move step-by-step through hazard identification, risk
assessment, and determining what hazard controls are
reasonably practicable before, finally, designing
emergency responses enabling workers to escape safely as
a final safety defence layer.

9.
Implementing: Hazard Identification

This is the first of three chapters focused on managing
hazards and the risks they pose to workers. In this
implementation phase, safety professionals are required to
enhance organisational capacity, by ensuring adequate
resourcing of activities and should foster a positive safety
culture, while building-up individual worker capacity
through training and engagement.

   In this chapter, the focus is on effective hazard
identification as some hazards will be obvious, but some
will be very specific to a particular task undertaken at a
particular time of day, or even time of year. It is vital
that organisations seek to identify hazards because they
can lead to occupational disease or a WHS incident.
Identifying hazards is the first step towards strengthening
an organisation's safety defence layers (see Swiss Cheese
Model, Chapter 5).

   Learning Objectives

      This chapter introduces:

                                     175
176 Lynnaire Sheridan

              · The concept of hazard identification.

              · Common hazard classifications; chemical,
                 ergonomic, biological, physical, psychosocial,
                 safety, and workplace.

              · Strategies to identify work-related hazards
                 and scenarios that uncover unanticipated
                 hazards.

A hazard may be defined as "anything with the potential to
harm life, health or property" (Dunn, 2012, p. 53) and, in
WHS management, risk is the "likelihood and consequence
of injury or harm occurring" (Standards Australia &
Standards New Zealand, 2001, p. 5) due to an interaction
between a hazard and a worker. Hazard identification,
risk assessment and hazard controls attempt to make an
organisation's safety defence layers as strong as possible,
mitigating everyday occupational health risks while
reducing the likelihood of a WHS safety incident
occurring. According to the Swiss Cheese Model of safety
incident causation (Chapter 5), this requires management
of human factors to avoid "active failures" and system-
based factors, to proactively identify and address any
"latent conditions".

   In blame-the-system approaches, some people are not
considered innately more hazardous than others (Hopkins
& Palser, 1987). Instead, it is recognised that there are
situations (conditions) that increase the likelihood of
human error (active failures), see Box 9.1. These
conditions have been extensively researched in different
fields including clinical psychology, experimental
psychology, organisational psychology, educational
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 177

psychology, medical science, anthropometric science,
cognitive science, industrial engineering, safety
engineering, and computer science (Federal Aviation
Administration, n.d.). Scholars, such as Reason (2000)
and Hudson (2007), have undertaken empirical studies on
human factors in practice.

In an effective safety management system, human error
would not lead to a serious incident because other safety
defence layers will protect workers. Human factors mainly
correspond to the `people' layer of the Swiss Cheese Model
(including safety culture) but require consideration of the
interactions between workers and the other safety defence
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 179

layers (see Figure 9.1). Just like for the other safety defence
layers, human factors need be identified and controlled,
however, Reason (1997) suggests this is challenging
because human-centric factors are difficult to predict and
control.

               Figure 9.1: Swiss Cheese Model safety defence layers

In contrast, management of latent conditions involves
identifying "poor design, gaps in supervision, undetected
manufacturing defects or maintenance failures,
unworkable procedures, clumsy automation, shortfalls in
training, less than adequate tools and equipment" (Reason,
1997, p. 10) which notionally corresponds to engineering,
procedural and administrative safety defences (see Figure
9.1).

Hazard Identification

The first step in reducing the risk of a hazard to workers is
180 Lynnaire Sheridan

to identify it. It is not possible, or appropriate, to present
all possible WHS hazard identification tools and
techniques here, instead, the focus will be on providing a
conceptual overview.

   As general rule, when establishing hazard identification
processes and procedures in a business, it is advisable to:

       1. Use industry-specific hazard identification
            resources: Often available from WHS
            regulators or professional industry bodies, these
            resources identify the most common hazards
            associated with an industry or type of work.

       2. Employee engagement and consultation:
            First, get workers to identify hazards known to
            them that are specific to their role and, secondly,
            have them collaborate with other workers to
            discover the less obvious hazards that
            inattentional blindness or change blindness
            may not enable them to identify.

       3. Hazard identification auditing: Hire
            professionals, or establish mutually beneficial
            arrangements with suitably qualified industry
            peers, to independently review your work site
            for hazards. This strives to enact a greater level
            of accuracy, again seeking to avoid biases such
            as inattentional blindness or change
            blindness, and takes hazard identification to a
            more sophisticated level.

       Note: Avoid allocating hazard identification to an
       accreditation body who is auditing your safety
       management system for two reasons; firstly, it will
       identify that you have weak hazard identification
       practices in place putting your certification in
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 181

       jeopardy and, secondly, these audits tend to be at a
       higher level and focused on system-function rather
       than undertaking the systematic hazard identification
       that is actually required for effective safety
       management.

       Note: WHS regulators may undertake a hazard
       audit as part of a spontaneous site visit to your
       business or as part of an incident investigation;
       neither of these two options should be relied upon
       as an effective hazard identification measure as they
       expose the business to compliance risk. However,
       WHS regulators that take an educative approach (see
       Chapter 7 discussions on WorkSafe New Zealand as
       an educative WHS regulator) may genuinely support
       you in establishing your safety management system
       by undertaking a hazard audit once you have
       demonstrated genuine attempts at hazard
       identification. These WHS regulators recognise the
       innate vulnerability of a business at the start-up
       phase of safety management, where hazard controls
       are not yet in place, but seek to encourage an
       organisation's pro-safety stance. Furthermore, your
       proactive engagement with the WHS regulator can
       be one way to demonstrate efforts towards due
       diligence during this challenging period.

   If you are joining an established safety management
system it will be important to learn both the tools that
your businesses use, but also to understand why they have
adopted those methods. This enables you to question if the
existing tools are the best possible ones for the task.

   Although definitions do vary, as a starting point, hazards
maybe categorised into:

Chemical Hazards

Chemical hazards "can be a solid, liquid or gas. It can be
a pure substance, consisting of one ingredient, or a mixture
of substances. It can harm the health of a person who is
exposed to it" (Comcare, 2021, para. 1). The International
Labour Organization ranks the risk of these hazards in
priority order as: "1. Asbestos, 2. Silica, 3. Heavy metals,
4. Solvents, 5. Dyes, 6. Manufactured nanomaterials
(MNMs), 7. Perfluorinated chemicals (PFAS), 8.
Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), 9. Pesticides, 10.
Workplace air pollution" (ILO, 2021, p. v). The types
of diseases that workers suffer as a consequence include
respiratory illnesses, toxicity reactions, and cancer. Box
9.2 outlines the global scale and consequence of chemical
hazard exposure to workers.

   The International Labour Organization's
Exposure to hazardous chemicals at work and
resulting health impacts: A global review, found
that:

      Workers around the world are facing a global
   health crisis due to occupational exposure to toxic
   chemicals. Every year more than 1 billion workers
   are exposed to hazardous substances, including
   pollutants, dusts, vapours and fumes in their working
   environments. Many of these workers lose their life
   following such exposures, succumbing to fatal
   diseases, cancers and poisonings, or from fatal
   injuries following fires or explosions. We must also
   consider the additional burden that workers and their
   families face from non-fatal injuries resulting in
184 Lynnaire Sheridan

           disability, debilitating chronic diseases, and other
           health sequela, that unfortunately in many cases
           remain invisible. All of these deaths, injuries and
           illnesses are entirely preventable." (ILO, 2021, p. v)

The impact on workers of Inorganic dust can be difficult
to identify due to its prolonged, rather than acute,
presentation. Identifying these chemical hazards usually
are a specialist activity requiring occupational
epidemiologists and guidance from public health
agencies and WHS regulators (see Chapter 4). Workers
are involved as they may be required to participate in
health monitoring, would be expected to report exposure
events and, importantly, should be involved in continuous
improvement of safe work procedures.

          Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and
       Safety reflections for practitioners: "Access
       chemical information with substance. Find
       resources on chemical hazards, product safety;

       Information System], (M)SDSs [Material Safety
       Data Sheets], transport of hazadous materials,
       toxicity, and safe work practices" (2023, para 1).

Ergonomic Hazards

Ergonomic hazards are "physical factors in the
environment that may cause musculoskeletal injuries"
(ComCare, 2022, para. 1). Occupational therapists and
ergonomists are useful in the re-design of work layouts to
prevent ergonomic-related injuries (Capodaglio, 2010). In
Past influencing the present we see how ergonomics for
productivity has shifted to ergonomics for health.

      Frederick Taylor used scientific principles (Scientific
   Management) to change the positioning of workers and
   machines in the workplace to enhance productivity and
   Henry Ford built on this by designing the assembly line,
                  ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 187

which brought the task to the worker rather than the
workers to the task (see Chapter 3).

   Today industrial engineers continue the traditions of
Scientific Management by striving to identify efficiencies
through industrial design (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
2023) but ergonomists and occupational therapists focus
on designing work for workers, including personalising the
workplace (see Figure 9.5), particularly if a person is
returning to work after illness or injury (Ammendolia et al.,
2009).

       workplace design and considerations, work-related

Biological Hazards

Biological hazards "are organic substances that present a
threat to the health of people and other living organisms.
Biological hazards include "viruses...toxins from
biological sources, spores, fungi, pathogenic, micro-
organisms, bio-active substances" (ComCare, 2023, para.
1). These types of hazards can be acute, and have an
immediately obvious impact on health, or lead to chronic
conditions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2022) which are "defined broadly as conditions that last
1 year or more and require ongoing medical attention or
limit activities of daily living or both" (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2022, para. 1).

   In an Australian survey, 19% of workers had biological
hazards present at their workplace; 75% of these workers
were exposed to human biological hazards and 30% to
animal biological hazards. Less was known about
exposure of workers to less obvious hazards such as plants
or mould (Safe Work Australia, 2020).
190 Lynnaire Sheridan

          Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and
       Safety reflections for practitioners: "Many
       workplace hazards have the potential to harm
       workers' short- and long-term health, resulting in
       diseases, disorders and injuries" (2023, para. 3).

Physical Hazards

America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
define physical hazards as "workplace agents, factors, or
circumstances that can cause tissue damage by transfer of
energy from the agent to the person" (2022c, para. 1).
If only thinking about the Swiss Cheese Model, workers
might only identify physical hazards with acute impacts on
workers, such as an object striking a worker and breaking
their arm, but the transfer of energy aspect of the above
definition can refer to many other situations. One example
(see Figure 9.6) is workers operating tools or machinery
that vibrate as "excessive exposure can affect the nerves,
blood vessels, muscles and joints of the hand, wrist and
arm causing Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome" (Health and
Safety Executive, n.d.-a, para. 17).

   Physical hazards comprise a broad range of hazards
including "loud noises, extreme pressures, magnetic fields,
radiation, fire, poor lighting, unsafe machinery, misused
machinery, obstructions in walkways, [and] slippery
floors" (National Association of Safety Professionals,
2018, para. 11). They can be challenging to identify at
times because piece of workplace machinery might always
pose a physical safety risk but slippery floors are a
temporary physical hazard.

          Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and
192 Lynnaire Sheridan

       Safety reflections for practitioners: "Physical
       hazards are substances or activities that threaten
       your physical safety. They are the most common
       and are present in most workplaces at one time or
       another. These include unsafe conditions that can
       cause injury, illness and death" (2023, para 4).

Psychosocial Hazards

Psychosocial hazards are "aspects of work which have the
potential to cause psychological or physical harm"
(ComCare, n.d., para. 1). The Australian Government has
classified 14 types of psychosocial hazards (see Figure 9.7)
and these are important to manage because:

   Psychological injuries have longer recovery times, higher
   costs, and require more time away from work. Managing the
   risks associated with psychosocial hazards not only protects
   workers, it also decreases the disruption associated with staff
   turnover and absenteeism, and may improve broader
   organisational performance and productivity. (Safe Work
   Australia, 2022, p. 5)

Essentially, while overlooked until recently, psychosocial
hazards represent an important business risk that must be
addressed.

Different industries expose workers to different types of
psychosocial hazards. WorkSafe Queensland highlight
manufacturing, transport, agriculture, construction, retail
and wholesale, and healthcare as particularly `at risk'
industries.
194 Lynnaire Sheridan

   In healthcare, for example, workers have low job control
as their work comprises shiftwork and the provision of care
to patients in challenging circumstances. There are high
job demands, with considerable emotional control required
to enable service delivery. There can be poor levels of
support with care staff working very independently. Low
role clarity can emerge because of the autonomy of the
role and limited opportunities for supervisory guidance and
feedback. Workplace change is constant as each shifts
changes the care team and allocated patients. There can
be poor perceptions of institutional justice around shift
allocations or inconsistent implementation of procedures.
Finally, poor relationships can develop, with conflict not
being resolved between shifts, or the line between
professional and personal being blurred in patient care
(WorkSafe Queensland, 2020). In Chapter 5, Neil Logan
(Box 5.1) spoke of the psychosocial hazards of aged care,
including personal attachment to elderly people who will
inevitably pass away.

   In addition to industry-based differences, distinct
segments of worker population can be disproportionally
exposed to psychosocial hazards (Lovelock, 2019). In
2021 a national survey of the New Zealand working
population (n = 3612) identified on average that 35% had
been exposed in the prior year to `offensive behavour'
including bullying (23%), cyberbullying (16%), violent
threats (14%), sexual harassment (11%), and physical
violence (11%). Colleagues and/or customers could be
perpetrators of psychosocial hazards. However, within this
same survey, Mori and Pacific workers reported higher
levels of exposure to psychosocial hazards comparable to
the entire New Zealand worker population. For example,
bullying was experienced by Mori and Pacific at a rate
of 28%, compared to 23%, and physical violence was
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 195

reported by 17%, versus 11% of respondents (Khieu et
al., 2021). Global populations experience psychosocial
hazards at different rates as well, for example violence at
work is more likely to be experienced by women than men
(see Box 9.3).

Safety Hazards

Safety hazards comprise hazards that may not easily fall
into the above categories but do create conditions that lead
to safety incidents, and according to America's National
Association of Safety Professionals are:

   Tripping and slipping hazards, including spilled liquid, cords
   running across the floor and blocked aisles. Working from
   any raised work area, including roofs, scaffolding and
   ladders. Moving machinery parts and unguarded machinery
   that a worker can accidentally touch. Electrical hazards,
   including improper wiring, missing ground pins and frayed
   cords. Confined spaces. Hazards related to machinery,
   including boiler safety and the improper use of forklifts.
   (National Association of Safety Professionals, 2018, para.
   22)

One safety hazard that requires particular attention is
working alone which is "work is done in a location where
the employee can't physically see or talk to other staff
members" (Ministry of Business, Employment and
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 197

Innovation, n.d.c, para. 1). This can occur both within a
workplace (see Working Alone Example 1) and outside
of workplace, given PCBUs are responsible for work
wherever it is being undertaken (NZ Parliament, 2015;
Safe Work Australia, 2023). Identifying hazards in
potentially unknown worksites poses significant
challenges (see Working Alone Example 2).

Working Alone Example 1: In a workplace setting

In Australia in 2013, Mr Vijay Singh died from organ
failure, caused by hypothermia, after being trapped in a
commercial freezer. He was inadvertently working alone
when his co-workers all went on lunch break without him
(Coroner NSW, 2015). The Swiss Cheese Model of safety
incident causation is applied to this incident below.

Active Failure:

         · Mr Singh has poorly manoeuvred the forklift
            truck when moving stock into a freezer, leading
            to him being trapped in the freezer by products
            and the forklift truck.

                                            CC0

Latent conditions:

         · Mr Singh was hired via a labour hire company
            to pack products. A job change led to him using
            a forklift and working in the commercial freezer
            without additional training.

         · While the company had a forklift policy, Mr
            Singh did not have a forklift licence. Different
            staff members assumed that another had
            checked that Mr Singh had a forklift licence.

         · The incident occurred on a Saturday. The site
            did not usually operate on a Saturday, there were
            fewer staff than usual, and the main supervisor
            left the site at 12.30pm.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 199

         · Mr Singh became a lone worker, but this was
            unintentional. The three other packers on site
            went on a lunch break together at approximately
            1.30pm and returned to work at 2pm.

         · The other workers decided to finish for the day
            at 2.30pm and realised they had not seen Mr
            Singh. It was at this point that they discovered
            Mr Singh trapped in the freezer and called
            emergency services. They tried to turn off the
            freezer but did not know how and the company
            was not answering their phones (as it was a non-
            standard workday).

In this case, there are administrative errors, such as not
checking for a valid forklift truck licence, through to
procedural ones around working in freezers. Moreover,
the emergency response procedures were lacking also with
the workers being unable to turn off the freezer and the
company not being available by telephone to advise them
how.

   Ironically, less than an hour earlier there had been a near
miss. Mr Singh had poorly manoeuvred the forklift truck
and called for help. All the workers then collaborated to
re-align and free-up the forklift, which had become stuck in
the freezer. Sadly, once working alone, that one remaining
layer of safety defence (access to the other workers) was
not available and Mr Singh's calls for help went unheard,
leading to his death.

Working Alone Example 2: Outside of a workplace setting

The disappearance of real estate agent Yanfei Bao, on the
19th July 2023 in Christchurch New Zealand, has raised
200 Lynnaire Sheridan

concerns for lone workers undertaking work outside of
workplace settings.

            Figure: A real estate agent is showing a property to a client
           Source: RDNE stock project, pexels.com, pexels free licence

Ms Bao was door-knocking to expand her client base.
Unfortunately, while undertaking this work activity, she
was abducted and, after some hours, her car was found
abandoned in a suburb different to where she was doing her
work. A person was arrested for murder despite her still
being missing (Radio New Zealand, 2023).

   Off-site client engagement is common in real estate
work, according to the Real Estate Institute's Jen Baird, it
is "a fairly standard part of real estate, and lots of people
still do it and do it perfectly safely. It's a great way to
meet people and engage with their communities" (Radio
New Zealand, 2023, para. 5). The challenge is then how to
ensure a workers can undertake this activity safely and, if
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 201

not, whether a PCBU can expect a worker to engage in this
activity.

Workplace Hazards

The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety
(2023) uses this category to classify some hazards that do
not easily fit within other categories but are workplace
related including indoor air quality, scents or odours,
weather (temperatures, lighting and storms) etc.

   In concluding, the overall purpose of hazard assessment
is to produce an exhaustive register of work-related
hazards, no matter where that work occurs. Once this has
been established, the next required step is to determine the
risk associated with each hazard and this is achieved via
risk assessment.

Implementing: Risk Assessment

Having learned the importance of hazard identification,
and some tactics to compile a thorough list of potential
sources of harm in the workplace, it is now time to
understand how to assess WHS risk.

   Learning Objectives

      This chapter explains:
              · The objective of WHS risk assessment.
              · The difference between likelihood and
                 probability.
              · Risk assessment techniques.
              · The important role of workers in risk
                 assessment and Safety I versus Safety II
                 approaches.

Risk assessment identifies, for each hazard, the "likelihood
and consequence of injury or harm occurring" (Standards
Australia & Standards New Zealand, 2001, p. 5). What
do risk assessment tools do? They aim to facilitate the

                                     203
204 Lynnaire Sheridan

ranking of the likelihood, and consequences, of an
interaction between the hazard and workers, plant and/or
the environment.

Consequence

In risk analysis, it is useful to begin by connecting hazards
with their potential harm. Wide-reaching tools, such as
brainstorming and using scenarios (see Box 10.1), are
useful to understanding the hazard's potential behaviour in
different work contexts and conditions.

Beginning broadly, and working down to task-specific risk
assessments, is only achievable through extensive worker
consultation. What the workplace looks like, and how the
hazard behaves, can be different. In Risk Assessment
Example 1, seeking to understand the consequence of
sunlight exposure leads to consideration of sun sensitive
workers, sunstrike and, following a conversation with a
worker, discovers a range of unexpected potential hazards
that may have been left undiscovered should worker
consultation have not have occurred.

Risk Assessment Example 1: Exposure to sunlight (and the
Glastonbury Festival!)

Due to public health efforts, awareness of common harms
(consequences) of exposure to sunlight, such as UV
exposure being linked with skin cancer, are relatively well
known. However, some people are more sensitive to
sunlight than the general population and "a medical
assessment may be required to assess whether an offer
of employment is in the mutual interest" (The University
of Queensland, 2022, Section 3.0). If already employed,
reasonable adjustments to roles may be required if
206 Lynnaire Sheridan

prolonged sun exposure is currently a requirement of the
job.

   Through brainstorming and the use of scenarios, workers
may identify less commonly known risks specific to their
work team that make a usually controlled hazard,
hazardous for them--such as sunstrike (see Figure 10.1).
Waka Kotahi (the New Zealand Transport Agency)
identifies sunrise and sunset as "a very dangerous condition
to drive in" as the sun is low in the sky and usual hazard
controls, such as a vehicles sun visors, are ineffective
(Waka Kotahi, n.d., para. 1). Between 2013 and 2017,
sunstrike-related crashes led to 21 deaths and 780 injuries
(Tischler, 2018).

British bakery delivery driver Steve Thomas begins his
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 207

shift at 1.15am and concludes his shift at 11.30am
(Empson, 2021); this potentially exposes him to sunstrike
every single day. Sunstrike will also be seasonally
impacted, it will be worse in winter when the sun is lower
in the sky expanding the sunstrike window for a longer
period each day (Tischler, 2018). However, further
discussion (worker consultation) with Steve reveals other
task-specific risks and uncovers a particularly an
unexpected one: the Glastonbury Festival! What could a
music festival have to do with risk to a bakery delivery
driver?

Paul Empson, General Manager of Bakers Basco, rode
along with Steve Thomas for the day and discovered:

   For Steve, the early mornings are becoming more
   challenging as he gets older. Road rage among car drivers
208 Lynnaire Sheridan

   has increased over the years and he notes that, with people
   more and more in a hurry these days, there is a lack of
   tolerance generally on the roads towards fellow drivers.
   Added to that, the carnage caused on the roads of Steve's
   route around Glastonbury each year has a knock-on effect
   with delivery times and additional hours due to heavy
   traffic. (Empson, 2021, para. 18)

Spending time with Steve has revealed 1) potential age-
related fatigue (see Medical University of South Carolina,
2023), 2) a psychosocial hazard, road rage, and 3) that
the Glastonbury Festival creates traffic congestion which
likely would amplify Steve's fatigue, his exposure to road
rage and contact with drivers heading for the festival who
may be less familiar with the roads.

   It is only by taking a broad approach that unique, job
specific, risks of harm can come to be understood.
Sometimes at this stage, like in this example, additional
hazards will be identified, and these will need to be added
to the hazard register.

Likelihood

Once all possible potential links between a hazard and
a consequence are identified, it is time to focus in on
assessing the likelihood of the consequence occurring.
Broadly speaking there are three types of risk assessment:
large scale assessment "for large scale complex hazard
sites", required specific assessments "that are required
under specific legislation or regulations" or general
assessments as part of due diligence to comply with WHS
legislation and WHS regulator expectations (Safety
Culture, 2023, para. 8). Large scale assessment will
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 209

probably require risk assessment specialists. The accuracy
and effectiveness of required specific assessments and
general assessments will benefit from authentic worker
engagement during the consultation process and this could
even extend to include worker consultation on the choice
of risk assessment tools to be adopted for the task.

   No matter the specific tool, this aspect of risk assessment
is focuses on the `likelihood' that the consequence of the
hazard interacting with the workers, plant or environment
will be harm. The likelihood of the harm occurring is
ranked from low to high (see Table 10.1). The magnitude
of the potential harm is then usually described and
classified according to its severity from low to high (see
Table 10.2).

At this point, some organisations will combine the
consequences and likelihood scales together into a table.
Some of the tables propose that consequence severity and
likelihood be added together (summed) whereas others
suggest that they are multiplied (as per Table 10.3).

   Table 10.3: Hazard prioritisation (likelihood x severity)

Other organisations will prefer to generate a risk matrix
(see Figure 10.3). In a risk matrix, the low probability-low
severity are often represented in green to infer these risks
do not merit hazard control. High probability-high
severity risks are often red to infer they are unacceptable
risk and that hazard control efforts must be taken. Finally,
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 211

there will be risks, often represented by yellow or orange,
that are medium risks. Medium risks are assumed to be
ones that can be managed using an As Low As Reasonably
Practicable (ALARP) or So Far As Is Reasonably
Practicable (SFAIRP) approach (Wolters Kluwer, n.d.).

       Source: Lynnaire Sheridan, modified from Vector Solutions (2019)

The key challenge for Table 10.3 and Figure 10.3 is that
they are fundamentally built on the flawed assumption that
likelihood is objective and that matrices objectively
calculate priorities for actioning. These two assumptions
can result in risk management errors that have led to large-
scale critical incidents.

Assumption error 1: Likelihood is objective, like
probability

It is vital to understand that collective negotiation of the
likelihood that a particular hazard will cause an identified
corresponding harm is a subjective, not an objective,
decision. While data may inform some aspects of the
likelihood of occurrence, often it requires speculation of
the timeframe and/or likely severity of the consequence; it
is not based on mathematical or statistical probability.
212 Lynnaire Sheridan

   Many different factors can impact on individual risk
perception including a person's pre-disposition towards
optimism or pessimism (optimists reduce the likelihood of
the risk and pessimists the inverse), how numerate they
are (more numerate people use data better and tend to be
less risk biased), personal experience (lived experience of
harm increases perceived likelihood of the risk), control
over the risk (uncontrolled risks are perceived as more
dangerous) and mood (angry people experience reduced
risk perception and fearful individuals have amplified risk
perceptions) (Ferrer & Klien, 2015). Likelihood is not
a fixed value but it is instead based on the perceived
likelihood as generated collaboratively by the stakeholders
involved, based on what they know and what they perceive
at that time.

   In summary, likelihood is "the chance that something
will happen" (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d., para. 1) and
is not the same as mathematical probability (see Porter,
n.d.). This distinction is important in safety management
as the term likelihood should be used instead of probability
because the actual probability of when a hazard will
generate a particular harm is currently
incalculable. However, risk tables and matrices
complexify the misconception of likelihood as probability
because often qualitative perceived likelihood is presented
on rating scales using numbers (see Tables 10.1 and 10.2).
It is then tempting to generate an overall `sum', or simple
multiplication (see Table 10.3) of likelihood and
consequence but, as explained above, likelihood is based
on risk perception rather than risk probability. There are
no `real' numbers assigned to risk matrices and therefore it
is not possible to do calculations using it (Wolters Kluwer,
n.d.).

Assumption error 2: Matrices (or tables) reflect the

`actual' priority

Risk tables or matrices are perceived as effectively ranking
the risks of hazards from high to low, in many cases this is
simply not true. Consider Table 10.3 Hazard prioritisation
(likelihood x severity), it is based on the mathematical logic
of one organisation's online risk assessment tool (it will
remain anonymous as it is erroneous). Hazard Example
1, the high likelihood-high consequence hazard, achieved
a risk assessment score of 25. Hazard Example 2, the
medium likelihood-medium consequence hazard, achieved
a risk assessment score of 9. Hazard Example 3, the low
likelihood-high consequence hazard, achieved a risk
assessment score of 5. Figure 10.3, the risk matrix, ranks
hazards similarly.

   The flaw is that both Table 10.3 and Figure 10.3 place
the lowest priority for action on low probability-high
consequence events. Poorly designed tables and matrices
inadvertently lead to low probability-high risk critical
incidents being completely overlooked (Wolters Kluwer,
n.d.). This was one of James Reason's insightful
discoveries when investigating large-scale WHS incidents
and why they were still occurring despite the existence
of functional safety management systems (Reason, 1997),
Hudson also mentions this in his video (see Chapter 6).
Dekker proposes improper use of risk tools has focused
organisations on resolving less complex hazards.
Ironically when a organisation succeeds "in lowering a
non-serious injury incident rate [it] definitely puts an
organization at greater risk of accidents and fatalities"
(Dekker, 2018, p. 8). Due to their flaws, efforts are being
made to create and implement alternatives to risk matrices
in the field of risk assessment (see Box 10.2).
214 Lynnaire Sheridan

          Box 10.2: Developments in risk assessment

          Adequately capturing low probably-high risk
       hazards for meaningful consideration during risk
       assessment is a challenge, one which is beyond the
       capabilities of risk matrices. Ortwin Renn presents
       an alternate model for risk assessment (German
       Advisory Council on Global change, 1998). His
       approach seeks to move beyond likelihood and
       probability, to adequately consider what acceptable
       risk actually is (reasonably practicable) from a
       societal perspective (Government Office for
       Science, 2011).

          Through the German Advisory Council on Global
       Change, Renn proposes six risk classes (assigned
       names from Greek mythology) derived from nine
       overarching concerns derived from experts and the
       general public: "extent of damage, probability of
       occurrence, incertitude, ubiquity, persistency,
       reversibility, delay effect, violation of equity and
       potential of mobilization" (Government Office for
       Science, 2011, p. 42). Risk class descriptors
       encapsulate the characteristics of the risk challenges
       they represent:

                    1. Damocles. Risk sources that have a

                           very high potential for damage but a
                           very low probability of occurrence. e.g.
                           technological risks such as nuclear
                           energy and largescale chemical
                           facilities

                    2. Cyclops. Events where the
ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 215

      probability of occurrence is largely
      uncertain, but the maximum damage
      can be estimated. e.g. natural events,
      such as floods and earthquakes.

 3. Pythia. Highly uncertain risks, where

      the probability of occurrence, the extent
      of damage and the way in which the
      damage manifests itself is unknown due
      to high complexity. e.g. human
      interventions in ecosystems and the
      greenhouse effect

 4. Pandora. Characterised by both

      uncertainty in probability of occurrence
      and the extent of damage, and high
      persistency...e.g. organic pollutants and
      endocrine disruptors.

 5. Cassandra. Paradoxical in that

      probability of occurrence and extent of
      damage are known, but there is no
      imminent societal concern because
      damage will only occur in the future.
      There is a high degree of delay between
      the initial event and the impact of the
      damage. e.g. anthropogenic climate
      change.

 6. Medusa. Low probability and low

      damage events, which due to specific
      characteristics nonetheless cause
      considerable concern for people. Often
      a large number of people are affected
      by these risks, but harmful results
      cannot be proven scientifically. e.g.
216 Lynnaire Sheridan

                           mobile phone usage and
                           electromagnetic fields. (Government
                           Office for Science, 2011, p. 42)

          Firstly, these descriptors appear conceptually
       translatable to smaller-scale organisational scenarios
       despite being designed to address global
       environmental risk. Secondly, low probably-high
       risk situations become clearly visible for
       consideration. Renn explains that the descriptors
       are particularly useful to reduce the "gap between
       the layperson's risk perception and expert risk
       analysis" (Renn & Klinke, 2004, p. S44).

          If adopting this perspective, risk assessment is
       conceptualised as the probability of occurrence
       versus the extent of damage (see Figure 10.4). The
       goal of this model is to recognise which class a risk
       scenario falls into and, ideally, to move it from the
       outer intolerable area towards the normal areas so it
       can be managed on a day-to-day basis (the hazard is
       `controlled'). Their model is based on the premise
       that risks can shift classes as their threat is
       downgraded, for example Pythia can downgrade to
       Cyclops through the implementation of risk
       management strategies (German Advisory Council
       on Global change, 1998).

                          Council on Global Change

   Alongside of their model, to actually enhance risk
management, Renn and Klinke (2004) suggest
management strategies appropriate for each class of
risk (see Table 10.4). They propose that Damocles
and Cyclops respond best to science-based
management. Pythia and Pandora require
application of precautionary principles. Cassandra
and Medusa risks should be managed via discursive
approaches. Notably, discursive approaches are a
more transparent approach to risk management
218 Lynnaire Sheridan

       compared to matrix tables and their numerical
       scales that infer objectivity, while actually being
       based on the perceived likelihood attributed by
       stakeholders when engaging in risk assessment in
       any given workplace at any given time.

   While Renn's approach may not entirely be
relevant to WHS, or applicable at the scale of an
organisation, its philosophical premise is useful
when critiquing risk assessment tools to ensure that
they are robust in the prioritisation of risk.

Risk assessment in the field

Due to change blindness, it is important before a worker
begins a task that they undertake a quick risk
re-assessment. While a formal risk assessment for their
workplace hazards should have already taken place, via
the processes outlined above, things can and do change in
the workplace. Changes relevant to a worker's safety need
to be noticed, and acted upon, to ensure the risk that a
hazard poses remains stable day to day (with the exception
being when the safety management system identifies an
opportunity for improved hazard control).

   Hazard identification, and then risk assessment, may be
required `in the field' for workers who undertake their
work in different environments. While they should be
familiar with the hazards that their equipment poses,
requiring risk re-assessment, it is important that they pause
to consider what hazards exist in their less-familiar
surroundings. Two risk assessment tools that are often
used in the field are Take 5 and Checklists (see Box 10.3).

          Box 10.3: Tools for worker risk assessment `in
       the field'

          This video explains two risk assessment tools,
       Take 5 and Checklists, that are particularly useful
       for workers who undertake work outside of regular
       workplaces i.e. `in the field'.

It must be acknowledged that, in this context, risk
assessment is heavily dependent on the worker
authentically engaging. Dekker (2018), in Safety Anarchy,
warns that these types of procedures become bureaucratic;
in a worst-case scenario they might even be designed at
head office and pushed out to work sites leading to worker
skepticism (see Box 6.3). Risk assessment by workers
of their work is heavily reliant on this procedure being
embedded within a functional safety culture. Box 10.4
presents one company's clever solution when seeking to
raise up their safety culture and communicate their new
expectations to their employees. Effectively, it expects
workers to engage in informal risk assessment and,
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 223

importantly, to take action to reduce the risk posed by the
hazard.

       assessment training

          This is a safety culture training video designed
       to encourage staff to risk assess their environment
       and take action, where possible, to reduce potential
       worker interactions with hazards through `good
       housekeeping`.

Risk signage

Risk signage is designed to raise the awareness of staff
(and potentially visitors) to a hazard in their immediate
environment and usually communicates a common
consequence caused by that hazard with graphics used to
overcome any language barriers (see Figure 10.5).

                   Figure 10.5: Hauteur reduite [Reduced Height]

                                       BY-NC-SA 2.0

Many will be fixed signs whereas others are portable if the
hazard is only present occasionally, such as Figure 10.6 for
use only when the floor is wet.

                         International, flickr.com, CC BY 2.0

Finally, some other signs simply state the hazard as being
present, in this case a toxic gas is used at this workplace
(see Figure 10.7).

Tabal et al. (2023) found that safety signage is most
accurately interpreted, and effectively used, when workers
have undertaken general safety training as well as sign-
specific training. Moreover, use of signs improves as
workers age and/or acquire greater work experience. So
while signs inform workers of the hazards, adherence to
their message is enhanced when organisations also educate
and train workers on the purpose of signage.

Safety I versus Safety II

In concluding this chapter, it is important to discuss Safety
I versus Safety II. The transition from Safety I to Safety II
is fundamentally a shift in mindset from focusing on what
went wrong in an incident (Swiss Cheese Model) to what
goes right day to day. It extends beyond considerations
of safety culture (Reason, 1997; Hudson, 2007) towards
a much more worker-centric approach to safety
management, perhaps returning back towards Weick &
Sutcliffe's (2001) discussions of the mindfulness of
workers in high reliability organisations. Safety I's focus
is on people as a source of error, whereas Safety II sees
them as a "resource necessary for system flexibility and
resilience" (Hollnegal et al., 2015, p. 4).

   The shift from Safety I to Safety II is maybe no where
more apparent than as reflected in the certification
standards, as impacting on risk assessment. For AS/NZS
4801:2001 the focus was on taking organisations through
the steps of the safety management system, adopting
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 227

scientific management's task orientation, whereas ISO
45001:2018 diagrammatically (see Figure 6.4) depicts
leadership commitment and workers at the centre of safety
management, reflecting a greater emphasis on human
relations managerial approaches as critical to fostering the
intrinsic worker motivation upon which safety
management has always actually relied.

   The emergence of Safety II recognises that everyone in
the business, no matter their rank or status, must prioritise
safety and take appropriate action in accordance with their
role. In acknowledging the importance of front-line
workers in their own safety, and that of others around them,
we see James Reason's flexible culture (Chapter 6) coming
to life through efforts to balance a system's administration
with `Do' and `Act' (Plan-Do-Check-Act) to achieve
continuous improvement. Whereas Safety I emphasises in
the field risk assessment checklists, Safety II is more likely
to encourage mindfulness, such as Take 5 (see Box 10.3).

   Having completed risk assessment, and having
contextualised its underpinnings during a time of transition
from Safety I to Safety II, the next chapter will focus on
how to control the risk associated with the hazard through
hazard control.

Implementing: Hazard Control

This final hazard and risk chapter focuses on hazard
control, determining "appropriate ways to eliminate the
hazard, or control the risk when the hazard cannot be
eliminated" (Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and
Safety, 2023, para. 6). Here the Hierarchy of Control
conceptual model is presented to control hazards
corresponding to the engineering, procedural and
administrative safety defence layers in our Swiss Cheese
Model (see Figure 8.1) before examining psychosocial
hazards, and other human-related issues, and their
management within the people safety defence layer.

                 practicable, having identified hazards, their
                 risks and potential controls.

Hierarchy of Control

The most important thing to understand when adopting the
Hierarchy of Control is that is should always be undertaken
in a sequential order from top to bottom (see Figure 11.1).
First try to eliminate the hazard: Does the hazard even
need to be present in your workplace? If the hazard is
vital to undertaking work, could it be substituted with a
less dangerous equivalent? If the hazard remains (or even
a substitute is brought in), what guarding or other
engineering solutions can isolate the workers from the
hazard? What administrative controls, such as training, can
ensure that the worker only engages with the hazard when
needed and that they follow the safest possible work
procedures when doing so? Finally, what personal
protective equipment can be used as a final protective
measure?

Using this hierarchy is important because WHS managers
have the greatest control over the upper tiers of the
Hierarchy of Control and the least over the bottom levels.
For example, safety management staff can decide to
substitute one hazard for another, but it is more difficult
to ensure that an individual worker is using their safety
glasses all the time. The emphasis put on planning in
Chapter 7 is partly because it is tempting to get straight into
trying to control hazards without doing things step by step,
however, organisations risk spending lots of money on PPE
for hazards that do not even need to be in their workplace.

Elimination

Inadvertently, sometimes due to inattentional blindness,
hazards are present in our workplace that do not even need
to be there. For example, during hazard identification,
it may be found that there is an old unused piece of
machinery sitting in the corner of the factory floor. While
it may appear harmless, it is unnecessary, and its oily
residues may present a fire hazard. Do you need to have
that ticking timebomb in your workplace or could you have
it properly disposed of?

   Sometimes the hazard might be ergonomic. Via a
workplace risk assessment by an ergonomist, the
positioning of equipment might be shifted to eliminate the
ergonomic risk. In some cases, these types of hazards
will not be able to be resolved this way, and will require
administrative controls, but if you can eliminate the hazard
upstream in the control process, this is best approach.

Substitution

A chemical may be used to clean metal prior to powder-
coating. The chemical currently used may be highly toxic
and poses a substantial risk to workers. Could this
chemical be substituted by another which is equally
effective but less toxic? It is usually not reasonably
practicable to continue to use a highly toxic chemical
if a good substitute is available. Should the price of the
substitute be substantially more, risking the financial
viability of the task, it may be reasonably acceptable to
remain with the current practice, however, some businesses
may decide to eliminate the hazard and outsource that work
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 233

to a specialist business with specialist hazard controls in
place.

Engineering controls
Does your machinery have appropriate guarding to protect
your workers from harm? When importing new
equipment, it is important that thorough risk assessments
are undertaken to ensure that all potential ways that a
worker could be injured by the machine and its operation
are considered. Ideally then, effective engineering controls
can be put in place to inhibit worker contact with hazards,
such as moving parts (see Figure 11.2).

When importing machinery, a similar risk assessment
234 Lynnaire Sheridan

should be undertaken and, in many jurisdictions, it is illegal
to import machinery without safety guards being attached
before supply (Safe Work Australia, 2014); as,
unfortunately, some manufacturers sell safety guarding
separately which discourages their purchase.

   Does your equipment have a clearly marked and
accessible emergency `stop' mechanism (button)? In an
emergency, it is important that machinery can safely, and
quickly, be switched off to reduce further risk of harm
(see Chapter 9, Working Alone Example 1). Can your
machinery automatically stop? See Past influencing the
present for details on a dead man's switch, an automatic
shutoff should an operator lose consciousness.

   Past influencing the present

      It is taken for granted that a power tool, such as a hand
   drill, only works while you hold the button down on its
   handle but this is an engineering hazard control known as a
   `dead man's switch' invented in the 1890s.

   Frank Sprague was an electrical engineer specialising in
trams and railways. One of his inventions, in direct
response to fatalities caused by railway disasters, was the
dead man's switch (Sprague, 1932). This switch requires
the driver to actively, and continually, be in contact with the
device (see Figure 11.4) and when they are not, often due to
a medical episode, it will bring the train to an automatic
halt as the driver has ceased active control over the train
(Newman, 2010).

Note: Engineering controls attempt to address some latent
conditions in the Swiss Cheese Model (see Chapter 5) and
are notionally considered the engineering safety defence
layer in Figure 8.1.
Administrative controls
The purpose of administrative controls is to reduce worker
exposure to hazards via appropriate work practices which
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 237

can include "work process training, job rotation, ensuring
adequate rest breaks, limiting access to hazardous areas
or machinery [or] adjusting [production] line speeds"
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023, para.
9). One such control is a Safe Operating Procedure and
another is a Safe Work Method Statement (see Box 11.1).

   A Safe Operating Procedure (or Standard Operating
Procedure) are guidelines on the most efficient, safest, way
to undertake the work. By standardising approaches to
tasks, "workers don't have to guess what to do next and can
perform tasks efficiently and without danger to themselves
or others. Failure to follow SOPs may cause significant
safety breaches or loss in production and operational
efficiency" (Safety Culture, n.d., para. 1). Again, worker
involvement is important to ensure that uptake of Safe
Operating Procedure occurs, rather than workers feeling
patronised by instruction on simple activities or unrealistic
procedures being expected of workers (see Dekker, 2018,
and Box 6.3).

          Box 11.1: Regulated Safe Work Method Statement
       for High Risk Construction Work

          In addition to a situation requiring a business to
       undertake risk assessment and control, WHS
       regulators have specific requirements for high risk
       hazards and/or work. The Safe Work Method
       Statement for High Risk Construction Work, is an
       example of a support resource created by Safe Work
       Australia to help PCBUs comply with "18 high risk
       construction work activities defined in the WHS
238 Lynnaire Sheridan

       Regulations" (Safe Work Australia, 2020, p. 1). Its
       purpose is:

              To be used if identified as an `administrative
           control' following a Risk Assessment and is a
           document that outlines the `high risk construction
           work' activities to be carried out at a workplace, the
           hazards that may arise from these activities, and the
           measures to put in place to control the risks.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

When no other control measures are possible to implement,
it is important to ensure that workers are wearing protective
equipment that is suitable for their job's tasks.

Managers have the least control over PPE implementation
and compliance. It is useful, therefore, to come up with
engaging ways to create a safety culture that makes
wearing, and remembering to wear, PPE part of `how
things are done around here'. In Box 11.3 Dominion, an
American electrical services company, involve their
workers in producing a video that, through a very catchy
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 241

rap song, helps staff remember in the field safety steps and
PPE use.

          Box 11.3: Safety Rap
          In this video, staff have produced a rap song to
       remind themselves of PPE use and good safety
       practices in the field. It reinforces the organisation's
       safety culture by making safety a social norm.

   It is now important to demonstrate use of the hierarchical
qualities of this hazard control tool. Example 1 applies the
Hierarchy of Control to a lathe machine and Example 2
applies the Hierarchy of Control to a ladder.

Lathes (see Figure 11.5) are tools designed to shape metal
or wood (All Metals Fabricating, 2020). In this example,
we will assume that the lathe is being used in a metal
tool fabrication workshop. While there are many potential
hazards, such as heavily lifting, contact with liquid coolant
etc., as identified by WorkSafe (2017), this example will
only focus on the machine when in operation.

Ladders (see Figure 11.6) are a piece of equipment, with
steps or rungs, allowing people to access heights above the
ground. In this example, we will assume that the ladder is
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 245

being used by professional painters who paint building
facades for a commercial painting business.

                To paint building exteriors, painters need to
                reach all parts of the building, and this

                Applicable:

Substitution    Scaffolding or scissor lifts (see Figure 11.7)
                are likely safer options for painters working
                at height due to their greater stability
                compared to a ladder.

                   It would be ideal if all buildings had their
                own scaffolding, but this is not the case.
                Currently the business cannot afford to own
                and install scaffolding for all the buildings
                they are concurrently required to paint. They
                also cannot afford the time to put up and take
                down a lesser amount of scaffolding.

                   Decision: A scissor lift is hired, as a trial
                to see if it is suitable for the workers, as it
                potentially could quickly position--and re-

               recommendations from the WHS regulator.

                  For example, ensure that workers have
               apparatus that adheres them to the scissor lift
               basket.

In this example, the original hazard is able to be
substituted, however, scissor lifts will have associated
hazards and risks that will then also need to be considered.

   By way of some final comments on the Hierarchy of
Control, its depiction in Figure 11.1 is not the only
conceptual model available. Safe Work Australia (2023),
for example, ranks substitution, isolation and engineering
controls as equally comparable in their hierarchy which
may be a more useful approach in some business settings
(See Figure 11.8).

Finally, but notably, the Hierarchy of Control is not
effective for controlling all types of hazards. Box 11.4
contains a short video outlining when using a hierarchical
approach is useful but also when it is not. Given the
examples outlined above, it is likely that you can see it
appears effective for chemical, ergonomic, biological,
physical, safety, and workplace hazards. Hazard controls
for human factors, including psychosocial hazards, will
now be discussed.

Controlling Human Factors

Taking a blame-the-system approach does not preclude us
from attempting to control human factors. In the Swiss
Cheese Model, the active failure in an incident is usually
comprised by human factors (Reason, 1997). What is
important is to focus on preventing the conditions that
contribute to human error, not on any individual person,
because "everyone can make errors no matter how well
trained and motivated they are. However in the workplace,
the consequences of such human failure can be severe"
(Health and Safety Executive, n.d.-b, para. 1).
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 251

   Human failure, however, is not one thing so different
types of failures can be classified according to if they
are deliberate or inadvertent (see Figure 11.9). The
complexity of human factors is the reason why James
Reason puts such a focus on the latent conditions in the
Swiss Cheese Model because `controlling' individual
behaviour, even within a good safety culture, is the most
difficult type of hazard control to achieve in a safety
management system (Reason, 1997). In essence, both
Performance Influencing Factors and psychosocial
hazards need to be managed.

Controlling for Performance Influencing Factors

Conditions acting upon workers are considered to be
Performance Influencing Factors, "the characteristics of
the job, the individual, and the organisation that influence
human performance. Optimising PIFs will reduce the
likelihood of all types of human failure" (Health and Safety
Executive, n.d.-c, para. 1). Figure 11.8 depicts a logic tree
for human failures derived from Performance Influencing
Factors. Essentially some human failures will be
inadvertent whereas others will be deliberate. Health and
Safety Executive (n.d.-b) explain that inadvertent errors
may result in a slip (a usual action going wrong) or a lapse
(a required action not being performed). Deliberate non-
compliance violations require investigation to determine
if non-compliance is routine (usual), situational (specific
to the context on that day, such as time pressures) or
exceptional (rule breaking to solve an unexpected
problem).

                                          para. 1).

Performance Influencing Factors, and their controls, are
perhaps best understood via examples. The first example
will explore worker fatigue (likely an inadvertent error)
and the second discusses the influence of drugs or alcohol
on work (likely deliberate non-compliance).

Performance Influencing Factor Example 1: Fatigue

Fatigue may be defined as "weariness or exhaustion from
labor, exertion, or stress" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.-a, para.
1). It is identified as having an impact on "physical,
mental, cognitive, emotional, and motivational
functionality" (Billones et al., 2021, p. 8). It is a hazard
because "the negative effects of fatigue range from losses
or productivity at work due to medical disability,
occupational hazards, deaths from medication errors, and
suicidal ideation (Billones et al., 2021, p. 1).

To identify fatigue requires a risk assessment of staff and
considering what is currently known about the causes of
fatigue. For example, there is research that clearly links
shift work with fatigue (Shen et al., 2006) and shift workers
are likely to be an easily identifiable cohort in your worker
population. In contrast, fatigue derived from outside of the
workplace may be more difficult to identify (see Figure
11.11).

Currently, the most common ways to identify worker
fatigue (in New Zealand) is via employee surveys and
training managers to identify it in workers (Business NZ,
2021). Where there is a good reporting culture, supported
by a just culture that will not blame the worker, these tools
might be useful to identify work or home related fatigue.
Increasingly however, organisations are seeking to address
it as part of a broader wellbeing programme alongside
of flexible work arrangements, employee assistance
programmes (such as counselling) and even health food
initiatives (Business NZ, 2021).

   Fortunately, WorkSafe explain:

   PCBUs don't have the sole responsibility to manage fatigue at
   work. Workers must take reasonable care of their own health and
   safety...Workers should: turn up in a state fit to work...inform
   your manager or supervisor if a task is beyond your
   capabilities...recognise the signs and symptoms of
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 255
   fatigue...communicate with your manager and report fatigue-
   related incidents. (WorkSafe, 2017, para. 31)

          Performance influencing factor assessment:
          Fatigue is likely to be an inadvertent error,
       potentially leading to either action error, a slip or
       lapse, or a thinking error, a rules-based mistake or
       knowledge-based mistake (see Figure 11.9).

Performance Influencing Factor Example 2: Drugs and/or
alcohol

Worker drug and alcohol consumption can impact on
workplaces as it causes absenteeism (reduced work
attendance) and presenteeism (reduced work performance
when attending at work). Presenteeism costs businesses up
to four times more than absenteeism because it generates
impacts such as "reduced productivity and quality of work,
job errors, injury, the negative effect on co-workers,
inefficient use of resources and damaged property amongst
others" (Sullivan et al., 2019, p. 543).

                                    Pexels free licence

While drug and alcohol testing to determine if employees
are fit to work might appear the best solution, as a medical
procedure it requires careful (including legal
consideration). Notably in the New Zealand context,
"generally an employer may only ask employees and other
workers to agree to alcohol or drugs tests if this is a
condition of their appointment and in the employment
agreement or workplace policies" (Ministry of Business,
Employment and Innovation, n.d-d). The Ministry of
Business, Innovation and Employment refer employers to
the International Labour Organization's Code of Practice
on the management of alcohol and drug-related issues in
the workplace (see ILO, 1996) for further guidance.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 257

          Performance influencing factor assessment:
          Drugs or alcohol being present in a worker's
       system is likely to be deliberate non-compliance
       which is either a routine, situational or exceptional
       violation of workplace policy (see Figure 11.9).

Controlling psychosocial hazards

In contrast to human failures, caused by Performance
Influencing Factors on an individual, psychosocial
hazards tend to be generated by conditions in the
workplace (recall examples such as lack of role clarity or
poor organisational justice or bullying from Figure 9.7).
WorkSafe suggest that "effective psychosocial risk
management is dependent on the key agents having
adequate knowledge, relevant and reliable evidence and
effective and user friendly methods and tools, and the
availability of competent experts, services and institutions,
and research and development" (WorkSafe, 2019, p. 60).
Clearly PCBUs must empower competent staff to enact
psychological controls within their organisations.

   A challenge posed by psychosocial hazards is that many
of them can go unnoticed. Safe Work Australia (2022)
explains that physical violence is obvious, others are less
distinguishable in a generally poor workplace culture.
Psychosocial injury flourishes when certain workplace
demographics combine with low workplace diversity in
258 Lynnaire Sheridan

a poor workplace culture. This reinforces statements by
Reason (1998), Hudson (2007) and Dekker (2018) that
a strong safety culture be considered pivotal to WHS
management. It also supports calls from the HR profession
for workplace diversity across gender, age, ethnicity etc.
(Ely & Thomas, 2020).

   Effectively controlling psychosocial hazards requires
organisations to address internal conditions (perhaps
through changing recruitment practices to incorporate
diversity into the workplace) at the same time as putting
specific measures into place including ensuring safe access
to their facilities (protecting staff from uninvited
perpetrators), making all parts of the workplace visible
(ensuring there are no areas where a worker could be
trapped by another person), and controlling workplace
temperatures (literally keeping things cool to keep people
calm). Along side of these can be procedural interventions
(extricating violent clients), through to administrative
strategies, including training to build awareness of
psychosocial hazards among staff (Safe Work Australia,
2022).

   Note: Psychosocial hazard controls attempt to address
some active failures in the Swiss Cheese Model (see
Chapter 5) and are notionally considered the people safety
defence layer in Figure 8.1.

Determining what is reasonably practicable

Once you have identified your hazards, undertaken risk
assessment and devised hazard controls, it is time to
determine what is reasonably practicable to implement.
While an initial safety management budget may have been
260 Lynnaire Sheridan

established, what is reasonably practicable is not simply
costing-out what can be afforded this financial year.
Instead, to ensure due diligence, determining what is
reasonably practicable will require collaborative
discussions between safety staff, workers, representatives
of workers (unions), sometimes WHS regulators and, very
importantly, the senior leadership of the organisation.

   Aligning stakeholder risk perceptions is important
because, no matter the rigour of likelihood and
consequences tools, the resource limitations of
organisation will always demand a moral, values-based,
judgement of what hazard controls are to be actioned,
versus those activities that will be left until the next safety
system cycle or even set aside indefinitely. Given the
critical relationship between leadership commitment
towards safety and safety resource allocation, it is
important to identify that hazard control is constrained by
financial resources. Less committed organisations will
control fewer hazards and expose their workers to greater
risk of harm. However, workers should be able to have
a reasonable expectation to safely return home from work
each day.

           Box 11.6: What is reasonably practicable?

          Through a process of aligning stakeholder risk
       perceptions, decisions can be made that prioritise
       hazard control according to the likelihood and
       severity of an incident within the organisation's
       logistical and budgetary constraints. The
                   ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 261

    organisation then progresses its safety management
    based on what is reasonably practicable at that point
    in time. This is the focus of the following video.

   understanding of hazard identification, risk assessment and
   hazard control concepts as introduced across Chapters 9, 10
   and 11, and see how your learning is progressing.

   In concluding this discussion of hazard controls, it is
important to point out that implementing controls for all
identified hazards will take time. Workers will continue
to be exposed to an unacceptable risk levels until the
organisation is able to implement hazard controls. This
is why the next chapter is focused on how to achieve an
effective emergency response, and how to escape a hazard,
if necessary, to minimise harm.

Implementing: Emergency response

Hazard identification, risk assessment and hazard control
(Chapters 9-11) all focus on strengthening an
organisation's safety defence layers in response to latent
conditions contributing to WHS incidents, as outlined in
Chapter 5's discussions of the Swiss Cheese Model.
Importantly, James Reason emphasises that it is not
possible to control all possible hazards all of the time, so
it is vital to "to provide the means of escape and rescue
should hazard containment fail" (Reason, 1997, p.7). This
is known as an emergence response and is the focus of this
chapter.

   Learning Objectives

      This chapter introduces:
              · The principles behind emergency response
                 planning and procedures.
              · Natural and public disaster management in
                 the WHS context.
              · Real life examples of how WHS
                 management principles have improved actual

                                     263
264 Lynnaire Sheridan

                 emergency responses.
              · The role of effective crisis leadership in

                 WHS.
              · The importance of simulation training to

                 consolidate emergency response planning.

An emergency response may be defined as:

   An immediate, systematic response to an unexpected or
   dangerous occurrence. The goal of an emergency response
   procedure is to mitigate the impact of the event on people,
   property, and the environment. Emergencies warranting a
   response range from hazardous material spills resulting from
   a transportation accident to a natural disaster. (Mishra, 2018,
   para. 1)

   Figure 12.1: Signage indicates the direction of the closest emergency exit

                                Source: pxhere.com, CC0

   A fully functioning WHS management system is
constantly striving to `block the holes' in James Reason's
Swiss Cheese Model and reduce the risk of a serious
incident occurring. When all else fails, however, an
emergency response is our last layer of protection.
Importantly, emergency response protocols extend beyond
WHS boundaries to include first responses to natural
disaster or public disaster situations. The goal of any
emergency response is to reduce injury and loss of life as
the immediate situation unfolds.

   The challenge of natural disasters, public disasters or
even a critical WHS incident is that they are low
probability-high consequence, events (Pearson & Clair,
1998). The following video explains why being prepared
is important but also why it is a challenge to keep our focus
on these unlikely, but potentially catastrophic, events.

          Box 12.1: Video disaster and preparedness
          This video is useful when trying to understand
       preparing for disasters (incidents). While it refers
       to individuals, the same logic applies to businesses
       when planning for natural disasters or WHS
       incidents.

Emergency response plans

So where should we begin? The role of an emergency
response plan is to identify the best response when a
particular situation eventuates. For example, an
emergency response for a fire requires a building
evacuation. This is quite different a lockdown designed
to protect staff from a potentially violent workplace
trespasser. The goal of the emergency response is to
reduce the risk of harm to those immediately threatened by
the hazard.

   Developing an emergency response plan is challenging
because it depends on the number of known potential
hazards and the number of people and/or first responders
who need to be coordinated. However, the alternative is
having no planned response for known potential hazards
which clearly increases the risk of harm to workers and
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 267

site visitors (sub-contractors, customers etc.) as well as
increasing a business' legal liability.

   In the following Contemporary WHS Challenge, Steve
Anderson, former Chief Executive Officer of Foodstuffs
(South Island), discusses the critical role that their
emergency response plan played in responding to the
Christchurch 2011 earthquakes.

   Contemporary WHS challenges - earthquakes

      While Acts of God technically sit outside of WHS
   legislation, natural disasters can and do have many
   impacts on our workplaces and do have WHS implications.
   Particularly with global climate change increasing the risk
   of weather-based natural disasters (United States
   Geological Survey, n.d.; see Figure 12.2), it is important to
   consider how to take the best of our WHS practices and
   apply these when our businesses are engaged in disaster
   management.

      The Christchurch earthquake of February 2011 was a
   natural disaster that immediately caused loss of life, with
   some employees dying at work when buildings were
   damaged, but also immediately generated many hazards for
   the survivors, ranging from unsafe live power cables,
   through to hygiene issues arising from the disrupted water
   supplies and sewerage systems.

   be included or excluded from WHS management (see

Ideally organisations would have designed and well-
practised emergency responses that will reduce any
further potential harm during critical incidents. It is
useful, however, to gain insights from the broader field
of crisis management to inform our understanding of the
specific role of leadership during, and in the aftermath, of
a larger scale critical incident.

Leadership during emergency responses
(Crisis Management)

A crisis maybe defined as "an unstable or crucial time
or state of affairs in which a decisive change is
impending...especially one with possibility of a highly
undesirable outcome" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.b, para. 3).
Ideally, an emergency response would reduce confusion
and focus staff on action during an incident, but even then
the immediate consequences and recovery phase may
prove complex for leaders. Crises are important because
they are low-probability but high-consequence situations
that are time sensitive, and implicitly are high uncertainty
(Pearson & Clair, 1998). These are precisely the scenarios
that are challenging for decision-making, as they invoke
leaders to adopt their heuristics--mental shortcuts to
decision-making that can be implicitly biased (Paulus et al,.
2022)--which may not lead to the best outcomes.

   Eric McNulty is an expert on crisis management who
suggests successful crisis leadership comprises:

       1. A capable team

The leader will surround themselves with a capable team
who are empowered to make valuable contributions
through decentralised decision-making.

   This is important because, under the high task load
conditions established by crises, leaders are vulnerable to
heuristics (Paulus et al,. 2022) and shared decision-making
has been determined to be most effective approach (Kunzle
et al., 2010).

       2. Asking questions
276 Lynnaire Sheridan

The leader will ask questions to get other people's
perspectives and engage them in collaborative problem
solving.

   This keeps the leader informed while, again, ensuring
that they are not impacted by heuristics and other potential
decision-making biases (Thompson et al., 1998).

       3. Having a focus on order, rather than control

The leader will recognise that they cannot fully control the
situation so they focus on order by making sure everyone
knows what is expected of them, and what they can expect
from others.

   When things are `out of control' during a crisis it often
activates the amygdala region of our brain. The amygdala
278 Lynnaire Sheridan

can trigger responses including fight, flight, fright, etc.
(Schauer & Elbert, 2010); this does not help leaders, or
their followers, achieve the vital common goals required
for the organisation and its people to survive. While some
leaders might think they need to control everything to
establish stability in crises, this is not achievable (McNulty
& Marcus, 2020). Instead, they must make " a conscious
effort to deactivate [the] amygdala and activate [the]
frontal lobes, the part of [the] brain responsible for rational,
logical, thinking" (Holland, 2023, para. 22). Creating
order--clarity on what to do--might be what is required
to help everyone step out of amygdala activation and back
towards being able to use their executive brain functions,
such as decision-making.

For this successful crisis leadership `recipe' to work, the
leader must maintain the trust of their followers (staff and
other relevant stakeholders who should be collaborating to
move towards a common goal). To do this, they must be
rallying people towards an authentic common goal, they
must have confidence, but it must be paired with humility,
they must communicate the truth and it must be
communicated clearly (McNulty et al., 2019)

          Box 12.9: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's pre-
       lockdown casual communication with the people of
       New Zealand

280 Lynnaire Sheridan

       truth" about COVID-19 case patterns ahead of a
       lockdown (i.e. cases will increase before any
       reduction in infections will occur). Dressed
       informally (arguably a sign of "humility"), she
       conveys "confidence" in what New Zealand can
       achieve during the COVID-19 crisis if everyone
       collaborates to achieve COVID-19 elimination (the
       "common goal").

In contrast, it is common that leaders who hold a narrow
view, end up managing rather than leading, by becoming
overly involved in all decision-making, and becoming task
oriented at the very time people need empathy and
humanity. So McNulty & Marcus suggest, "determine
which decisions only you can make and delegate the rest.
Establish clear guiding values and principles while
foregoing the temptation to do everything yourself" (2020,
p. 4).

Simulated emergency responses

Almost of equal harm to not having an emergency response
plan, is having a plan without training workers on the
actual emergency procedures and rehearsing these
emergency responses under safe, practice, conditions.
Even when we offer drills, some staff will not take this
simulation training seriously, so this type of training works
best when it is embedded in a functional safety culture.
Some staff might be blasé about emergency responses
because they believe their instincts will kick-in and protect
them when faced with a critical situation, but this is simply
not the case. The following video demonstrates that
282 Lynnaire Sheridan

without practice, people can be slow to react during an
emergency response and this increases their risk of
harm.

          Box 12.11: Human behaviour during a fire alarm

   In conclusion, the process you might undertake in your
business to create an emergency response plan will vary,
however, collaboration with staff to identify the hazards
and create workable emergency responses is crucial.
Rolling out initial awareness training and following it up
with simulated emergency response events will enable your
business to, firstly, ensure the emergency response
procedures documented on paper are actionable in practice
and, secondly, make these response procedures memorable
284 Lynnaire Sheridan

for staff should they ever be required in an actual
emergency. Finally, the leadership you demonstrate during
any emergency event will fundamentally shape its
outcome.

13.
Closing the Loop: Measuring,
Evaluating, Reviewing and Improving

The final phase in a safety management system is to `close
the loop' by evaluating safety data to determine the cycle's
safety outcomes, before deciding what is reasonably
practicable to implement in the next safety management
system cycle. This corresponds to the `Check' and `Act'
phases of Plan-Do-Check-Act (see figure 6.4).

   Learning Objectives

      This chapter explains:
              · The expected components of a data-driven
                 safety performance review.
              · The purpose of a safety performance review.

Measurement of safety should be an ongoing process that
is embedded into day-to-day implementation of WHS.
Ideally, if the system was planned well, workers are
continually collecting data as safety activities are
undertaken (input indicators), or as issues arise (output

                                     285
286 Lynnaire Sheridan

indicators), such as reporting a near miss. Input and
output KPIs should then be centralised into a reporting
system that can provide up-to-date insights for safety
management staff via dashboards. However, evaluation
of this data is crucial as data on its own does not generate
insights or invoke action.

   A principal responsibility of WHS systems specialist
staff is to ensure safety performance reviews with senior
leadership are scheduled and incorporated into regular
business reporting cycles. The purpose of this is to ensure
that safety remains a priority for the business, but also to
foster the leadership's commitment to safety and, finally, to
secure the resources required to sustain and enhance safety
initiatives that, in turn, should lead to improved safety
outcomes at the conclusion of the next full cycle of the
safety management system.

   What comprises a safety review? A data-driven
presentation of safety input indicators and output
indicators for that reporting period, perhaps
complemented by anecdotes that demonstrate that the data
reflects impacts on people, culminating in an honest
appraisal of the organisation's performance on hazard
control. Safety management staff would then present their
proposed safety initiatives for the next reporting cycle,
including the resources required to enhance control of
current safety challenges, while quickly addressing new
issues that have emerged across the last cycle of the
system. The safety review would comprise both `health'
and `safety' data.

   The WHS `health' data would include input indicators,
outlining both existing and emerging occupational health
preventative measures, and output indicators, updating
senior leaders on the occurrence of occupational illness
and injury as identified in their worker population. It is a
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 287

time to brief senior leaders on any emerging occupational
disease trends, as identified by public health officials and
communicated to the organisation by the WHS regulator.

   WHS `safety' data would include input indicators, such
as attendance rates at safety training courses or the number
of completed emergency evacuation drills, and output
indicators, including lost time injuries, and injuries
without lost time and near misses (see Chapter 5).
Considering this in the context of Reason's Swiss Cheese
Model (see Figure 5.1), the review considers both active
failures and latent conditions. If the safety system is
functioning well, and no critical incidents occurred, the
safety team will explain how inputs into the safety system
combined with the safety culture to minimise and prevent
losses. This would be an ideal outcome.

   One of the greatest challenges of a successful safety
management system is securing the resources to sustain
and continually improve safety management. It is easy for
senior leaders, despite their moral judgement or business
risk commitment to safety, to become complacent when
safety management is effective in preventing loss within
the organisation. As Wieck & Sutcliffe (2001) advise,
organisations that are most effective at safety management,
such as high reliability organisations, figure out ways
to stay `mindful' and preoccupied with safety failure. If
this can be achieved, your organisation will stay in the
proactive or generative rungs of Hudson's Safety Culture
Ladder (see Figure 6.2). If not, your organisation may
find itself slipping towards a calculative or reactive safety
culture and, longer term, less effective WHS management.

   Notably, organisations that undergo safety system
certification evaluate the rigour of their internal safety
management system through external, independent,
auditing. Some organisations do this to foster their social
288 Lynnaire Sheridan

licence to operate, as it independently demonstrates the
organisation's capacity to manage safety. Other businesses
may undertake certification as a governance practice, as
part of due diligence, in order to ensure safety staff are
accountable for delivery of their process enhancements.
Rarely would the auditing cycle of a standards
accreditation body be as frequent as an organisation's
internal safety management review cycle. This means that
the auditing cycle is overlaid upon the organisation's safety
review cycle and, when these occur, their insights are
pivotal and inform system-level improvements.

   At the end of your safety review, with your leadership
commitment re-affirmed and your budget allocated for the
next cycle in your organisation of WHS management,
according to the PDCA approach, it is time to "take action
based on what you learned" (American Society for Quality,
n.d., para. 3). You would examine, based on insights from
the review, the adequacy of safety policy and procedures
and proceed to enact any required changes. You would
then enter the planning phase of the next safety
management system cycle, before implementing required
changes. Whatever the review timeframe is, continuous
improvement can only be achieved by going through the
safety management cycle and seeking out opportunities
to enhance safety management over and over again (see
Figure 6.1), in recognition that internal and external factors
are constantly acting on your organisation (see Figure 6.4),
potentially creating weaknesses that will develop into holes
in your Swiss Cheese (Figure 5.1). Continuous
improvement is infinite, however, its discussion in this
context of WHS management for HR management must
now conclude.

   This section of the book, Practice: Establishing,
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 289

implementing and closing the loop in a safety management
system, was designed as a conceptual overview of how
organisations can approach the implementation of WHS
safety management systems using a standards-based
approach, while recognising that the specific tools and
techniques that each business will adopt will be based on
factors including the scale of the business, the nature of
the work (ie. level of risk), and the legislative requirements
of the jurisdiction within which the business operates.
These chapters were designed to assist you, as an HR
practitioner, to identify your moral stance on safety and,
most importantly, to determine the level of competency
you need, particularly if further professional development
is required, to competently fulfil your safety management
role within your organisation.

Conclusion

WHS management emerged during the Industrial
Revolution (Chapters 2 and 3) but has evolved from its
domain within labour rights, to be positioned as a business
risk requiring a systems-based approach to manage it
(Chapter 7). Management of occupational health and
incidents was conceptualised using the Swiss Cheese
Model of incident causation. This theory proposes that
when active failures (human error) combine with latent
conditions (safety defence layer weaknesses that may lay
dormant in organisations until an active failure occurs
setting off a chain of events) it culminates in an incident
(Chapter 5). Large-scale, critical incidents, have a
substantial impact on people and businesses; it is these
low probability-high risk events that present a substantial
compliance, operational and reputational risk to
organisations (Chapter 7).

   While latent conditions can be addressed through
safety management systems, the only way to really
achieve effective safety management is via a strong
organisational safety culture (Chapter 6). Safety culture
motivates the `Do' and `Act' in the Plan-Do-Check-Act
(PDCA) continuous improvement cycle (Chapter 10).
From Reason's perspective, it is the learning culture
component of a safety culture that is most important.
Learning from an incident, or most ideally from a near
miss, should identify what to improve but only the culture
can foster the authentic safety improvement required to
reduce risk of an incident (Chapter 6). In examining safety
management implementation, all staff have a role to play

                                     291
292 Lynnaire Sheridan

(Chapters 8-10), but leader commitment to safety is critical
to resourcing safety management and setting the tone of
an organisation's safety culture (Chapter 7). When safety
is not a moral imperative, business risk can be used to
advocate for safety management, however, history cautions
us that labour supply and demand will always play a role
in the overall prioritisation of safety management as a
business imperative (Chapters 2 and 3).

   Fundamentally, as research on high reliability
organisations informs us, when organisations take a moral
stance and intrinsically value the health and safety of their
workers, they stay preoccupied with safety because they
have a strong safety culture that makes safety everyone's
business (Chapter 6). This is reflected in the transition
from Safety I to Safety II, from AS/NZS 4801:2001 to
ISO45001:2018, which now puts people at the centre of
safety management. Keeping people at the centre of WHS
should motivate all we. There should be no death statistics
in WHS, we must remember deaths and injuries are the
devastating consequences of poor business practices on
people.

Glossary

Accident

      An accident which is defined as "something bad that
      happens that is not expected or intended and that often
      damages something or injuries someone" (Cambridge
      Dictionary, 2023, para. 1) or "something that happens
      by chance or without expectation; an event that is
      without apparent or deliberate" (Oxford English
      Dictionary, n.d., para. 6).

Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC)

      New Zealand has universal coverage approach to
      injury "If someone in New Zealand has an accident
      and we cover their injury, we use this money to help
      pay for and support their recovery. This includes
      treatment, health, rehabilitation and support services,
      loss of income or financial help and injury prevention
      in the community" (Accident Compensation
      Corporation, 2018, para. 2). This coverage applies
      to anyone who incurs an injury, including visitors,
      within New Zealand. This compensation is
      administered via the Accident Compensation
      Corporation (ACC).

Accreditation

      Accreditation is formal authorisation by an standards
      organisation permitting the accredited entity (person

                                     293
294 Lynnaire Sheridan

      or business) to certify other businesses against their
      standards (United Kingdom Accreditation Service,
      n.d.).

Active failures

      "Human beings contribute to the breakdown of such
      [complex technological] systems in two ways. Most
      obviously, it is by errors and violations committed at
      the 'shape end' of the system...Such unsafe acts are
      likely to have a direct impact on the safety of the
      system and, because of the immediacy of their adverse
      effects, these acts are termed active failures" (Reason,
      1997, p. 10).

Acts of God

      Acts of God: "The operation of uncontrollable natural
      forces, an instance or result of such forces, frequently
      in the context of insurance" (Oxford Dictionary, 2023,
      para. 3).

American Dream

      Is an aspiration for citizens and those who have
      immigrated to the United States that they can achieve
      the "American Dream of a better, richer, and happier
      life for all our citizens of every rank" (Adams, 1931,
      Preface, para. 2).

As Low As Reasonably Practicable Approach
(ALARP)

      "ALARP is short for 'as low as reasonably
      practicable'. SFAIRP is short for 'so far as is
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 295

      reasonably practicable'. The two terms mean
      essentially the same thing and at their core is the
      concept of "reasonably practicable"; this involves
      weighing a risk against the trouble, time and money
      needed to control it" (Health and Safety Executive,
      n.d.-a, para. 2).

AS/NZS 4801:2001

      AS/NZS 4801:2001 Occupational health and safety
      management systems - Specification with guidance
      for use was agreed to safety management standards
      published in 2001 (see Standards Australia and
      Standards New Zealand, 2001). These standards have
      now been superseded by AS/NZS ISO 45001:2018
      Occupational health and safety management systems
      - Requirements with guidance for use (see Standards
      Australia, 2018).

AS/NZS ISO 45001:2018

      AS/NZS ISO 45001:2018 Occupational health and
      safety management systems - Requirements with
      guidance for use are the currently agreed to
      International Organization for standards safety
      management system standards (see Standards
      Australia, 2018).

Auditing

      "Auditing is defined as the on-site verification
      activity, such as inspection or examination, of a
      process" (ASQ, 2023, para. 1).
296 Lynnaire Sheridan

Biological Hazards

      "Biological hazards are organic substances that
      present a threat to the health of people and other living
      organisms. Biological hazards include:
      viruses...toxins from biological sources, spores, fungi,
      pathogenic, micro-organisms, bio-active substances"
      (ComCare, 2023, para. 1).

Blame the system

      "Theories about the causes of industrial accidents can
      be classified into two broad types: those which
      emphasize the personal characteristics of the workers
      themselves and those which locate the causes in the
      wider social, organisational or technological
      environment. The former approach is conveniently
      termed blaming-the-victim and the latter, blaming the-
      system" (Hopkins & Palser, 1987, p. 26).

Blame the victim

      "Theories about the causes of industrial accidents can
      be classified into two broad types: those which
      emphasize the personal characteristics of the workers
      themselves and those which locate the causes in the
      wider social, organisational or technological
      environment. The former approach is conveniently
      termed blaming-the-victim and the latter, blaming the-
      system" (Hopkins & Palser, 1987, p. 26).

Boston Associates

      Boston Associates is a term coined by Vera Shlakman
      to refer to "a small group of investors from Boston
      were critical to the larger industrial development of
      New England. This group, connected by social and
      blood ties, consolidated wealth and dominated the
      American textile industry during the first half of the
      nineteenth century" (Charles River Museum of
      Industry & Innovation, n.d., para. 1).

         "Men like Patrick Tracy Jackson, Francis Cabot
      Lowell and Nathan Appleton were linked together not
      only because they had made it to the top of Boston's
      elite, but because they wanted to make sure that
      industrial growth did not run amok--that it was
      restrained by traditional values of community, hard
      work, social obligation, and decency." (Charles River
      Museum of Industry & Innovation, n.d., para. 1).

Bottom-up approach

Disciplinary Processes

      "Particularly where employment relationships are
      well-defined and enforceable, discipline and
      grievance processes are the mechanisms for policing
      the relationship and enforcing its terms. Discipline is
      the employer's response to a perceived breach of the
      terms of the relationship by the employee. Grievance,
      in strict definition, is the employee's mechanism for
      addressing an alleged breach of the terms of the
      relationship by an employer" (McAndrew, 2016, p.
      92).

Discrimination

      "Discrimination is the unfair or prejudicial treatment
      of people and groups based on characteristics such as
      race, gender, age, or sexual orientation. The human
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 303

      brain naturally puts things in categories to make sense
      of the world. Very young children quickly learn the
      difference between boys and girls, for instance. But
      the values we place on different categories are
      learned--from our parents, our peers, and the
      observations we make about how the world works.
      Often, discrimination stems from fear and
      misunderstanding. Discrimination is a public health
      issue. Research has found that the experience of
      discrimination--when perceived as such--can lead to
      a cascade of stress-related emotional, physical, and
      behavioral changes" (American Psychological
      Association, 2022, para. 1)

      response to an unexpected or dangerous occurrence.
      The goal of an emergency response procedure is to
      mitigate the impact of the event on people, property,
      and the environment. Emergencies warranting a
      response range from hazardous material spills
      resulting from a transportation accident to a natural
      disaster" (Mishra, 2018, para. 1).

Employee Assistance Programme

      "An employee assistance program (EAP) is a work-

Employment Relationship

      An employment relationship is "the connection
      between employees and organizations through which
      individuals sell their labour to an employer. In
      practice, employment relationships can be short-term
      or long-term, can be governed by informal
      understandings or an explicit contract, and can
      involve workers and organizations of all types. From
      a legal perspective, the laws in each country define
      what is considered an employment relationship
      covered by employment and labour law as well as
      other public policies such as unemployment insurance
      or social security" (Budd, 2016, p. 123).
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 305

      may have the potential to cause harm" (CCOSH,
      2023, para. 4).

Health

      The World Health Organization defines health as "a
      state of complete physical, mental and social well-
      being and not merely the absence of disease or
      infirmity" (World Health Organization, 1946, p. 1).

Heuristics

      "A heuristic is a mental shortcut commonly used to
      simplify problems and avoid cognitive overload.
      Heuristics are part of how the human brain evolved
      and is wired, allowing individuals to quickly reach
      reasonable conclusions or solutions to complex
      problems. These solutions may not be optimal ones
      but are often sufficient given limited timeframes and
      calculative capacity" (Chen, 2023, para. 1).

High Reliability Organizations

      High reliability organisations are distinguished from
308 Lynnaire Sheridan

      other organisations as they have a: "...preoccupation
      with failure, reluctance to simplify interpretations,
      sensitivity to operations, commitment to resilience
      and deference to expertise" (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2001,
      p. 30).

      "Industrial Revolution, in modern history, the process
      of change from an agrarian and handicraft economy
      to one dominated by industry and machine
      manufacturing. These technological changes
      introduced novel wasy of working and living and
      fundamentally transformed society. The process
      began in Britain in the 18th century and from there
      speak to other parts of the world...the United States

      not contain carbon" (John Hopkins Medicine, n.d.,
      para. 6).

International Labour Organization

      The International Labour Organization was created by
      the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 but is now a specialist
      organisation of the United Nations devoted to
      "advancing opportunities for women and men to
      obtain decent and productive work in conditions of
      freedom, equity, security and human dignity"
      (International Labour Organization, n.d., p. 1).

International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

      The ISO (International Organization for
      Standardization) is "is an independent, non-
      governmental international organization with a
      membership of 169 national standards bodies.
      Through its members it brings together experts to
      share knowledge and develop voluntary, consensus-

      "The knowledge economy is a system of consumption
      and production that is based on intellectual capital.
      In particular, it refers to the ability to capitalize on
      scientific discoveries and applied research" (Hayes,
      2021, para. 1).

Labour

      Labour "means any valuable service rendered by a
      human agent in the production of wealth, other than
      accumulating and providing capital or assuming the
      risks that are a normal part of business undertakings"
      (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2022, para. 1).

      "Trade union, also called labour union [particularly
      in the United States], association of workers in a
      particular trade, industry or company created for the
      purposes of securing improvements in pay, benefits,
      working conditions or social and political status
      through collective bargaining" (Encyclopedia
      Britannica, n.d., para. 1). Notably, Trade unions
      emerged in the United Kingdom during the Industrial
      Revolution to protect craftsperson's rights (they
      emerged from original crafts guilds), whereas in the
      United States they drew all workers (skilled and
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 313

      unskilled) together to negotiate labour rights (hence
      these are known as Labour Unions).

Lag (outcome) indicator

      "Outcome indicators refer more specifically to the
      objectives of an intervention, that is its `results', its
      outcome...These indicators, therefore, allow us to
      know whether the desired outcome has been
      generated. It may take time before final outcomes can
      be measured" (World Health Organization, 2014,
      para. 7).

Latent conditions

      "Fallibility is an inescapable part of the human
      condition, it is now recognized that people working
      in complex systems make errors or violate procedures
      for reasons that generally go beyond the scope of
      individual psychology. These reasons are latent
      conditions....poor design, gaps in supervision,
      undetected manufacturing defects or maintenance
      failures, unworkable procedures, clumsy automation,
      shortfalls in training, less than adequate tools and
      equipment - may be present for many years before
      they combine with local circumstances and active
      failures to penetrate the system's many layers of
      defences" (Reason, 1997, p. 10).

Lead (input) indicator

      "These indicators refer to the resources needed for
      the implementation of an activity or intervention.
      Policies, human resources, materials, financial
      resources are examples of input indicators. Example:
314 Lynnaire Sheridan

      inputs to conduct a training course may include
      facilitators, training materials, funds" (World Health
      Organization, 2014, para. 1)

Legislation

      "A law or set of laws suggested by a government
      and made official by a parliament" (Cambridge
      Dictionary, n.d., para. 1).

Likelihood

      Likelihood is "the chance that something will happen"
      (Cambridge Dictionary, 2023, para. 1) compared with
      probability which is "mathematics concerned with the
      laws governing random events, including the
      collection, analysis and interpretation, and display of
      numerical data" (Porter, n.d., para. 1). This
      distinction is important in safety management as the
      term likelihood is used instead of probability because
      the actual probability of when a hazard will generate
      a particular harm is currently incalculable. In WHS
      management then, the term likelihood describes a
      rating that is collaboratively generated by the
      stakeholders involved based on what they know and
      what they perceive at that time - it is their perceived
      likelihood for the risk.

Management

      "Organization, supervision, or direction; the
      application of skill or care in the manipulation, use,
      treatment, or control (of a thing or person), or in the
      conduct of something" Oxford English Dictionary,
      n.d., para. 1).

Medical retirement

"Medical retirement...is different from normal
retirement because after normal retirement the
employee doesn't often work again, after medical
retirement the employee often looks for a different job
that is not limited by the illness or injury" (Ministry
for Business, Innovation and Employment, n.d., para.
16).

   The advantage for an employee of having a medical
retirement is "the reason for leaving will be reflected
in their record of service and in any references that
the employer gives them (rather than dismissal for
incapacity). A medical retirement package may
include a financial payment which can provide some
financial security while the employee gets better and
considers future options. Sometimes a medical
retirement package includes career support, EAP
counselling or medical assistance" (Ministry for
Business, Innovation and Employment, n.d., para.
18).

Metric System

1875 by seventeen countries, including the United

States.        The seven SI base units, which are

comprised of

Length - meter (m)

Time - second (s)
316 Lynnaire Sheridan

         Amount of substance - mole (mole)
         Electric current - ampere (A)
         Temperature - kelvin (K)
         Luminous intensity - candela (cd)
         Mass - kilogram (kg)" (National Institute of
      Standards and Technology, 2023, p. 2).

Middle Ages

      "Middle Ages, the period in European history from
      the collapse of the Roman civilisation in the 5th
      century to the period of Renaissance (variously
      interpreted as beginning in the 13th, 14th or 15th
      century, depending on the region of Europe and other
      factors)" (Encyclopaedia Britannica 2023, para 1).

Modern Slavery

      "Modern slavery is a relationship based on
      exploitation. It is defined by a range of practices that
      include: trafficking in persons; slavery; servitude;
      forced marriage; forced labour; forced marriage, debt
      bondage; deceptive recruiting for labour or services;
      and the worst forms of child labour and is visible
      in many global supply chains. Each of these terms
      is defined in treaties and documents of the United
      Nations and the International Labour Organization"
      (Australian Human Rights Institute, 2019, para. 3)

Moral Judgement

      Moral judgement is the "evaluation of actions with
      respect to moral norms and values established in
      society" (Thoma et. al. 1991 cited in Li et al., 2017, p.
      122).

Natural Disaster

      "A sudden and terrible event in nature (such as a
      hurricane, tornado, or flood) that usually results in
      serious damage and many deaths" (Merriam-Webster,
      n.d., para. 1).

Near miss

      Near misses are "unplanned incidents that occurred
      at the workplace that, although not resulting in any
      injury or disease, had the potential to do so" (Archer
      et al., 2015, p. 86). When contextualised in the Swiss
      Cheese Model of incident causation, they can be
      understood as "an event that could have potentially
      resulted in...losses, but the chain of events stopped in
      time to prevent this" (Wolters Kluwer, n.d., para. 1).

Negligence

      "Negligence, in law, the failure to meet a standard
      of behaviour established to protect society against
      unreasonable risk" (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023,
      para. 1).

Occupation

      Technically occupations are "the activities and tasks
      of everyday life. These include things people do to
      look after themselves, to enjoy themselves, and to
      contribute to the social and economic fabric of their
      communities" (Occupational Therapy Board of New
      Zealand, n.d., para. 1).

         Note: Occupation does not just refer to
      employment.
318 Lynnaire Sheridan

Occupational disease

      Occupational disease is "any illness associated with a
      particular occupation or industry. Such diseases result
      from a variety of biological, chemical, physical, and
      psychological factor that are present in the work
      environment or are otherwise encountered in the
      course of employment" (Kazantzis, 2022, para. 1).

Occupational Epidemiology

      "Occupational epidemiology has the same main goal
      as the broad field of epidemiology: to identify the
      causes of disease in a population in order to intervene
      to remove them. Occupational epidemiology is an
      exposure-oriented discipline; it is thus the systematic
      study of illnesses and injuries related to the workplace
      environment" (Merletti et al., 2014, p. 1577 citing
      Checkoway et al. 2004).

Occupational health

      Occupational health had its modest beginnings in first
      aid and disease controls for high risk heavy industry
      workplaces, such as mines, but gained greater
      recognition in the 1970s when the World Health
      Organization acknowledged its contribution to the
      identification of workplace-derived factors causing
      occupational illness and suggested its remit should
      be broadened to encompass public health. So, today,
      many occupational health specialists have more of a
      public health, and less of an immediate workplace,
      focus (Schilling, 1989).
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 319

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)

      Health and safety at work is known as occupational
      health and safety, workplace health and safety and
      work health and safety. Occupational health and
      safety would appear to be a traditional term which
      is currently less in favour, perhaps, because the term
      occupation is broader than paid work (consider
      occupational therapy). The term workplace health
      and safety then likely emerged to define the focus
      as being on work, as opposed to other types of
      occupation. Today, given the rise of flexible work
      arrangements and the `gig economy', worker safety
      has been clarified in legislation as being the
      responsibility of persons conducting a business or
      undertaking (PCBUs) no matter where their workers
      undertake that work. It is for this reason that this book
      adopts the term work, health and safety.

Occupational Therapy

      "Occupational therapy is the art and science of
      helping people take part in everyday living through
      their occupations" (Occupational Therapy Board of
      New Zealand, n.d., para. 1)

         Note: Occupation in this context is not limited to
      the occupations of work and employment.

Operational risk

      Operational risk "arises from within the corporation,
      especially when the day-to-day operations of a
      company fail to perform" (Kenton, 2022, para. 10).
320 Lynnaire Sheridan

Paternalism

      "The policy or practice of restricting the freedoms and
      responsibilities of subordinates or dependants in what
      is considered or claimed to be their best interests"
      (Oxford Dictionary, 2023, para. 1).

Paternalistic

      "Of, relating to, or of the nature of paternalism;
      practising paternalism" (Oxford English Dictionary,
      n.d., para. 1).

PCBU

      A PCBU, a person conducting a business or
      undertaking, "may be an individual person or an
      organisation. This does not include workers or
      officers of PCBUs, volunteer associations, or home
      occupiers that employ or engage a tradesperson to
      carry out residential work" (WorkSafe, 2019, p. 4).

Performance Influencing Factors

      "Performance Influencing Factors (PIFs) are the
      characteristics of the job, the individual and the
      organisation that influence human performance.
      Optimising PIFs will reduce the likelihood of all types
      of human failure (Health and Safety Executive, n.d.-c,
      para. 1).

Performance management

      Decramer et al. (2021, p. 91) succinctly describe that:
      "Performance management is described as the process
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 321

      of measuring, communicating and managing
      employee performance in the workplace so that
      performance is aligned with the strategy of the
      organisation (Bauer et al., 2020). The HR system of
      performance management comprises a specific
      approach to consistently manage individual
      performance goals (DeNisi & Smith, 2014) and
      consists of multiple related HR practices: planning,
      monitoring, evaluation, and reward of employees'
      performance (Aguinis, 2013; Audenaert et al., 2019)".

Physical hazards

      "Physical hazards are factors or conditions within the
      environment that can harm your health" (Comcare
      2023, para. 1).

Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)

      "The Plan-do-check-act cycle is a four-step model
      for carrying out change. Just as a circle has no end,
      the PDCA cycle should be repeated again and again
      for continuous improvement" (ASQ, 2023, para. 1)
      where the different steps are: "Plan: Recognize an
      opportunity and plan a change, Do: Test the change.
      Carry out a small-scale study; Check: Review the test,
      analyze the results, and identify what you've learned;
      Act: Take action based on what you learned in the
      study step" (ASQ, 2023, para. 3).

Planning

      "The establishment of goals, policies, and procedures
      for a social or economic unit" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.,
      para. 1).
322 Lynnaire Sheridan

Policies

      Policies "are rules and guidelines that define and limit
      action, and indicate the relevant procedures to follow"
      (Heery & Noon, n.d., para. 1).

Probability

      Probability is "mathematics concerned with the laws
      governing random events, including the collection,
      analysis and interpretation, and display of numerical
      data" (Porter, n.d., para. 1).

Procedures

      Procedures are "step-by-step sequences of actions that
      should be taken to attain particular objectives" (Heery
      & Noon, n.d., para. 1).

Productivity

      "At the corporate level, productivity is a measure of
      the efficiency of a company's production process, it is
      calculated by measuring the number of units produced
      relative to employee labor hours or by measuring a
      company's net sales relative to employee labor hours"
      (Kenton, 2023, para. 3).

Prosecution

      "The act of officially accusing someone of
      committing and illegal act by brining a case against
      that person in a court of law" (Cambridge Dictionary,
      n.d, para. 1).
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 323

Protestant ethic

      "The value attached to hard work, thrift, and
      efficiency in one's worldly calling, which, especially
      in the Calvinist view, were deemed signs of an
      individuals' election, or eternal salvation"
      (Britannica, 2020, para. 1).

Psychosocial hazards

      "Psychosocial hazards are aspects of work which have
      the potential to cause psychological or physical harm"
      (ComCare, n.d., para. 1).

Public health

      "Public health is the science and art of preventing
      disease, prolonging life, and promoting physical
      health and efficiency through organized community
      efforts for the sanitation of the environment, the
      control of community infections, the education of the
      individual principles of personal hygiene, the
      organization of medical and nursing service for the
      early diagnosis and preventative treatment of disease,
      and the development of the social machinery which
      will ensure to every individual in the community a
      standard of living adequate for the maintenance of
      health" (Windslow, 1920, p. 30)

Punitive

      "Intended as a punishment" (Cambridge Dictionary,
      n.d, para. 1).
324 Lynnaire Sheridan

Quality risk management

      "Quality risk management is a systematic, risk-based
      approach to quality management. The process is
      composed of the assessment, control, communication,
      and review of quality risks. It is especially critical
      in the pharmaceutical industry, where product quality
      can greatly affect consumer health and safety" (Safety
      Culture, 2023, para. 1).

Reasonable adjustment

      "Reasonable adjustments are changes an employer
      makes to remove or reduce a disadvantage related to
      someone's disability. For example: making changes
      to the workplace, changing someone's working
      arrangements, finding a different way to do
      something, providing equipment, services or support.
      Reasonable adjustments are specific to an individual
      person. They can cover any area of work" (Advisory,
      Conciliation and Arbitration Service, 2022, para. 1).

         Note: Disability can be permanent or temporary.
         In the Australian legal context:
         "The concept of reasonable adjustments reflects the
      understanding that a worker with an injury, ill health
      or disability can often
      perform tasks if adjustments are made to
      accommodate the effects of their injury, ill health or
      disability. The aim of any reasonable adjustment is
      to minimise the impact of the injury, health problem
      or disability to enable the worker to fully take part in
      work-related programs and effectively undertake the
      inherent requirements of their job.
         Workers face many obstacles to participating in a
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 325

      life in work. Reasonable adjustments that support
      someone's ability to work can be effective in:
      > preventing deterioration of health and allowing
      employees with health problems to stay at work
      > enabling employees to stay at work or return to
      work after injury
      > assisting people with a disability to enter and stay in
      the workplace" (ComCare, 2013, para. 1).

Reasonably Practicable

      Australia's Model Work Health and Safety Bill
      defines reasonably practicable as:

         "In this Act, reasonably practicable, in relation to
      a duty to ensure health and safety, means that which
      is, or was at a particular time, reasonably able to be
      done in relation to ensuring health and safety, taking
      into account and weighing up all relevant matters
      including:

         (a) the likelihood of the hazard or the risk
      concerned occurring; and

         (b) the degree of harm that might result from the
      hazard or the risk; and

         (c) what the person concerned knows, or ought
      reasonably to know, about:

         (i) the hazard or the risk; and
         (ii) ways of eliminating or minimising the risk; and
         (d) the availability and suitability of ways to
      eliminate or minimise the risk; and
         (e) after assessing the extent of the risk and the
      available ways of eliminating or minimising the risk,
      the cost associated with available ways of eliminating
      or minimising the risk, including whether the cost
326 Lynnaire Sheridan

      is grossly disproportionate to the risk" (WorkSafe
      Australia, 2023, Section 18).

Regulation

      "Regulations are rules made by a government or other
      authority in order to control the way something is
      done or the way people behave" (Collins Dictionary,
      n.d., para. 1).

Relativisitic

      A relativistic stance is "based on the belief that truth
      and right and wrong can only be judged in relation to
      other things and that nothing can be true or right in all
      situations" (Cambridge Dictionary, 2023, para. 1)..

Reputational risk

      Reputational Risk "Any time a company's reputation
      is ruined, either by an event that was the result of a
      previous business risk or by a different occurrence, it
      runs the risk of losing customers and its brand loyalty
      suffering" (Kenton, 2022, para. 11).

Return to work plan

      "A return to work program is a workplace's written
      plan that focuses on finding meaningful and suitable
      work for workers coming back to the workplace from
      injury or illness. The program should include
      prevention, accommodation, and support for recovery.
      Through collaboration, the goal of the program is to
      have the worker return to their pre-injury or pre-
      illness job, where appropriate, and in a timely
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 327

      manner. The return to work program outlines the
      roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. It is a
      guideline for developing individualized plans for both
      physical and mental injuries. Return to work programs
      can also be used to facilitate accommodations for non-
      work-related injuries" (Canadian Centre for
      Occupational Health and Safety, n.d., para. 1).

Risk (WHS)

      "Likelihood and consequence of injury or harm
      occurring" (Standards Australia & Standards New
      Zealand, 2001, p. 5).

Risk Assessment

      "The purpose of risk assessment is to identify and
      manage hazards to reduce the likelihood of incidents
      occurring" (ACC, 2012, p. 52).

Safe Operating Procedures

      "Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) sometimes
      called a Safe Operating Procedure, outlines a set of
      detailed instructions to help workers perform complex
      tasks properly and safety. Having standard operating
      procedures in place means workers don't have to
      guess what to do next and can perform tasks
      efficiently and without danger to themselves or
      others. Failure to follow SOPs may cause significant
      safety breaches or loss in production and operational
      efficiency" (Safety Culture, n.d., para. 1).
328 Lynnaire Sheridan

Safe Work Method Statement

      WHS regulators sometimes have specific
      requirements for high risk hazards and/or work. Safe
      Work Method Statements are documents "that
      outlines the `high risk ...activities to be carried out at
      a workplace, the hazards that may arise from these
      activities, and the measures to put in place to control
      the risks " (University of New England, n.d., para. 8).

Safety

      Safety is a "state in which the risk of harm (to
      persons) or damage is limited to an acceptable level"
      and risk is the "likelihood and consequence of injury
      or harm occurring" (Standards Australia & Standards
      New Zealand, 2001, p. 5).

Safety Audit

      "A safety audit is a process that is considered the
      gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of
      occupational health and safety programs. Their
      primary purpose is to identify health and safety
      hazards, assess the effectiveness of the measures in
      place to control those hazards, and ensure compliance
      with the Occupational Health and Safety
      Administration's (OSHA) standards. Safety audits are
      conducted by independent audit consultants in order
      to ensure an unbiased review of policies, procedures,
      and safety management systems" (Safeopedia, 2021,
      para. 1).
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 329

Safety culture

      "A culture that supports an organization's OH&S
      management system is largely determined by top
      management and is the product of individual and
      group values, attitudes, managerial practices,
      perceptions, competencies and patters of activities
      that determine commitment to, and the style and
      proficiency of, its OH&S management system"
      (Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand,
      2018), p. 27).

Safety culture ladder (Patrick Hudson)

      Patrick Hudson's health, safety and environment
      ladder conceptualises "a pathway from less to more
      advanced [safety] cultures" (Hudson, 2007, p. 703).
      It sees organisational safety behaviours as ranging
      from pathological, very weak safety cultures, through
      to generative cultures that embody a strong safety
      culture.

Safety Culture theory (James Reason)

      James Reason conceptualises a safety culture as
      comprising "four critical subcomponents of a safety
      culture: a reporting culture, a just culture, a flexible
      culture and a learning culture" (Reason, 1997, p.
      196). By focusing on the development of these
      individual subcomponents, he believes that a safety
      culture will emerge as "ways of doing, thinking and
      managing that have enhanced safety health as their
      natural byproduct" (Reason, 1997, p. 192).
330 Lynnaire Sheridan

Safety I and Safety II

      Safety management is increasingly being classified
      into two eras (or paradigms); Safety I and Safety II.

         Safety I, the dominant safety management
      paradigm from the 1960s into the 2000s, can be
      explained as a safety management approach that
      " presumes that things go wrong because of
      identifiable failures or malfunctions of specific
      components: technology, procedures, the human
      workers and the organisations in which they are
      embedded. Humans--acting alone or
      collectively--are therefore viewed predominantly as
      a liability or hazard, principally because they are the
      most variable of these components" (Hollnegal et al.,
      2015, p. 3). The Swiss Cheese Model of incident
      causation is an artifact of Safety I conceptualisations
      of safety management.

         Safety II has emerged across the 2000s with
      Hollgegal advocating for a shift "from ensuring that
      `as few things as possible go wrong' to ensuring that
      `as many things as possible go right'" (Hollnegal et
      al., 2015, p. 3). Their 2015 white paper "From Safety-
      I to Safety-II" essential coined the two terms and
      explained Safety II as assuming "that everyday
      performance variability provides the adaptations that
      are needed to respond to varying conditions, and
      hence is the reason why things go right. Humans are
      consequently seen as a resource necessary for system
      flexibility and resilience" (Hollnegal et al., 2015, p.
      3).

         In summary, Hollnegal et. al. consider Safety I's
      focus to be on people as a source of error (active
      failures), whereas Safety II sees people as a "resource
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 331

      necessary for system flexibility and resilience"
      (Hollnegal et al., 2015, p. 4).

Safety management system

      A safety management system is " a systematic
      approach to managing safety. It is designed to
      continuously improve safety performance through the
      identification of hazards, the collection and analysis
      of safety data and safety information, and the
      continuous assessment of safety risks" (Civil Aviation
      Authority of New Zealand, 2023, p. 12).

Scientific Management

      Scientific Management may be defined as: "An
      approach to management, based on the theories of
      F.W. Taylor, dealing with the motivation to work. It
      sees it as a manager's duty to find out the best way
      to do a given job, by a process of work measurement,
      then give each worker individual instructions which
      have to be strictly followed. The individual is thus
      seen as the extension of his or her machine, and his
      or her rewards are also to be allocated mechanically,
      with more pay expected to produce more output
      regardless of any other factors" (Statt, 1999, p. 150).

Scientific Method

      "Mathematical and experimental technique employed
      in the sciences. More specifically, it is the technique
      used in the construction and testing of a scientific
      hypothesis" (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023, para. 1,
      Scientific Method).
332 Lynnaire Sheridan

Scientific Revolution

      The Scientific Revolution was a "drastic change in
      scientific thought that took place during the 16th and
      17th centuries. A new view of nature emerged during
      the Scientific Revolution, replacing the Greek view
      that had dominated science for almost 2,000
      years...bringing about the following transformations:
      the re-education of common sense in favour of
      abstract reasoning; the substitution of a quantitative
      for a qualitative view of nature; the view of nature as a
      machine rather than as an organism; the development
      of an experimental, scientific method that sought
      definite answers to certain limited questions couched
      in the framework of specific theories; and the
      acceptance of new criteria for explanation, stressing
      the "how" rather than the "why" that had
      characterized the Aristotelian search for final causes"
      (Spencer et al., 2019, para. 1).

Slave

      A slave is a " person who has the (legal) status of
      being the property of another, has no personal
      freedom or rights, and is used as forced labour or as an
      unpaid servant; an enslaved person" (Oxford English
      Dictionary, 2022, para. 1).

Slave labour

      Slave labour is "labour performed involuntarily and
      under duress, usually by relatively large groups of
      people" (Encylopaedia Britannica, 2022, para. 1).
              ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 333

Slavery

Slavery is "a form of dependent labour performed
by a nonfamily member. The slave was deprived of
personal liberty and the right to move about
geographically" (Encylopaedia Britannica, 2022,
para. 1).

So far as is reasonably practicable (SFAIRP)

"ALARP is short for 'as low as reasonably
practicable'. SFAIRP is short for 'so far as is
reasonably practicable'. The two terms mean
essentially the same thing and at their core is the
concept of "reasonably practicable"; this involves
weighing a risk against the trouble, time and money
needed to control it" (Health and Safety Executive,
n.d.-a, para. 2).

Social Class

Social class is "a group of people within a society
who possess the same socioeconomic status"
(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023, para. 1).

Social license to operate

"The social license to operate (SLO), or simply social
license, refers to the ongoing acceptance of a
company or industry's standard business practices and
operating procedures by its employees, stakeholders,
and the general public. The concept of social license
is closely related to the concept of sustainability and
the triple bottom line" (Kenton, 2023, para. 1).
334 Lynnaire Sheridan

Socialism

      "A theory or system of social organization based on
      state or collective ownership and regulation of the
      means of production, distribution, and exchange for
      the common benefit of all members of society;
      advocacy or practice of such a system, especially as
      a political movement" (Oxford English Dictionary,
      n.d.).

Standard Operating Procedures

      "Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) sometimes
      called a Safe Operating Procedure, outlines a set of
      detailed instructions to help workers perform complex
      tasks properly and safety. Having standard operating
      procedures in place means workers don't have to
      guess what to do next and can perform tasks
      efficiently and without danger to themselves or
      others. Failure to follow SOPs may cause significant
      safety breaches or loss in production and operational
      efficiency" (Safety Culture, n.d., para. 1).

Standards

      Standards are agreed to principles and approaches
      established by panels of experts (International
      Organization for Standardization, n.d.).

Strategic risk

      "Strategic risk is when a business does not operate
      according to its business model or plan" (Kenton,
      2022, para. 8).
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 335

Swiss Cheese model of safety incident causation

      "James Reason proposed the image of "Swiss cheese"
      to explain the occurrence of system
      failures...According to this metaphor, in a complex
      system, hazards are prevented from causing human
      losses by a series of barriers. Each barrier has
      unintended weaknesses, or holes - hence the
      similarity with Swiss cheese. These weaknesses are
      inconstant - i.e., the holes open and close at random.
      When by chance all holes are aligned, the hazard
      reaches the patient and causes harm" (Perneger, 2005,
      p. 71).

System

      "A group or set of related or associated things
      perceived or thought of as a unity or complex whole"
      (Oxford Dictionary, 2023, para. 1).

Top-down approach

      "Used to refer to a situation in which decisions are
      made by a few people in authoriy, rather than by the
      people who are affected by the decisions" (Cambridge
      Dictionary, n.d, para. 1).

Trade Union

      "Trade union, also called labour union [particularly
      in the United States], association of workers in a
      particular trade, industry or company created for the
      purposes of securing improvements in pay, benefits,
      working conditions or social and political status
      through collective bargaining" (Encyclopedia
336 Lynnaire Sheridan

      Britannica, n.d., para. 1). Notably, Trade unions
      emerged in the United Kingdom during the Industrial
      Revolution to protect craftsperson's rights (they
      emerged from original crafts guilds), whereas in the
      United States they drew all workers (skilled and
      unskilled) together to negotiate labour rights (hence
      these are known as Labour Unions).

Train

      "To subject to discipline and instruction for
      development of character, behaviour, or skill" (Oxford
      English Dictionary, 2023, part 11.10).

Treaty of Versailles

      The Treaty of Versailles is a "peace document signed
      at the end of World War I by the Allied and associated
      powers and by Germany in the Hall of Mirrors in
      the Palace of Versailles, France, on June 28, 1919"
      (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023, para. 1).

Triple bottom line

      "The triple bottom line is a business concept that
      states firms should commit to measuring their social
      and environmental impact--in addition to their
      financial performance--rather than solely focusing on
      generating profit, or the standard 'bottom line'"
      (Miller, 2020, para. 5).

United Nations

      "The United Nations is an international organization
      founded in 1945. Currently made up of 193 Member
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 337

      States, the UN and its work are guided by the
      purposes and principles contained in its
      founding Charter. The UN has evolved over the years
      to keep pace with a rapidly changing world. But one
      thing has stayed the same: it remains the one place
      on Earth where all the world's nations can gather
      together, discuss common problems, and find shared
      solutions that benefit all of humanity (United Nations,
      2023, para. 1).

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
(UNSDGs)

      "The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
      adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015,
      provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity
      for people and the planet, now and into the future. At
      its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
      (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all
      countries - developed and developing - in a global
      partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and
      other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with
      strategies that improve health and education, reduce
      inequality, and spur economic growth - all while
      tackling climate change and working to preserve our
      oceans and forests" (United Nations, 2023, para. 1).

Voluntary compliance

      "The act of obeying a particular rule or law, or of
      acting according to an agreement without being
      forced to" (Collins Dictionary, n.d., para. 1).
338 Lynnaire Sheridan

Wellbeing

      According to the World Health Organization: "Well-
      being is a positive state experienced by individuals
      and societies. Similar to health, it is a resource for
      daily life and is determined by social, economic and
      environmental conditions. Well-being encompasses
      quality of life and the ability of people and societies
      to contribute to the world with a sense of meaning and
      purpose" (World Health Organization, n.d, para. 1).

Western

      William McNeill explains that the "west" and
      "western" have different interpretations across history
      and dependent on the particular context: " 'the West'
      in the sense of Western civilization. The first and most
      obvious point to make is that the meaning of the West
      is a function of who is using the word. Those who
      feel themselves to be part of the West-who think of
      the West as "we'`-will surely have flattering things
      to say about their civilization. Those who think of
      the West as the "other" are likely to define it in less
      flattering terms. The basic meaning of the word is
      "where the sun sets"-one of the cardinal directions"
      (1997, p. 513).

         However, at this time in history, western
      "encompassed the Atlantic littoral of Europe (the
      British Isles, Scandinavia, the Low Countries, France,
      and Iberia) plus America. In time, it came to
      encompass Australia, New Zealand, and all other
      European overseas settlements, The West, therefore,
      could be imagined as a civilization independent of
      locale" (McNeill 1997, p. 513 - 514).
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 339

Whistleblower

      "On the simplest level, a whistleblower is someone
      who reports waste, fraud, abuse, corruption,
      or dangers to public health and safety to someone
      who is in the position to rectify the wrongdoing. A
      whistleblower typically works inside of the
      organization where the wrongdoing is taking place;
      however, being an agency or company "insider" is not
      essential to serving as a whistleblower. What matters
      is that the individual discloses information about
      wrongdoing that otherwise would not be known"
      (National Whistleblowers Center, 2023, para. 3).

WHS event

      Three types of potential WHS events that occur at
      different scales and levels of severity:

         "Lost time injuries/diseases: Those occurrences
      that resulted in a fatality, permanent disability or time
      lost from work of one day/shift or more.
      Injuries without lost time: Those occurrences that
      were not lost time injuries and for which first aid and/
      or medical treatment was administered.
      Near-misses: Unplanned incidents that occurred at the
      workplace that, although not resulting in any injury
      or disease, had the potential to do so" (Archer et al.,
      2015, p. 86)

WHS regulator

      In principle, and in accordance with the Australian
      Model Work Health and Safety Bill, a regulator is a
      legally established government body whose functions
      are:
340 Lynnaire Sheridan

         " (a) to advise and make recommendations to the
      Minister and report on the operation and effectiveness
      of this Act;

         (b) to monitor and enforce compliance with this
      Act;

         (c) to provide advice and information on work
      health and safety to duty holders under this Act and to
      the community;

         (d) to collect, analyse and publish statistics relating
      to work health and safety;

         (e) to foster a co-operative, consultative
      relationship between duty holders and the persons to
      whom they owe duties and their representatives in
      relation to work health and safety matters;

         (f) to promote and support education and training
      on matters relating to work health and safety;

         (g) to engage in, promote and co-ordinate the
      sharing of information to achieve the object of this
      Act, including the sharing of information with a
      corresponding regulator;

         (h) to conduct and defend proceedings under this
      Act before a court or tribunal;

         (i) any other function conferred on the regulator by
      this Act"

         (Safe Work Australia, 2023, section 152).

Work

      Work is "the activities and labour necessary to the
      survival of society" (Encylopaedia Britannica, 2018,
      para. 1).

Work health and safety (WHS)

      World Health Organization defines work
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 341

      (occupational) health and safety as "all aspects of
      health and safety in the workplace and has a strong
      focus on primary prevention of hazards" (World
      Health Organization, n.d., para. 1).

         Note: Health and safety at work is known as
      occupational health and safety, workplace health and
      safety and work health and safety. Occupational
      health and safety would appear to be a traditional term
      which is currently less in favour, perhaps, because the
      term occupation is broader than paid work (consider
      occupational therapy). The term workplace health
      and safety then likely emerged to define the focus
      as being on work, as opposed to other types of
      occupation. Today, given the rise of flexible work
      arrangements and the `gig economy', worker safety
      has been clarified in legislation as being the
      responsibility of persons conducting a business or
      undertaking (PCBUs) no matter where their workers
      undertake that work. It is for this reason that this book
      adopts the term work health and safety.

Worker

      A worker is a person undertaking work for a PCBU
      (Safe Work Australia, 2023).

         Note: There are some nuanced legal differences
      between Australia and New Zealand legislation
      definitions of workers.

Worker consultation

      "Good consultation enables workers to respond and
      contribute to issues that directly affect them, and
      provide valuable information and insights. It's a two-
      way process where information and views are shared
342 Lynnaire Sheridan

      between PCBUs and workers. PCBUs can become
      more aware of hazards and issues experienced by
      workers, and involve them in finding solutions or
      addressing problems. Workers often notice issues and
      practices, or foresee consequences, that might
      otherwise be overlooked. PCBUs must genuinely
      consult with workers and their representatives,
      including HSRs, before any changes or decisions are
      made that may affect their health and safety.
      Consultation should take place during both the initial
      planning and implementation phases so that
      everyone's experience and expertise can be taken into
      account" (Safe Work SA, 2023, para. 8).

Workers' Compensation

      "Workers' compensation, commonly referred to as
      "workers' comp," is a government-mandated program
      that provides benefits to workers who become injured
      or ill on the job or as a result of the job. It is effectively
      a disability insurance program for workers, providing
      cash benefits, healthcare benefits, or both to workers
      who suffer injury or illness as a direct result of their
      jobs" (Kagan, 2023, para. 1).

Workers' compensation (Australia)

      "Workers' compensation is a type of insurance that
      can offer you an important safety net if you become
      injured or ill because of work...Under Australian law,
      employers must have insurance to cover their workers
      in case they get sick or injured because of work" (Safe
      Work Australia, 2023, para. 1).
           ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 343

Workplace

"The office, factory, etc., where people work"
(Encyclopaedia Britannica, n.d, para. 1).

Workplace Health and Safety

Health and safety at work is known as occupational
health and safety, workplace health and safety and
work health and safety. Occupational health and
safety would appear to be a traditional term which
is currently less in favour, perhaps, because the term
occupation is broader than paid work (consider
occupational therapy). The term workplace health
and safety then likely emerged to define the focus
as being on work, as opposed to other types of
occupation. Today, given the rise of flexible work
arrangements and the `gig economy', worker safety
has been clarified in legislation as being the
responsibility of persons conducting a business or
undertaking (PCBUs) no matter where their workers
undertake that work. It is for this reason that this book
adopts the term work health and safety.

Transcript Video 1: An introduction to
work health & safety management
(Chapter 4)

While following some basic safety rules at work might be
easy, understanding how to achieve effective Work health
and safety Management is much more complex.

   This resource is designed to help you understand some
key concepts in Work health and safety by exploring some
of the complexities. We will refine important terms in our
context. By exploring the theories we will try to explain
why certain approaches are useful while others lead to
serious injuries for workers.

   So, what is work health and safety management?
   In its simplest sense, WHS management is any action
taken by the company to ensure a safe workplace. This
means protecting the people, plant, and environment from
harm.
   In simple terms, it can be considered the approaches,
processes, tools and techniques used by business managers
to keep their workers safe so they can achieve their work.
   More technically, the World Health Organization
describes it as "all aspects of health and safety in the
workplace and has a strong focus on primary prevention of
hazards."
   But what then is health? According to the World Health
Organisation "Health is a state of complete physical,
mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of
disease or infirmity."

                                     403

   So the `health' in work health and safety is not just
about preventing illness or injury but potentially about
encouraging workers to be well.

   Indeed, wellbeing promotion by business for workers is
an emerging and growing area of work health and safety
management.

   What then does `safety' mean in this work health and
safety management context?

   The World Health Organisation Standards Australia and
New Zealand defines this as "A state in which the risk of
harm (to persons) or damage is limited to an acceptable
level."

   They go on to then define risk as "The likelihood and
consequence of injury or harm occurring."

   This means that an employer is only expected to manage
safety to an `acceptable level' of risk for injury or harm to
occur to their workers. Of course, if you are the employee
who is injured it might be difficult to agree that your injury
was acceptable!!!

   Already you can see that there are complex concepts and
terms that we use every day in undertaking work health and
safety management.

   While it is about safety in a `workplace' even the idea
of what a workplace means is changing and evolving over
time.

   For example, think about people who work for one
company but who are sub-contracted or visiting many
different sites - people who service machinery or perhaps
even consultants. What about those who work a couple of
days a week from home?

   So rather than specifically focusing on defining the
`workplace' in work health and safety today we tend to
focus on the people responsible for health and safety
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 405

management of workers these people are known as PCBUs
(person conducting a business or undertaking).

   Workcover NSW defines this as: "A `person conducting
a business or undertaking' (PCBU) is a legal term under
WHS laws for individuals, businesses or organisations that
are conducting business. A person who performs work for
a PCBU is considered a worker."

   You can see that this definition removes the emphasis
from specifically managing work sites towards thinking
about worker health and safety wherever they are engaged
in their work.

   Under the work health and safety legislation in Australia
it is anyone who "...performs work for a PCBU is
considered a worker."

   This means that not only are permanent and casual
employees workers, but volunteers and contractors and
subcontractors are also classified as workers.

   Also, some employers take their responsibilities one step
further - they have really considered the World Health
Organisation's definition of `health' as being well rather
than be focused on avoiding injury or illness - these
employers actively invest in their employees' wellbeing.
Wellbeing may be considered WHS taken to the next level,
where now the employer is not only protecting the health
of their people in the workplace, but also outside of work.
This may include healthy life initiatives such as quit
smoking programs, subsidised or fully funded gym
memberships, and even activities such as education
programs. The whole idea is that healthy employees are
more productive and less prone to harm at work. So
managers are often interested in well-being initiatives.

   Organisations that effectively manage work health and
safety are focused on the `prevention of hazards'.
406 Lynnaire Sheridan

   What is a hazard? "...it's a source or situation with a
potential for harm."

   An organisation investing in wellbeing is simply higher
up the prevention scale than a business that is just
managing the basics of injury avoidance.

   But please note, no matter the work health and safety
initiative, the one thing that these initiatives always have in
common is that they are focused on the health of workers.

   Even though we may discuss large workplace disasters
that have impacted on the general public, the focus of our
discussion will always be on the workers involved.

   As managers we can only seek to influence the
behaviours of ourselves and our workers - not the general
public.

work health & safety management
(Chapter 4)

In this video we are going to consider why health and
safety isn't consistently implemented both between
organisations and between countries around the world.

   So, at the organisational level, why might one
organisation be very proactive about work health and
safety (doing wellbeing for example) and another may only
do the minimum or try to avoid any focus on worker
safety?

   Some factors to consider might be:

         · Size - the number of employees and/or the
            financial capacity might affect work health and
            safety management. For example, a small
            business might have a different practical
            approach towards work health and safety
            compared to a large organisation (even if both
            organisations are trying their best to protect their
            workers).

         · Danger - Some jobs might be physically or
            psychologically more dangerous than others. It
            might be physically more dangerous to work in
            a mine compared with working in an office. It
            might be psychologically more dangerous to
            work as an air traffic controller due to stress
            than being a shop attendant (unless you have

                                     407
408 Lynnaire Sheridan

            problems with your customers!!!). So some
            businesses - just to get the job done - may need
            a stronger safety focus than others.

         · Legislation - different parts of the world have
            different laws so work health and safety
            requirements might just be different

So, there may be some scenarios where an employer could
get the job done more cheaply without safe work practices
(perhaps in a developing country without legislation and
with many available workers), alternatively, in a
knowledge economy (where employees are valued for
thoughts and ideas) an employer might want to support
wellbeing as they require relaxed and thriving employees
to achieve the company's aims. Every situation and
response to work health and safety will be different.

   Likewise, employees come with different attitudes
towards work health and safety. Firstly, consider their
varied past experiences - perhaps they have `gotten away
with' doing a dangerous practice successfully many times
in the past (like the employee who takes a shortcut across
the factory floor to leave work 5 minutes earlier to make
sure they get to catch their bus) or perhaps the employee is
very safety conscious (they may have seen someone having
a serious injury at work and experienced the consequences
of that loss) and are now safe work champions.

   You can already probably tell from these scenarios that
another key factor influencing work health and safety in
an organisation are employer and employee values - the
attitudes and beliefs towards work health and safety that
either prioritise it or deprioritise it in a particular business.

   Values and goals are a bit tricky because in an
organisation there is a combination of top-down values
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 409

or priorities but also bottom-up behaviours - what the
employees think and do.

   To try to explain why people might have different values
and goals towards work health and safety Hopkin's
proposes his `Binary Approach'.

   Hopkin's suggests that you either blame-the-victim (and
believe that the worker causes the situation and/or injury)
or you blame-the-system (and believe that the situation
and/or injury occurred because of an error in the safety
management system). Put simply, you either tend to blame
the worker or blame the manager!

   Every decision from then on is based on which of these
two approaches you have towards work health and safety
management and, subsequently, create a proactive or
reactive safety culture.

   If you blame the victim, you believe as an employer that
you cannot improve your workplace safety unless you stop
recruiting `dangerous' people - when people are injured
they are considered `high risk' people and you would try
to remove them from your company. Ideally you believe
that human resource managers can avoid them during the
recruitment process.

   If you are an employee who blames the victim you
would simply think that you are a safe person and it won't
happen to you whilst ever you are working around other
safe people - you might even victimise `dangerous' people
who have had accidents and exclude them from your
workgroup or social group.

   If you blame the system, you will try to understand how
the person came to be injured and what might have gone
wrong in the practices and processes that led to that injury.
In this case it is less about blame and more about learning
to avoid similar consequences in the future.

   The key difference is that when you blame the victim no
410 Lynnaire Sheridan

learning takes place and potentially more people will go on
to be injured. In the second scenario learning takes place
and improvements to safety management ideally result in
less people getting injured.

   Our course endorses a blame-the-system approach. The
reasons behind this will be presented using current theory
and case studies. In particular we will use James Reason's
Swiss Cheese Model which helps us to try to explain and
understand how system errors can lead to workers being at
increased risk of injury or harm.

   However, before discussing the systems approach and
its related theories, it is important to know the difference
between an `accident' and an `incident'.

   An `accident' is "...an undesirable or unfortunate
happening that occurs unintentionally and usually results
in harm, injury, damage, or loss; casualty; mishap." This
definition from Dictionary.com is similar to what we all
know and understand - an accident is when you get hurt
but it's unpredictable and, importantly, unpreventable. So,
if we think back over an accident we realise that nothing
could have changed.

   In work health and safety management it would be
impossible to prevent accidents...it is important to
understand that we cannot manage random, unpredictable,
workplace injuries. Even insurance companies have an exit
clause and do not pay out for `Acts of God' which are
legally defined as "An event that directly and exclusively
results from the occurrence of natural causes that could not
have been prevented by the exercise of foresight or caution;
an inevitable accident."

   In this course we cannot manage accidents but we DO
manage incidents.

   An incident is defined in Australian Standard on work
health and safety (4801) as: "Any unplanned event
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 411

resulting in, or having a potential for injury, illhealth,
damage or other loss."

   At first this may not sound different from an accident as
both accidents and incidents are both unplanned, however,
an incident is believed to be preventable while the accident
"could not have been prevented by the exercise of foresight
or caution."

   In work health and safety we do not manage Acts of
God but, instead we manage the Acts of Humans and we
believe that by taking a systems approach we might be able
to observe, measure, learn and improve so that incidents
resulting in serious injury or harm occur do not occur (or,
at least, occur as rarely as possible).

   Now, if you focus even more on the definition for an
incident you will notice it says "Any unplanned event
resulting in, or having a potential for injury, illhealth,
damage or other loss."

   This, too, is a key difference. Incidents are not always
harmful - they do not always go catastrophically wrong -
but, instead, they are indicators of issues in the work health
and safety management system.

Transcript Video 3: An introduction to
work health & safety management
(Chapter 5)

In this video we are going to learn about James Reason's
Swiss Cheese model. This theoretical model tries to
explain the relationship between a hazard and a workplace
injury. It can be used two different ways. Firstly, after an
incident has occurred, it can be used to help us understand
what went wrong so we can learn and immediately improve
our safety system. Alternatively, we can use it before an
incident occurs and it can help us identify any weaknesses
developing in our safety system so we can fix these before
something serious happens.

   But who is James Reason and why did he develop this
model? After much research and analysis on critical
incidents (large scale ones resulting in many fatalities),
UK-based Professor James Reason started thinking about
what causes an incident - how do hazards and people
interact? How does a potential hazard actually end up
hurting people at work? Where does it go wrong? And,
ideally, what strategies could we use to prevent an
incident?

   First we need to think about a hazard - a source of
potential for harm.

   Every workplace has many hazards - they are
everywhere...machinery with blades that could cut off a
worker's hand, ladders that a worker could fall off or

                                     413
414 Lynnaire Sheridan

computer keyboards that might cause repetitive strain
injury.

   But, while hazards are everywhere; they are not injuring
workers all the time or at the same rate - some
organisations have catastrophes while others have low rates
of injury even when workers are doing the very same job
with exposure to the same hazards.

   So while the threat of getting injured or harmed is
always there, the risk to the worker ("The likelihood and
consequence of injury or harm occurring.") is not the
same.

   What could explain why some workers get injured and
other do not? This is particularly interesting when workers
are exposed to the same hazard while doing the same job.
What is the difference about the individual or the
workplace where the work is occurring?

   Professor Reason and others concluded that it depends
on the effectiveness of the organisation to identify the
hazard, assess its risk (the actual potential for an injury to
occur to a worker) and undertake measures to reduce the
risk to the workers.

   Interestingly, blaming the individual did not explain the
incident nor did it lead to better safety outcomes.

   What is unique to James Reason is that he had analysed
workplace catastrophes he had learned that it was never
just one person's fault. Different issues in and around
organisations affect the people involved and led to the
incident. He was looking for a way to explain that we
really shouldn't blame-the-victim - because he could see
that there were patterns - systems failures - and these were
to blame. But how could he explain this?

   Then, the idea of Swiss cheese model came to him!
   James Reason first proposed that if a workplace were
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 415

considered a block of cheese, then slices of cheese might
represent layers of defence in a safety system including:

   A people layer - safety focused workers with relevant
values, behaviours and safe decision making

   An engineering layer - with alarms, physical barriers
and automatic shutdowns

   A procedural layer - with instructions on safe work
practices

   An Administrative layer - ensuring people are hired with
the right skills and provided the right training to perform
tasks safely and are also, for example, given a safe work
uniform.

   However, Reason believes that there would be
weaknesses in these layers occurring at any given time
due to internal and external factors putting pressure on the
organisation and its workers.

   So James Reason proposes that we are not really looking
at a solid block of cheese but, instead, we are looking at
something like Swiss cheese. The first thing you notice
with Swiss Cheese is that it has holes in it.

   When workplaces develop weaknesses in their safety
defence layers we can imagine the cheese getting holes in
it. These holes are not always predictable or static they
pop up when safety issues arise and disappear when safety
issues are resolved, they can occur in different defence
layers and within different parts of the organisation.

   So, let's imagine a block of cheese cut into slices - we
are viewing the safety system in its distinct safety defence
layers. Then, let's pretend a hazard is like an arrow trying
to shoot through the cheese to cause an incident.
Fortunately the hazard can only shoot through the cheese
when all the holes in the defence layers line up.

   In each of the defence layers, holes are constantly
appearing and being repaired. Most of the time holes in
416 Lynnaire Sheridan

each layer do not line up but when they do, you have an
incident. The hazard will have had its opportunity to make
contact with the worker and injury or harm will occur.
Essentially when multiple layers of safety defences are
weak, there are more holes in the cheese and a greater
probability that the hazard arrow can shoot through more
often to cause more incidents.

   Organisations striving for good safety management try
to repair the holes in the Swiss cheese as promptly as
possible to minimise the probability of all the holes lining
up and the hazard arrow shooting through.

   So what specifically causes the holes in our safety
cheese?

   Professor Reason suggests that holes are created in
safety defence layers by active failures and latent
conditions combining.

   Active failures are the unsafe acts committed by people
who are in direct contact with the hazard. If you blame-the-
victim this is all you would consider as it would just be that
person's fault. You would only examine the `people' safety
defence layer. They are either safe or unsafe people.

   But with a systems approach we also examine Latent
conditions - any decisions, processes and procedures that
have the potential to weaken our safety defences and
impact on a worker's safety. This considers the
engineering, procedural and administrative layers.

   Active failures are `active' - immediate and easily
visible. Unless we are proactively using the Swiss Cheese
Model to review our safety defence layers systematically
and regularly, latent conditions can lay dormant in the
system, they might only obviously emerge when the holes
in the Swiss cheese match up causing an incident.

   For example a manager decides to operate double shifts
with the same crew. This management decision leads to
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 417

tired workers. One worker hits a button on a machine -the
hazard - out of sequence (an active failure) and this results
in a colleague having his hand crushed (the incident). A
procedural weakness is overlooking the fatigue in the
operator who pressed the button. An engineering weakness
is the fact that there was no layer of defence, no safety
guard, to prevent the colleague's hand being in the
machine.

   So how do we repair the holes in the Swiss cheese to
stop the arrow shooting through?

   Active failures are complex human-centric factors which
makes them difficult to predict and control. However latent
conditions can be identified and fixed before an incident
occurs.

   Keeping latent and potential active factors in check is
key to safety management.

   So how do we manage our safety defence layers? How
do we avoid a blame-the-victim approach?

   Most organisations choose to use a systems approach
and therefore choose to have a safety management system.

   In our next video we will learn about safety management
systems, what they are comprised of and the different steps
involved in setting one up. We will learn how to use safety
management systems to identify and repair holes in the
cheese.

(Chapter 6)

In this video we examine Work Health and Safety
Management Systems.

   These systems are expected to eliminate latent
conditions and minimise the risk of active failures, but
what is a safety management system and how do they do
this?

   The Australian Standard 4801 for Occupational health
and safety management systems states that a work health
and safety system has five steps:

       1. Ensuring commitment to safety and undertaking
            relevant policy development

       2. Planning how to roll out the system within the
            organization and industry context

       3. Implementing safety initiatives and practices
       4. Effective measurement & evaluation of safety

            initiatives and practices; and, finally,
       5. Reviewing safety indicators to further improve

            implementation.

Ideally a work health and safety system is like a wheel - it
goes round and round (repeating the steps over and over)
while constantly moving forward (achieving continual
improvement).

                                     419
420 Lynnaire Sheridan

   These five steps help organisations to identify their
safety defence layers and repair any holes that have
emerged. Keeping records of near misses, for example,
helps identify where the weaknesses are so that serious
incidents can be avoided.

   So how might we work to address active failures using a
safety system?

   This requires a focus on the "People" defence layer and
people are often more complex than machinery or the
procedures required to use them.

   While not specifically linked or discussed in the
Australian Standards, active failures (the actions of
workers that lead to immediate consequences in an
incident) might be influenced via the development of a
strong safety culture that influences safe managerial
decisions and worker behaviour.

   Here it is proposed that this safety culture might be
embedded in an organisation and work in parallel with each
of the steps of the work health and safety management
system.

   Hopkins (2005) states that "Safety culture is one of a
number of ideas currently seen as offering organisations a
way to achieve higher standards of safety...The attention
now being paid to the cultural approach to safety stems
in part from a recognition of the limitations of safety
management systems as a means of achieving safety."

   While a system provides a strong framework for
managing safety, a cultural approach considers people's
values and behaviours and therefore enhances the system
rather than replacing it.

   How to develop a safety culture concurrent to the safety
system is a core concept in our learning so it is important,
first, to understand what, technically, a safety culture is.

   James Reason, after using Swiss cheese to try to
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 421

understand how incidents might occur, spent time thinking
about how individual worker values, attitudes and
behaviours might be brought together and aligned in order
to support work health and safety. He has coined this group
approach to safety as being the organisation's `safety
culture'.

   A business can have a positive safety culture (with
workers looking out for each other and themselves and
are engaged in safe work practices) or a negative safety
culture (where they blame-the-victim and no effort is put
into worker safety).

   Reason's Safety Culture Theory comprises four key
elements (Reporting, Just, Learning and Flexible) each of
these will interact to generate an overarching `Informed'
Safety Culture where employees are closely engaged and
aligned with the organisation's work health and safety
management system to achieve maximum safety outcomes
and avoid serious incidents.

   Now let's examine the four culture sub- components
which will engineer an ideal Safety Culture (Reporting
Culture, Just Culture, Learning Culture and Flexible
Culture).

   A Reporting Culture considers the confidence of
employees to report workplace incidents - particularly near
misses which might otherwise go unnoticed but are an
important source of information on weaknesses in our
safety defence layers.

   The key to achieving a successful Reporting Culture
is establishing trust and Reason proposes a `no blame'
approach, where employees report even their own mistakes
in order to provide relevant safety-related information to
their employer. Practitioners then need to think about how
to motivate employees to report incidents that did not have
422 Lynnaire Sheridan

consequences as most people won't want to do paperwork
which they consider `unnecessary'.

   A Just Culture creates an atmosphere of trust between
the employee and employer, and between staff, because
everyone understands acceptable safety behaviours.

   In a Just Culture it must be acceptable to make mistakes
while, at the same time, deliberately unsafe activities must
not be tolerated.

   Employee perceptions of organisational reactions
towards employees who mistakenly or deliberately engage
in activities leading to safety incidents become very
important for maintaining the trust between the employer
and employees. So a Just Culture supports a Reporting
Culture.

   A Learning Culture ultimately determines whether an
organisation can generate change based on prior incidents
to prevent future occurrences. A strong Learning Culture
will encourage change based on information collected for
and emerging from the safety system. So the Learning
culture is informed by the Reporting culture but can also be
proactive when hazard identification and assessment takes
place in organisations.

   Finally, the Flexible Culture is the ability of an
organisation to respond to change and empower people to
make decisions at the right time and place to achieve better
safety outcomes.

   Reason proposes that in emergency response scenarios
the person with the most expertise or information in that
moment should move to the top of the chain of command
- there should be a hierarchical shift - so that this person
becomes the key decision maker as they are best equipped
to generate the best safety outcome.

   So, overall, if we blame-the-system rather than blame-
the-victim we can focus on the continual improvement of
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 423

safety in our business by using a work health and safety
management system to actively maintain our safety
defence layers (that is to repair the holes in the cheese)
and further reinforce the "people" layer by recognising a
cultural element and therefore also focus on generating an
`ideal' safety culture.

   In such an organisation, people learn from the mistakes
of the past and, by taking action to remediate safety issues,
reduce the risk of injury or harm to workers over time.

   Organisations would aspire to being safe because of their
moral values (workers have the right to return home
unharmed by work) combined with the potential
productivity benefits achieved by becoming a desirable
employer fostering healthy and effective employees.

(Chapter 11)

What is risk management? Initially, risk management
might sound simple:

         · You identify some risk

         · You work out how big the risk is

         · And then you try to prioritise different risks and
            find ways to control them so that incidents and
            their consequences don't eventuate.

This is the basis of risk management but there are many
more complexities that need to be understood. For
example, there are different ways to apply risk
management. So, achieving a deep understanding of risk
management to apply it in practice is more difficult than it
first looks.

   Consider, what I think is risky you might think is OK?
   Or what I think is a tolerable risk you might think is
completely unacceptable
   Also - should risk management be confined to
circumstances when the risk might lead to hurting people
or should you consider all of the possible consequences of
an incident?
   Does risk always have a bad, or negative, outcome?
There is risk in buying shares in the stock market but you
don't buy shares thinking you are going to lose your money

                                     425
426 Lynnaire Sheridan

- you want to make money and have a positive outcome.
If risk outcomes were always negative there would be no
investment! Sometimes `taking a risk' can then be a good
thing so all this needs to be considered within the broader
context of risk management.

   What impacts our perceptions of risk can depend on
our experience, education, whether the risk is voluntary
or imposed on us, that is, whether we feel that we are in
control and what benefit we think we will get from taking
the risk.

   Risk is a part of everything that we do from getting up in
the morning

   We are all making risk-based decisions, all the time.
Using instinctual risk management in our daily lives is
what we do to make sure we stay safe.

   So why study risk management?
   What I might think of as severe or catastrophic
consequence you might think of as only a minor or
moderate consequence. Because my perceptions of risk are
different to yours, my tolerability or acceptability of risk
may be different to yours and my experiences are different
to yours - we need to have a way that we can communicate
about risk in a way that takes away all of the emotion and
gives us a common language.
   Also if we can learn some simple tools then we can make
sure that when we "do" risk management we are much
more likely to identify all of the risks. Then we can have
a better understanding of the causes, consequences and
likelihoods to then develop controls that will be effective
in managing those risks to get good outcomes we are after.
   More advanced risk management also helps you to know
what to do when you have a long list of risks and controls
- it will guide you on what to do next.
   So let's start with establishing a common language?
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 427

   The terms hazard and risk are often used interchangeably
in the English and other languages. This is because our
understanding risk varies depending on our culture and
context. Even some WHS professionals use the words
interchangeably but they are different.

   In a WHS context a Hazard is a situation or thing that
has the potential to harm a person. Hazards in a workplace
can include: noisy machinery, a moving forklift, chemicals,
electricity, working at heights, a repetitious job, bullying
and violence.

   The International Standard for Risk management
principles and guidelines, ISO 31000, replaced the term
"hazard" with "risk source". This then means that risk
sources maybe considered to be elements acting either
alone or in combination with an intrinsic power to generate
a risk.

   Risk may then defined any effect of uncertainty on
objectives.

   What is uncertainty? It can be the likelihood, frequency
or probability of something occurring.

   Risk = consequences X frequency
   Risk = dying in a road incident X number/year
   Thinking about it another way...
   A good way to remember this is to think of a shark - A
shark maybe a source of harm but does it pose a risk?
   Given our new understanding of the word risk - for
a shark to pose a risk, the shark has to pose a risk to
something - it has to have an effect over something
   For example, if you put a swimmer near a shark - the
shark now poses a risk to the swimmer. But how much risk
does it pose?
   To understand the level, scale or size of risk that the
shark poses to the swimmer there are many factors to
consider:
428 Lynnaire Sheridan

         · How far away is the person from the shark? Are
            they isolated by distance or some other barrier
            such as a shark proof fence?

         · What type of shark is it and how big is it? (baby
            or a fully grown white pointer)

         · How fast can the person swim? Can they get
            away from the shark once they know it is there?

         · What PPE is the person wearing? This could be
            a mesh suit to resist any bite?

         · What engineering controls are in place? Is the
            person in a shark proof cage, are there other
            deterrents such as acoustic measures?

By thinking about the person, the shark and the situation -
you are starting to do risk management.

   So if risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives, in this
case, the risk could be defined as chance of getting bitten
by a shark while swimming in waters where sharks have
been sighted. All of the other considerations are controls
that impact on the level or size of the risk. Risk
management is simple a way to explain all of this
complexity.

   The actual risk for any person facing a shark is therefore
dependent on many factors - so now you can see why risk
and its management is such a complex topic!

   Risk Prioritisation
   Now that you know the basics of risk management but
how can we use it because we can't fix everything at once!
   By understanding levels of risk we can prioritise
different scenarios to see where we are best off spending
our money. A common way to do this is to rate the level
of consequence (impact) and likelihood (how often you get
the impact) and prioritise the risks based on a score.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 429

   Risk tables can be used for WHS but area also a useful
tool to examine Environmental, Financial, Legal, Cultural,
reputation and other types of business risk.

   The common idea is that they provide a way of saying
which risks are really important ( big risks) and which ones
are less of a concern ( little ones) and they often have rules
on what to do if you have different sized risks.

   Having a list or a chart so that people understand what
is important to be focussed on is an important tool for
businesses as it doesn't matter how good you are you can't
do everything at one.

   Why is risk management important?
   By understanding and applying risk management you
can identify problems, determine how to control them and
make assessments as to whether the risk is acceptable. In
a WHS context you can make things safer for people by
understanding what can go wrong and how to prevent it.
   It also provides you a common language by which to
compare different risks and prioritise them so that you can
spend (or use) limited resources including people, time
and dollars wisely to most benefit the largest number of
people or, put simply, to keep the greatest number of people
safe within budget constraints.

   And Human Factors
   Let's start learning this "new Language" or at least
words used in specific ways that have specific meanings.
   SFAIRP (so far as is reasonably practicable)
   Is any level of risk acceptable?
   Clause 17 of the NSW Work Health and Safety Act 2011
specifies that a duty holder can ensure health and safety by
managing risks, which involves:

         · - eliminating the risks, so far as is reasonably
            practicable, and

         · - if not reasonably practicable--to minimise the
            risks, so far as is reasonably practicable.

How do you defined reasonably practicable?
   In this context, reasonably practicable means that which

is, or was at a particular time, reasonably able to be done to
ensure health and safety, taking into account and weighing
up all relevant matters including:

         · - the likelihood of the risk concerned actually
            happening

         · - the degree of harm that might result from the
            hazard or the risk

         · - what the person concerned knows, or ought
            reasonably to know, about the hazard or risk,
            and ways of eliminating or minimising the risk

         · - the availability and suitability of ways to
            eliminate or minimise the risk, and

         · - after assessing the extent of the risk and the
            available ways of eliminating or minimising the
            risk, the cost associated with available ways of
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 433

            eliminating or minimising the risk, including
            whether the cost is grossly disproportionate to
            the risk.

Causes
   - a list of ways an event can happen
   Controls
   - actions, procedures, processes or systems that help to

manage the risk to a level that is reasonably practicable
   Scenarios

         · Describing the scenario is like setting the scope
            for the risk being considered

         · A good scenario describes

                      - The target being affected by the risk
                        (in safety this is usually a person but it
                        could also be the environment,
                        community, plant or equipment).

                      - How the event occurs and the
                        consequence to the target - for
                        example how and what would injure
                        the person?

                      - Potential magnitude of the injury (if
                        that's known at this stage).

                      - Example, one scenario: A person is
                        run over by a forklift resulting in
                        death of the person

Risk Assessments - tools
   Take 2 or Take 5
   - Simply means a few minutes before you start a job to
434 Lynnaire Sheridan

think about what you are doing, where you are doing it and
what might go wrong.

   Checklists
   Checklists are lists of features to consider when
assessing a situation

         · - Types and properties of materials

         · - Job tasks - heights, depths, manual handling

         · - Design features - safety devices, pressures,
            temperatures, volumes

         · - Maintenance - access, how and when?

         · - Operation

         · - Shutdown

         · - Natural events - wind, floods, day and night

Work Method Statements
   From SafeWork NSW the purpose of a work method

statement is:

         · to outline a safe method of work for a specific
            job

         · to provide an induction document that workers
            must read and understand before starting a job

         · to meet legal requirements, that is, hazard
            identification and control

         · to program work, materials, time, staff, and to
            anticipate possible problems

         · to use as a tool in quality assurance.

Brainstorming
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 435

   Brainstorming is a way to:

         · Get ideas quickly

         · Involve everyone

         · Allow people to think creatively

Rules:

         · All ideas are included

         · Don't analyse each idea as you go

         · Everyone should get time to speak

         · Limit time from 5 to 10 minutes

What If
   Ask a series of logical predetermined questions
   Hierarchy of Controls
   There are many ways to control risks. Some are more

effective than others. Hierarchies of control rank risk from
those that offer the highest protection and are the most
effective to those that offer the least protection and are the
least effective.

   Remember that you need to have a mix of controls.
If you only use engineering controls without training or
maintenance these will not be effective. Multiple controls
can give you layers of protection - that's what the Swiss
Cheese model aims to show us. In a best case scenario
managing the risk associated with hazards is like wearing
pants with belts and braces and then also holding your
pants up!

   You should also consider whether the layers are
independent or whether they can all fail in a "common
way" often called a "common mode failure" for
exampleyour set of engineering controls all rely on
436 Lynnaire Sheridan

electrical power. If you lose the electrical power all
controls fail.

   The hierarchy of control works well for:

         · - Separating physical risks

         · - Plant

         · - Chemicals

The hierarchy of control doesn't work so well for:

         · - Psychosocial risks

         · - Risks that require a combination of controls

         · - Considering unintended consequences for
            elimination or substitution for example
            eliminate human involvement (automate a
            process) needs consideration of the introduced
            risk - short term, long term and even emergency
            situations

         · - Or risks that depend on a time sequence

Personal Protective Equipment as a control
   Regulation 44-47 in the WHS Regulations includes

specific requirements if PPE is to be used at the workplace,
including that the equipment is:

         · Selected to minimise risk to health and safety

         · Suitable for the nature of the work and any
            hazards associated with the work

         · A suitable size and fit and reasonably
            comfortable for the person wearing it

         · Maintained, repaired or replaced so it continues
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 437

            to minimise the risk

         · Used or worn by the worker, so far as is
            reasonably practicable

A worker must, so far as is reasonably able, wear the PPE
in accordance with any information, training or reasonable
instruction

   Human Factors - How people are involved in the
actions, processes and systems. Humans are a big source
of risk and often unpredictable but there are documented
ways to understand how human errors can occur.

   For example, did you know that if a person is faced
with a process involving creative thinking, the process is
unfamiliar, complex and time is short, then the person is
likely to have high stress levels and fail 1 in 10 times.
Imagine they are running a process in a heavy industry that
could kill someone!

   To conclude, these are not every single risk management
term that you might come across but you now have an
overview of some commonly used risk management terms
- you are on the way to joining us in using shared risk
management language.

Transcript Video: Moving up the
Culture Ladder (Chapter 6)

Moving up the Culture Ladder
   Professor Patrick Hudson
   Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands
   Patrick Hudson speaking:
   Accidents happen because of a culture. Every recent big

accident such as BP's Texas City and Deepwater Horizon
disasters, Longford and NASA's shuttle disasters has been
directly linked to poor safety culture. When we look back,
it always was the culture. Not just the big accidents but
most of the smaller ones as well. People are trying to get
the job done - so all too often, they were allowed to get
away with dangerous behaviours.

   When things go well, like Qantas QF32 or the Miracle
on the Hudson, we get to see just how big a role a positive
culture plays in averting disaster. Culture plays both ways.
So a better culture is the place to be especially when danger
is your business. The best organisations know this. They
look at their own cultural of safety. They ask how they can
improve. That is what I want to talk about today.

   My name is Patrick Hudson. I was Professor of the
Human Factor in Safety at Delft University of Technology
in the Netherlands and have been working in the safety
business for the last 28 years, mostly in oil and gas,
aviation, mining and pharmaceuticals. There's a list of
what makes a good culture culled from numerous studies
such as Jim Reason's seminal study and my own work with
companies such as BHP, Shell, BP and Exxon.

                                     439
440 Lynnaire Sheridan

   These are, first of all, leadership. Leaders are not afraid
to do difficult things. Everyone knows where leaders stand
on managing risks - either taking the risks or running
them. Secondly, respect. Individuals are respected as are
the dangers they face. Experts are listened to, even when
they are low in the hierarchy. This leads to being informed.
Managers know what is really going on and the workforce
is willing to report their own errors and near misses -
which is pretty hard for them to say and for managers to
hear. These create a culture that is mindful. Everyone is
wary and always ready for the unexpected.

   Also, a respectful culture is one that is just and fair, a
culture with clear lines between what is acceptable and
unacceptable, ones that everyone agrees upon. What makes
it just, is that there are well understood consequences, both
positive and negative. What makes it fair is everyone from
top to bottom agrees where the lines are drawn and the
consequences of crossing them. Finally, the organisation
is learning. Willing to adapt and implement necessary
reforms even when they feel expensive and even when
holy cows have to be overthrown based upon what they've
learned.

   Organisations with these characteristics have many clear
advantages, not only in safety but also commercially. The
advantages are that such organisations are flexible. They
operate according to need rather than tradition. Reliable -
they always deliver on time, on quality, on demand because
they manage the risks better than anyone else. This makes
them profitable. All their stakeholders benefit. Finally,
people like working in that sort of organisation. The
problem is this is a daunting list for leaders. How can they
do this?

   Most studies of safety culture wind up with something
like this, such as the High Reliability Organisation
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 441

program. The problem is that most organisations are
nowhere near this level and if they were, they wouldn't
need help and advice. Most organisations that want to
achieve this list need a roadmap. This is what the safety
culture ladder offers - providing a structure to help decide:

         · where you are now;

         · where you want to go to; and

         · support the process of getting there.

We can describe a sequence of distinct cultures that differ
in many ways, including how they regard safety. First and
definitely not a culture of safety, is the pathological. Safety
seems a problem caused by workers. The main driver is the
business and a desire not to get caught by the regulator.
Then we have four levels of increasing improvement often
called `maturity', starting with the reactive. Organisations
start to take safety seriously but only after incidents is there
action. Whenever they see a problem, they want to fix it.
Then, we progress to the calculative. Safety is driven by
management systems with much collection of data. Safety
is still primarily driven by management but all agree,
systems are the way to go.

   Beyond that however, there's the proactive. With
improved performance the unexpected is more of a
challenge. Workforce involvement starts to move the
initiative away from a purely top-down approach. And
finally, generative. There is active participation at all
levels. Safety is part of the business and organisations are
characterised by chronic unease - "We're doing so well.
What are we missing?"

   I have learnt that this ladder is very attractive to those
who want to do their best but it turns out to be more
difficult to improve than most people imagine, which I
442 Lynnaire Sheridan

have to admit can be frustrating, especially when the
organisation's leaders want to get to the top, and quickly
- an admirable attitude but one that needs to be tempered
lest it be doomed to failure. The good news is that knowing
how to proceed, can help to speed things up quite a lot.

   The first lesson people need to learn is that fine speeches
and motivational speakers don't really help. The feel-good
factor they create usually has a very short half life and
dissipates maybe by the next morning. Furthermore, they
create unrealistic expectations, possibly making things
worse rather than better. The good news however, is that
that the motivation is already there.

   In my experience of asking many companies in different
industries, ranging from oil and gas and mining to
pharmaceuticals, to aircraft engineering, is that people can
recognise where they are on the ladder and always want to
be higher. From top to bottom. In all such organisations,
there's a built-in desire to be better. The problem is day-
to-day reality. They have good values and impeccable
attitudes when surveyed but their behaviours are what let
them down. One of the common simple definition of
culture is "how we do things round here". This is where
aspiration meets reality - where the rubber meets the road.

   What I have found does work is discovering what they
could do or change ie, their activities, processes or systems
which would first, be characteristic of more advanced
safety cultures. Secondly, be fairly easily be made to be
how things are done and by using standard management
skills for ensuring change takes place. When people say,
"We could certainly do that," then we can use standard
management approaches with deliverables and
accountabilities that nevertheless impact on the culture. If
they behave this way for long enough, they become what
they wanted to be.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 443

   To help in the process of going up the ladder, I made
a discovery that can help. I found talking to many
organisations, not only did they think they were higher up
the ladder than I suspected them to be but when challenged
they'd say, "But we have this in place and that in place,"
and I realised that they thought having things like reporting
systems or communication strategies in place, was going to
be enough. Certainly, they were reacting to demands from
regulators, the industry and internally to be compliant with
the requirements and often, having things in place kept the
auditors happy. But I realised that actually putting them
into operation was a distinctly new challenge that will be
characteristic of having the management system actually
running. So the first stage was rather typical for reactive
cultures, while calculative cultures actually both have a
process and used it.

   For example, a country's aviation regulator set up an
aircraft accident investigation bureau which in turn, put
a confidential reporting system in place for their aviation
industry. At the end of the first year, there were two reports.
In place? Yes. Operational? No. They passed the audit.

   So putting processes and systems in place is what
happens when a pathological organisation makes the move
to becoming reactive. Along with this is a tremendous
commitment to safety, the decision to mend one's ways
and do the right thing. Here, we already measured good
attitudes and optimistic beliefs. To make the transition
from a reactive to a calculative culture however, requires
actually putting these processes and systems into operation
- making them work.

   But what next? The transition to becoming a proactive
organisation becomes clear. It involves making the
processes and systems that are now in operation truly
effective because often they're not, or they no longer have
444 Lynnaire Sheridan

the impact that was expected when they were put in place.
What may have worked at first no longer has the effect
originally intended after the kick-off effect. For instance,
the first reports may have a great impact, "Wow, do we do
that?" but they just become reports to be counted, giving
numbers to be reported quarterly.

   On the Deepwater Horizon, 110 staff on board were
submitting an average of over 100 stock cards every day
- nearly one per person, per day - not that it helped. This
transition to a proactive culture is hard, harder than people
imagine, including myself - and I'm going to come back to
this.

   Finally, it's essential to ensure that what has become
a number of effective habits generating stellar safety
performance as well as environmental and quality
outcomes, become permanent. Only then can we speak of
"How we do things around here" in ways that mean that
the organisation has become a true culture of safety. This is
when the best habits are ingrained so operations are more
than safety first. Safety is no longer a priority but the true
value, meaning far more than just an answer in a survey.
At the generative level, safety overrides the temptations for
both workers and managers to do it dangerously, "just this
once".

   There are challenges to both going higher up the ladder
and staying there if you got there in the first place. The
safety ladder has snakes. One of these, from my own
experience, was when a very advanced organisation, an
Australian coal mine, was taken over by a foreign company
that insisted that they throw away their old processes that
worked really well for them and replace them with their
own that objectively were actually not producing such
good performance elsewhere for the new owner.
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 445

Fortunately, the culture was strong, the processes
embedded and they carried on, but quietly.

   Another problem is when success in part of an
organisation means they no longer get the senior
management attention that was helping them be good in the
first place. This can lead to reversion and in the worst case,
a drop from the top right down to the very bottom. The case
reported in the Harvard Business Review of the Nut Island
sewage works in Massachusetts that went from the best, to
actually pumping out raw sewage into Boston Bay, is also
a story we need to hear.

   The simple sequence in place, in operation, effective,
permanent can be mapped onto the transitions of the ladder
from pathological right up to generative, so wherever we
are, what's stopping us. The first transition requires getting
out of the pathological mindset. I don't want to say a lot
about this here, but uncompromising regulation, messages
from the markets or, unfortunately the most frequent
impulse, a big disaster - Exxon has never been the same
since the Exxon Valdez - these can be enough to get things
in place, change attitudes, instil some values that this safety
stuff is worth taking seriously. It is not enough to achieve
stellar goals but represents the hardest change of all.

   The next stage is still really hard because reactive
organisations already have good attitudes. Their problem is
a shortage of managerial skill to get the performance they,
and others might demand of them. The fight is between
how things get done and the systems that are in place but
may not be used. This means that the major driver has to
come from management, right from the top. Management
has to concentrate on ensuring that everyone - and this
includes top management themselves - gets into the habit
of doing things the way they say they should. They have to
have the discipline to keep on using processes and systems
446 Lynnaire Sheridan

until they become the norm. That's another word for
culture. Self-discipline has to be applied by senior
managers to ensure that everyone else becomes disciplined
as well. This is hard. The temptations to backslide, "just
this once" are many but disastrous for progress in the right
direction.

   Nevertheless, many organisations have done this and are
predominantly calculative nowadays. They can invariably
be recognised by their performance as well as how they do
things. What I have found, time and time again, is that the
best of these calculative organisations recognise that there
is such a thing as being too system driven and they want
to make the move to becoming a proactive culture. This is
where it gets really hard and I find a metaphor useful to
understand why the transition to a proactive culture is so
difficult.

   I see calculative organisations as being like caterpillars.
Steadily munching their way through the leaves, very
organised and efficient but the caterpillar looks up to the
sky and sees a beautiful butterfly floating past and thinks,
"I wish I could be like that." Little does the caterpillar
know that a caterpillar is the resource that's needed. How
would you know? Where in a caterpillar are the butterfly's
wings? What do all the legs become? When the caterpillar
has become large enough, a miracle occurs - pupation,
when the caterpillar turns into butterfly soup. You have all
the ingredients. What you need to do next is to change to
become something completely new.

   The lesson for organisations is that to make their safety
systems effective, everything has to be challenged and re-
examined. What was good enough for a reactive culture
and appeared to operate for a calculative one, is no longer
good enough. What worked to get you there is no longer
enough to take you further. For instance, the knowledge
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 447

accumulated by a calculative culture, aggregated at the
corporate centre, has to be pushed back out to be used by
managers and workers, not just horded. Those individuals
require a radically different sort of training and the
expansion of roles and responsibilities in a proactive
organisation. Top management can feel comfortable in
having got their safety management systems to work. Now
they'll have to make themselves deliberately
uncomfortable learning to resist the cry that, "It was
working fine. Don't change it."

   Let's take an example of an incident database. This is
crucial for creating an informed culture. It is the repository
of the reports from a reporting culture and provides the
data for a learning organisation. First, you need to have a
database available with ways of getting incidents in and
information out, but people may be loathed to report.
Investigations may be summary to the point of useless
except for counting purposes. Still, it's in place. Next,
you need to operate the database by ensuring that people
actually put incidents and reported hazards into the
database. This is the discipline senior managers must
exercise.

   You also need to train the workforce so that people know
what's worth reporting and how to both investigate and
also analyse incidents usefully. Often we want, or we even
have a confidential reporting system required but we have
to show that reporting leads to change rather than blame, if
anyone's going to report at all. The database and associated
processes may, nevertheless only serve superficial
requirements. To be truly effective, the data inside has to
be turned into information. Especially, it must have the
opportunity to surprise us, "I didn't know we were working
like that" and properly inform our decision-making
processes, "Where do we spend our resources?" Not just
448 Lynnaire Sheridan

justifying decisions after the event. Finally, the system has
to become standard. No alternative is envisaged.

   This may all sound unnecessarily complicated but
consider that the financial culture has usually got all these
facets long in place, in operation and effective for financial
information which is more than just the raw finance data.
Consider what happens to your expenses claim. Does a
change of manager change that system? Maybe a good
safety system should learn from the success of the financial
systems within organisations.

   So, what's hard about becoming generative then? Wasn't
the hard bit just becoming proactive? In the generative
culture all these elements come to fruition. In the proactive
culture, the top of the organisation is still driving safety
but have created the potential to let those who are the
subject matter experts take responsibility and accept it as
well. Thinking about generative organisations and the very
few I have seen and heard about, I realised that they could
be described as saying that the lunatics are running the
asylum. Top management stood back and it looked as if
they had nothing to do as far as safety was concerned or
indeed, in production either. But then I realised that they
have the hardest job of all - designing asylums to be run by
lunatics.

   This captures the deck crew on USS Carl Vinson where
the officers watched but could not intervene. This was what
the General Manager of the coal mine intended when he
set up operations so the miners had to use their brains, all
day long. This can be hard for senior managers to let others
stand out and often take the glory. Pathological leaders use
the organisation to polish their glory. Generative leaders
glory in the achievements of their workforce.

   So, when we ask where we are on the ladder, we can
pose a number of challenges about the safety processes and
                      ANZ HR Management of Work Health & Safety 449

systems, and we do safety. "What are you actually doing?",
"Are things just in place or in operation?", "How would
you know if it was working?", "Is it data or information?",
"What would people do if you stopped right now?" A
takeover may change everything. A new broom can sweep
clean and clean away. "Who's behaviour are we talking
about? Is it just the workers, the managers, the executive
management or everybody together?" But this shouldn't be
that hard. So why don't more people or organisations get to
the top of the ladder? People don't believe cultural change
is like this. Surely, we have to win hearts and minds? Yes.
The best way to win hearts and minds is by proven success
by yourselves not by others.

   Success requires implementation, actually doing what
you decided to do. Many organisations however, see
strategic planning as having a higher status than mere
implementation. Events overtake plans and we discover
that the senior management commitment was not as strong
as it was during the opening speeches of the culture
initiative. Cultural change takes time. Senior managers are
impatient and may be moved on before the fruits ripen. It
probably takes two years at a minimum to change from old,
bad safety habits to new and better ones.

   Another set of disablers include authoritarian leadership
styles who cannot give away hard-earned power:

         · corporate loss of nerve shown by withdrawal of
            permission to try new things;

         · imposition of top-down control because of a
            lack of trust;

         · a fear that the workforce will run away and be
            irresponsible;

         · managerial failure to learn to like bad news - an

            essential part of their diet;
         · corporate flexibility and possibly regulatory

            inflexibility as well.

The benefits are clear because the kind of organisation

that makes it to the proactive level runs better. The people

who work enjoy it more, staff turnover is less. Another

advantage of the advanced culture is a consequence of

increased trust, "You do your job and I'll do mine," that

results in reduced supervisory costs and increased

flexibility in operation. Finally, having fewer incidents

help keep costs down as well but advanced cultures do

spend more to glean the maximum information from the

few incidents they have.

The most important ingredient in moving up the ladder

is the commitment and actions of leadership, primarily

senior leaders, but also those safety leaders throughout the

organisation who together develop the trust that things will

be done properly, both top-down and bottom-up.

In my next talk I'll cover leadership, safety leadership

in particular and how leadership and culture are intimately

intertwined.

In conclusion, it's possible to climb the ladder but it's

hard and probably harder than people expect when they

start. The good news is that I have never found anyone who

wanted to go down the ladder but lots of people at all levels

who wanted to go up.

Finally, if you do make it up there, everyone benefits -

commercially, environmentally, socially and you all get to

go home in one piece - every time.
