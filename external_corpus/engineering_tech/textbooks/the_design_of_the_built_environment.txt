Introduction

This book is for novices interested in the design of the built world and those interested in the Uni-
versity of Illinois and its context. It examines the diversity of influences that inform and affect the
structures and landscapes that humans occupy. It seeks to clarify this wide range of factors and
determine how they come together. Through a series of walking tours, organized around themes,
the reader is guided through concepts and strategies that affect the human-built world. The Uni-
versity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's campus and its surrounding context form the backdrop for
teaching these concepts. Each tour is framed with introductory material. The walks are designed
to be perceived through the senses as the reader conceives the related subjects. The Design of the
Built Environment is a broad exploration of the reasons why the world looks the way it does. Its
approach is an attempt to make the material accessible to all.

The built environment is both culturally significant and contextually based. It reflects individual
creativity and collective values. The text will explore interior design, architecture, landscape
architecture, urban design, and planning while concentrating on place making. The components
emphasized are the interdependent aspects of culture: design, economics, politics, technology,
and tectonics. The text is built on the belief that context forms the basis of design and that culture
forms the basis of context.

The book is divided into five parts.

Part 1. Approaches to Architecture

Architecture is considered the mother of the arts. As such it holds both aspirations and practical
requirements. This part illustrates approaches to architecture from different points of view. It
introduces the reader to how varied approaches to the built environment shape its design. The
definition of architecture from different points of view demonstrates approaches from a func-
tional, aesthetic, or structural bias. Later, vocabulary and principles are presented to inform future
examinations.

Part 1 introduces concepts (transparency, parti, poché) while exploring ideas of architecture,
design, structure, and use. The Architecture Building, designed by Charles Platt (1926), is used
to provide examples of these principles, clarify the points raised, and familiarize the reader with
architectural graphics.

Part 2. The Making of Place and the University Plan

The Urbana-Champaign campus is a product of over 150 years of planning and development. From
the early years of land acquisition to the present, ideas about what a university can and should
be, have helped form the campus. Ideals create a strong framework for generations to contribute
structures and designs of and for their time. As times change, subsequent generations determine
the value of these edifices for future generations. The walks in this part seek to explore the major
principles used by designers in the creation of the major public realms of the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign: the South Quad, the Main Quad, the engineering campus, and Campustown.
Each walk introduces themed concepts and historical information. Before undertaking these walks
a history of the university plan is offered to lay a foundation for the structures and architectural
approaches.

Part 2 uses the campus and its public realm to discuss ordering principles in the built environment
and the role buildings and landscape play in the creation of public and private spaces. This portion
has three walks through the central axes of the campus and the main quadrangles: the South Quad,
the Main Quad, and the engineering campus north of Green Street (the Bardeen Quad and the
North Quad). It uses the campus to introduce design principles (figure-ground, axis, hierarchy,
spatial closure).

Part 3. The University Context

The context surrounding the university predates its founding. The walks in this part explore the
context surrounding the university and the formative roles that these contexts play in the lives of
its inhabitants. These contexts include Champaign, Urbana, Philo, a local cemetery, and a typical
residential street with an atypical residence. Each part looks at issues that are local, regional, and
sometimes national in their scope. Physical, economic, and social contexts play an enormous role
in determining the form of the built environment. Traversing these environments reinforces gen-
eral concepts while providing specific examples of how structures work to create a larger set of
spaces and places.

Part 3 discusses the context surrounding the university, including Campustown; the towns of
Champaign, Urbana, and Philo; and the physical landscape through an examination of Mount Hope
Cemetery. This section examines national influences and regional values that informed settlement
and subsequent development. It includes a discussion of a typical Midwestern residential street
(Indiana Avenue) and an atypical house (Erlanger House) that provide insight into the norm.

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | xxv
Part 4. Technical Aspects of Architecture

Design is a complex combination of art/aesthetics on one hand and technical aspects on the
other. The designer must evaluate both the needs of the owners/occupants and the general pub-
lic. Codes and regulations are used to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community
while the owners' and occupants' needs must be considered to satisfy the construction's funder.
Part 4 deals with the codes, contracts, and basic principles of structure and mechanical systems,
including heating and ventilation systems (both supply and demand). This portion provides greater
insight into the infrastructure and technical aspects of design and how they influence the forms
that buildings and places take.

Part 5. Individual Buildings and Their Design

This part explores concepts in design and how they may reveal themselves in individual buildings.
The walks in this part provide insights into the causes and effects of principles and their applica-
tion.
Part 5 uses campus buildings to illustrate specific aspects of design such as precedents, the use of
the orders, servant space versus served space, function and design, meaning and metaphor, and
design synthesis and sustainability.
The parts are intended to present the concepts simply. The goal is for individuals to experience the
built environment and make connections for themselves. The text can be read as a general discus-
sion of how humans occupy the natural world and create the built environment to suit their needs.
Experiential examples are used to illustrate principles. Sometimes these examples are unique to
their local context, but often the principles can be seen more generally across a region or globally.
The Design of the Built Environment is meant to be experienced. To understand our world, one
must be a part of it. Once engaged with the environment the observer can make associations
with past experiences and make connections to things learned previously. In this way there are
two worlds, the world of perceptions and the world of conceptions. The two basic philosophi-
cal approaches to understanding our environment, the phenomenological and the ontological, are
addressed. The phenomenologist uses an approach that concentrates on the study of conscious-

  ness and the objects of direct experience, while the ontologist seeks to create a set of concepts

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2

  and categories in a subject area or domain that shows properties and the relations between them.
  With this in mind, this book can be used in a variety of ways. The reader may sift through the
  material to gain a better understanding of the principles or to link their own experiences to those
  presented. Throughout the text, images and diagrams are presented to help clarify ideas regarding
  the principles and the edifices discussed. Photographs are used to reinforce ideas and aid in visu-
  alizing conditions for those not going on the walks. These tours discuss the venues and concepts
  while providing a hands-on/eyes-on opportunity.

 PART 1. APPROACHES TO
 ARCHITECTURE

        Overview

        One begins with the exploration of the basic question: What is architecture? Entire books have been
        dedicated to the subject. Here this question is used, instead, to frame approaches taken to design.
        After exploring the concepts outlined by Vitruvius--that architecture is the masterful combination of
        firmitas, utilitas, venustas, that is, it must be solid, useful, and beautiful--other opinions about what
        constitutes architecture are examined to introduce how values can affect the built environment.
        Some initial terms and concepts are outlined to present ideas used in the environments to be
        explored.

  What is architecture? This question is often posed to those interested in the creation of the built
  environment. Here, the question is used to frame how the many different approaches to design
  have arisen. Its many answers over the millennia, when examined collectively, begin to approxi-
  mate a definition given by the Roman architect Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (Vitruvius), who lived in
  the first century BCE. Vitruvius wrote De Architectura, a work of ten books that cover subjects
  such as city planning, public and private buildings, construction, military and civil engineering,
  and building materials. Vitruvius famously stated that architecture was the masterful combination

                                                                           4

  of firmitas, utilitas, and venustas. Sir Henry Wotton translates Vitruvius in the seventeenth cen-

                                                                                                                                                                                                5

  tury, writing: "Well building hath three conditions. Commoditie, Firmenes, and Delight," or func-
  tion, structure, and delight.
  Examining the Vitruvian triad leads to an understanding of values in different epochs. When struc-
  ture is emphasized, the goal to produce something bigger, taller, and other superlatives has led
  to material and technical advancements and new construction methods for edifices ranging from
  Gothic cathedrals to the world's tallest buildings. The emphasis on function has led to unique

   1 | Part 1. Approaches to Architecture
  solutions to programmatic needs. The idea that "form follows function" has led to the creation of
  edifices that will better suit the needs of those using them. The emphasis on delight has led to

                                                                                                  6

  aesthetic refinements and poetic responses.

                                                                                                                                                                                                7

  cates a bias toward the venustas, whether that be interpreted as delight, beauty, or love.

          Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space.

          --Ludwig Mies van der Rohe

          Architecture is a learned game, correct and magnificent, of forms assembled in the light.

          --Le Corbusier

          Architecture is the triumph of human imagination over materials, methods, and men, to
          put man into possession of his own Earth. It is at least the geometric pattern of things, of
          life, of the human and social world. It is at best that magic framework of reality that we
          sometimes touch upon when we use the word "order."

          --Frank Lloyd Wright

          Architecture is really about well-being. I think that people want to feel good in a space. . . .
          On the one hand it's about shelter, but it's also about pleasure.

          --Zaha Hadid

          Architecture is basically a container of something. I hope they will enjoy not so much the
          teacup, but the tea.

          --Yoshio Taniguchi

          Architecture is inhabited sculpture.

          --Constantin Brancusi

6. In his discussion of venustas--Built upon Love: Architectural Longing after Ethics and Aesthetics--Alberto Pérez-Gomez
   offers a particularly phenomenological interpretation, expressing a view that venustas is love rather than delight or
   beauty, having been born of the root for Venus, goddess of love.

          Architecture is like a mythical fantastic. It has to be experienced. It can't be described. We
          can draw it up and we can make models of it, but it can only be experienced as a complete
          whole.

          --Maya Lin

  The Vitruvius triad (or portions of it) might be interpreted as an equation: Structure Function
  Delight = Architecture. When one element is missing Architecture is not attained: Structure
  Delight = Sculpture; Structure Function = Building; Delight Function = Ruins. Before examining this
  triad in detail and undertaking a field study, it is helpful to introduce concepts and terms used by
  designers of the built environment.

  Phenomenal transparency is when two distinct figures appear to occupy the same space simulta-

                                                                                                                                                                    8

  neously. Designers have employed phenomenal transparency for centuries, but the term was cre-
  ated in the twentieth century by Gyorgy Kepes:

          If one sees two or more figures overlapping one another, and each of them claims for
          itself the common overlapped part, then one is confronted with a contradiction of spatial
          dimensions. To resolve this contradiction, one must assume the presence of a new optical
          quality. The figures are endowed with transparency: that is they are able to interpenetrate
          without an optical destruction of each other. Transparency however implies more than an
          optical characteristic; it implies a broader spatial order. Transparency means a simulta-
          neous perception of different spatial locations. Space not only recedes but fluctuates in a
          continuous activity. The position of the transparent figures has equivocal meaning as one

                                                                                                                                             9

          sees each figure now as the closer, now as the further one.

  Thus art is dependent on viewers' participation, and architecture is one of the most interactive
  arts. Buildings are meant to be experienced. As Maya Lin noted, any structure "can only be expe-
  rienced as a complete whole," and environments can be fully understood only through immersion.
  The ability for the observer to "read" a building has been consciously manipulated by designers
  using phenomenal transparency for centuries.

  Parti is a shortened term derived from partis prix, which is a term from the École des Beaux-Arts
  (the influential French art schools) that literally means "departure point." In architecture it refers
  to the basic idea or organizational strategy that is fundamental to the design. A parti is often a
  basic spatial diagram. One example is the primary shape used by the campus designer Charles
  Platt for the Architecture Building, whose T shape is formed by linking its major spaces with hall-
  ways, classrooms, and offices.

   3 | Part 1. Approaches to Architecture
Poché is also derived from the École des Beaux-Arts and literally means "poached" but can be a
noun or a verb. As a noun, it refers to something that gives shape to space like the irregularly
formed white in a poached egg that gives shape to the yolk. A poché may be the walls or masses
used to define an area of a building. Another way to conceptualize a poché is to think of a pocket
whose cloth defines the void into which one may place hands or keys. As a verb, architects use
poché to mean the filling in of the area between walls or spaces. For example, the buildings sur-
rounding the Main Quad act as poché, giving shape to the grassy space that without the buildings
would have no clear definition.

Part 1.1. The Architecture Building

     About the Walk
     This walk uses the Architecture Building to clarify basic design concepts such as literal and phenom-
     enal transparency, poché, and parti. The notion that a building can be read or interpreted is then
     discussed and illustrated.
     This walk begins outside the Architecture Building at 608 East Lorado Taft Drive in Champaign.

Transparency, parti, and poché, along with the concepts of rhythm and proportion, will be
explored in relation to the Architecture Building, which was designed by Charles Platt and com-

pleted in 1926. Located at 608 East Lorado Taft Drive, it is part of a composition of buildings with
David Kinley Hall (DKH), the Surveying Building (now Richard D. and Anne Marie Irwin Doctoral
Study Hall), and Commerce West (now Wohlers Hall). In Platt's design for campus, the Surveying
Building was to be razed, and a fourth building similar to the Architecture Building was to be con-
structed (see figure 1.1.1).

Platt created a set of building partis that could be combined in a variety of ways to create block

                                                                                                                                                                   1

plans. These partis can be likened to letters of the alphabet with variations. These blocks fit into
the city grid and were expected to serve as a model for university development. Examples of these
building partis and block plans can be seen on campus, though Platt's design for an extensive rep-
etition of these blocks was never realized.

In Platt's 1923 Sketch for the Development of Campus (see figure 1.1.3), the block configurations in
figure 1.1.2 can be seen flanking the campus's main axis. In Platt's Study of the Ultimate Development

with several other block compositions, is seen repeated in a cookie cutter manner. The result is a
diversity of scales from grand axial quadrangles to handsome streets to intimate courtyard spaces.

Platt designed numerous campus buildings, including the Main Library, Louise Freer Hall, DKH,
Mumford Hall, and the President's House, but the Architecture Building is his most remarkable
campus structure. One can see the care Platt took in creating a space for "Architecture and Kin-
dred Subjects," as the engraved stone above the main entrance heralds.
This structure readily demonstrates the concept of phenomenal transparency. The building's
design allows for different ways for it to be seen or "read." Like a text, it may be translated in dif-
ferent ways. Within the larger composition it relies on DKH and Wohlers Hall to create the illusion
of a tripartite structure similar to designs by the Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio in which
a central pavilion is flanked by two end pavilions and connected with a loggia. This compositional
strategy was used by architects who admired Palladio's The Four Books of Architecture including
Colen Campbell, a noted Scottish architect and neo-Palladian credited with the creation of the
Georgian style who published a volume entitled Vitruvius Britannicus. The influence of Vitruvius
and Palladio are thus brought to campus through its Georgian buildings (see figure 1.1.5).

of coherency to campus. Under his direction cam-

pus began to consistently use this style for a wide

range of building types including classrooms (DKH and Mumford Hall), the addition to the Armory,

the Main Library, and gymnasiums (Freer and Huff Halls). Platt's adoption of the Georgian style

allowed him to use the Palladian compositional strategy of a central volume with two connected

pavilions at either end (see figure 1.1.6).

It is a transformation of this compositional parti that Platt uses to connect DKH and Wohlers Hall
with the Architecture Building. By providing gates flanking the Architecture Building, Platt visu-
ally connects the three buildings in a composition reminiscent of Palladio's design style. Figure 1.1.7
shows different ways in which principles of rhythm, repetition, hierarchy, and scale are used in
this block plan.

2. It is not unusual for a campus to adopt a particular building style. Princeton University, the University of Notre Dame,
   and Washington University in St. Louis favor the collegiate Gothic style, while the first buildings at Stanford University
   reflect a coherence because of the consistent use of the Romanesque style.

                                                                                                                                                                    Kevin J. Hinders | 8

and linked to the end pavilions with a connecting loggia. This composition is repeated in the Georgian style at
Mumford Hall and other university buildings.

The front facade of the Architecture Building is a rich weaving of vertical and horizontal elements
that can be interpreted in many ways because of its use of phenomenal transparency. Looked at
one way, the building appears to be a giant red brick aqueduct. Looked at another way, the building
can be seen as a series of stacked windows standing in soldier-like attention. The viewer is made
to interpret the facade and its many transparencies (see figure 1.1.8).

The ribbon of stone between the first and second floors that weaves through the limestone win-
dow detailing carries the transparency further (see figure 1.1.9). The window base is a remarkable
mixture of a dominant horizontal stone that turns into a vertical reading (see figures 1.1.10 and
1.1.11).

On entering the Architecture Building one comes to an entry hall with steps up to two intersecting
hallways. The intersection is marked by two columns with matching pilasters against the wall.
These squared-off columns match the freestanding columns but are engaged (attached) to the
adjacent walls. The columns and pilasters form an aedicule space, which typically marks a location
like an important opening or spot where walkways adjoin (see figure 1.1.12).

       Figure 1.1.6. Mumford Hall line drawing with diagram. Above, the front elevation facing the South
       Quad. Below, the three pavilions are shaded. The central pavilion is five bays wide and occupies a
       central axis and secondary pavilions to the north and south have their own entry axes. Note the
       manner in which downspout placement and chimneys subtly reinforce the north and south entries/
       masses.

This aedicule calls attention to the intersection of the entry that leads back to Room 120 (a promi-
nent lecture room) and the cross-axis hallway that goes west to the large Temple Hoyne Buell
Gallery and east to a series of offices used by the dean of the College of Fine and Applied Arts.
These offices are relatively new and replace a large room that was used for teaching. Prior to the
college offices being inserted into this space, the building had a straightforward parti: a T-shaped
building with large rooms terminating the ends of each hallway (See figures 1.1.13-1.1.16).

                                                                                                                                                               Kevin J. Hinders | 10
The second floor has also been altered. It once had a library above Room 120 and two large studio
spaces at the east and west ends of a corridor lined with bathrooms and offices. These rooms
acted as poché to give form to the hallways and the major rooms. The third-floor area above the
library has a simple flat roof, but the parti continues to have a large studio space at either end of a
long hall. Offices, bathrooms, and secondary classrooms line this hall. Tying the building together
vertically is a beautiful curving staircase that occupies the northwest corner off the intersection
of the hallways.

shaded to show the relationship between the plan and the facade.
Phenomenal transparency may also be seen in three-dimensional space. Temple Hoyne Buell
Gallery has spaces within spaces. First the space may be read as a single volume, and then vertical
and horizontal aspects of the gallery can influence the impression of dimension and volume. Fig-
ure 1.1.18 shows the many spatial transparencies of the gallery.

With these basic architectural concepts and techniques for reading spaces, a foundation is in place
for exploring more concepts and principles. Additional examples will focus on the University of
Illinois campus and the surrounding environment, but many concepts are applicable to the Mid-
west, the United States, and global settings. The reader is encouraged to reflect on their own
experiences and the environments they occupy when walking through campus spaces, reading the
text, and considering the details highlighted in the illustrations.

PART 2. THE MAKING OF PLACE AND
THE UNIVERSITY PLAN

       Overview

       After passage of the Morrill Act in 1862, the university was created in 1867 as a land-grant institution
       on acreage between Urbana and Champaign. Since its early days the university has gone through
       periods of rapid growth (for example 1910-30) and periods of little construction (such as during the
       1970s). There have been significant contributors to the growth of the university. Following
       World War II the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (and subsequent government programs
       commonly referred to as the GI bill) afforded many the opportunity to access higher education
       without regard to cost or ability to pay. This expanded the size of the university in an era in which
       public and private research were seen as essential postwar tools to keep America at the forefront of
       technology. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 led to diversification of the student body, and the Higher
       Education Act of 1965 provided financial assistance to universities for scholarships, low-interest
       loans, and the National Teaching Corps. These new programs greatly increased the size of universi-
       ties' administration across the nation and its subsequent footprint on campuses. Finally, the growth
       of intercollegiate athletics through commercial television and outside funding has significantly
       altered the university's physical landscape.
       The planning of the campus has been a conscious effort to allow for needed growth of individual
       colleges while managing the goals and objectives of the overall institution. This section gives a his-
       torical introduction to the campus.

  The new Industrial University of Illinois, founded in 1867, was the result of the Morrill (Land Grant)

                                                                                                                                    1

  Act of 1862, signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln. The act's goal was to help establish

1. The original bill was passed by Congress in 1859 but was vetoed by President James Buchanan. Edmund James asserts
  that the bill was created by Johnathon B. Turner and his Illinois associates years prior to the election of Justin S. Morrill:
  "There is also evidence that Justin S. Morrill was selected by Turner and other friends of the measure to introduce the
  bill because he was from an older state which had not thus far benefitted by the land grant of the Federal Government.
  And that in this way he [Morrill] for the first time became connected with the bill" (see James, Origin of the Land Grant
  Act, 27).

institutions of higher education that would provide practical education in agriculture and the
mechanical arts and extend higher education to the working classes. The Morrill Act provided for
30,000 acres of federal land per US senator and congressperson for each state to help fund these
new schools. Because Illinois had sixteen representatives in 1867, it was given 480,000 acres of
federal land in Minnesota and Nebraska.

The people of Urbana and Champaign (Champaign County) placed a bid to host what was to
eventually become the University of Illinois. There was heated competition from two other com-
munities: Normal (Maclean County) and Jackson (Logan County). After considerable debate and
lobbying from the different constituents, Champaign County's bid was selected in February 1867.

21 | Part 2. The Making of Place and the University Plan
  When the Board of Trustees for the new educational institution met in March 1867, its land hold-
  ings were considerable. On the condition that the new university be built in Urbana-Champaign,
  the citizens of Champaign County contributed assets including 405 acres south of Mount Hope
  Cemetery known as the Busey Farm; 400 acres of farmland southeast of Urbana (Griggs Farm,
  destined to be sold off over the next 25 years to support the university's coffers); 160 acres of
  land north of the cemetery bounded by Lincoln Avenue to the east and Fourth Street to the west
  with a northern boundary just south of where Foellinger Auditorium now stands (Armory Avenue
  extended); an old seminary building and its surrounding 10 acres; $100,000 in Champaign County
  bonds; $2000 in trees donated from the Dunlap nursery; and $50,000 in freight charges from the

  Illinois Central Railroad. Almost immediately the board decided to link the 10-acre property to the
  north with the 160-acre property to the south. Thirty-six acres, known as the Wells Tract, were
  purchased to connect these properties before the university opened to students in March 1868.
  This central core of more than 600 acres still resonates today. The university has a clear presence

                                                                                                                                           3

  The land south of University Avenue and north of Springfield Avenue has been altered somewhat
  since the university's founding, as Mathews Avenue now extends north of Springfield Avenue.
  Today this area is organized by structures surrounding the North Quad, also known as the Beck-
  man Quad, and the area south of Springfield Avenue and north of Green Street is organized by
  the internalized Bardeen Quad. The 1871 plan shows the Green Street offset as the grid shifts to
  the south between Urbana and Champaign along Green Street. This was originally planned to be a
  boulevard (see figure 2.3).

  The Main Quad was established between Green Street and Armory Avenue (extended), while the
  160-acre section south of Armory Avenue encompasses the South Quad and what would become
  the military axis. Aspects of this early map still reverberate. Illini Grove remains on land designated

ation still share control of the stock farm area south (and west) of the cemetery with the College
of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences. The extension of Fourth and First Streets
down to St. Mary's Road is depicted at the bottom left of figure 2.1, foreshadowing the creation of
Assembly Hall (now State Farm Center) almost 100 years later.

Land ownership, more than any early plan or vision, set the stage for subsequent campus designs.
The early administrations were quick to recognize the need for securing adjacent lands and tried
to make certain the university did not get into a position where it was unable to expand. Located
between the towns of Urbana and Champaign, the university now sits as a mediator between the
two communities, straddling Wright Street between Champaign and Urbana (see figure 2.4).
As the university grew, the need for the orderly use of land in a planned manner was balanced by
the immediate demands of college units. Early plans show buildings set in a landscape, but these
soon evolved into the familiar setting of buildings banding together to form collective spaces. Act-
ing Regent Thomas Burrill, a botanist and professor, recognized the need for ordering elements
on campus and planted elm trees along the avenue that would bear his name. The elms and the
avenue are now gone, transformed into a walkway on the west side of the Main Quad known as
the Broadwalk.
Numerous plans were produced in the first two decades of the twentieth century. From 1909 to
1917 the university enlisted the aid of the Burnham Campus Plan Commission, whose members

                                                                                                                                                               Kevin J. Hinders | 24

   Burnham made notable pronouncements about design:

 7. Burnham is well known for his work on the plans for Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and Manila. Burnham had
    gained fame as the director of works for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where he employed the U
    of I sculptor and alumnus Lorado Taft to create sculptures. Burnham later served on the McMillan Commission, whose
    members included landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and Charles F. McKim of the New York firm McKim,
    Meade, and White that later designed the Women's Building at the university. The McMillan Commission produced a
    master plan for the Washington, DC, Mall and park system. The ideas from the Burnham Commission reflected their
    belief that large, open public spaces surrounded by buildings of appropriate size and density was a model for both cities
    and universities.

 8. Zimmerman served as Illinois State Architect for 1905-15. In this capacity, he is credited with designing many buildings
    on campus, including the Natural History Building additions, the Armory (in its original state), the Commerce Building
    (now the David Dodds Henry Administration Building), the Physics Building, and the Stock Pavilion.

 9. Blackall was an alumnus of the class of 1877 who became an eminent architect in Boston. He prepared plans for the uni­
    versity as early as 1903. He also designed Foellinger Auditorium, which was completed in 1907.

10. White was the supervising architect for the university beginning around 1909. He is credited with designing or code­
    signing approximately fifty buildings on campus including Smith Memorial Hall. He worked in collaboration with Charles
    Platt on many projects including the President's House, the Women's Gymnasium (now Louis Freer Hall), the Armory
    addition, and the Main Library; Mann is credited with R. C. Jones and R. T. Jones for the design of the Acacia fraternity
    house (now the Library and Information Science Building), built in 1914.
     25 | Part 2. The Making of Place and the University Plan
           Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will
           not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, log-
           ical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing,
           asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are
           going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon

                                11

           beauty.

   This was Burnham's charge to the other commission members: He acted in only an advisory capac-
   ity and never produced a plan. Each of the other members created drawings and plans that were

                                                                                                                                                                                                        12

   shared to provide a broad, comprehensive set of ideas to develop over the next ten years. Most
   plans featured a Main Quad with southern expansion and an attempt to organize an engineering
   area. Eventually the plans began to expand westward along what became known as the military
   axis, which included a large area for recreation and military activities south of the Armory. Follow-
   ing World War I, plans by the architectural firm Holabird and Root and a commission study fixed
   the site of Memorial Stadium.

   In 1922, Charles Platt was employed to study the campus master plan and subsequently as archi-

                                                                                                                         13

   tect for the Agriculture Building (now Mumford Hall). Platt accepted most of the principles and
   recommendations of landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and the Burnham Campus Plan
   Commission and then set out to establish the relationship between the plan and the individual
   structures. Platt determined that a unifying Georgian style would establish a presence for the uni-
   versity while uniting the buildings and the landscape into a cohesive entity.

   The university then commenced on a series of periods of slow growth followed by rapid building.
   With the Great Depression came a general slowing of campus construction. One notable exception
   was the building of the Illini Union. This important structure fulfilled Olmsted's prediction that a
   new and better building would replace the old University Hall. The positioning of the Union is crit-
   ical in the overall plan.

   After World War II the university experienced a period of rapid growth. The Servicemen's Read-

                                                                                                                         14

12. These include numerous plans by White and Blackall between 1911 and 1914 (see Tilton and O'Donnell, History, 32 50-78).
13. Platt originally studied as a painter and engraver. In 1892, he traveled to Italy and produced the book Italian Gardens.

    This trip allowed him the opportunity to design gardens and eventually architecture. Platt gravitated to the Cornish Art
    Colony headed by the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. His parents' connections from New York's Century Club helped
    him procure early commissions. By the early 1920s his reputation was well established after the completion of the Freer
    Gallery of Art on the Washington Mall in 1918; Tilton and O'Donnell, History, 117.
14. One provision in the GI bill was the dedicated payment of tuition and living expenses for veterans. By 1956 approximately
    2.2 million people had used the college benefit.

                                                                                                                                                                   Kevin J. Hinders | 26
   education. New construction was necessary to provide both housing and classroom space for the
   influx of students, and new research concentrations demanded lab space. This turn toward sci-
   ence and technology drove a simple modern style that replace Platt's Georgian model for campus
   structures.

   By the 1960s the Baby Boomers were making their way onto campus and with them came a con-
   struction surge. Some buildings constructed in this period are Krannert Center for the Perform-
   ing Arts, Assembly Hall (now State Farm Center), Turner Hall, Commerce West (now Wohlers Hall),
   the Psychology Building, the Foreign Languages Building (now the Literatures, Cultures, and Lin-
   guistics Building), Morrill Hall, the Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory, the Education Building,
   and the Intramural Physical Education Building (now the Activities and Recreation Center or ARC).
   Examined collectively these structures can be seen as newcomers to the campus master plan that
   filled in open spaces. No new quadrangles were developed to situate the great variety of research,
   classroom, sports, performance, and exhibition structures. The Foreign Languages Building was
   the only new structure on the Main Quad. The majority of these newcomers were constructed on
   sites marked in earlier plans for future structures or on newly acquired sites near the perimeter
   of campus. Perhaps this reflects the strength of Burnham's call to "make no little plans" as the plan
   provided before World War II was clear and inspiring to direct construction for decades.
   During this period the university also dedicated its efforts to housing, building over twenty dormi-

                                                                        15

   tories at the campus periphery. These units were often in complexes with shared dining facilities

15. These dormitories replaced housing that had been located south of Gregory Drive and west of Fourth Street. The uni­
    27 | Part 2. The Making of Place and the University Plan
   and multiple structures working together to form a composition. For example, the collection of
   dormitories known as the Six Pac consisted of three structures located on Peabody Drive--Syn-
   der, Scott, and Weston Halls--and three on Gregory Drive--Hopkins, Garner, and Forbes Halls (see

                            16

   figure 2.5). This composition included shared dining and support facilities. Each building had
   small courtyards, and the overall composition rejected the quadrangle precedent, preferring less
   defined spaces between the dormitories.

   These and many other structures built at this time were designed by Ambrose Richardson. His
   Ten-Year Development Plan was submitted in 1960, but growth stalled as stagflation--a combi-
   nation of economic stagnation and inflation--spurred in part by the energy crisis of the 1970s
   reduced funding. As the modernist period gave way to postmodernism, the style and formulation
   of campus were reexamined. Just as the country was exploring its past, so the university began to
   draft strategies to preserve its heritage while exploring the possibilities of its master plan. Sasaki
   and Associates began a 30-plus-year relationship with the University of Illinois about this time and
   described a different approach:

           The central theme of planning and design at Illinois expands and perpetuates the best tra-
           ditions of the university's past physical development. In developing several major campus
           quadrangles, for example, Sasaki drew inspiration from plans from the 1920s and the Main
           Quad at the heart of campus. Sasaki's work reinforces the desired relationships among aca-
           demic, research, and support units and achieves an overarching spatial order that clearly
           links the various campus precincts together while maintaining functional integrity. The
           result is an organized system of campus spaces and land-use precincts that accommodate

                                                                                                                                                        17

           future growth and reflect the school's international reputation.

   Whereas the Burnham Campus Plan Commission, Holabird and Root, and Platt sought to make a
   great plan for a great university, the Sasaki approach claims to follow those traditions but refers
   mainly to functional relationships and organized systems, making no reference to a plan's "magic
   to stir men's blood."

   The Six Pac has been dramatically altered. In the 21st century several of the dorms along with the
   dining facilities have been replaced. The Ikenberry Commons now organizes the composition.

   In the 1990s the university began a new joint venture that dramatically altered the campus. In 1997
   the Board of Trustees sent out a request for proposals for two new research parks: one east of

    versity also constructed married student housing in Urbana east of the President's House and south of Kirby Avenue,
    some of which remains.
16. Forbes and Garner Halls have been demolished, and the Ikenberry Commons has added Nugent, Wassaja, and Bousfield
    Halls between Euclid and First Streets and Gregory and Peabody Drives.
17. Sasaki, "University of Illinois."

                                                                                                                                                                    Kevin J. Hinders | 28
the engineering campus between Goodwin and Lincoln Avenues to facilitate technology transfer
from the university to the marketplace and one for the area south of St. Mary's Road, along First
Street to Windsor Road. A local development company established by Clint Atkins and Peter Fox
was ultimately awarded the opportunity to create these enterprise zones. Research Park on the
south end of campus consists of one-, two-, and three-story structures set in landscaped parking
lots and open space. Begun west of First Street and south of St. Mary's Road, it has grown to the
east, and a new extension of Fourth Street now frames the development all the way to Windsor
Road to the south (see figure 2.6). This expansion is the result of a clause in the agreement that
allows the developer to construct a new building whenever the threshold of available lease space
falls below a specified amount.

The strategy for development of Research Park south of campus has largely proven to be success-
ful, while the spot intended for a northern research zone has transformed into an extension of
the engineering campus with localized public spaces such as the courtyard between the Thomas
M. Siebel Center for Computer Science and the National Center for Supercomputing Applica-
tions. Farther east, Campbell Hall and the University Laboratory High School occupy signifi-
cant real estate. Parking structures and parking lots along University Avenue serve the area, but
growth there has been stagnant for several decades. The research spaces and labs once consid-
ered for the north part of campus have given way to new plans as the Carle Illinois College of
Medicine--opened in 2018 as the world's first engineering-based college of medicine--has begun
exploring additional spaces for educating its students.

   The footprint of the DIA has grown on the fields south of Mount Hope Cemetery into a small cam-
   pus with the State Farm Center, Memorial Stadium, the Bielfeldt Athletic Administration Building,
   the Ubben Basketball Complex, the Atkins Tennis Center/Khan Outdoor Tennis Complex, Illinois
   Field, and the Henry Dale and Betty Smith Football Performance Center, along with facilities for
   baseball, softball, track, and soccer. Nearby are the Demirjian Indoor and Lauritsen/Wohlers Out-
   door Golf Practice Facilities. Plans to build new spaces for volleyball, gymnastics, and wrestling
   continue to be discussed.
   The expansions of Research Park, the domain of the DIA, and the intramural fields have come at
   some cost to the feel of the campus. Many of the agriculture facilities that had been so important
   for the development and the psyche of the university have been moved far away from the central
   core and now typically are south of Windsor Road and beyond.
   In the mid-1990s David Dressel, then director, Office of Facilities, Planning and Management pre-
   dicted that the university would fill all its available building sites by 2030 and then would have a
   denser environment. Today that prediction is challenged by the university's dedication to the
   environment and its desire to create a more sustainable campus. The goal set in 2008 for carbon
   neutrality by 2050 has significantly affected growth. The 2010 plan for climate action and subse-
   quent iterations limit consumption and promote resiliency. One aspect of the overall strategy is

                                                                                18

   the commitment to no net growth. As the university embarks on the next phases of its planning
   it will reevaluate its objectives and methods for achieving those goals.

Part 2.1. The South Quad: Organizing the
Farms

     About the Walk

     It is a fitting place to begin: the Stock Pavilion. With its earthy smell, dirt floor, grandstand seating,
     and trussed roof, the structure is a beautiful example of a collective building for the South Quad. A
     collective building is more than an individual department or school within a university. It is a place
     where all people can come together to celebrate the common good and mark the passing of time.
     The Stock Pavilion thus represents the College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sci-
     ences and becomes a focal point of the South Quad. This walk will discuss the hierarchy of the South
     Quad and its secondary quadrangle, the military axis. The general plan of the university will be fur-
     ther discussed with particular attention to David Kinley Hall, Mumford Hall, the brilliance of the
     library's placement, and the effect of Dutch elm disease. Concepts such as figure-ground, axis of
     symmetry, and balance will be introduced.
     This walk begins at the Stock Pavilion located at 1402 West Pennsylvania Avenue in Urbana and tra-
     verses the South Quad to the Undergraduate Library and the back of Foellinger Auditorium.

The concept of figure-ground is one of the first taught to design students and is often illustrated
with a vase/face drawing. In figure 2.1.1 it is possible to see the silhouettes of two faces (illustrated
here in black) looking at one another across a short distance (in white). It is also possible to see a
vase (white on a black background). The drawing demands for the viewer to decide what they see.
The faces form the vase, and the vase forms the faces. It is impossible to perceive the faces and the
vase simultaneously. The viewer's mind flips back and forth, seeing the faces, then the vase, and
then the vase in the foreground must mentally recede to become a background before the faces
can appear. It is up to the viewer to determine which figure they perceive.

This type of diagram is referred to as a figure-ground. The tool is used by designers, especially
architects and urban designers, when diagramming buildings and cities (see figure 2.1.2).

In a diagram like figure 2.1.3, which depicts the city of Champaign, Illinois the buildings are shown
as black on a white field. This can be reversed so that white buildings are seen on a black field, as
shown in Figure 2.1.3.

                                                                                                                                                               Kevin J. Hinders | 32
In this type of reversal, the mind senses the image differently, and these alternate perceptions can
help provide the designer with insights.

                                            Part 2.1. Orientation Map.

A second useful concept is an axis. An axis is a central or pivotal element, typically a line, around
which a composition is arranged. Nature has a multitude of symmetrical creatures that have dif-
ferent kinds of axes. An example of a bilaterally symmetrical creature is a butterfly. The axis of
symmetry runs through the butterfly's body from head to tail. Another kind of symmetry is radial
symmetry, whereby a symmetry exists around a central point. Think of a starfish with its five arms
radiating outward from its body. The South Quad has several important axes of different types.

Situated at the south end of the main axis, the Stock Pavilion has a rich, earthy smell. Years of use
have given the structure an appropriately rugged patina. The central portion of campus ends in
this low, vaulted structure that functions as both a visual terminus to the South Quad and a sym-
bolic representation of the College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences (ACES).
This walk will proceed to the other bookend to the South Quad--Foellinger Auditorium, which
serves as the representation of both today's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the univer-
sity's 1867 founding, when that land-grant institution offered instruction in the liberal arts.

The Stock Pavilion is a figural building--which means that it stands out from the surrounding
background structures--because of calculated design decisions. To understand the idea of what
makes a structure figural, think of a stop sign. A stop sign needs to stand out from its surroundings
to communicate an important message. To facilitate this communication the following principles
help make a stop sign figural: position, shape, color, contrast, and size. Similarly, a figural building
uses these principles to communicate importance. The Stock Pavilion is positioned at the end of
the South Quad--a long space focused on the Stock Pavilion's facade and its curved roof beyond. It
sits on a raised earthen platform so it is slightly elevated above the surrounding buildings. To fully
appreciate the Stock Pavilion's importance in this setting it is necessary to know that the original
design had a two-story, nine-bay loggia--an open-ended, exterior arcade or gallery--that ran the
length of its north facade. This terra cotta loggia was white and contrasted dramatically with the
surrounding structures. In addition, it was the largest structure in the vicinity when it was con-
structed in 1913 (see figures 2.1.4 and 2.1.5).

The terra cotta facade--including fifty-two decorative terra cotta animal head panels --was
removed during a 1958 restoration because it had been badly damaged by water infiltration (see
figures 2.1.6 and 2.1.7).

  After the removal of the terra cotta facade the loggia along the north facade was replaced with a
  less symbolically significant facade in a traditional Georgian style in keeping with university stan-
  dards (see figure 2.1.8).

  Armory, begun in 1912 and completed in 1914, is a contemporary sibling of the Stock Pavilion.
  Though the structural systems of the buildings are different, it is interesting to imagine these two
  under construction at the same time and the subsequent facade changes that have given them a
  similar appearance.
  The Stock Pavilion accommodates approximately 2000 people on stepped concrete seating on
  the north and south sides of the structure. Originally used for judging and studying livestock and
  classes, the building has hosted agriculture career exhibitions, Moms Weekend flower shows, and

   and a two-story addition that wrapped the original structure was added by James White and Charles Platt (see Program
   in Arms Control and Domestic and International Security, "Armory Building"). For more on the Armory, see part 4.3.

The space has a series of curved trusses that create a long span that allows for good sight lines for
spectators. The vault is visible from the outside and thus expresses the presence of people coming
together.

The building is strategically positioned on an axis with both Foellinger Auditorium and the Illini
Union beyond. This distinguishes it as a building that represents a group larger than a single
department. In the university's early history the three main areas of study were Engineering, Lib-
eral Arts and Sciences, and Agriculture. To this day, the university master plan protects sites
located on major university axes. Only structures that represent a larger, collective group are given
these positions of honor. Secondary structures line the east and west sides of the Main Quad and
the South Quad. As this walk moves north these buildings will be discussed (see figure 2.1.9).
Leaving the Stock Pavilion through the north doors one sees to the west Temple Hoyne Buell Hall
(Buell) and to the east the Agricultural Engineering Sciences Building (Ag Engineering). Both struc-
tures, built in 1992 and 1983, respectively, attempt to use historical references while creating con-
temporary buildings that move away from the traditional Georgian style. Buell and Ag Engineering
narrow the South Quad by using pathways that pinch in movement from the wider areas to the
north. Buell has a walk aligning with the entry to Gregory Hall (two blocks to the north) and allows
pedestrian passage through the structure. Similarly, Ag Engineering has walkways that redirect

                                                                                                                                                               Kevin J. Hinders | 38

Beyond Buell and Ag Engineering one comes to two remarkable structures, seemingly indepen-
dent, that have an entwined history. The first is a small farmhouse, one of the earliest univer-
sity buildings and the oldest surviving structure. The second is one of the newest on campus, the
McFarland Memorial Bell Tower. Both have a historic relationship to the military axis of the South
Quad.
The military axis is a long, thin cross axis that once linked the South Quad to a military parade
grounds that is now the area bounded by First Street to Fourth Street and Gregory Drive to

                                                                                                                                           3

  Peabody Avenue. This area was once the home of the Six Pac --six student dormitories located
  between Euclid Street and First Street--and an additional set of dormitories located between

                                                                        4

  Euclid Street and Fourth Street. The university is phasing out and replacing the Six Pac dormito-
  ries with new housing and student service structures in an area called Ikenberry Commons. There
  is a poetry in the building of these dormitories at the time of the cold war and the Vietnam War on
  land previously dedicated to military training and then to housing veterans returning from WWII.
  One senses the desire by university officials to mediate at a time when calls to "make love, not
  war" were part of a societal issue of tremendous controversy.

  The military axis has long been a concept for planning but never a clearly defined entity. Never-
  theless, numerous master plans have maintained the idea well enough to prohibit structures from
  inhabiting the area between Fourth Street and the South Quad. Plans have called for figural build-
  ings of equal square footage to bookend the military axis since the 1970s. The Funk ACES Library
  now occupies the short arm of the military axis and the distant termination piece is the Siebel
  Center for Design along Fourth Street. The Funk ACES Library is an octagonal brick veneer build-
  ing with stone accents and a copper roof. This postmodern building takes its design cues from
  the precedent that dominates the Main Quad: Foellinger Auditorium (which will be discussed in
  greater depth in part 2.2). Foellinger Auditorium is strategically placed on the high point of the
  Main Quad and has an elaborately figural front door facing it. Unfortunately, unlike Foellinger
  Auditorium, the Funk ACES Library lacks the presence of its precedent and has a main entrance
  away from the South Quad. Its octagonal shape is a transformation of the round Foellinger form
  that is then capped with an ornate copper crown. It is a much stripped-down version of its model
  without the remarkable ornamentation and commanding presence of the original.

  At what is now the western end of the military axis stands the Siebel Center for Design (SCD). Its
  creators asserted before the building opened: We believe in using Design Thinking as an approach
  to promote Human-Centered Design (HCD) and mandated quick iterations. We also aim to foster

                                                                                                         5

  multidisciplinary collaborations across campus. Reflected in this statement is the idea of bringing
  together cross-campus participants. The site is carefully located near the School of Art and Design
  but provides opportunities for many innovative interactions from participants in all the univer-
  sity's colleges. This collective aspect is a crucial reason for allowing SCD to be located on the mili-
  tary axis's western terminus. The new structure is rather short in comparison to its neighbors, but
  its irregular geometry reinforces its figural quality.

While turning toward Mumford House and the McFarland Memorial Bell Tower, it can be seen
that these structures are somewhat at odds with one another. This makes for an interesting study
of changing ideals and values over time. Mumford House was originally a small farmhouse near
experimental farms. The farmhouse was subsequently occupied by professors and deans for many
years, including the dean of the College of Agriculture, Herbert W. Mumford, for which it is named.
The small farmhouse is visible near the bottom of the early plan of the Illinois Industrial University,
which had imagined only a few buildings (see figure 2.1.10).
As the university grew, the Main Quad and the South Quad became demarcated by the structures
lining their edges and the landscaping that came to define their walkways. Numerous architects
were involved in shaping these, most notably Charles Platt and the University of Illinois professor/

43 | Part 2.1. The South Quad: Organizing the Farms
collaborator James White. White introduced the idea of a tower on a site near Mumford House

                                                           6

(see figures 2.1.11 and 2.1.12).

In his proposal, White illustrated a tower similar to the bell tower in the Piazza San Marco in
Venice. Not only did this tower look like its predecessor in Venice but it worked in a similar man-
ner. Just as the campanile (bell tower) in Venice serves to turn the energy of the Piazza San Marco
and form a hinge linking the piazza to the Grand Canal, the proposed University Tower would have
marked the military axis and provided a similar hinge to link the South Quad to the parade grounds
in the distance (see figure 2.1.13).

Figure 2.1.13. Bell tower diagram. Figure-ground comparison of Piazza San Marco, Venice (left), and the South
Quad (right).

For decades the bell tower was not constructed, and Mumford House began to deteriorate. Con-
cerned students and faculty, determined to save Mumford House from being torn down, decided
to have it named a historic building. In 1989, the structure was placed on the National Register of

                                                                                                 7

house were removed, and the building is now used as office space.

In spring 2000, a School of Architecture graduate studio conducted a series of design exercises
for the South Quad. One was to design a tower to be located in relation to the military axis and the
South Quad. University Architect Roland Kehe was invited to the project's review, which reignited
the idea for a South Quad tower. Completed in 2008, the new structure is dedicated to Sarah
"Sally" McFarland. Shortly before the placing of the bells, students pulled a prank, hanging a replica
of the Eye of Sauron (from J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings). No arrests were made.
Today, any climbing of the carillon is strictly forbidden.

  The McFarland Memorial Bell Tower marks three axes. It stands at the intersection of the South
  Quad and the military axis. It also creates a third axis: a vertical one that strategically marks the
  intersection of the two primary organizational design features. This tower acts as an axis mundi
  or world axis: "a line or stem through the earth's center connecting its surface to the underworld

                                                                                                                                  8

  and the heavens and around which the universe revolves." Typically one considers the axis that
  runs through the North and South Poles as an axis mundi about which the world spins. There are,

  and obelisks--and in this case, a carillon--have long been used to mark important locations and

  create local centers. These local centers provide organization and can help create order.

  Moving north, the next two structures on the South Quad are fraternal twins: David Kinley Hall

9. To get students to understand the idea of an axis mundi I ask whether anyone has ever watched or listened to a sporting
   game and felt that their actions--such as getting up to fix a sandwich or using the restroom--might change their team's
   luck. Though intellectually one can be pretty certain that unrelated activities in one's own location--miles away from an
   event--do not have any effect on the game's outcome, it is still a question that produces blushing from many students.
   This is a psychological representation of the person's perception of themselves as the axis mundi--the belief that the
   world revolves around one's self. When we are infants this is natural, and as we mature we are taught empathy and the
   notion that we are part of a world but not the world's center.

   identical. Closer inspection reveals notable differences, including in the entries, the central win-
   dows, and the presence or absence of pilasters. Each building has a center with a large pediment
   and implied pavilions on the ends (see figures 2.1.14-2.1.16).

   The architect used careful placement of both chimneys and downspouts to enrich the composi-
   tional strategies for these buildings as they look at one another across the South Quad.

   The space between DKH and Mumford Hall is quite wide. Tree-lined walks run parallel with the
   long buildings. Though these trees are substantial, they have not reached their maturity, which is
   significant. Once elms formed beautiful alleys of trees almost ninety feet tall that lined the cam-
   pus. They were one of the most striking features of the area. In the early 1950s Dutch elm disease
   caused the death of the trees:

           The University of Illinois was especially hard hit--a whopping 90 percent of campus trees
           were American elms. The elm catastrophe of the 1950s may be the single most devastating
           blow ever dealt to the beauty of the UI campus.

           A campus without trees was unthinkable. Experts such as horticulturist J. C. Blair and
           botanist C. F. Hottes credited trees with making the UI campus one of the nation's most
           beautiful. "Without them [the trees] to relieve the stern hues of the brick buildings and the
           monotonous level of the greensward, the campus would be as dull and uninteresting as the
           prairie," an observer remarked in 1908. . . .

           In a little over a decade, only 92 of the 1,850 campus elms remained, while all of the elms
           located on the Quad were wiped out.

                                                                                                                                                                              10

           Afterwards, the Quad resembled a blast zone (see figures 2.1.17 and 2.1.18).

   Alumni were greatly dismayed when they returned to their beloved university to find its character
   so much altered. Dutch elm disease caused the university to lose the building-landscape relation-
   ship that at maturity had created such a striking campus. Seemingly overnight the university had
   to reline its walks with trees. The new trees vary in species, much like those in other Midwestern

                                                                                                                                                                                                              11

   towns and cities, which have not planted singular species so as to avoid a similar catastrophe.

   Further north one comes to the primary libraries. The Main Library, again designed by Platt, has
   at its core a very clever idea. Instead of placing a single library in the geographic center of cam-
   pus, Platt decided that the nature of libraries, like the nature of research and knowledge, is to

11. Today, the Midwest is confronted with a new arbor epidemic caused by the spread of the emerald ash borer. Millions

grow. Thus, the problem of the library and its placement becomes an issue of both convenience
and symbol. Symbolically the library represents and houses the knowledge accumulated by our
culture. Indeed, all the research being generated by this great research institution is documented
and aspires to be included in the library--the great repository of human knowledge. What hap-
pens when a centrally planned library needs to expand? The problem was neatly solved by Platt
when he determined to build two structures that would face one another across the South Quad,
just south of Foellinger Auditorium. Each library would then be free to expand to the east or west.
One imagines that just like DKH and Mumford Hall, these libraries would have been similar but not
identical.

Every first-year student at Illinois learns of the Morrow Plots, whether through a song--often
sung by the a cappella group The Other Guys--or an orientation that the university has the oldest
continuous-use experimental farming soil in the Western Hemisphere: the Morrow Plots. Instead
of following Platt's notion of turning the space opposite the Main Library into a site for another
library, the university recognized its importance for research and prohibited its development. In
fact, extensive work has been undertaken to ensure that the crops grown on this site are not
adversely affected by any construction in the area. As "Morrow Plots Song" goes: "You can't throw

                                          12

shade on the corn." The Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB), dedicated in 2007,
illustrates the concern for casting shade on the Morrow Plots. Careful massing studies and strate-
gic construction led to the IGB being set back from the Morrow Plots while subtly reflecting

   stylistic aspects of the Main Library and Mumford Hall. In contrast to its more agricultural sur-
   roundings, the IGB houses a contemporary set of labs and learning facilities "where science meets

                      13

   society."

   Just to the north of the Morrow Plots stands the Astronomical Observatory, built in 1896. Despite
   its small size, its unique dome hovers above the plots as a sentinel searching the skies.

   Given the dilemma of desiring a central location and a need for expandability, it was decided to
   put the two-story Undergraduate Library underground. This choice allowed for both the symbolic
   centering of knowledge on campus and the opportunity for growth. The entrances flank a square
   central well that allows light down into the Undergraduate Library. The courtyard is known as the
   Edmund James Memorial Courtyard and contains quotations from his writings that focus on the
   importance of education, social service, and the power of books as sources of inspiration lining
   the cornice.

   The garden space has changed over time but still provides access to light and gives an opportunity
   for an outdoor break when studying. As new space is needed the library can expand either down
   or horizontally below grade--though today many books are housed off-site in storage facilities
   on Oak Street in Champaign. The collection has become very large--the forethought to plan for
   expansion has proven extremely wise. Overall the University Library is the fourth largest academic
   library by volumes in the United States.

   Today, much of the university book collection has been moved to Oak Street High Density Storage.
   The Oak Street Library at 809 South Oak Street now provides a full-service library circulation
   point and a research space for patrons. The Undergraduate Library closed in 2022. The space is
   being transformed into the Archives and Special Collections building. Allowing its keeping its use
   to match its symbolic location on campus.

   The rear facade of Foellinger Auditorium completes this walk. It is a mass of brick topped in cop-
   per. Though the rear of Foellinger is stark, it works with Gregory Hall and Smith Memorial Hall to
   close the South Quad. Paths on either side have a noticeable grade change leading into the Main
   Quad. It is interesting to note that the back side of Foellinger Auditorium used to be the location
   of the campus's most famous sculpture: the Alma Mater (relocated in 1962 by the Alumni Associa-

                14

   tion).

13. Behind the woman in robes with outstretched arms "stand the twin figures of Labor and Learning, joining hands in a
    bronze incarnation of the University's motto." When the statue was in its original location, "at night spotlights cast twin
    shadows of Labor and Learning onto the rear wall of the Auditorium, making them truly larger than life" (UIHistories,
    "Alma Mater").

     About the Walk

     Foellinger Auditorium and the Illini Union create focal points for the Main Quad. These are places
     for literal and symbolic coming together. The entire Main Quad is the real and symbolic center of the
     campus. The use of a sloping topography toward Boneyard Creek and its axial placement establishes
     the hierarchical placement of Foellinger Auditorium, while the Illini Union's southern veranda sur-
     mounted by a decorative cupola terminates the Main Quad's north side. The secondary axis of the
     Main Quad is the Daniel Street corridor leading to Krannert Center for the Performing Arts. This
     cross axis retains the memory of an old tram system and a tremendous east entry called the Centen-
     nial Plaza, which has changed over time.
     This walk begins in front of Foellinger Auditorium on the Main Quad located at 709 South Mathews
     Avenue in Urbana and ends at the Illini Union located at 1401 West Green Street in Urbana.

       From the earliest colleges of the colonial era to the land-grant universities of the frontier,
       the American campus has been a simulated city that, with few exceptions, is distinctly
       unlike European models. Loose arrangements of freestanding buildings meld with the
       landscape to suggest an almost urban space. Not all campuses possess clearly defined
       quadrangles, but the ones that do seem to be more focused and provocative. They also

                                                                                                                                                                                             1

       represent the most tangible tradition of enclosed urban space in the United States.

The Illinois campus is organized using two fundamental strategies involving figural solids and fig-
ural voids. These can be considered using two historic prototypes: The Acropolis of ancient Athens
is a figural solid that organizes space around it, and the Forum of ancient Rome organizes struc-
tures around a series of spatial voids (see figures 2.2.1 and 2.2.2).

The University of Illinois relies significantly on these two strategies. The Acropolis's equivalent at

Illinois is Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, which organizes the east side of the campus,
and the most notable Forum equivalent is the Main Quad (see figure 2.2.3).

  The Main Quad is a spatial void defined by the presence of buildings at its perimeter. Conceptually
  one might imagine filling the entire Quad with water and freezing it--the buildings acting like an
  enormous ice cube tray--and then the "ice cube" created in the shape of the Quad can be visu-
  alized (see figure 2.2.4). The Main Quad plays a significant role in the overall organization of the
  campus.

  The theologian and philosopher John Henry Newman offers one idea for a way to organize a uni-
  versity:

          If I were asked to describe as briefly and popularly as I could, what a University was, I
          should draw my answer from its ancient designation of a Studium Generale, or "School of
          Universal Learning." This description implies the assemblage of strangers from all parts in
          one spot; from all parts; else, how will you find professors and students for every depart-
          ment of knowledge? and in one spot; else, how can there be any school at all? Accordingly,
          in its simple and rudimental form, it is a school of knowledge of every kind, consisting of
          teachers and learners from every quarter. Many things are requisite to complete and sat-
          isfy the idea embodied in this description; but such as this a University seems to be in
          its essence, a place for the communication and circulation of thought, by means of per-

                                                                                                                                2

          of Liberal Arts and Sciences, is the real and symbolic center of the campus. It provides
          the one spot where all members of the university can gather. The space hosts organized
          and impromptu events that speak to the life of the university. The Quad is created by the
          surrounding buildings gathered together for the good of all. Each structure contributes to
          the overall quality of the space. Just as the strength of a university is the coming together
          of many disciplines, the Quad symbolizes the coming together of the disciplines to form
          something greater than the sum of its parts. It is a physical manifestation of John Henry
          Newman's "assemblage of strangers from all parts in one spot."

   felicity of interaction.
3. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences encompass the two great branches of knowledge: moral philosophy and natural
   philosophy. This knowledge of liberal arts and sciences predicate human freedom. The Main Quad embodies free indi­
   viduals coming together to create something of value together.

                                                                                                                                                                  Kevin J. Hinders | 56
  As such it is like the family table from the Norman Rockwell painting Freedom from Want (see figure
  2.2.5).

  The patriarch (presumably the Illini Union) sits at one end with the matriarch (Foellinger Audito-
  rium) at the other. In the Rockwell painting, it is presumed the grandmother will take her seat at
  the opposite end of the table from the patriarch, just as Foellinger Auditorium and the Illini Union
  create focal points for the Main Quad. Note that these, too, are places for literal and symbolic
  gathering and represent the coming together of different groups--they are collective buildings. In
  the painting, the rest of the family and friends--the various departments such as those for English,
  foreign languages, chemistry, etc., along with the administration, are represented at the table. As
  is the case with some large family gatherings, not everyone can be seated at the main table. Some
  other departments, like children at a Thanksgiving feast, need to sit in proximity but cannot fit at
  the head table. The Quad uses the topography and slope toward Boneyard Creek to establish the
  hierarchical placement of Foellinger Auditorium at the crest of the south end. The Illini Union cre-
  ates a southern veranda to view the Quad. One imagines that after the carving of Rockwell's turkey
  the patriarch and matriarch in the image will take their seats to commence with the feast.

                                                                                                                                                           4

  Foellinger Auditorium in fact acts as a bookend to two quadrangles. As has been discussed in

4. In a 1906 preliminary report and letter to the University Board of Trustees, Frederick Law Olmsted, who was working
   with Clarence H. Blackall, wrote:

          We note that the Trustees have evidently planned to have two rows of buildings, with an open campus between
          them extending southward from University Hall. It is not so evident, but we judge that it must have been the
          idea that this arrangement would extend to the cross row of new permanent farm buildings, a distance of over
          2400 feet. Mr. Blackall proposes to interrupt this extraordinarily long campus by placing the new Auditorium in
          the middle of it. One justification for thus breaking the long campus in two is found in the low crosswise ridge
          that breaks the view. This ridge could be eliminated by grading, and it has been suggested that this should be
          done. The ridge, however, should be preserved, and its presence does justify, from an architectural standpoint,
          the forming of two quadrangles in place of one. The Auditorium is designed as a permanent monumental build-
          ing--one which will be a beautiful object, symmetrical, grand in scale, and sufficiently elaborate in detail to be
          interesting and effective, when fully completed, from whichever side it is seen. It is manifestly such a building
          as is thoroughly well adapted to a central symmetrical, commanding position in respect to all other buildings
          in the vicinity. It is not such a building as can just as well take a place in a miscellaneous row of buildings. In
          architectural character it will correspond in symmetry and ornamental effect to the great Low Library Building
          which forms the architectural center of the group of principal buildings of Columbia University, and therefore
          will probably be located in the middle of the great south campus. We unhesitatingly approve of the general loca-
          tion proposed. We have one recommendation as to its location in detail. This is that the center of the dome
          be placed on the center line (extended) of Nevada Street. Heretofore no attention has been paid to relating the
          University buildings to the axis lines of intersecting streets. This we believe is a great mistake. The University
          grounds and the surrounding street system should be considered together from the esthetic point of view. The
          opportunity to place this fine dome so that it will be seen at the end of one street at least should not be lost.
          In determining the position of the center of the Auditorium east and west, we advise as follows: Lay out along

   57 | Part 2.2. Liberal Arts & Sciences and the Main Quad: The Symbolic Center
  part 2.1, Foellinger works with the Stock Pavilion to frame the South Quad. On the Main Quad,
  Foellinger's main entrance presents the space with a refined portico that welcomes people to
  gather and participate in lectures, presentations, and events. The dome, long a symbol of gather-
  ing, is not the location of the speaker, but rather where the audience gathers.

                                                                                                                                                                                            5

  Foellinger Auditorium is modeled on an ancient Roman structure called the Pantheon. Foellinger,
  like the Pantheon, is situated as a focal point in a figural space. The ancient precedent is a purely
  urban model, while the Illinois interpretation integrates landscape features. The Pantheon is a
  masonry/concrete structural system requiring thick walls, while Foellinger Auditorium has a steel
  structure and a brick exterior--thus the difference in the wall thicknesses (see figure 2.2.6).

                 Figure 2.2.6. Comparison of the plans and images of the Pantheon and Foellinger
                 Auditorium. The buildings are shown at the same scale.

          the east side of the new campus a new avenue with a double row of trees to correspond with Burrill Avenue.
          Burrill Avenue is not parallel with the Agricultural Building (Davenport Hall) and the meridian. Therefore the new
          avenue should converge slightly toward the Auditorium so that it and Burrill Avenue will be precisely symmetri-
          cal about the meridian line. The position of this avenue we determine arbitrarily by assuming that the east row of
          trees should be 50 feet from the middle of the west front of the Agricultural Building. The Auditorium should be
          in the middle of the space between the two avenues with its axis upon the meridian line. Tilton and O'Donnell,

5. The Pantheon is an archetype--an original pattern or thing that is then copied, transformed, or represented. The Uni­
   versity of Virginia's Rotunda Building, designed by Thomas Jefferson, is also inspired by the Pantheon.

                                                                                                                                                                  Kevin J. Hinders | 58
The facade of Foellinger Auditorium is also modeled on an ancient Roman archetype--the tri-
umphal arch (see figure 2.2.7).

                   Figure 2.2.7. Comparison of the Arch of Constantine and the Foellinger Auditorium
                   main entrance.

In the Pantheon model a front porch creates the entry to the cylindrical space and dome. Given
the need for a weather-enclosed foyer to Foellinger, a variation on a triumphal arch allows for a
grand processional entrance that celebrates the transition from the Quad to the hall while creat-
ing a dominant facade at the south end of the Quad's main axis. The architect has chosen to use
contrasting, two-story, limestone Ionic columns set in front of three arched, red brick entryways.
Similar to the Arch of Constantine, the facade is then embellished with decorative carvings and
details. To broaden the facade without causing it to become too high (which would block the view
of the dome) the columns are flanked by brick masses. These brick masses employ brick pilasters

59 | Part 2.2. Liberal Arts & Sciences and the Main Quad: The Symbolic Center
to frame windows in between. The two side masses work to establish a solidity to the edges of the
facade--effectively buttressing the composition and reinforcing the central axis and the voids for
the entry (see figure 2.2.8).

Heading north from the top of Foellinger's steps one descends to a plaza that overlooks the Quad.
The buildings lining the Quad respectfully sit back at a relatively uniform distance from sidewalks
lining both sides. Secondary spaces are then created between these walks and the buildings. Some
spaces incorporate yew hedges to mask bike racks or present extended entries to the Quad (Henry

                                                                                6

Administration Building for example).

The Main Quad is eclectic in comparison with the South Quad. Like a city built over time, the
Main Quad is composed of buildings that vary stylistically. Beginning with Lincoln Hall and mov-
ing clockwise, one can take a tour of these styles. Lincoln Hall is well known for its terra cotta
reliefs that depict the life of Illinois' most famous US president. This large structure is a Midwest
American translation of an Italian palace. Stylistically it merges the Prairie School with its Italian
precedent. The dramatically oversized cornice at the top emphasizes the horizontal extension of
the roof to cap the building.

6. For basic history of the buildings on the Main Quad see Kalev Leeturev's UIHistories Project.

                                                                                                  Kevin J. Hinders | 60
  The English Building was originally designed as the Women's Building by the famous New York firm
  McKim, Meade, and White and opened in 1905. An addition in 1913 supplied the distinctive colon-
  nade that faces the Quad. The Georgian style of the original structure is somewhat overshadowed
  by this two-story colonnade and the adjacent towers.

  Henry Administration Building--originally the College of Commerce and Business Administration
  Building--has three distinct pieces and awaits a fourth. The first was built along the Quad in 1913
  and has a stone base with second and third stories composed of red brick. Two-story pilasters are
  crowned with ornate carvings located on the Quad side. An addition was built a year later along
  Wright Street. In 1964 an addition was placed on the south side of these structures. Currently a
  parking lot occupies the area just north of the building where an addition would complete the
  composition. With its stone base and repetitive bays, the building gives a nod to classical archi-
  tecture, but again translated to fit the campus.

  Before the Illini Union was constructed, the site was occupied by University Hall. As early as 1906
  landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. had called for its replacement and had asked that

          Whenever University Hall is replaced by a larger and better building, the new University
          Hall should center on the axis of the Auditorium Building. The end pavilions of this future
          building should be designed so they will center one on Burrill Avenue and the other on the

                                          7

          new avenue.

  The building Olmsted describes is the Illini Union, whose construction was funded by the Works
  Progress Administration as part of a New Deal effort in the 1930s to employ people and create
  public works projects. Following Charles Platt's guidelines, the Georgian-style Union anchors the
  north end of the Main Quad. Even its name stresses the importance of the structure as a place
  to come together. The two cupolas, one overlooking Green Street and the other overlooking the
  Quad, stand as clock towers reminding students and faculty of the need for punctuality. At first
  glance, it is a symmetrical structure, and it was supposed to be just that. As early as 1906 the inten-
  tion was to eventually raze the adjacent Harker Hall and replace it with the Union's fourth and final
  pavilion.

  Harker Hall was designed by Nathan Clifford Ricker, the first graduate of the university's archi-
  tecture program (1873) and the School of Architecture's first head, and it is his first significant
  design. It is the second oldest building on campus (after Mumford House). This structure in the
  Second Empire style had a mansard roof until a lightning strike caused significant damage and it
  was replaced with a hipped roof. Because of its perceived significance, Harker Hall was placed on

the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Even so, it was gutted and renovated in 1992 to
house the University of Illinois Foundation. Once Harker Hall was designated a historic place, that
ended the idea that the Illini Union would be completed as imagined (see figure 2.2.9).

Noyes Lab is one of only a handful of Richardson Romanesque buildings on the Illinois campus.
This style developed by Henry Hobson Richardson became immensely popular in the United States
from the 1870s to World War I. The Noyes Lab entry displays a typical Richardson Romanesque
portal--a low arch with rough-hewn stone surround, flanked by grouped arches. The rest of the
structure is less distinguished. By 1916 the Chemistry Department had outgrown its building and
an addition was made along Mathews Avenue. In 1930 the Chemistry Annex opened to serve the

                                                                                                                                                               Kevin J. Hinders | 62
needs of the expanding discipline and a tunnel was created to connect the two buildings. This tun-
nel runs under what was once one of the most beautiful exterior spaces on campus.
There exists a secondary axis to the Main Quad. Running from Krannert Center for the Performing
Arts in the east, through the Quad, and west along Daniel Street is a major organizing cross axis
(see figure 2.1.9). This cross axis has significant thresholds prior to entering the Main Quad. The
east threshold was redesigned to mark the 100th anniversary of the university. Timed to corre-
spond to the opening of Krannert Center in 1969, this aptly named Centennial Plaza has seen sig-
nificant decay over the past decades. The plaza between Noyes Lab and the Chemistry Annex is
marked by urns at the eastern entry. A taller wall once separated the two buildings and created
intermediate spaces used for bike paths and bike parking. This wall has been lowered to less than
3 feet because of life-safety issues (the wall was seen as a place where would-be attackers could
hide while awaiting victims--this very real concern is an indication of predicaments faced as one
designs spaces). The space once had maple trees alternating with lampposts and benches. The
trees lining the walk were all of similar variety and height. The trees eventually grew together in
such a way as to create a horizontal canopy of green punctuated by rhythmic voids that let in
columns of light. The sense one had when walking through it and onto the Quad was one of inti-
macy as the space compressed before expanding (see figures 2.2.10 and 2.2.11).

But these trees have been dying, and it will be impossible to recreate that former splendor until
new trees are planted and then mature. To the west of the Quad the cross axis has a wide walk
framed by urns opening up onto Daniel Street. When the University of Illinois Bookstore was con-
structed, a stout tower was placed at the corner of Wright and Daniel Streets to help mark this
cross axis. The natural extension of the cross axis may eventually be when the university estab-
lishes a gate or portal at Fourth and Daniel Streets.

Davenport Hall has one of the largest footprints on the Quad. It uses the Palladian strategy of
a large central portico with two end pavilions linked to the center mass by a connecting wall of
classrooms and offices. The unique aspect of Davenport lies in the composition of the end pavil-
ions. Instead of emphasizing the pavilions' centers with a door or ornamented window, these
centers are downplayed. This curious decentering causes the viewer's eyes to be led around the
building instead of resting at a focal point.
The last building to consider is the Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics Building (LCLB; previously
the Foreign Languages Building). Many think it looks out of place. Built in the late 1960s and ded-

                                                                                                                                                               Kevin J. Hinders | 64
  icated in 1970, this structure is a simple brick mass that occupies the site of the old Entomology
  Building. The style associated with the structure has the unfortunate moniker Brutalist. Though
  stylistically and decoratively much different from the other buildings on the Main Quad, the LCLB's
  massing is similar in height to its neighbors, and it supports the spatial enclosure of the Quad.
  Extending the Rockwell analogy, one might think of the LCLB as a newcomer to the family trying
  to fit in.

  Knowing that elms once lined Burrill Avenue (now sometimes referred to as the Broadwalk) and
  that honey locusts once grouped together on the Quad somewhat changes the conception of the

Part 2.3. The Engineering Campus: A
Transformation of the Public Realm

        About the Walk

        The engineering campus includes the Bardeen Quad and the North Quad. Originally a set of unorga-
        nized structures, the area once referred to as "north of Green Street" has undergone a transforma-
        tion in the past twenty-five years. Structures that were previously independent and serviced by the
        street did not use to come together to form a collective space. The structures and landscape have
        been reorganized to create a series of interwoven spaces that tie back to the overall master plan.
        The redesign of Boneyard Creek and the creation of two shearing axes--one between the Illini Union
        and Kenney Gym and the other between Grainger Library and the Beckman Institute--are major
        accomplishments that add coherence to the public realm.
        This walk begins at the Illini Union located at 1401 West Green Street in Urbana and moves north
        through the Bardeen Quad and then on to the North Quad. The walk ends at the Beckman Institute
        located at 405 North Mathews Avenue in Urbana.

                                                                                                                                       1

          Welcome: The first experience that virtually any building should give the user is the expe-
          rience of welcome. It is natural for people when welcoming friends or family that they care
          for to hold out their arms and embrace the visitor. Buildings too can provide a sense of
          welcome to the visitor. This can be done by the building reaching out to "embrace" people,
          by providing shelter to them as they arrive, by making them feel safe and cared for when

                                                                                                                                                                          2

People at the university make a clear distinction between the areas north and south of Green
Street. Departments joke about the differences between the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
and the College of Engineering. The differences are more than topics of study and research dol-
lars--though both certainly play a role. Their physical attributes differ as well. South of Green

                                                                                                                                                               Kevin J. Hinders | 68
Street the plan of two axial quads was established by the early twentieth century. North of Green
Street is a different story. Initially the zone associated with engineering and related studies had
incremental growth and expansion without a clear vision for the creation of public space. Because
campus buildings in this area were relatively sparse, engineering administration sought to expand
both east and west and eventually north.

       Figure 2.3.1. Engineering, Liberal Arts and Sciences, and Agriculture diagram showing primary and
       secondary axes. Note the manner in which Green Street separates the Main and South Quads from
       the engineering campus. Read long description of figure.

Green Street bisects a broad swath of building front yards. This space is only a bit narrower than
the Main Quad, which has prompted some thoughts of its closure between Wright Street and Lin-
coln Avenue.
The Illini Union, with its central portico and circle drive, prepares one for entry into the Main

  Quad. Across the street are three buildings with similar setbacks: the Materials Science and Engi-
  neering Building at 1304 West Green Street, Engineering Hall at 1308 West Green Street, and
  Everitt Laboratory at 1406 West Green Street (see figure 2.3.2).

                      Figure 2.3.2. The Bardeen Quad. Read long description of figure.

  The jump from the 1300 block to the 1400 block indicates the former location of Burrill Avenue,
  which used to cut through campus, ran south to Pennsylvania Avenue, and was turned into the
  Broadwalk on the west side of the Main Quad. This avenue also extended north to Springfield
  Avenue. When the university sought to bring a greater sense of order and unity to the engineering
  campus, it started with this walkway between Everitt Lab and Engineering Hall. Frederick Law
  Olmsted hinted at the solution when he stated that the new building at the north end of the Main

                                                                                                                                                                       3

  Quad (now the Illini Union) should terminate Burrill Avenue with a pavilion. The Union uses this

3. The south-east corner pavilion was never built. Instead, Harker Hall was allowed to remain. Olmstead felt that the
                                                                                                                                                                  Kevin J. Hinders | 70
strategy on the north side. An axis is then extended to Springfield Avenue and terminates in a
flagpole and the mansard roof of the Kenney Gym Annex. The important dialogue struck between
these two buildings shifts the axis of the Main Quad over to the west and establishes an ordering
device for the area between Green Street and Springfield Avenue (see figure 2.3.1).

 Figure 2.3.3. Plaza.

Because of pedestrian safety concerns in the late 1990s, the university explored the notion that
Green Street might be redirected underneath this walkway so as to create an at-grade pedes-
trian crossing free from vehicular traffic. An advantage of this proposal was the introduction of a
500-car multilevel parking garage under the lawn to the north of the Illini Union. Two issues were
considered insurmountable obstacles: the proximity of Wright Street to the crossing would have
demanded a steep ramp west of the walkway to create a viaduct, and an early twentieth century
access tunnel under Green Street east of the proposed viaduct would have to be reworked at great
expense. Other considerations were the elimination of the bus stop in front of the Union and the
character change that putting a subterranean parking structure in front of the Union would have
on the existing trees and landscape. The Green Street corridor was subsequently reworked into
its current configuration in 2018.

Broadwalk should have a visual terminus in an Illini Union pavilion- the south-west corner of the Illini Union. This motif
would then be repeated on the north side of the Illini Union.
71 | Part 2.3. The Engineering Campus: A Transformation of the Public Realm
    Figure 2.3.4. The Boneyard Creek.

  Moving north along this axis one comes to several landscape features. The first is a plaza between
  Everitt Laboratory and Engineering Hall. This plaza allows axial and diagonal movement across the
  space as students travel north and south through campus and in and out of Campustown. The walk
  then narrows to allow passage over Boneyard Creek. Boneyard Creek's entry to the campus from
  the west marks its emergence from under Wright Street and its first appearance in Urbana. The
  university celebrates the creek with a series of terraces that connect the upper landscape with
  the water. As the Boneyard's flooding has become more controlled, its presence on campus has
  become less intrusive and much more pleasant. Figures 2.3.3-2.3.5 illustrate the spatial sequence
  from Green Street into the Bardeen Quad. The visual termination of the axis is the mansard roof
  of the Kenney Gym Annex and its flagpole.

  Crossing over the creek and continuing north one reaches the Bardeen Quad, named for Professor
  John Bardeen, the only person to have received the Nobel Prize twice for work in the same field

                       4

  (physics). After the university cleared buildings in the 1990s and early 2000s to make a dedi-

  cated public space, the College of Engineering had a large green quadrangle for the first time. The
  south end of the Bardeen Quad slopes to the Boneyard Creek terraces while the north edge is
  defined by the Grainger Engineering Library Information Center. On the east side is the Mechan-
  ical Engineering Laboratory, an amalgamation of structures including an early power house, labs,
  work areas, and office spaces. When plans to organize this part of campus were underway, it was
  clear that the eastern edge of what would become the Bardeen Quad would need a facelift, and
  the buildings received a unifying facade. Despite the aesthetic changes, the internal circulation of

                                                                                                                                        5

  the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory remains labyrinthian. On the west side is a symmetrical,
  four-story facade of brick and limestone. The curious two-story base with an entry calling out
  Materials Testing is mounted by a more elaborate arched structure with a central area proclaiming
  it to be the Arthur Newell Talbot Laboratory. The back sides of the Materials Science and Engi-
  neering Building, Engineering Hall, and Everitt Laboratory complete the southern partition of the
  space. Engineering Hall supports a plaza that encroaches into the Boneyard.

  Traveling north to enter the Bardeen Quad is compositionally interesting. Grainger Library is a
  symmetrical mass with two wings and an off-center, diminutive entry, complete with classical
  columns. From this vantage point Grainger Library appears to sit directly on the Bardeen Quad. In
  reality, only a portion of the south facade is on the quad. This visual "correction" creates a percep-
  tion of order for the viewer, even though the space is irregular, as can be seen from the vantage
  point of the western walkway (see figure 2.3.6).
  The Bardeen Quad hosts two sculptures of two different scales: Mananaan by Alexander Liberman
  and Computing the Future by J. Seward Johnson Jr. Mananaan is a large-scale, abstract sculpture

                              6

  of raw steel. It weighs 15 tons and is 26 feet tall. Computing the Future is a human-scale bronze.
  A painted male figure sits adjacent to Grainger Library's south entry, forever reading a book enti-
  tled The Future as his watch remains fixed at 11:25, to never advance. Mananaan works to pro-
  vide a focal point between the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory entry and Grainger Library. Its
  monumental scale is juxtaposed with the size of the Bardeen Quad and the people moving nearby,
  while Computing the Future sits casually trying to humanize the enormous library whose dedica-
  tion proceedings were entitled "Gateway to a New Era" (see figure 2.3.7).

As one approaches Springfield Avenue, a major shift in axis takes place. The Kenney Gym Annex
has terminated the north-south movement and a new axis is created to the east between a pavilion
of Grainger Library and the Beckman Institute to the north. Using the same strategy as the Illini
Union used to terminate the Burrill Avenue walkway to the south, Grainger sets its west pavilion
up to recenter the north campus (see figure 2.3.8).

Figure 2.3.7. Computing the Future by John Seward Johnson II, and Mananaan by Alexander Liberman. Scale
comparison between Mananaan and Computing the Future. The person walking in front of Mananaan is the
same size as "Grainger Bob," the nickname of the figure in Computing the Future.

The portico under a very low arch allows entry to the library from the north, which then recenters
the library patron to the center of the building. Meanwhile on the outside, the portico acts like
an enormous catcher's mitt, collecting the energy of the axis from the north. This energy is then
shifted slightly to the west, down the Broadwalk (see figure 2.3.1). Perspective views play an impor-
tant part in how the individual is helped to create a mental ordering for the spaces.
The axis from Grainger Library to the Beckman Institute is relatively new by university standards.
The Beckman Institute was constructed near the site of the first university building: Old Main Uni-
versity Hall. This space had more recently been home to a baseball field, and many adjacent sites
were vacant when the institute was completed in 1986. With the establishment of this axis it was
only a matter of time and money before the area would be further developed.

On the east side of the axis are three structures: the Digital Computing Library (DCL), the Nathan
M. Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory, and the Coordinated Science Laboratory. On the west
side north of Kenney Gym are the Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory (MNTL)--formerly the
Microelectronics Laboratory--and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Building (ECE). While
DCL and the Newmark Lab were given facelifts and additions, the Coordinated Science Labora-
tory, a large portion of MNTL, and ECE were constructed after Beckman. Once those structures
were in place, the axial extension from Grainger Library through the North Quad was completed.
As on the Bardeen Quad, there are sculptures on the North Quad. The most central is a sundial
with fountains entitled Upwells by Peter Luecking, which was executed in 1990 (see figure 2.3.9).

 Figure 2.3.9. Upwells by Peter Luecking

This bronze and granite statue is the focal point of a paved plaza. The gnomon of the sundial also
points to the North Star when viewed through the bronze sphere at night. A second sculpture is a
female figure entitled The Quintessential Engineer by Julie Rotblatt Amrany, dedicated in 2017 (see
figure 2.3.10).
She stands on three shifted granite hexagons that are engraved with the terms "pioneering," "inno-

vative," "resilient," "passionate," "inspirational," "intelligent," "courageous," "and confident." Behind
her is a bronze plaque citing the "Women Engineers of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Cham-
paign." The figure is placed opposite the entry to Newmark Lab in a shallow niche/plaza to create
balance about the North Quad axis.

The Beckman Institute is a massive construction housing offices and labs: "The Arnold O. and
Mabel M. Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois was
conceived early in 1983, when campus administrators decided to assemble a proposal for a unique

new venture in multidisciplinary research at the university."

The building forms an edge to the campus along University Avenue. On its south face, centrally
located and fixing the north-south axis is a five-story tower that houses conference rooms over
the main entry. The parti of the building is simple. Laboratories located on the north side are

                                                                                       Kevin J. Hinders | 78
linked to offices across a four-story atrium by eleven bridges. These bridges are both useful and
symbolic. Not only do they facilitate movement but they represent the very idea of the building:
that by separating these uses individuals might interface with their peers to create new and inno-
vative research opportunities. The atrium becomes like a main street and the bridges have fur-
nished lounges to encourage discussion and interaction.

For all its good intentions and laudable research the building has a fundamental flaw at the campus
planning level. It internalizes the campus instead of opening the university to its neighbors. The
extensive wall along University Avenue is devoid of public portals. Rather, the building turns its
back to University Avenue and the people to the north and even extends a metal fence to the west

  that runs to Wright Street. This offensive act has not gone unnoticed by its neighbors. Loss of the
  larger context also occurs inside the building. The axis does not terminate in a substantial flour-
  ish and instead ends in a woven tapestry entitled Colored Ribbons by Dorothy Replinger (see figure
  2.3.11).
  Though the tapestry is beautiful it is not at a scale appropriate with the axis of the Main Quad to
  the south. Behind the wall on which the tapestry hangs are fire stairs (see figure 2.3.12).
  These fundamental design oversights might be overcome should the university choose to address
  the problem. It has been suggested that a large-scale portal could be incorporated into the north
  facade, which would allow passage through the laboratory wing into the atrium. This gesture of
  welcome would be a more fitting representation of the idea of a university as a gathering place for
  all those interested in study, research, and service (see figure 2.3.13).

  Other quadrangles on campus have a noted cross axis. On the South Quad it is the military axis. On
  the Main Quad it is the axis that extends from Krannert Center toward Daniel Street. Between the
  Bardeen Quad and the North Quad there is Springfield Avenue, which appropriately links Cham-
  paign and Urbana both literally and conceptually back to the state capital in Springfield. This does
  not act as a cross axis through a quadrangle however. It serves more to separate the two distinct
  spaces. For the Bardeen Quad one might take the Boneyard Creek as a cross axis, especially as it
  connects into the pedestrian and bicycle ways that traverse Campustown north of Green Street.
  The North Quad developed a cross axis of its own when the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Com-
  puter Science and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications created a courtyard com-
  position that extended a cross axis into Urbana's Main Street. This cross axis splits the Upwells
  sculpture with the telescopic globe to the south and the gnomon to the north. To the west is a

porates the mechanical intake systems for ECE softened with plants. Though this is pleasant, the
opportunity to celebrate this cross axis has been, at least for the time being, left unfulfilled. ECE
has a grand loggia and trellis on its south side. Functionally this trellis shades the glass facade in
the warmer months while allowing sunlight to penetrate in the winter months, which helps heat
the building. The trellis could serve also as a means to gather people moving from the west into
the North Quad. The landscaped space between ECE and MNTL does not significantly address the
connection to White Street (see figures 2.3.14 and 2.3.15).

One of America's greatest contributions to the design of the built environment is its university
campuses and their public spaces. It has been shown that campuses are forever a work in progress,
changing and adapting to meet the needs of the day and the hopes for the future. The engineering
campus provides insight into the transformation by incremental growth using strategies for the
creation of functional structures in support of attractive public spaces.

PART 3. THE UNIVERSITY CONTEXT

             Overview

             Perhaps unknown to many Illinois residents is a small town in Ohio named Urbana, which is
             the county seat of Champaign County. Years ago, as a reflection of the nation's attitude
             toward Manifest Destiny, a group of settlers left their home in west-central Ohio long
             before Horace Greeley's exhortation "Go west, young man." One of these settlers eventually
             saw fit to name Champaign County after his place of origin. Later, as a major railroad was
             being planned, an area of what was called West Urbana--now Champaign--was established.
             A discussion of territorial expansion based on the one-mile grid established as law under
             Thomas Jefferson (then secretary of state) and the Land Ordinance of 1785, which led to the
             Public Land Survey System, will contextualize the placement of both Urbana and Champaign
             and form the background for part 3.

The single greatest influence on the built environment in the United States was determined over
200 years ago shortly after the founding of the new country. Eager to provide a system for the
sale of lands that could supply the new nation with much needed funding, the Land Ordinance of
1785 laid the policy for land subdivision and subsequent sale. Thomas Jefferson, as a member of
the Continental Congress, wrote the Ordinance of 1784, which later became the Land Ordinance of
1785, passed by Congress. Jefferson's influence can readily be seen throughout Champaign County,
the Midwest, and the lands west of the Allegheny Mountains.

       The American Continental grid was originally established by the Continental Congress of
       1785. It provided a pattern of six-mile square townships subdivided into one-mile square
       sections. This pattern of land survey was conceived to bring about the orderly settlement
       of the expansive Northwest Territory, those western colonial lands won from the British in
       the Revolutionary War and ceded by the colonial states to their new national government.
       It was subsequently extended into all of the new territories that would one day make up
       the 48 continental United States.

       This grid constitutes the most pervasive urban-rural form in the United States. The trace
       of a giant-order Cartesian geometry on the landscape, it extends inexorably from the
       western slopes of the Allegheny Mountains north, south, and west to our nation's borders.

  George Washington, in his first address to Congress on January 2, 1790, stressed the need for a
  uniform system of weights and measures. There were such discrepancies that measurements in
  one state were dramatically different from those in another. Without a uniform national system,
  trade was greatly inhibited and quarreling among states was common. Congress charged the first
  secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson (who had the role from 1789 to 1793), with the creation of a

                                                                                                                    2

  uniform system of currency, weights, and measures. Jefferson, recently returned from Paris, had
  spent five years in France, where he interacted with members of the Académie des Sciences. Jef-
  ferson was well suited to the task, which he undertook with enthusiasm.

                      Figure 3.2. Township Diagram.

  During the first half of 1790 Jefferson worked out a decimal system for weights and measures that
  predated the French adoption of its metric system in 1793. His system was plain and elegant as it
  tied distance, weight, and currency together. Both Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton recognized

                                                                                                                                                                                                     3

   85 | Part 3. The University Context
For approximately ten years the process for measuring land for public sale was held up. The cause

of this delay was twofold: first, the Native populations banded together to create the Western Con-

federacy (composed of at least a dozen nations including the Miami, Wyandot, and Delaware). By

1790 the Western Confederacy had begun to inhibit settlers from moving into the area. Second,

                                                                             4

Congressional inaction was an issue. Without an agreed-on means, the plotting and measurement

                                                                                   5

of land based on a grid was impossible.

                Figure 3.3. Township Subdivision Diagram.

Three treaties signed in 1794-95 addressed one issue. After the defeat of the Western Confederacy

at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, one treaty forced "the Confederacy to acknowledge U.S. sover-

eignty over its land and to allow settlement up to a line from the mouth of the Kentucky River to

                      6

Lake Erie." The Jay Treaty with Britain (1794) gave the US the opportunity to occupy Detroit and

the northern frontier territory, while the Treaty of San Lorenzo gave the US freedom of navigation

  on the Mississippi River and access to New Orleans as a port. These three agreements allowed new
  settlers to move into western lands at a scale previously not possible.

  Meanwhile Congress had dithered with Jefferson's proposal and no new system of weights and
  measures had been approved. Though the French government had attempted to reach out to the
  US to share its new metric system in 1794, its emissary was not able to present the materials to
  Congress. Thus, the US missed the opportunity to become the second country in the world to

                                                           7

  adopt the metric system. Instead, Congress quickly passed "an Act for the sale of land of the
  United States in the territory northwest of the River Ohio, and above the mouth of the Kentucky

                 8

  River."
  With this legislation Congress opened up western expansion and determined the grid would be

   1794. A storm drove Dombey's ship, the Soon, off course and instead of arriving in Philadelphia Dombey was prevented
   from reaching America at all. He instead died in prison in the Caribbean in Plymouth Montserrat. Thus the message
   from Maximilien Robespierre and the correspondence from the Committee of Public Instruction along with a ceremo­
   nial copper metric rod and a kilogram weight were never formally presented to the US (see Linklater, Measuring Amer­
   ica, 133-42).

measured in neither Jefferson's decimal system nor the French metric system. Instead it was mea-
sured using Gunter's chain, which was based on feet, inches, yards, and miles. Starting with Ohio,
the lands were surveyed with an unprecedented regularity that stretched a grid across the United
States.
To facilitate the measurement of the land the territories were divided into survey townships that
were 6 miles by 6 miles square. These townships were then subdivided by a 1-mile grid, which
created a 36-square-mile area with thirty-six subdivisions. The parallel east-west dividing lines
are called township lines, while the parallel north-south dividing lines are called range lines. This
measuring technique has left an indelible mark on the built landscape in America--and particularly
the prairie (see figures 3.2-3.5).

                                          The range lines established on the 1-mile grid are

                                          lines are the major east-west streets. Once beyond
                                          the city these lines typically become county roads,

Champaign and Urbana are just two communities that owe their form to the ideals and pragmatics
of the continental grid. With the exception of precolonial and colonial settlements and the unique
instances of topography found in mountain ranges and dramatic floodplains, the grid has influ-
enced the selling of property and consistently forms the single most significant impact on the built
environment across the United States.

Part 3.1. Champaign: Railroad Town

     About the Walk

     Champaign is a railroad town shifted off the US continental grid to align with railroad tracks planned
     in 1851. This grid shift occupies 80 acres (a quarter mile from Neil Street to First Street and a half
     mile from Washington Street to Springfield Avenue) of downtown Champaign. The only aberration in
     this shifted grid is University Avenue, which extends the continental grid through Champaign and
     divides the 80 acres in half. The downtown has seen three different train stations where this walk
     starts. This walk clarifies the rationale for the placement of Main Street, city hall, industry and the
     major public institutions including parks, churches, libraries, theaters, and the commercial center.
     This walk begins at Illinois Terminal, the Champaign Intermodal Transportation Center located at 45
     East University Avenue in Champaign. The walk encircles downtown Champaign and terminates on
     Main Street.

         Part 3.1. Orientation Map.

89 | Part 3.1. Champaign: Railroad Town
Champaign (originally West Urbana) is the product of the US continental grid, land speculation,
and the construction of the Illinois Central Railroad (ICR). Today, the continental grid envelops the
80 acres that originally formed the town (see figure 3.1.1).

 Figure 3.1.1. Champaign map in 2020 with the original 80 acres called out. The 80 acres are bounded to the
 north by Washington Street, to the east by First Street, to the south by Springfield Avenue, and to the west by
 Neil Street.

University Avenue runs parallel with Springfield Avenue--one of the mile-by-mile roads that marks
this grid and mentally ties Champaign back to the nation's capital in the east. This grid extends
south with Florida/Kirby Avenue, Windsor Road, Church Street, etc. and west with Prospect
Avenue, Mattis Avenue, Duncan Road, Staley Road, etc. until the grid is simply marked by a numeric
system of county roads in the rural countryside (as shown in figure 3.5). University Avenue was
originally known as East and West Main Street (confusingly, there was also a Main Street located

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 90
  two blocks north, which today is the two-block street still named Main Street). This grid line phe-
  nomenally connects the citizen back to Washington, DC, but not before passing Urbana, Ohio,
  which is the seat of that state's Champaign County. In fact, the naming of Urbana in Illinois traces
  back to this Ohio area through State Senator John Vance, who named it after his hometown in
  Ohio. Thus, one can trace the westward expansion of the US through Urbana-Champaign as the
  continental grid marches westward from Ohio to the Pacific Ocean.

  The town of Champaign is part of a system of railroad towns created by the ICR that were laid out
  12 to 15 miles apart so farms would be within a half day's journey.

          In 1850 Illinois politicians, including Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, pressured
          the federal government to agree to give Federal lands to the State of Illinois. These lands
          would be used as a financial incentive, through state-issued charters to companies, to
          build railroads. Financiers would put up the cash to build a railroad, and in turn, they got
          vast amounts of land to sell along their railroad's right-of-way. President Fillmore signed in
          1850 legislation so that states could issue charters of federal lands, and the State of Illinois
          chartered the Illinois Central in 1851. It gave the proposed owners 4,060 square miles of

                                                                                      1

          land, nearly 10 percent of Illinois.

  The ICR originally planned to connect Cairo in southern Illinois with LaSalle and then to Galena
  in the northwestern part of the state. Senator Stephen A. Douglas owned land south of Chicago
  and got a change in the original charter to construct a branch to connect Chicago via east central

                                                                                                                   2

  Illinois to the main line at Centralia (see figure 3.1.2).

  Because of the topography, cost, or land acquisition it was decided to locate the railroad several
  miles west of Urbana. At first, this town was called West Urbana and was little more than a muddy
  slough, but with the building of the railroad came speculation and growth. In 1861 Champaign
  incorporated as a separate local government.

  New towns along the ICR tracks share remarkable characteristics. Because of the need for the rail-
  road to connect and move through the landscape with the greatest ease, the tracks do not coin-
  cide with the continental grid. As a result there exists an interesting juxtaposition of the grid of
  the town with the tracks and how this grid interfaces with the continental grid. The purchase of
  land for the railroad typically postdated the sale of land to settlers in Illinois. Speculators often
  purchased farmland with the hope that the railroad would choose a specific path and then would
  purchase their land at an increased cost while surrounding land would also increase in value. As

   of the built environment in Champaign. Jefferson's grid is ubiquitous while Abraham Lincoln assisted the ICR in it legal
   endeavors to negotiate the creation of railroad lines across the state.

  an example, Colonel M. W. Busey purchased 80 acres for an estimated $100 in 1848 that were sold
  to the ICR for $1600 in 1852. This purchase was bounded by Washington Street to the north, First
  Street to the east, Springfield Avenue (Springfield and First Street denote the continental grid) to
  the south, and Neil Street to the west. The tract is bifurcated into two 40-acre tracts by University
  Avenue. With the exception of University Avenue, downtown Champaign does not adhere to the
  continental grid. The railroad, after purchasing this property, created four streets to run parallel
  to the tracks: Oak Street, Locust Street (east of the tracks), Chestnut Street, and Walnut Street
  (west of the tracks). In Champaign, Oak Street is no longer present in downtown but can be seen
  both to the north and to the south. In the city center Oak Street was absorbed by the railway when
  its right-of-way was expanded to the east. Up and down the ICR route this naming pattern for

Finally, before beginning a tour of Champaign it is appropriate to address the manner in which a
railroad divides a community. A quick search of the Internet reveals a myriad of songs addressing
the presence of two sides of town. In the song "The Leader of the Pack" the Shangri-Las lament
the social divide:

       My folks were always putting him down

                                                                                                                  4

       They said he came from the wrong side of town.

James Brown, Guy Clark, Motörhead, Iggy and the Stooges, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Sting are
just a few of the musicians (and their represented genres) who have used "the wrong side of the
tracks" to describe this social and physical divide like the Kinks do:

          We're just slum kids, and we know it,

          And we never stood a chance.

          We were dragged up from the gutter,

          From the wrong side of the tracks.

          So how dare you criticize,

          When you don't know what it's like

          To be dragged up from the gutter,

                                                                                         5

          From the wrong side of the tracks.

  This divide is both real and symbolic. It derives from a very simple, practical condition. In any
  town, physical aspects determine the layout. Given that railroad towns are relatively flat where the
  tracks come through, the topographical influence in Illinois is minimal, so the major determinate
  to a desirable side of the tracks is most often determined by the direction of prevailing winds. In
  Champaign County the prevailing winds move west to east. It was common practice for the more
  affluent to live upwind of the tracks to avoid the smoke and pollution produced by the trains and
  industry. This condition is repeated throughout the US. Thus the west side of the ICR tracks are
  where the commercial and more affluent residences are located, while the factories and less afflu-
  ent are on the east side. Amusingly for Champaign residents, this pollution is sent east to the peo-
  ples of Urbana.

  We begin at the flagpole outside the Illinois Terminal, a multimodal transportation hub that links
  train, bus, pedestrian, and automobile traffic. From this spot one can see three Champaign train
  stations. They are like the three bears from the Goldilocks story. The Baby Bear is the oldest exist-
  ing station. It was built in 1899 (the architect of this station was Francis Bacon, supervising archi-
  tect of the ICR from the mid-1890s to 1907) following a fire that destroyed its predecessor. This
  station is now located at 320 North Chestnut Street and was moved using log rollers from its pre-
  vious spot so that a new station could be dedicated in 1924. This small station was renovated in
  2015 and is now a popular restaurant. The Momma Bear is a 1924 neoclassical station located at 116

Roosevelt and President Diaz of Mexico all spoke from its platform. The Liberty Bell was also displayed there on its way
to the St. Louis exposition. On July 2, 1923, many changes began taking place around the Champaign train station. The
old depot was settled onto its new foundation that day, after having been moved 114 feet north of its original location.
Even when moving, it remained in service with hoses providing gas and water. On August 9, 1924, the new Champaign
train station was dedicated. The depot served as many as seven trains and included a waiting room, smoking room,
ticket office, railroad offices and dining facilities. Along with the construction of the depot, the track was elevated to
relieve track congestion. The earth for this project was dredged from the section that passes through Paxton" (Cham­

  Moving west along University Avenue, the first structure on the south side is the Traction Building,
  constructed in 1909. It operated as the Illinois headquarters of the Illinois Traction System, later

  passenger and freight business in central Illinois. Champaign lines ran to Danville from 1902 to
  1953 and to Decatur from 1907 to 1955. These lines linked to rail services that extended to Peoria
  and all the way to St. Louis. The service also had an affiliated set of electric streetcars that pro-
  vided local service in many cities. With the growth of the automobile and highway systems the
  passenger traffic on the ITC greatly declined, and the ITC was eventually bought out and absorbed
  into larger rail freight providers. Its successor is the Norfolk and Western Railway.

   of its construction it was the tallest building in Champaign. The irregular site was previously occu-
   pied by a red brick multistory building. In 1937 it was replaced by an art deco building that acted
   as city hall and included a fire station and police station. The fire department vacated to 207 West

   along University Avenue. The structure elegantly incorporates the grid shift created by the rail-
   road and the continental grid presence by incorporating an octagonal tower topped in patina cop-
   per. This tower mediates both grids while giving the Champaign City Building an important figural
   presence, symbolically anchoring downtown Champaign and establishing its place in the conti-
   nental grid (see figures 3.1.5-3.1.8).

   Moving north up Neil Street one sees the care invested in placing concrete pavers and tree grates
   and landscaping the corridor. Neil Street beginning at University Avenue marks the former area of
   Champaign's downtown mall (1975-88), which extended from University to Church/Main Street.

   paign attempted to make downtown more pedestrian friendly by closing one area to vehicular
   traffic. A space-frame structure was erected at the intersection of Park Avenue and Neil Streets.
   Champaign's downtown was decimated relatively late compared with many towns in the Midwest,
   but the decision to close Neil Street was quickly viewed as disastrous as the area continued to
   struggle. By the early 1990s few people visited downtown even though planners and city com-
   missions made conscious decisions to encourage people to consider downtown as an attractive
   evening venue. The two greatest of these decisions were Champaign's arrangement to issue liquor
   licenses to incentivize redevelopment and the subsequent resolution to invest in its streetscape
   program. T. J. Blakeman, a City of Champaign planner, was quoted in a 2015 News-Gazette article:

          "That's what started fueling the restaurant and bar increase," Blakeman said, "which, in
          turn, really became the foundation for what the whole renovation has become, which is
          more of an entertainment district in the evening and employment district during the day.
          . . . In 1997, there were 11 bars and restaurants. By 2007, there were 31. I just counted: 43

   near freeways would be selected for mall development. The freeways would facilitate easy transportation of goods and
   bring consumers from smaller towns to shop. The reality is that these commercial malls assisted in decimating the local
   economies of small towns. Like many malls, Market Place is based on the idea of a climate-controlled pedestrian street
   mimicking a downtown. Market Place, however, is the same approximate size as the entire downtown Champaign shop­
   ping area.

   In 2025, the city boasted the number of locally owned bars and restaurants in downtown Cham-
   paign numbered 35 and the number is growing as the city continues to recover from Covid 19 dif-
   ficulties.

   Champaign owes its resurgence to a calculated investment in bars and restaurants that reversed
   the negative connotations of downtown. The city now balances a "work by day, play by night"

   One block north of University is Park Avenue. Park is the most common nonnumerical street

   name in America. From Neil moving west on Park Avenue one crosses Randolph (northbound)
   and State (southbound) Streets. These streets were made one way to facilitate movement past the
   city. Intended to speed vehicular traffic, this street couplet allows people traveling by car to bypass
   downtown. Together with the pedestrian mall, they aided in the deterioration of the downtown
   built environment. Traffic engineering may sometimes consider the speed of movement while not
   taking into account the repercussions to the quality of affected places they affect (see part 3.3).

12. T. J. Blakeman, a City of Champaign planner, provided data from his research: in 2003 the average number of food and
    beverage establishments in downtown Champaign was 20 with annual sales of $9.5 million; in 2016 the average number
    of these establishments was 43 with annual sales of $36.9 million.

   elaborate fantasy retreats for movie patrons to enjoy. These theaters, built in the 1920s, appealed
   to the public as they created a backdrop where the adage "the show starts on the sidewalk" could
   be realized. Many of these theaters came on hard times during the Great Depression in the 1930s
   and even more found themselves the victims of urban blight and urban renewal in the 1960s and

1970s. Adding to these problems was the calculated business move of suburban theaters to build
multiplexes capable of showing movies on multiple screens and sized to accommodate varying
numbers of patrons. These suburban competitors often outbid downtown theaters for the right to
show premier movies, which left downtown theaters without movie draws to fill their large spaces.
Today, many of these surviving theaters have been restored by communities seeking to preserve
these palaces of entertainment.

   Dutch-A Jump for Joy by artist Gary Bibbs. The park serves as a place of both passive and active
   recreation. Students from nearby Central High School still use it for physical recreation classes
   on occasion. A playground located in the northeast quadrant is often used by preschoolers from
   nearby day care centers. Today West Side Park is bordered by structures with numerous uses.
   Originally two types were prominent: residences and churches.

   The residences surrounding West Side Park were grand affairs. Mansions lined University Avenue
   as it stretched westward and two notable homes still sit along Elm Street on the park's west edge,
   although both have been turned into funeral homes. The large, Queen Anne style, white clapboard
   Ross Mattis House at 201 North Elm Street is now used by Heath and Vaughn Funeral Home, while
   the Owens Funeral Home at 101 North Elm Street occupies the classical, brick and stone Trevett
   residence (Trevett was a business partner in the Trevett-Mattis Bank whose facade remains at 112
   West Church Street). At one time, large homes with grand interior living spaces on the first floor
   and numerous rooms above were popular for renovation into funeral homes in many Midwestern
   cities. One can speculate that although a person may not have been able to afford to live in such a
   grandiose home when they were alive, they could have the opportunity to have a temporary stay
   when deceased.

   The appropriately named Church Street on the park's north side has two prominent structures at
   the intersection with State Street (see figure 3.1.11).

   On the northeast corner is the First United Methodist Church and to the west is the First Presby-
   terian Church. Farther west, a block past the park is the First Church of Christ, Scientist. On the
   southern side of the park is the Emmanuel Memorial Episcopal Church and one block south of the
   park is Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church. In addition, the First Baptist Church of Champaign was
   located at the northeast corner of Randolph Street and West University. The First Baptist congre-

Churches in the Midwest are often strategically located adjacent to commercial areas. Six-days-
a-week cities thrived on business but Sundays in the Christian tradition were reserved for rest.
Businesses were closed and "blue laws," which restricted certain activities, often limited sales of

sons. First is the deterioration of downtown. Second is the need for automobile access. Third is the desire to locate
closer to congregation members as people moved from downtown. Last is the need for expanded facilities such as
schools and day care centers, which require more land than what was available in a downtown. In some cases, the down­
town facility would remain and a new offshoot would be created to serve the community in a new location. In Cham­
paign, for example, St. Matthew Roman Catholic Church was formed by members of Holy Cross Church in the 1960s
on 10 acres of farmland donated for that purpose. St. Matthew's school was constructed by 1964, followed by a church
sanctuary in 1978.

    alcohol. On Sundays church attendees could rely on the parking spaces used the other six days a
    week for commerce. A synergy existed between religion and commerce.

    Two other building types once held a very important presence on West Side Park. The Burnham
    Athenaeum at 306 West Church Street was built in the classical style with two-story Ionic columns
    at the entry in 1896 from a donation by Albert C. Burnham. The building was used by the Cham-
    paign Public Library until 1977 when it moved to a larger facility at 505 South Randolph Street
    (designed by Hammond Beeby and Associates) and then moved again in 2008 when a new library
    (designed by Ross Barney Architects) approximately three times larger than its predecessor was
    opened near the same location. The Burnham Atheneum was converted by the law office of Meyer

                                                                                                                    19

    Capel, which has occupied the building since 1980. At the northwest corner of Elm and Church
    was a mansion that in 1938 was converted to the McKinley YMCA. Though replaced as the commu-
    nity YMCA in 2010, the YMCA's presence added to the community for 72 years. The new Stephens
    Family YMCA, located in suburban Champaign, replaced the aging structure that had been out-
    grown. Significantly, the Stephens Family YMCA building is not located near downtown Cham-
    paign.

    The demolition of the McKinley YMCA building in 2019 was the result of a Champaign Central High
    School renovation and expansion project. The choice to "keep Central central" was a rallying cry
    that helped the Champaign Unit 4 School District get financial backing to purchase properties that

                                                                                          20

    doubled Central High School's acreage.

    Libraries, churches, social organizations, and parks form a significant community aspect of a city.
    Together they represent the ideals of providing for a healthy mind, healthy body, and healthy spirit
    adjacent to the downtown business district. This set of community values was reflected in the built
    environment created by Champaign's founders and its philanthropists. Each edifice symbolized a
    community's commitment to its citizens through both private and public gestures.

    With the passage of time, a community's values can change and so can its needs. Changes along
    Church Street/Main Street in Champaign reflect the city's physical adaptations to societal shifts.
    Returning toward the train station along Church Street one sees a large brick and stone building
    sited at 301 North Randolph Street at the Church Street intersection. Owned by the Champaign
    Park District since 1991, this building is the Springer Cultural Center, where cultural, recreational,
    and educational programs for all ages as well as workshops, lectures, exhibits, and performances
    are offered (see figure 3.1.12).

19. After Meyer Capel began converting the structure an arsonist set a fire that damaged the interior and roof in October
     1979 (Meyer Capel, "Burnham Athenaeum").

20. The McKinley YMCA property was not the only noteworthy structure to be razed. Community outcries to "save the
     Burnham" along with two other homes were not enough to keep the Burnham mansion at 603 West Church Street from
     demolition. Preservationists were unable to secure financing to move the structure to a nearby vacant lot.

   This structure was formerly the US Post Office. Constructed in 1905 in the Beaux-Arts style, this
   building has seen numerous additions and alterations. Its main floor sits almost a full story above
   the street and is accessed by a prominent staircase to the marble lobby. As the US Post Office, this
   building was created for handling mail and to provide a symbolic presence of the federal govern-
   ment. Changes in mail distribution, including shipping accessibility, led to the need for new facili-
   ties. In 1966, after it was no longer used as a post office it was converted for alternative functions
   and took on the name the Federal Building, reflecting its historic use and symbolic presence. The
   solidity of the structure, built of brick and stone and raised above street level, was a conscious

                                                                                                                                                                                21

   effort by the federal government to pronounce its solid presence in Champaign.

   To the direct south of the Springer Cultural Center is a large parking lot. This site was once the
   home of a multistory garage that had a bridge connection over Randolph Street to Champaign's
   largest department store: Robeson's. Signs of the bridge can still be discerned in the brick work
   on the building's west facade. Robeson's served Champaign for 116 years and was the last family-

21. Federal presence was important to the citizens of a community. Stories exist of towns in Texas where the federal gov­
    ernment built oversized courthouses to intentionally bring peace to the West. Within a short time, the wild character
    was replaced with civility as ruffians were forced to either abide or move on.
                                                                                                                                                                  Kevin J. Hinders | 106
   owned department store in Illinois. Robeson's closed in 1990 because of the competition from big

                                                   22

   box stores and malls. The building is now leased to a variety of businesses on the ground floor
   with office space above.

   On the north side across from the former Robeson's location is the Art Theater, originally known
   as the Park Theater. Built in 1913 specifically for cinema, it originally seated 600 people. With alter-
   ations and remodeling it shrank to seat 250 people. The Art has had an interesting history as it
   has adapted to the times. From 1971 to 1986 it was an adults-only movie house. In 1987 it reopened
   as the New Art Theater and began showing art and foreign films to a devoted audience. In 2012 it
   became a co-op and in 2017 it merged with the Art Film Foundation to become a recognized non-

                                               23

   profit organization. The Art Theater regularly played independent, foreign, and short films until
   October 2019 when it closed. Although the owner tried to locate another theater operator to lease
   the building, after ten months and with the COVID-19 pandemic still requiring social distancing
   he determined there was no market for a theater in the structure and came to the conclusion to

              24

   sell. In 2025 it remains vacant and for sale.

   Farther east across the parking lot is the facade of the Trevett-Mattis Bank, which became the
   Bank of Illinois in 1963. This facade was removed when the building was demolished and then was
   incorporated into the design of the M2 Building when it was constructed at 301 North Neil Street
   from 2007 to 2009.

   The intersection at North Neil Street, Church Street, and Main Street has undergone a dramatic
   transformation that reflects the resurgence of downtown Champaign since the early 1990s. This
   five-corners intersection was home to the Flatiron Building, also known as the Gazette Building,
   between Neil and Hickory Streets from 1909 to 1969. The Gazette Building was torn down to pro-
   vide parking for nearby businesses such as Sears and Roebuck (which soon moved out to the new
   Market Place Mall by Interstate 74 in 1975). Eventually Hickory Street was removed and the current
   park/parking lot is the result. One Main Plaza and M2, created and managed by One Main Devel-
   opment, occupy the two northern sites. The mixed-use One Main Plaza, completed in 2004, was
   designed with ground-level retail, second- and third-story offices, and twenty-three condomini-
   ums above, while the nine-story mixed-use M2 Building has commercial and office activities on
   floors one through four with living units above. M2 has a connection to the 123 West Hill Street
   parking deck, which was built by the city to consolidate parking away from surface lots to allow
   for continued downtown growth.

    will not be a movie theater" (Singer, "Art Theater Owner").

     107 | Part 3.1. Champaign: Railroad Town
    The newest addition to this intersection is the Hyatt Place Hotel, which opened in 2014. The hotel
    is constructed on a lot that had been vacant since a cold November day in 2008 when a fire
    destroyed the handsome Italianate Metropolitan Building (built in 1871), which was just finishing a
    substantial renovation.

    Between Neil Street and Walnut Street are shop fronts and former sites of two notable businesses.
    The News-Gazette and the First National Bank had provided services to the Champaign community

                                                                      25

    from this block for decades. Originally the Urbana Union, founded in 1852, the newspaper
    became the News-Gazette when David W. Stevick merged his Champaign Daily News with the
    Champaign Daily Gazette in 1919. The News-Gazette's Stevick Building was completed in 1984 and
    today contains offices and communication systems. The paper was printed in nearby buildings
    between Walnut and Chestnut Streets across from the 1924 (Momma Bear) train station for almost

                           26

    100 years. Before the trucking industry replaced railroad usage, materials for the News-Gazette
    and other industries were brought into Champaign on railroad spur lines. Though the spur lines
    are mostly gone, their presence can be seen through placement of the buildings that ran paral-
    lel to these tracks east of Walnut Street and north of Main Street. Most of these structures were
    warehouses. The buildings' orientations are an anomaly. They hold neither to the railroad grid nor
    to the continental grid. Further evidence of the past steam locomotives is the base of the water
    tower near the termination of North Chestnut Street. Water stored in the tower supplied the rail-
    road's steam engines.

    Today, newspapers are no longer a primary source for news for many. With the rise in digital
    media and the ability to obtain news on demand, the News-Gazette is changing. Less advertising
    and fewer classifieds have affected the manner in which the paper is produced. The Stevick News-
    Gazette building was auctioned in the summer of 2020 after the offices relocated to Fox Drive in
    Champaign.

    The First National Bank Building, located at 30 Main Street, was until 2019 occupied by a suc-
    cession of banks. When built in 1910, it boasted a 25-ton steel safety deposit vault. This vault
    is encased by a five-story building with a solid rusticated base topped by four-story Corinthian
    columns. Its solid appearance was a vital aspect of the bank's intention to communicate that the
    institution was sound and therefore money invested with the bank was secure. For many patrons
    the idea was simple: This building looked like a bank (see figure 3.1.13).

25. News-Gazette, "History and Origin."
26. The News-Gazette was printed in Champaign at 48 West Main Street for almost 100 years. The last printing was Sunday,

    June 25, 2017. The paper is now printed in Peoria and trucked to Champaign (Kacich, "Century of Printing").

                                                                                                                                                                   Kevin J. Hinders | 108

It was built to last. Its enormous vault displays and represents that security. Over the years, the
look of banks has changed dramatically. The stock market crash in 1929 led to the Great Depres-
sion and failure of over 9000 banks by 1933. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was cre-
ated to give the banking industry greater stability. Over time, the sense of security for a bank came
not so much from its appearance as from its depositor's assets being insured. Thus freed from the
need for the structure to symbolically represent stability to the community, banks have evolved.
Following World War II a typical interior became much more modern in style. Today, the architect
Louis Sullivan's famous credo "Form ever follows function" is reflected in the utilitarian nature of

109 | Part 3.1. Champaign: Railroad Town
                                                                    27

many post-World War II banks. Thus a fast food restaurant, a post office, and a bank all have a
similar-looking front counter and the architecture may not distinguish the use. Through acquisi-
tions and mergers, the occupant of this building eventually came to be PNC Bank in 2008. In 2019
PNC Bank relocated, and it seems the image presented by the 1910 facade no longer fit with PNC's
branding as a friendly financial institution. The building is currently home to a restaurant.

Today one may walk down Main Street and imagine the bustle of activity as passengers would
come off the trains on their way to the Inman Hotel or visit Kuhn's Clothing Store (now Jos. Kuhn
and Co.). Moving past remaining cast-iron storefronts from the late nineteenth century, such as
at 34 Main Street, one sees a rehabilitated area that still shows signs of a time not so long ago
when there were multiple pawn shops in what was a rough part of town. This is underscored by
the police station's viaduct that leads from its new station directly to the east end of Main Street.

New shops, restaurants, and bars have replaced the vacant storefronts so prevalent before the
concerted effort to encourage visitors. Outside seating is enjoyed during pleasant weather. The
optimism and growth of the early twentieth century is being replicated a century later as down-
town Champaign experiences a renaissance and structures either adapt or are replaced to accom-
modate the needs and desires of its inhabitants.

Part 3.2. Urbana: County Seat

       About the Walk

       Though located just under 2 miles from downtown Champaign and the senior city of the two,
       Urbana (38,336) is less than half the population of Champaign (88,302). As the Champaign County
       seat, Urbana has the county courthouse and a newer federal courthouse. Unfortunately, the city
       made a series of decisions that center around Lincoln Square Mall that have caused a general lack of
       cohesion in the downtown environment. Though public amenities such as Main Street, the court-
       houses, fire and police stations, the farmers market, churches, and a post office exist, the superim-
       position of an enclosed urban mall and its vast parking lots has disassociated the institutions from
       the neighborhoods and reveals the delicate balance Midwestern towns maintain between their
       neighborhoods, their landscape, and their institutions.
       This walk begins at the Champaign County Courthouse at 101 East Main Street in Urbana. The walk
       encircles downtown Urbana before returning to Main Street.

         During the first fifteen years after Illinois became a state in 1818, forty-five new counties
         were created through the grassroots efforts of proponents of local government. The pio-
         neer spirit was marked by self-reliance, independence, and the desire to control one's
         destiny; these characteristics were reflected in the establishment of county governmental
         seats. The settlers' enlightened self-interest led them to recognize opportunities to

                                                                                                                                                            1

         advance their own ambitions in concert with community benefits.

         The nonhierarchical growth and expansion of township communities can be seen to derive
         from an insistence on a direct relationship between the single individual and supreme
         powers. In Puritan and Quaker ideology, there is an insistence on a direct relationship
         between man and God without a mediating hierarchical structure. This ideal religious
         order was a new model for an ideally nonhierarchical governmental order. Therefore, when
         a community or township grew to the point that a new settlement needed to be formed,
         the new community split off entirely from the older one and became whole and indepen-
         dent in and of itself. As a mode of self-government derived from English experience in

which the monarchy modified a hierarchic structure to suit itself, this pattern of cellular

subdivision and self-government resisted the institution of a formal structure between the

  To understand Urbana one must understand it as a product of two activities. The first was the
  exploration of the territory from the Mississippi River and the second is pioneer movement from
  the east, originally along the Ohio River. The settlement pattern in central Illinois was consistent:
  settlers chose to live near groves of trees. These groves provided resources for building homes and
  were located near water sources yet had sufficient elevation to avoid most flooding. In Champaign
  County there existed Sadorus Grove (Sadorus), Mink Grove (Rantoul), Bowes Grove later known
  as Shaeffer's Grove (near Philo), and Linn Grove (Sydney). The towns of Middleton (now Mahomet)
  and St. Joseph also owe their origins to their stands of trees and the local waterways (see figure
  3.2.2).

  settlements along the Wabash, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers. The waterways were the original transportation
  routes in Illinois. 1824: Growth of counties in the southern portion of the state. 1835: Champaign County and the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3

  The largest of all these groves had a simple and apropos name: Big Grove (originally 13,000 acres),
  and it was located near the geographic center of the county (a requisite for a county seat). Early
  white settlers found the area attractive and by 1833 they had established Urbana as the county
  seat of Champaign County, which was formed from land previously associated with Vermilion

                                                                                                        4

  County and was the sixtieth county in Illinois. Senator John Vance had proposed that this new
  county be split off from Vermilion County and named it after his home in Ohio, which had as

  its county seat the town of Urbana. The precise siting of the new county seat was not without
  intrigue. At the time of its formation, the largest population in the county was located at Big Grove.
  The north side of Big Grove offered numerous reasons for making it the logical location for the
  county seat: it had the only governmental building in the county, the Van Buren Post Office, and it
  was near Fort Clark Road, the only public road in the county.

          Accounts indicate that the Locating Commissioners, having met at the home of Phillip
          Stanford, left there giving assurances that the north side site met all requirements for the
          county seat. However, at the invitation of Isaac Busey, the Commissioners accepted his
          hospitality overnight. The next morning, a stake identifying the site of the county seat was
          placed on the south side of Big Grove, near Isaac Busey's house. On June 21, the Locating

                                                                                                                                                                                6

          Commissioners met and filed a report official fixing the location of Urbana.
  The Busey family (brothers Isaac and Matthew, along with their nephew Colonel Matthew W.
  Busey) was one of several landholders who sought to gain by the placement of the town of Urbana
  closer to their property. Though the population was sparse, the growth provided by a county seat
  was attractive to landowners. The history of western expansion into the Ohio Territories and later

                                                                                                                              7

  the Louisiana Purchase is a history of land speculation. Whatever occurred that night at Isaac
  Busey's home, it enriched the Busey family's holdings. Another example of the Busey family's spec-
  ulation is property purchased with an eye on capitalizing when the railroads began to make their

   which he owned. His estate sold the property less than five years later to the railroad for $1600.

   This stone and steel structure was built in 1901--that is, it was added onto in 1901. By the turn of
   the century the ICR had significantly increased the size, affluence and population of Champaign,

   population 9098. Urbana's population was 5728. The County Board wanted a new courthouse but
   wanted to avoid a county vote on the idea--which almost certainly would have shifted the loca-
   tion of a new courthouse to Champaign. The board conspired to keep the courthouse in Urbana.
   In 1898 they devised a simple scheme to make certain a vote would be avoided. The board initiated
   a plan to create a building repair to the 1849 brick and wood structure, which would not require
   public approval. Joseph Royer, an 1895 graduate of the University of Illinois School of Architecture,

    Richardson Romanesque. It remained popular into the early twentieth century.

   The 1901 courthouse originally cost the county $150,000 and had a 135-foot-tall clock/bell tower
   that was repeatedly struck by lightning. Eventually the tower was lowered to 85 feet. In 2006, after

                                                                                                                                                                   12

   fundraising of $1.54 million, the tower was rebuilt to its original height. The clock/bell tower
   marks the symbolic center of the county and can be seen from miles away. It also symbolically
   links the courts with the celestial heavens--though given the lightning strikes, perhaps too much
   so.

   Today the building is entered at 101 Main Street through an addition to the 1901 structure built
   in 2003. The addition is a functional facility that incorporates both offices and courtrooms. The
   original entry has been abandoned because of security and accessibility concerns. The new entry
   meets basic requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and has metal detectors to pro-
   tect access. In 1998, Judge George Miller was attacked in his courtroom by an irate individual hurl-

                                        13

   ing a fire bomb. Within days the sheriff had a metal detector installed. Very soon after it was
   realized that up until that time probably a good number of weapons had entered the courthouse.
   Whether it was these incidents or the domestic terrorist attack in 1995 on the Alfred P. Murrah
   Building in Oklahoma City (known as the Oklahoma City bombing) that prompted the change in
   the entrance, the courthouse no longer displays the open sense of a place to gather that repre-
   sents the people of the community. In this, the Champaign County Courthouse reflects a national
   shift due to antiterrorism protections.

   Next door to the Champaign County Courthouse is the US Courthouse, located at 201 South Vine
   Street. This brick and stone veneer building with a steel and concrete masonry structure was con-
   structed in 1994 and is stylistically postmodern. This courthouse is home to the US district, bank-
   ruptcy, and magistrate courts. Office space is also provided for court-related agencies, including
   the US attorneys, marshals, probation officers, and public defenders. Out front is the necessary
   flagpole and a public statue by Linda Howard entitled Sky Cathedral (see figures 3.2.4 and 3.2.5).

   In 1962 the Kennedy administration instituted a policy of including fine art in public buildings.
   Since then the General Services Administration, the agency responsible for federal public build-

                                                                                                                                                                      14

   ings, has taken over the role of overseeing the Art in Architecture Program. Funding for each Art
   in Architecture project is at least .5 percent of the building project's total estimated construction
   cost. This funding goes toward the designer's services and costs of fabrication and installation.
   Sometimes the art may be incorporated directly into the design of the architecture, such as a floor

                                                                                              15

Adjacent to the US Courthouse is an expanse of parking. This lot is used on Saturdays for the
Urbana farmers market, which operates every Saturday from May through October. Though the
farmer's market is very popular with venders and the public, this is a large area of the city given
over to a parking lot used only once a week, part of the year. The parking lot was originally created
to serve the adjacent Lincoln Square Mall, which was under construction from 1961 to 1964.

Lincoln Square Mall was built in response to a perceived stagnation in the Urbana economy. Res-
idents had mixed feelings about the project. It promised economic growth but also required the
closure of three public streets: Green Street and High Street between Race and Vine Streets
and South Broadway Avenue between Elm and Illinois Streets. With these closings the city and
developer were able to establish a 20-acre parcel for a new mall. A few structures on the site
were allowed to remain. These include Howard Apartments at the intersection of East High and
South Race Streets and the First United Methodist Church. Significantly, the Urbana Lincoln Hotel,
designed by Joseph Royer and opened in 1921, was integrated into the new construction. This
Tudor revival hotel faced the intersection of Green and Broadway. In 1927 a statue of Abraham Lin-
coln by Lorado Taft was placed adjacent to the hotel entrance. This statue was moved to Carle
Park on completion of the mall, and the hotel's main entrance was reworked to the perimeter of
Race Street.

The mall was planned by a nationally recognized developer named Victor Gruen for Carson Pirie
Scott and Company, which also provided the anchor store for the three-story complex. Offices and
twenty commercial firms were also provided. The mall was touted as the first weather-enclosed
shopping mall in Illinois outside of Chicago. Green Street and Broadway Avenue literally extend
into the mall as its main axis and cross axis. For two decades the mall was a commercial success
but by the mid-1980s competition was drawing customers away, and in 1988 Carson Pirie Scott
sold the mall. Since then it has had both Bergner's and Herberger's (closed in 2002) as the main
anchors, but after remodeling the tenants have included the county government and health care
providers. Numerous owners have come and gone.

So what went wrong? Retail patterns shift as consumers change their shopping habits. Compe-
tition from other strip malls and big box stores contributed to the decline in business. The mall
was essentially a suburban prototype placed in a city environment. It lacks the interstate highway
traffic that Champaign's Market Place Shopping Center provides. As shopper numbers declined
the sense of vacancy within the space increased, which led to greater store vacancies and a trou-
blesome spiral. Just as in many small towns affected by peripheral developments, the mall's "main
streets" with anchor stores were reduced to slots for niche shops with discounted lease rates. The
old Urbana Lincoln Hotel, which was incorporated into the mall's design, continues to struggle and
the city struggled for years to find an owner who can keep the hotel operational (see figures 3.2.6
and 3.2.7). In 2025, the hotel reopened as the Royer Hotel, a part of the Hilton Tapestry Collection.
It features a restaurant called The Writer's Room, and an indoor pool.

On a formal front the mall and its street closings did Urbana's present downtown few favors. The
area is now an eight-city-block zone adjacent to the Main Street corridor, which effectively cuts
off the neighborhoods to the south, east, and west. Just as Champaign reversed its exterior mall in
1988 it is perhaps a matter of time before Urbana reintroduces Green Street and Broadway Avenue
as through streets to reconnect Urbana's residents back with their city.

On the southwest corner of West Elm Street and Race Street is the beloved Urbana Free Library
(see figure 3.2.8).

As with many important buildings in Urbana, the structure was designed by Joseph Royer, and
it was constructed in 1918 in the neoclassical style (contrasting with the Tudor revival Lincoln
Hotel he designed across the street five years later). The library expanded in 1975 and again in
2005 (with design by Isaksen Matzdorff Architects). The first expansion was a three-story inter-

                                                                                                                                                                                                16

national style addition while the 2005 renovation incorporated a classical revival style. These
choices reflect the periods in which the additions were undertaken. The original 1918 structure
built during World War I uses a neoclassical style commonly associated with public buildings at
that time while the modern, international style addition executed in 1975 reflects the US culture's

tecture in the beginning of the twenty-first century.

       Figure 3.2.8. Urbana Free Library. Architect: Joseph Royer.

Moving north on Race Street takes one to the intersection with Main Street. Looking west, Spring-
field Avenue and Main Street split to form a triangular space formerly occupied by the Flatiron
Building. This structure acted like a western bookend to the city with the Champaign County
Courthouse anchoring the east. It had a small replica of the Statue of Liberty at the divide. It is
interesting to imagine that Urbana's Main Street moved off the continental grid to connect to
its Main Street "cousin" in Champaign. Springfield Avenue remains the township grid street that
extends, figuratively speaking, all the way to the State Capitol Building in Springfield.
From this intersection it becomes clear that Urbana is sited on high ground adjacent to the Bone-
yard Creek. Looking north and west, the topography drops off and the east-west Norfolk Southern
Railway line lies several blocks north where it crosses over Boneyard Creek. This line has its east-
ern terminus in Urbana.
Across the street from the former Flatiron site is a large Busey Bank branch. Sitting back from its
Race Street edge to provide customer parking, this structure does little to help Main Street cre-
ate the needed spatial closure to reinforce Main Street as a place. Busey Bank, now a part of First
Busey Corporation, is descended from a financial institution founded by some of the earliest set-

121 | Part 3.2. Urbana: County Seat
tlers of Urbana. It is now headquartered in Champaign and operates in Illinois, Missouri, Florida,
and Indiana.
The one block of Main Street Urbana, between Race Street and North Broadway Avenue is an
eclectic collection of commercial activities and styles. Care has been taken to provide a well-land-
scaped area for pedestrians and patrons of the cafes and restaurants. This is the heart of old
downtown Urbana. The Princess Theater once occupied a prominent location between Race and
Broadway. In the 1930s it was owned by Alger Brothers, who also owned and operated the Art The-
ater in Champaign at the same time. Built by the Busey family in the 1870s and remodeled on many
occasions, the building has been home to a bank, an opera house, a theater, and offices. Currently
the structure is used as a gallery. Many of the buildings here were once shop houses that had com-
mercial activity at the street level and families living above. Over time these businesses shifted and
changed while the upper stories often become office space. An example of this is the architect's
office occupying the space above a shoe store at 102 West Main Street.

         Figure 3.2.9. Old Urbana Post Office.

Near the courthouse exist two noteworthy structures: the old Urbana Post Office and a parking
garage. The 1914 structure is a classical, two-story building raised above street level. The entry
is framed by two-story Corinthian columns and pilasters (five bays) to create a presence on the

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 122
   prominent north-south axis, Broadway Avenue. The structure now pairs with the Hotel Royer to
   form an entrance to Lincoln Square Mall (see figures 3.2.9 and 3.2.10).
   Most of the post office's functions have been removed and the building now serves as office

                  17

   space. Just west of the Champaign County Courthouse on Broadway is a two-story parking
   garage. Urban legend has it that this garage's structure was designed with extra supports so as to
   accommodate vertical expansion. Because of an incredible amount of surface parking in the area,
   the garage remains a one-story edifice with parking on the ground floor and the roof. Fortunately,
   it supports a pedestrian environment by filling out the block and providing a street edge that helps
   define Main Street. This spatial enclosure is critical to the pedestrian experience. Unfortunately
   for Urbana and many other towns in America, the concessions given to the automobile to attract
   people to downtowns have created environments less desirable for pedestrians.

   This walk ends where it began, near the Champaign County Courthouse. Looking around Main
   Street one sees additional support needed by a county seat. Numerous law firms occupy first- or
   second-floor offices. Inevitably banks are located near the courthouse. This was, and is, practical

   named County Plaza was once one of the two largest banks in Urbana: Champaign County Bank

   and Trust. This five-story building at 102 East Main Street replaced a number of smaller struc-
   tures including a related bank on the northeast corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue and a
   nearby Montgomery Ward building. The bank had a large parking area to the south, designed more
   for vehicular traffic than pedestrians. Just as the Flatiron Building and the Champaign County
   Courthouse provided bookends to Urbana so did Busey Bank and the Champaign County Bank and
   Trust in both form and function.
   In Urbana one sees the struggle between the automobile and the pedestrian. Like most Midwest-
   ern towns created in the early to mid-nineteenth century, the automobile had no presence and
   the residential area was an integral extension of the downtown. Today Urbana exemplifies how the
   form of the city continues to evolve.

Part 3.3. Campustown: Politics of Place

     About the Walk

     In 1995 Chancellor Michael Aiken stated that he was embarrassed to bring guests of the university to
     Campustown. In response came a series of committees and projects known as Campustown 2000.
     Politics can be seen as having a major role in the creation of place. This walk will trace the
     approaches to Campustown 2000 by the three major groups involved: the cities, the university, and
     the shop and property owners. Long perceived as being in a standoff, these three groups had their
     own fears and agendas for Campustown. The development of a strategy for Campustown improve-
     ment will be examined and the Campustown master plan and its subsequent changes to the area will
     be illustrated. The chapter will also discuss the role of drainage and the Boneyard Creek and its
     retention and channelization.
     This walk begins at the Alma Mater statue located near the southeast corner of the Wright Street
     and Green Street intersection. The walk continues west on Green Street to explore the area adjacent
     to the campus.

  In 1966, film director Sergio Leone released his third spaghetti western starring Clint Eastwood.
  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly had each character defined in the opening credits. Toward the
  end of the film the protagonist, a "Man with No Name" played by Clint Eastwood (the Good), has
  a memorable duel with two other characters, Tuco Ramirez (the Bad), played by Eli Wallach, and
  Angel Eyes (the Ugly), played by Lee Van Cleef. The duel begins as each character desires access to
  a gravesite where $200,000 in gold is buried. Since each has a gun, there is a standoff. Presumably,
  whoever is the first to draw will be the next to be shot, which would leave the patient person as
  the winner. No one can be certain they will not be the first one shot, but they assume that the first
  to fire will certainly be the second target. The question of patience is a question of greed as well.
  Significantly, in this standoff, the viewer identifies with the `good' Man with No Name.

  By the mid-1990s a similar standoff had occurred in Champaign's Campustown area. The area had
  been long neglected because of the positions of the three main characters: the University of Illi-
  nois, the City of Champaign, and the Campustown property owners and merchants. Here though,
  the protagonist is not obvious.

  In 1996 David Dressel, Director of Facilities, Planning, and Management, explained to the author
  the Campustown standoff: "The University and the City of Champaign are often at odds given
  the University's need for property and its tax-exempt status. If the University acquires property,
  that property goes off the city's tax roll. The city is understandably wary of making investments
  in an area where the tax base could continue to erode. The City of Champaign likewise may be at
  odds with the local merchants and (perhaps) the larger population of the Campustown area. The
  city having finite resources often chose to support upgrades in other parts of the city rather than
  invest in Campustown improvements. Some suspect this is due to the number of non-registered
  (in Champaign) voters compared to other parts of the city. Thus, other areas of Champaign receive
  preferential status as a symptom of the politics of government. The Campustown property own-
  ers and merchants had long endured a perceived secondary status to other areas of the city. The
  Campustown area produced a substantial tax base for the city while few finances were directed to
  the perpetual flooding and infrastructure needs of the area."

  The university may have had the perception that local merchants and property owners were
  exploiting students. Rents in the Campustown area (within ten blocks from the Illini Union) seem
  to support this view as the cost of student apartments in the area are often two to three times
  greater than comparative size units elsewhere in the cities of Urbana and Champaign. This brings
  to mind the realtors' adage exhorting "location, location, location." Unlike Leone's The Good, the

  movies were marketed as a trilogy by United Artists, the stories are independent of one another. The main character in
  all three was rarely called by name so United Artists decided to package the films as the "Man with No Name movies."

                                                                                                                                                                Kevin J. Hinders | 126
  Bad, and the Ugly, there is no protagonist in Campustown planning. It is more about having differ-
  ent points of view.

  In 1996, however, the standoff ended when Chancellor Michael Aiken participated in a panel dis-
  cussion with Bruce Knight Champaign's director of planning, Bill Gray Urbana's director of public
  works, Jerry Heintze owner of Zorba's on Green Street and Steve Gradman, president of the Stu-
  dent Government Association (SGA). The five panelists discussed short term solutions to crime

                                                                                                                                                                          2

  when Gradman stated that the Campustown was "almost an embarrassment." The chancellor did
  not disagree. Knight stated: "The community stakeholders, representatives of the 200 business

  Working together they seized the opportunity to form the Campustown 2000 Task Force: With
  representatives from the university, city officials, and area business and property owners four
  subcommittees were formed: Transportation and Traffic; Safety; Financing; and Drainage, Public
  Improvements, and Appearance Subcommittees. These subcommittees reported to the Campus-
  town 2000 Task Force. The city took responsibility for a traffic study and hired Bucher, Willis, and

                                                                                                 4

  Public Improvements, and Appearance Subcommittee, which resolved to try to create a set of
  design guidelines.

  "The mission of the Campustown 2000 Task Force is to facilitate the improvement of the Campus-
  town area to make it more conducive, accessible, and desirable for attracting students, visitors,
  and local residents as a quality environment for conducting commerce and residential develop-

  ment."

  The Drainage, Public Improvements and Appearance Subcommittee concluded that "a new image
  for Campustown should be developed. In addition, a procedure to maintain this image should be
  created. Recognizing the resources of the University's School of Architecture, a proposal for a
  multi-disciplinary team was suggested. A faculty member and four graduate students from the
  disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture and urban and regional planning were selected

                                                                          6

working on the project could be `completely deniable.' If the group produced good results the Uni-
versity would look good. If the group produced results contrary to what the University wanted the
administration could discern that this was an academic exercise."

The group was hired for two months and worked in the Facilities and Planning Offices above the
Illini Union Bookstore on Wright Street. An early task of the design team was to determine the
area of study. Some wanted the Campustown area to be widely defined, stretching from Univer-
sity Avenue to Windsor Road and from Neil Street to Lincoln Avenue. For political reasons, it was
determined that this study would concentrate on Champaign but that a Campustown area would
also be created in Urbana in the future near Krannert Center for the Performing Arts to serve the
east side of campus (this has become the Gregory Street development between West Oregon and
West Nevada Streets). Eventually the design team chose to concentrate on a smaller area. In its
plan, the team wrote:

       The area of the Campustown Commercial Core and Green Street Corridor as outlined
       by the Campustown 2000 Drainage, Public Improvements and Appearance Subcommittee
       extends from Neil Street to Wright Street and includes parts of Daniel Street (between
       Sixth and Wright), John Street and Healey Street (between Fifth and Wright). This design
       team has chosen to concentrate on the Green Street Corridor and the north-south streets
       that intersect the corridor.

       Through observation and a survey, the design team learned that the visual and aesthetic
       quality of the Green Street Corridor decreases as one moves from Wright Street to the
       west. In order of preference, people surveyed chose the area between Sixth and Wright
       Streets as having the highest visual quality, and their opinion is that the aesthetic quality
       decreases as one progresses westward.

       There are numerous reasons for this recognizable shift in aesthetic quality. Historically the
       Green Street Campustown area was one block in length located between Wright and Sixth
       Streets. A shift occurred in the fifties and sixties as this commercial strip began to expand
       westward. In response to this expansion zoning changes were made, and in the early 1960s
       parking was removed from Green Street. At this same time Green Street zoning west of
       Fourth Street was changed from B-4 (requiring no parking) to B-3 (requiring a percentage
       of on-site parking). This action lowered the burden of providing public parking for busi-
       nesses to the west of Fourth Street but has had detrimental effects on the visual and aes-
       thetic quality of the area.

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 128
         The buildings built since this zoning change are seen as objects, free standing buildings,
         typically unattached to surrounding structures, often set back from the property line.
         Buildings to the east, in contrast, create an enclosing system by using party wall construc-
         tion and limiting building setbacks to a uniform distance. This system allows the viewer to
         experience the street/sidewalk area as an outdoor room. As one progresses to the west,
         the spatial enclosure decreases, thus lowering the quality of the corridor as "a place."
         The University of Illinois provides a clear border for the east end of the Campustown,
         but no clear boundary exists to the west. (The Illinois Central Railroad does not act as a
         boundary because it is too far away.) Without the benefit of a clear demarcation, the Green
         Street Corridor loses definition as it moves to the west. Thus, the Green Street Corridor
         has become a variety of individual destinations without an overall identity. The challenge
         to the design work team is to create a vision of Campustown which facilitates both vehicu-
         lar and pedestrian movement while fostering a sense of place for residents, merchants and

                                7

         visitors.

Campustown's Green Street was then broken into three sections, each with distinct characteris-
tics. From Wright Street to Fourth Street was the commercial hub, the densest area. From Fourth
Street to First Street was an area with a mixture of freestanding commercial buildings with their
own parking and apartments built typically to their lot lines. From First Street to the railroad
tracks was an area of mixed single-family homes, a drive-up commercial strip, and a corner gas
station. It was determined that these areas were distinct enough that a gateway at each would be
appropriate. The train viaduct east of Neil Street would be the first marker.

At First Street from the west would be another appropriate spot to differentiate Campustown and
give the area an identity. Pedestrian markers would begin here with distinct banners and a clear
threshold.
The desire to stretch Campustown's identity from Wright Street to First Street helped define the

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 130
project. It was decided that there were too many vacant lots and not enough edge definition to
give Campustown a cohesiveness. Thus, the area was perceived as incoherent and lacking identity.

The design team was challenged to accomplish three goals by the Drainage, Public Improvements,
and Appearance Committee: to develop a functional and aesthetic vision for the area, to generate
street and facade guidelines based on that vision, and to recommend a procedure for the estab-
lishment and work function of an architectural review board. In reality, many area merchants were
concerned with a recent development on Green Street: Businesses were in an arms race to put up
larger and larger signage, in particular backlit awnings that almost everyone agreed were eyesores.
Many property owners and businesses wanted some kind of regulation to control these imposi-
tions into the streetscape. Most preferred to have this regulation after their own "improvement"
had been made, however.

Having defined the area of investigation the design team created a survey that elicited 177
responses. The survey was essential. First, it provided useful input to help prioritize action and
verify the members' observations. Second, and very important, it was undertaken with the intent
to provide much sought after verification that Green Street in this area should be a destination
rather than a vehicular corridor connecting Urbana and Champaign. The traffic study that had
been scheduled to take at least six months took over eighteen months. This timing gave the design
team the opportunity to be proactive with information and insights they supplied to the Trans-
portation and Traffic Subcommittee. By providing details to the Campustown 2000 Task Force
and its subcommittees the team was able to preempt the possible exploration by traffic studies to
use Green Street as an automobile arterial. The survey also assisted the designers in prioritizing
responses to a number of identified safety issues. The survey was able to both guide the team's
investigation and justify its approach.

One other issue had been affecting Campustown for years: flooding. One-half block north of
Green Street flows the Boneyard Creek. More often than not the Boneyard is a shallow trickle.
Most of the watershed begins in north Champaign, heads to the Salt Fork, and then travels to the
Vermilion, Wabash, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. In 1996
it was still considered a navigable waterway by the Army Corp of Engineers. However, time and
progress meant there were big impacts when heavy rains occurred:

       More impermeable infrastructure combined with growth in the campus area and C-U at
       large created a perfect storm for more frequent, more damaging flooding. The flood of
       1979, which damaged millions of dollars of property, was one of C-U's loudest wakeup calls.
       Intense flooding regularly overloaded the drainage system in the coming decades. Even
       when we tried to forget the Boneyard, it forced us to remember. In 1993, a flood halted the

                                                                                                            8

          time, causing millions of dollars of damage.
  In addition to the water from north Champaign moving through Campustown, the area's water-
  shed was increased. An area known as "Lake Neil," located west of the Illinois Central Railroad on
  South Neil Street, often flooded. This water would eventually percolate into the soil, but as devel-
  opment along Neil Street continued to produce impermeable pavement the problem grew. The
  city reengineered the area in the mid-1980s to drain into Boneyard Creek. This additional water
  exacerbated the flooding in Campustown. With a heavy rain the intersection of Fourth and Green
  Streets was susceptible to substantial inundation (see figure 3.3.3).

  The design team explored the problem with flooding but were encouraged to separate aesthetics
  and flooding into two separate problems. The team proposed a Boneyard walkway/bikeway where
  some portions of the creek were placed in a culvert and others were improved and made into

   existing plan to create a large basin north of Green Street and west of First Street. Additional basin
   developments and channels near Scott Park and along the Second Street area were also privately
   proposed (see figure 3.3.4).

   The Healy Street Detention Basin, completed in 2000 at the cost of $23 million, was created on
   properties initially assembled by James Gallivan for the purpose of flood mitigation. Gallivan was
   a civil engineer by trade and a developer whose vision to create a large detention basin north
   of the Green Street corridor and west of First Street greatly alleviated the flooding problems of
   Campustown. Strategically located to capture the runoff from both Boneyard branches--includ-
   ing the "Lake Neil" water--the basin was able to hold 80 percent of the floodwater, equivalent to

   a twenty-year flood. The building of this basin began in 1998. A second basin, implemented in
   2008 and located between First and Second Streets and Springfield and University Avenues, was
   designed to provide for the additional needs of the area. Combined with the first basin, the area

    flooding implications for people in Missouri. The design decisions made in Champaign have had flooding impacts on
    people living in Villa Grove for years.

   increased the biodiversity in the area. The university has also sought to benefit from a well-man-
   icured Boneyard Creek as it runs through the Bardeen Quad before moving to Urbana (see part
   2.2).
   This walk begins at the base of the Alma Mater--the beloved statue created by University of Illinois
   alumnus Lorado Taft (who graduated in 1879). The Alma Mater depicts a motherly figure welcom-
   ing students, alumni, and visitors that is flanked by two male figures: Learning and Labor, who
   represent the university's motto (see figure 3.3.5).

   at Green and Wright Streets and is specifically positioned to recognize the Campustown entrance
   to the university.

   On leaving the Alma Mater and progressing to the Green and Wright intersection, it is helpful to
   refer to a brief history of Green Street:

           Green Street was laid out in 1868 dividing the north and south campuses of the University
           of Illinois. The street was lined with large, beautiful homes and elm trees providing a
           canopy of shade. The area near the intersection of Wright and Green Street was recog-
           nized as the point where Champaign, Urbana, and the University of Illinois came together.

           A number of forces precipitated the development of Campustown. Prior to 1905 the char-
           acter of Green Street was residential with some small businesses operating out of homes.
           With an increasing enrollment at the University of Illinois, an economic demand for stu-
           dent goods and services became apparent. The central location of Green Street spurred
           new development shortly after 1910 with the block between Wright Street and Sixth Street
           becoming fully developed by the end of the decade. The residential character of Green
           Street west of Sixth Street remained well into the 1930s.

           Residences along the remainder of the street began to attract more interest from entre-
           preneurs. Many houses began to transform into storefronts, some of which can still be
           seen today. This also led to a diverse blend of businesses including: tailors, barbers, ice
           cream parlors, movie theaters, jewelry stores, bookstores, bowling alleys, billiard parlors,
           and restaurants. A majority of these types of businesses are still present today in some for-
           mat or combination.

           By the 1970s the character of Green Street had been fully transformed into a commercial
           district. The automobile contributed dramatically to this transformation. On-street park-
           ing was removed in the late 1960s to increase traffic flow. This displacement of parking
           spaces and increasing development along Green Street resulted in the City of Champaign
           amending its zoning ordinance to require businesses to provide parking with new con-
           struction. In addition to increased parking, the amount of automobile traffic that circulates
           through the area has had a significant effect on the character of the Campustown area.
           In contrast to these influences the area has been historically dependent upon pedestrian

                                                                                                                                          12

           traffic with businesses primarily orientated for students.

   as seen in 1996:

Today, the commercial Campustown area is concentrated between Wright and Fourth
Streets, extending as far west as Neil Street and including several north-south streets.
Champaign-Urbana has witnessed a shift of commercial activity to other areas of the
region, specifically the North Prospect and Market Place areas in recent years. This shift
in commercial activity is hardly responsible for the problems that currently face Campus-
town. Increasing neglect, automobile traffic and changing political climate has generated

an unattractive and unsafe pedestrian-oriented environment.

In 2008 the City of Champaign described how the planning of Campustown was evolving:

       The original University District Action Plan (known in the past as the Campustown Action
       Plan) was first created through a joint venture between Campustown businesses, the Uni-
       versity of Illinois and the City of Champaign. . . . This report became the basis for the 1999
       Campustown Action Plan. This document set forth a wide range of action items targeted at
       implementing the Task Force recommendations. These action items contained recommen-

13. Ibid., 13.

                Kevin J. Hinders | 136
           dations on priority, funding and responsibility. Now nine years later, this update contin-
           ues to build on the successes of that original document. Its chapters are molded after the
           original task force report. However, it is important to bear in mind that since the original
           plan adoption in 1999 several key changes have occurred. In 2002, Campustown 2000 was
           disbanded and in its place the University District Advisory Board was created. This board
           serves as an official City of Champaign board and is comprised of specific key leaders in
           the University District (Property Owners, University Representatives, Student Represen-
           tatives, Real Estate Development, and Business Owners). This group, along with City staff,

                                                                                                                                                                           14

           will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of this document.

   Green Street continues to be the heart of Campustown. In 1996 the design team determined that
   changing the roadway from four lanes to three, increasing sidewalk widths, and introducing ded-
   icated turn lanes throughout Campustown would enhance safety and pedestrian activity while
   encouraging bus use (see figures 3.3.6 and 3.3.7).

   The design team first sought to establish Green Street as a special location, unique in the city.
   Picking low-hanging fruit was essential for success. Choosing low-cost options that could be
   implemented in a timely manner encouraged a sense of place for Campustown. Prior to this time
   very few trees existed in the area (there was only one tree between Sixth and Wright Streets, for
   example). Introducing trees in grated wells along with consistent street lighting suited to both
   pedestrian and vehicular traffic was an easy way to introduce unifying elements while increasing
   safety. These streetlights were also outfitted with banners and landscape amenities such as hang-
   ing plants.

   An issue that needed to be addressed was the servicing problems for the businesses located on
   the south side of Green Street east of Fifth Street. A connecting alley did not exist and delivery
   and refuse removal was problematic. In an effort to resolve this problem the planning team pro-
   posed changes to parking and delivery traffic along Sixth Street. A pilot study was undertaken to
   explore design implications and opportunities at the intersection of John Street and Sixth Street.
   The intersection was chosen as it also assisted the university in an attempt to alleviate life-safety
   problems associated with people using wheelchairs along John Street. Diagonal parking combined
   with dedicated loading zones provided a reasonable compromise in this area. The streetscaping
   exploration at the John and Sixth intersection served as a later model for the Green Street corri-
   dor.

   To initiate investment in the area, a fund overseen by a review committee was created to pay up to
   one-fifth of development costs if the property owner chose to follow guidelines established by the
   task force (up to a maximum of $200,000). This carrot incentivized investment in Campustown and

began the steady growth readily seen today. Improvements that could earn funds included making
properties more accessible, updating building facades, and increasing safety through design.

Some of the first new construction in the area occurred just west of Wright Street. Even before
the task force had completed its recommendations, Follett's Bookstore began replacing its struc-
ture at the northwest corner of Green and Wright Streets. Today Follett's Bookstore has closed
but the building has been adapted to house both retail and restaurant activities. At 616 East Green
Street, a pair of towers were built to take advantage of the proximity to campus. These towers
replaced several older one- and two-story structures including a movie theater and a McDonald's.
It is important to note that the university assisted McDonald's in deciding to surrender a prime
Green Street location by leasing it space in a new food court in the basement of the Illini Union

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 138
   and creating a space for another McDonald's near the student dormitories on Gregory Avenue and

                                                                                                                                                                                                 15

   Euclid Street in a facility with the Illini Orange snack bar, better known as "the Orange."

   These new structures followed the suggestion made by the design team to set back the facade of
   a Green Street frontage at least 10 feet if the building was 20-40 feet high. The design team rea-
   soned that this would help make a more consistent, pedestrian-scaled space while still allowing
   development at a higher density. The City of Champaign never adopted the setback requirement
   and many structures in Campustown do not have Green Street setbacks.

   Perhaps the most notable change in the area was the attention given to the existing facades.
   Numerous owners took advantage of available incentives to restore their facades to a more origi-
   nal appearance. At one time in the 1990s a two-story almost blank facade with a huge Buffalo Wild
   Wings logo was adjacent to the wood-clad exterior of Murphy's Pub. With the new guidelines and
   incentives, the building's billboard-like elevation of the logo was removed to reveal a facade that
   better matched its neighbors. Eventually Murphy's Pub expanded into the space.

   Progressing west one encounters a phenomenon that can be seen at numerous Campustown loca-
   tions. Houses on both Green Street and Sixth Street were adapted to provide commercial opportu-
   nities. Many two-story homes that sat back from the street had a storefront attached that filled in
   the space between the house and the sidewalk. Establishments such as the bars formerly located
   at 706 and 708 South Sixth Street readily displayed this structure (see figures 3.3.8 and 3.3.9).

   These structures were demolished in 2018 to make way for a new residential mixed-use project

                                           16

   (see figure 3.3.10). Today, however, several examples of a storefront tacked onto a house remain
   such as the structures located at 406 Green Street.

   Even more interesting is the case of a house located near the intersection of Sixth and Green. This
   building is reminiscent of the one in the children's story The Little House by Virginia Lee Burton. In
   this tale, a little house built in the country wonders what it would be like to live in the distant city.
   Soon the city expands to surround the little house. Tall buildings block out the sun and the city
   brings pollution and noise. In Burton's story the city engulfs the little house. The house grows sad
   and can only be happy when it is restored to the country. Though the story is excruciatingly anti-
   urban it accurately depicts the urban expansion around this house-turned-apartment-building in

15. Both of these McDonald's franchises subsequently closed. There is now a McDonald's on the 600 block of East Green
    Street incorporated into the Green Street Towers' base. This restaurant is very close to the previous location on Green
    Street.

16. The 2017-18 campus master plan identified an area from Green Street to Daniel Street as a public-private partnership
    opportunity. The university partnered with developers to greatly change the area surrounding the Swanlund Admin­
    istration Building. New developments at the intersection of Green and Sixth Streets and Sixth and Daniel Streets have
    ushered in a new era for Campustown.

Champaign. Entering a small walkway between 507 and 509 East Green Street one walks down a
narrow sidewalk before coming to this structure (see figures 3.3.10 and 3.3.11).

The house once faced Sixth Street but the developments around it eventually closed it into its little
courtyard space in the center of the block. The fifteen-story structure on the southwest corner of
Sixth and Green was the last building to seal off the house from the adjacent streets.

   Figure 3.3.11. Entry to the "Little House."

                                                                                Figure 3.3.12. Campustown's "Little House."

Across the street, on the northwest corner of Green and Sixth Streets a large development
stretches between Green and Healey over the Boneyard Creek. For many years this land had been
a parking lot owned by the City of Champaign known as Lot J. In the 1980s a request for propos-
als to develop the site was issued by the City of Champaign. Unable to reach an agreement with a
developer, the city continued to lease the lot. Wendy's chain restaurant leased a small one-story
building at the corner, but by the early 1990s that building was vacant. JSM Apartments bought the
property and developed it with a two-story commercial building accommodating two popular fast
food restaurants. The strategic construction was intended to position JSM for selection to develop
the Lot J parcel. JSM's project became a six-story mix of parking garage, hotel, and commercial
activities with a landscaped corridor over the buried Boneyard Creek culverts.
Green Street has seen considerable development since the mid-1990s. Newer, taller apartment
buildings continue to be built as Campustown expands westward. Prior to the 1990s, however, the
character of Campustown had a marked shift at Fourth Street. When the city removed parking
from Green Street it began requiring property owners and businesses to have on-site parking.
This change in zoning west of Fourth Street dramatically changed the character and quality of
the built environment. Structures west of Fourth Street began to take on suburban characteristics
that supported automobile traffic at the pedestrian's expense. Burger King, International House of
Pancakes, convenience stores, and other businesses constructed roadside buildings more appro-
priate for strip mall locations. Many even had drive-through windows. These businesses posed
serious safety problems as cars and pedestrians were placed at odds with one another. A few rem-

141 | Part 3.3. Campustown: Politics of Place
nants from this period survive. The Pizza Hut at 411 East Green was a suburban prototype and was
remodeled to reflect Pizza Hut's rebranding in the twenty-first century, and the US Post Office
at 302 East Green Street is a suburban transplant that appears very out of place. At the south-
east corner of Fourth and Green stood a bank with drive-through service. Though the bank has
given way to a series of businesses, it shows how the densification of the area is encouraging more
pedestrian activities as the drive-through has now been transformed with an urban infill building.
This new structure helps provide a continuous building edge to the street and supports Campus-
town's pedestrian life (see figure 3.3.13).

Figure 3.3.13. Campustown Infill. The densification of Green Street at the southeast corner of the Fourth Street
intersection.

On the former site of the Burger King at 309 East Green is a building sometimes referred to as
"the Whopper." This play on the hamburger chain's popular sandwich references the former Burger
King location and the size of the new construction. Where once stood houses converted to com-
mercial businesses and a one-story suburban hamburger chain transplant now stands a twenty-
story apartment building with a multistory parking deck adjacent to an odd green patch waiting
for another tower. The cost of the project, according to the City of Champaign, was approximately

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 142
   $34 million and provides 110 apartments. Since the Campustown 2000 investment, the growth of
   Campustown has been significant. From 2004 to 2016, over 700 apartments were added to the
   Green Street corridor from the railroad tracks to Wright Street at an estimated cost of $163 mil-
   lion. During that same period the City of Champaign recorded the construction of over 1900 units
   at a cost of over $375 million in the Campustown area. Between 20016 and 2024, over 60 projects
   exceeding one million dollars have been undertaken in the Campustown area at a conservatively

                                                                                                                                                                               17

   estimated cost of over $700,000,000 thus adding over 3500 units to the area. New structures
   continue to be added as the Green Street corridor density expands to the west. The area is as
   vibrant and lively as it has ever been. Now safe from flooding, development continues to include
   mixed-use structures that cater to the campus community.

       About the Walk

       "Philo: Center of the Universe" is proudly displayed on the town's water tower. In actuality, for its
       inhabitants, Philo has been an axis mundi just as its water tower states. The idea of creating a central
       and cohesive place in the agrarian landscape is important for an understanding of central Illinois.
       This walk is actually a drive in the country. Beginning with the ubiquitous Casey's General Store
       found in almost every small Illinois town, this ride discusses the role of commerce, the grain eleva-
       tor, churches, the post office, the cemetery, the evolution of the schools, and even the local tavern
       as integral aspects of small town living.
       This walk/drive begins on Route 130 after leaving Urbana and heading south to Philo. The tour goes
       through the various sections of Philo, the cemetery, the downtown, and the residential areas.

                                                                                1

  Traveling east from Decatur, Illinois, on the Norfolk Southern Railway one passes a series of towns
  with tall grain elevators: Cerro Gordo, Milmine, Bement, Ivesdale, Sadorus, Tolono, and Philo,
  then Sydney, Homer, Fairmount, Catlin, and Tilton before reaching Danville, about 80 miles from
  Decatur. On average, just over 6 miles separate each town. These towns are the centers for farm-
  ing communities located on the Toledo, Wabash, and Western Railroad line (now a Norfolk and
  Southern line) to facilitate the movement of crops to processing centers (see figure 3.4.1).
  Philo is located near Bowes Grove and is named after Philo Hale, the land speculator who bought
  up acreage in the area anticipating the construction of a railroad. His foresight was rewarded when
  the railroad was built in 1856. Eventually the "Wabash Cannonball" began running between Detroit

1. Decatur has been an important grain-processing city for over a century. The A. E. Staley Company began processing
  corn in Decatur in 1906. A. E. Staley became Staley Continental in 1985 and was taken over by Tate and Lyle--a British
  corporation (see Tate and Lyle, "Augustus Eugene Staley"). The Archer Daniels Midland Company, long a major agricul­
  ture-based corporation, was headquartered in Decatur from 1969 to 2014 (see ADM, "History").
                                                                                                                                                                 Kevin J. Hinders | 144
  and St. Louis and traveled through Philo (Detroit to Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Decatur, and then to

                        2

  St. Louis). The main use for the rails, though, was the linkage of farmers to their markets.
  The continental grid that crisscrosses the area has long allowed farmers to bring crops to town,
  where the grain elevators facilitate exchange. These prairie towers set at a regular increment can
  be seen for miles across the flat, east central Illinois landscape. The elevators identify the commu-
  nity's presence on the skyline above the fields of corn and soybeans (see figure 3.4.2).

2. From "Wabash Cannonball":
          Listen to the jingle, the rumble, and the roar, As she glides along the woodland, through the hills, and by the
          shore. Hear the mighty rush of her engine; hear that lonesome hobo's call. You're travelling through the jungles
          on the Wabash Cannonball. (Loewen, "Wabash Cannonball").

The skyline of these towns tells a story. The dominant horizon on the prairie is broken by few ver-
tical attenuations. The groves of the area can be seen from miles away, as can the built environ-
ment. Church steeples and bell towers serve to call their congregations. These vertical extensions
from the horizontal plane strive to connect heaven with Earth. Similarly Philo's water tower with
its proud inscription "Philo: Center of the Universe" locates Philo, not just locally, but in the cos-
mos (see figure 3.4.3).

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 146

It serves as a centering device--an axis mundi. Philo has experienced numerous fires throughout
its existence. The water tower is a symbol of people coming together. It is a governmental struc-
ture that underscores the importance of a community, especially when the town or village is not
large enough to support a county seat or a grand city hall. The skyline of the small Midwestern
town is punctuated by these built edifices that break the monotony of the fields. Spiritual commu-
nity, civic community, and economic community form the backdrop for the life of the town.

series of cautionary speed limit signs. At one time roads coming into Philo were paved on only

one side while the other side remained compressed dirt. The farmers needed paved roads when

  not need the expensive pavement.

  On the northern outskirts of Philo lies a Casey's General Store. Casey's business plan has been to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    5

  locate its combination of convenient stores and gas stations in small towns across the Midwest.
  This strategy makes great business sense for Philo. It no longer supports a grocery store and there
  is only one other gas station in town (Phillips 66). Though the town still has major agricultural ties
  it has also become a bedroom community to Urbana-Champaign. Many residents work at the Uni-
  versity of Illinois, Parkland College, or local health care facilities. Instead of forcing residents to
  drive 3 miles to a southern Urbana strip mall or big box store, Casey's services the community for
  its smaller-scale needs.

  On entering town there is a distinct separation of the east and west. To the west lies the town
  cemetery, immaculately kept and slowly growing. The cemetery overlooks the prairie from a high
  point. Philo was referred to by railroad engineers as "Summit" because it could take two engines to
  push railcars up the incline to Philo from the west. On a clear day one can easily count a half dozen
  grain elevators in the distance. The cemetery bears the signs of persons having visited. Tombs are
  cared for and flags are placed on Veteran's Day. One gets the sense of the connection between
  those living to the east and those buried here.

  Crossing Route 130 on Jefferson one can go six city blocks before coming to what was once the
  edge of town. Philo's land pattern is easy to discern. "Old" Philo rests between County Road 1650
  East, which becomes Cleveland Street on the east, and Route 130 (or County Road 1600 East),
  which is called Lincoln Street. It is between County Roads 900 and 800 North (Monroe Street and
  Roosevelt Road, respectively). Incorporated in 1864 by E. B. Hale, the son of the town's namesake,
  the town originally comprised 80 acres. Now Philo occupies approximately 320 acres inside this
  boundary of streets paying homage to our past presidents. A closer look indicates that the down-
  town and the oldest area were located on the north half of the town. One hundred and sixty acres
  lie north of Van Buren Street. This is still the heart of Philo (see figure 3.4.4).

  South of Van Buren lie residences and newer construction, where the streets begin to change and
  become less dense. To the east lie the "suburbs." This area, east of Cleveland Road, is, surprisingly,
  sprawl. Sprawl occurs when developers purchase agricultural land and make improvements, typ-
  ically providing electricity, water and sewer lines, and paved roads, and then subdividing the area
  into lots for sale to future homeowners and contractors building on speculation. These tracts are

   small towns across Iowa. Approximately two-thirds of Casey's stores are still found in areas with populations of 20,000
   or fewer." (Casey's, "Corporate Profile").

often governed by established covenants determined by the developer. When a percentage of lots
are sold the governance is turned over to a homeowner's association. Philo has two such tracts:
Jefferson extends east to take on a meandering path with cul-de-sacs to the north and south..
To the south, Valley View Drive and Country View Drive are named to attract those wishing to
take advantage of sight lines afforded of the agricultural land surrounding the city. They also have
adjoining cul-de-sacs.

  Returning to Philo's older quarter along Madison Street just west of Cleveland, one sees the Roman
  Catholic Church and a school named St. Thomas. The parish was established in 1894 and the cur-
  rent church was dedicated in 1980. The parochial school was established in 1905 and the current
  school was built in 1966 with an addition dedicated in 2020. Philo supports two other churches
  that are over a century old, the Zion Lutheran Church at Van Buren and Harrison Streets and the
  Philo Presbyterian Church at 105 East Jefferson Street. In addition to these village churches is
  Countryside United Methodist Church, which moved to its current location in the 1970s approxi-
  mately 3 miles from Philo on 1807 East County Road 1000 North. This congregation has roots dat-
  ing back to the 1830s and includes former churches from Philo and Sydney including Alice Chapel,

                                                                   6

  Lost Grove, and Pleasant Hill.

  Years ago, Philo had an old two-plus-story schoolhouse on Madison Street. For over five decades

                                                                                                                                      7

  the stone and brick school served as the Philo High School, but in the 1950s the schools in the
  southern part of Champaign County created a consolidated high school in Tolono, 6 miles west of
  Philo. The Champaign County Unit Seven School District now controls a vast area, serving towns
  in the southern part of Champaign County including Tolono, Philo, Sadorus, Pesotum, and Sydney

                                                                                                8

  set among 100,000 acres of rural farmland. The high school is known as the Unity Rockets: Unity
  to symbolize the uniting of numerous communities into one larger school and Rockets to serve as
  an apropos nickname for a school emerging after World War II.

  The Philo school building on Madison Street continued to serve the town until 2002, when the
  Unity East Elementary School (pre-K through fifth grade) was constructed at 1638 County Road
  1000 North just north of Philo. Unity West Elementary School was built that same year in Tolono.
  The designs for the schools were very similar to conserve costs and avoid any hard feelings or
  favoritism in the district. These schools feed into the junior high and high school located in Tolono.
  The Philo school site was sold to the village and the old school building was torn down. Today the
  R. E. Franks Center occupies the part of the grade school addressed toward Washington Street,
  which is connected to the Thelma Melohn Gymnasium on Madison Street. This community center
  is used for sporting events, receptions, and reunions.

  Washington Street at the Route 130 intersection makes a concession to the adjacent railroad
  tracks before realigning with the continental grid. Washington is the commercial street in town. Its
  entrance from the west is marked by the Phillips 66 gas station. At Jackson Street, one block east
  is a commemorative place dedicated to those who have served in the armed services. This marks
  the pride of local inhabitants linked to the federal government. The flagpole and bronze plaques
  remind the population and visitors of the sacrifices made by service members from the Philo area.

   One-half block farther on the north side of the street is a small brick federal post office from the
   years just after World War II. This structure is a simple, utilitarian building, not a grand edifice
   used to symbolize the federal government. The flagpole and signage are the only things differen-
   tiating it from the nearby commercial buildings.
   The primary intersection in Philo occurs at Washington and Harrison Streets. Harrison is the only

patrons come for lunch and dinner. Most towns of this size have their own version of the Philo
Tavern: a place where people congregate to hear local news and visit with one another. The Philo
Tavern also serves as a local hub. People from other communities travel to Philo for their Friday
fish fries and their Saturday night prime rib dinners.
Many towns and villages across the Midwest are similar to Philo. Yet each has unique, distinguish-
ing characteristics that reflect its own history. It is the remarkable similarities in their built envi-

     About the Walk

     The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has an incredibly rich set of exterior spaces, including
     Illini Grove, the quadrangles, and many smaller intimate areas. In America, some of the most beauti-
     ful landscapes are cemeteries and public gardens. This part discusses both the formation of the
     campus topography and how American cultural preferences of the landscape have shifted over the
     centuries.
     Mount Hope Cemetery, directly to the south of the Stock Pavilion, predates the university. This area
     was used for interment by the 1850's. Currently Mount Hope Cemetery has approximately 14,000
     graves. The cemetery features a large mausoleum and chapel, individual and family mausoleums, a
     columbarium, family plots, in-ground plots, a Jewish section, and areas reserved for military veter-
     ans. A tour through the cemetery reflects the values and concerns of the living even in death. Strate-
     gies and design layout with trees and plantings reinforce the values of our society and the changes
     that continue to take place in the world of the living that affect the world of the dead.
     This walk begins at the entrance to Mount Hope Cemetery at 611 East Pennsylvania Avenue in Cham-
     paign. The walk moves in a wide counterclockwise circle from the main mausoleum and then west-
     ward before returning to the entrance gate.

       God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female
       He created them. God blessed them; and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and
       fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky
       and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
       --Genesis 1:27-28

With the Fall of Man (Genesis ch. 3), God sends Adam and Eve away:

       "Cursed is the ground because of you!
       In toil shall you eat its yield

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 154
       All the days of your life.
       Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you,
       And you will eat the plants of the field.
       By the sweat of your face shall you get bread to eat
       Until you return to the ground,
       From which you were taken;
       For you are dirt,
       And to dirt you shall return."
       . . . the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which
       he was taken. So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed
       the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the
       tree of life.

Part 3.5. Orientation Map.

In these chapters from Genesis describing the origin story of humanity from the Christian per-
spective, two important ideas in this tradition are relayed that shall be discussed here: first, that
humankind has dominion over nature; second, that in the beginning humans lived in a garden in
which harmony existed between people and animals, and humankind's fall from grace and banish-

  ment from the Garden of Eden created a clearly antagonistic relationship between humans and
  nature.

  The history of human civilization traces back to a nomadic existence with a seasonal movement of
  clans. Only with the advent of agricultural farming were groups able to settle in one place. These
  settlements reflected a fundamental understanding of the seasons and allowed for greater manip-
  ulation of the built environment. Stonehenge is an example of a neolithic desire to fix oneself in
  both time and place.

  As human societies evolved so did the understanding of the universe and nature. Since antiquity,
  however, some cultures have had a core belief that though humans benefit greatly from an
  enhanced understanding of nature, there still is a fundamentally antagonistic relationship between
  them. Even today, structures are constructed to keep weather out and provide safety within. At the
  urban scale, cities in previous eras were typically encircled by walls and fortified for protection.
  Those not "inside" the walls (exemplifying one's own society) were "outsiders"--barbarians--and

                                           1

  often antagonistic.

  During early settlement of what would become the United States and the later westward move-
  ment by Europeans and their descendants, the notion of outside versus inside became important
  in their psychology. The indigenous peoples may or may not have been thought by Europeans to
  be like Rousseau's romanticized "Noble Savage" but they were certainly considered by many Euro-
  peans to be "uncivilized." Similarly, the Native Americans were wary of the "uncivilized" strangers.
  Benjamin Franklin wrote in his essay "Remarks concerning the Savages of North America" (1784)
  explaining each society:

1. The philosopher John Locke, in his Two Treatises, proposed the idea that humans were essentially free beings:

          According to him humans were initially in a state of nature. The state of nature was apolitical in the sense that
          there were no governments and each individual retained all of his or her natural rights. People possessed these
          natural rights (including the right to attempt to preserve one's life to seize unclaimed valuables and so forth)
          because they were given by God to all of his people. The state of nature was inherently unstable. Individuals
          would be under constant threat of physical harm. And they would be unable to pursue any goals that required
          stability and widespread cooperation with other humans. Locke's claim is that government arose in this con-
          text. Individuals seeing the benefits which could be gained decided to relinquish some of their rights to a central
          authority while retaining other rights. This took the form of a contract. In agreement for relinquishing certain
          rights individuals would receive protection from physical harm security for their possessions and the ability to
          interact and cooperate with other humans in a stable environment ("John Locke (1632-1704)," Internet Encyclo-
          pedia of Philosophy, accessed June 11, 2025, https://iep.utm.edu/locke/#SH4a).

  Thus the citizen was affiliated with a particular government. All others were a part of another society that was often
  viewed with suspicion and mistrust.

                                                                                                                                                                Kevin J. Hinders | 156
       Savages we call them, because their manners differ from ours, which we think the perfec-
       tion of civility; they think the same of theirs.

       Perhaps, if we could examine the manners of different nations with impartiality, we should
       find no people so rude as to be without any rules of politeness; nor any so polite as not to

                                                                                2

       have some remains of rudeness.

This bias toward self as civilized and outsider as barbarian can be illustrated by the children's
movie Pocahontas, released by Disney in 1995, as the English settlers exchange lyrics with the
Powhatan tribe:

What can you expect                         This is what we feared
From filthy little heathens?                The paleface is a demon
Here's what you get when races are diverse  The only thing they feel at all is greed
Their skin's a hellish red                  Beneath that milky hide
They're only good when dead                 There's emptiness inside
They're vermin, as I said                   I wonder if they even bleed
And worse                                   They're savages! Savages!
They're savages! Savages!                   Barely even human
Barely even human                           Savages! Savages!
Savages! Savages!                           Killers at the core
Drive them from our shore!                  They're different from us
They're not like you and me                 Which means they can't be trusted
Which means they must be evil               We must sound the drums of war
We must sound the drums of war!             They're savages! Savages!
They're savages! Savages!                   First we deal with this one
Dirty shrieking devils!                     Then we sound the drums of war!3
Now we sound the drums of war!

  Whether it was forts built by the Pilgrims or Conestoga wagons crossing the West and circling the

                                               4

  wagons for defense, there is a consistency in the inside good/outside bad and civilized/uncivi-
  lized dichotomy in American culture.

  This relationship is reflected in the manner in which the landscape is treated. Since ancient times
  in Western cultures, the walled city has typically included gardens, which often reflect a desire to
  create an earthly recreation of the "paradise lost." These paradise gardens can be seen in a vari-
  ety of places and cultures. Christian versions often replace the biblical Tree of Knowledge of Good
  and Evil with a central fountain. This may be taken as a symbol of the role that baptism plays in
  washing away the sins of Adam and Eve. In these gardens, and the evolution of gardens in Western
  culture in general, one can trace a marked sense that humankind is being placed in a dominant
  position over nature. Trees are planted in orderly rows. Bushes and shrubs are trimmed to create
  geometric patterns and forms. Water is channelized and appears in fountains along with sculp-
  tures and buildings.

  The gardens of Versailles are a superb example of a design suited to exemplify Louis XIV's com-
  plete control. Topiary is trimmed into elaborate cones and arabesques in an effort to create an
  exacting order. The display of both power and control is both aesthetic and political.

  With the rise of the Enlightenment in the West a dramatic shift took place that is still reverberating
  today. As humans' understanding of the natural world expanded, the sciences developed special-
  ized fields--including physics, biology, and chemistry--that produced additional insights into how
  the universe works. With this new knowledge, humans' interactions with nature gradually changed
  from one of antagonism and a new aesthetic developed. This shift is readily seen in the English
  landscape garden. In the United States, the work of Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted illus-
  trate this change in the preference for an undulating landscape that simulates a "natural" setting.
  In truth, these landscapes are incredibly contrived to look natural but, like New York's Central Park,
  require large amounts of soil redistribution and removal of the existing natural landscape to create
  the desired effect. Therefore as the antagonistic relationship with nature changed in the West, so
  did the design of the built environment.

  The Enlightenment begat the Industrial Revolution, which provided new materials (notably steel
  and float glass) and means of production. These coinciding factors have had a substantial influence

4. Nathaniel Philbrick describes the Pilgrims' fort built in 1622 out of fear of an attack from the Narragansetts: "By March,
   it was complete: a massive, sap-dripping, bark-peeling wall between them and the surrounding forest. A new sense of
   order and control had been willed upon the wilderness. Plymouth was now an entity, a circumscribed place, its streets
   and houses darkened by the shadows of its margins. It was quite shiplike in many ways. Plymouth was like a huge
   Mayflower run aground on the shores of New England, her bow resting atop Fort Hill, her stern edging toward the har­
   bor and the outflow of Town Brook. By impaling the town, the Pilgrims had made it clear that they intended to remain
   there for a very long time" (Mayflower, 130).

                                                                                                                                                                 Kevin J. Hinders | 158
on the way we now design our world. Frank Lloyd Wright's homes illustrate the desire to place the
structure in nature. Often these homes inserted rooms into the landscape with windows on three
sides. The ability to blur the distinction between inside and outside is not just a matter of using
technology but is a use of technology in support of a shift in values about the natural environment.
Today, a homeowner may still run lawn mowers and create highly artificial landscapes, but these
alterations are often done with the sincere desire to make things look natural.

In the preindustrial age, the aspiration to reaching the heavens is seen throughout history. From
the cosmic mountains and pyramids in the Middle East, Egypt, and Mexico to the boldly tower-
ing medieval cathedrals of Europe, the use of bearing wall construction--brick on brick, stone on
stone--created monuments aspiring to link heaven and Earth. Since the invention of the Besse-
mer process, which allows for the production of steel, new construction technology has allowed
for greater verticality and horizontality and much longer spans. A new preference for the nat-
ural landscape occurred alongside these technological advancements. The search for a god not in
heaven but in the world around us has coincided with the advancements in knowledge of the nat-
ural world. Alongside this search has been a growing preference for the natural over the human
built. Thus, new construction technology has helped people create a more horizontally framed
relationship with nature. The Prairie houses of Frank Lloyd Wright and the glass and steel designs
of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe illustrate the idea of a structure that uses horizontal planes to
frame the landscape and an attempt is made to blur the distinction between inside and outside. In
Wright's case, he often created rooms with dramatic roof overhangs and windows on three sides
with the fourth edge anchored by a hearth. This symbolic idea of the hearth providing a verti-
cal centering device for the family that then extends out into nature is extremely poetic and is
repeated throughout Wright's Prairie-style houses. In Mies van der Rohe's early houses the inside
walls extended beyond the interior into a garden and the horizontal floors/ceilings extended
beyond the glass enclosure walls to create a similar extension of the inside into the natural world.
In his later work, most notably the Farnsworth House, the horizontal planes of floors and roof
hover above the ground with the occupants occupying the space in between (see figures 3.5.1 and
3.5.2).

Before exploring the landscape of campus it is essential to understand the form and formation of
the prairie in which the campus rests. In Annals of the Former World, John McPhee writes about
the Earth as it was long before human habitation. Through a series of trips with geological experts,
McPhee discusses how the Earth's forms have been created. In the passage below he is traveling in
the Midwest with geologist Anita Harris:

       We had come into the continent's province of supreme tectonic calm, the Stable Interior
       Craton, where a thin veneer of sediment lies flat upon the stolid fundament, where the
       geology--even by geological standards--is exceptionally slow. "This is the most conserva-

159 | Part 3.5. Making a Built Landscape: Cemeteries and Other Notes on Form
       tive part of the U.S.," Anita said. "I've often thought about it. The wildest, craziest people
       are in the most tectonically active places."

       And yet the craton stirs. There is no part of the face of the earth that vertically and laterally
       does not move. The bedding planes in Midwestern rock, which appear to be absolutely
       level, do in fact dip. They will descend across a great many miles and then rise, arching
       over the far rim of a vast and shallow bowl, and then subtly dip again to form a similar bowl:
       the Findlay Arch, the Michigan Basin, the Kankakee Arch, the Illinois Basin. Anita called
       the arches "basement highs." . . . They are products of the creaking motions of the craton,
       in response perhaps to plays from deep within the mantle--a process that, in the general
       phrase, is "not well understood." They represent a degree of tectonic activity about as lively

                                                                               5

       as the setting in of rigor mortis.

Illinois, as most schoolchildren learn, has incurred repeated invasions. Long before humans settled
in this area, however, there were invasions of another sort. Over the past 2.5 million years, approx-
imately twenty-five huge continental glaciers have encroached and receded across the plains.
Sometimes the glaciers measured over 2 miles thick. These glaciers moved tons of dirt and
stone at their leading edge. As temperatures warmed, the glaciers would retreat, leaving behind
moraines. Two such moraines run through Champaign County: the Bloomington Moraine system
and the Champaign Moraine system are both part of the Upper Sangamon Basin. These moraines
were formed between 10,000 and 25,000 years ago during what is called the late Wisconsin glacia-
tion. This Wisconsin invasion left a moraine that is a part of the University of Illinois campus. A
long ridge runs south of Memorial Stadium, State Farm Center, and the intramural activity fields.
The top of this ridge is crowned by the round barns along St. Mary's Road. To the south, waters
drain to the 195-mile-long Embarras River before emptying into the Wabash just above the Ohio
River. To the north, the waters drain to the Boneyard Creek (see figure 3.5.3).

At first, the waters of the glaciers were held by the earthen dams they had left behind. Eventually
the increasing water pressure on the moraines caused breakthroughs, such as the Sangamon
River, which cuts through the moraine near Mahomet. These breakthroughs typically feature sand
and gravel deposits at their outflow. Because of the broad, flat areas left behind by previous, more
southerly encroaching glaciers, the water on the south side of the Champaign Moraine spread and
settled. South of Champaign remained a vast, swampy area for millennia before ingenious meth-
ods were used by settlers in the 1800s to produce some of the richest farmlands in the world. Even
today, the areas to the south of the moraines have a very high water table.

This is the natural landscape surrounding the university: Broad prairie occupying approximately
eighty percent of the land with groves of trees near streams and rivers accounting for the remain-

  The cemeteries predate the university. As the school has grown it has come to envelop the parcel
  that once defined its southern edge.

  Mount Hope Cemetery was founded in 1855 on acreage donated by the Burt family and was incor-

  outdoors in a manicured landscape. Paths and roads provided vehicular and pedestrian access to
  open green space. The Mount Hope Cemetery site has an appealing undulation of the ground. Pre-
  viously the largest cemetery space in Urbana was located at what is now Leal Park until the Native
  American and pioneer remains buried there were relocated to other cemeteries. Though Mount
  Hope is perceived as a single cemetery, there are two separately named cemeteries. Because of
  upkeep costs, an area in township section 18 (the westernmost area, alongside Fourth Street) was
  sold in 1906 for $50,000 to a group that named its area the New Mount Hope Cemetery. This later
  became Roselawn Cemetery (see figure 3.5.5).

  Although the two cemeteries are contiguous, they remain separate in name and retain separate
  pricing for grave spaces and burial services. The cemeteries are now the resting place of approxi-

Figure 3.5.5. Mount Hope Cemetery and Roselawn Cemetery.

Both Mount Hope Cemetery and Mausoleum and Roselawn Cemetery are addressed at 611 East
Pennsylvania Avenue in Champaign. On entering the main gate, the mausoleum along with its non-
denominational meeting space is located to the east. A low stone building, the mausoleum pro-
vides aboveground burial locations for both embalmed and cremated remains. A gathering space
with amber glass to either side of a vaulted, central hall greets the visitor. Bench pews for approx-
imately 100 people allow for viewings and ceremonies. Tombs are stacked six high and run in adja-
cent corridors lined with small urns for flowers and mementos. Many couples and families are
grouped together. Uniform cream-colored marble slabs with bronze letters announce the names
of the people interred. Benches provide resting space for the bereaved and those visiting. Shelves
with glass doors hold vessels with cremated remains.
Outside are four primary materials used as grave markers. Early stone memorials and monuments
were often carved out of limestone and marble. Because of the weathering effects on these mate-
rials, granite has now become the stone of choice. Most granites are gray, red, or black. Bronze
metal is also often used in plaques in the military sections. Bronze is chosen as it conveys a sense
of dignity, resists effects of weathering, and can be cast to include information about the deceased.
As one moves through the cemetery these materials will convey their own attributes to the visitor.

  This area provides tombs for war veterans dating back to the Revolutionary War. The grave mark-
  ers in this area are made predominantly of white marble. The thin markers have rounded tops and
  stand in rows at attention. Weather has eroded the engravings but the information is still legible.

   Urbana was closed and those interred there were moved to Mount Hope Cemetery by April 1900.
   Today many of these grave markers have stones placed on top in the Jewish tradition. According to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    10

   Rabbi David Wolpe, the reasons for this practice range from the "superstitious to the poignant."
   Superstition has it that the stones help keep the soul down as the grave is believed to retain some
   aspect of the departed soul. The stones also serve as a more permanent reminder of one's visit
   than flowers, which are rarely seen in Jewish cemeteries. Stones have a permanence of memory
   while flowers provide a sense of passing. Another explanation dates to the days of shepherds:

           A beautiful answer takes its cue from the inscription on many gravestones. The Hebrew
           abbreviation taf, nun, tsadi, bet, hey stands for "teheye nishmato tsrurah b'tsror ha-
           chayyim," a phrase usually translated "May his soul be bound up in the bonds of eternal
           life."

           Yet tsror in Hebrew means a pebble. In ancient times, shepherds needed a system to keep
           track of their flocks. On some days, they would go out to pasture with a flock of 30; on
           others, a flock of 10. Memory was an unreliable way of keeping tabs on the number of the
           flock. As a result, the shepherd would carry a sling over his shoulder, and in it he would
           keep the number of pebbles that corresponded to the number in his flock. That way he
           could at all times have an accurate daily count.

           When we place stones on the grave and inscribe the motto above on the stone, we are
           asking God to keep the departed's soul in His sling. Among all the souls whom God has to

                                                                                                                                                                                             11

           watch over, we wish to add the name--the "pebble"--of the soul of our departed.

   In addition to stones one may also find touching reminders from loved ones who have left behind
   objects such as a harmonica, an action figure, or a hockey puck (see figure 3.5.7).

   Though entire books have been written on symbolism in the cemetery it is worthwhile to touch

 9. This cemetery is believed to have been located near the property of Judge Joseph and Mary Cunningham, whose man­
    sion was turned into an orphanage after its donation to the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1894. (Avner and Avner, Jewish
    Sections of Mount Hope Cemetery, 2); As the size and diversity of the Jewish community grew, the special Jewish sec­
    tion of Mount Hope also grew and diversified. As new Jewish organizations became established within the community,
    operation of the Jewish cemetery became more of a cooperative activity. The major populations served have belonged
    to the Reform congregation of the Sinai Temple (established in 1904 as the Champaign-Urbana Hebrew Congregation),
    the Orthodox Congregation B'nai Israel (active from 1912 through 1954), and the University of Illinois Hillel Foundation
    (established in 1923). From 1899 to the present, the area covered by the Jewish section of Mount Hope has been gradually
    expanded by purchase of additional land with the income earned from sales of burial rights. In May 2015, the Jewish sec­
    tion of Mount Hope Cemetery consisted of 870 burial spaces and 36 mausoleum spaces containing 421 interment (Ibid.,
    2-3).

   on why certain trees and shrubs are found in this cemetery. Moving west from the Jewish area
   one comes to an alee of very old cedar trees (genus Cedrus). These trees are coniferous, which
   gives them longevity and an evergreen character, and this makes them and cypress trees (genus
   Cupressus) common in cemeteries. The cypress has been associated with death since the ancient

                                                                                                                                                                                                          12

   Greeks and Romans, who believed the tree was sacred to the keepers of the underworld. It is
   thought that the wood used to make the cross for Jesus's crucifixion came from the wood of a
   cypress or oak tree. Thus, the oak (genus Quercus) is one deciduous tree often associated with
   graveyards. Early American settlers were known to have buried children under or near the shade
   of oak trees. The weeping willow (genus Salix) is another tree often associated with cemeteries
   and typically these are located near ponds and streams. Because of the topography at Mount Hope
   and Roselawn willows are not prevalent, but graveside peony bushes are very common here. These
   perennial flowers need very little attention and are known to survive generations, which makes
   them an ideal planting for spring and early summer flowering. Also found in Mount Hope Ceme-

   tery are English yews (Taxus baccata). Yews such as these have been known to live for centuries.

13. On the Apsley family's aristocratic Cotswolds estate near Cirencester, England, a yew hedge is trimmed annually to stand

    40 feet tall. It is 15 feet wide at the base and 8 feet wide at the top. It is estimated this hedge was planted in 1710 (Daily
    Mail Reporter, "Just a Short Back and Sides").

At the western edge of the alee is a meadow. Graves bound the north side of the gravel road. To the
south lies the potter's field, where poor and unknown people, criminals, and some suicide victims
are buried--many in unmarked graves.

       Figure 3.5.8. The Stevick-Chinigo Mausoleum.

Farther to the west is a second area dedicated to veterans. This section was originally a rectangu-
lar area demarcated from other spaces by four corner plantings of yew shrubs. Over time, these
shrubs overgrew the adjacent gravesites and all but those in one corner have been removed. This
unfortunate need for removal has left the area poorly defined. The graves here do not have head-
stones of granite or marble and instead are marked with bronze plaques that lie flat along the

167 | Part 3.5. Making a Built Landscape: Cemeteries and Other Notes on Form
ground in rows. Each plaque designates the name, rank, date of birth, and date of death and some-
times include a religious symbol (for example, a cross or Star of David) along with the war in which
the veteran served. A monument at the north end of the section is dedicated to those who gave
their lives in combat.

                           Figure 3.5.9. Huff and Zuppke Headstones on the `fifty yard line.'

The corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Fourth Street has a parking lot that forms the northern
boundary of Roselawn Cemetery. Extending the eastern boundary of the parking area directly
south determines the border between Mount Hope and Roselawn. Roselawn became a popular
burial location as its founders promised better upkeep than at the neighbor to the east.

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 168
Though widespread in other countries such as Italy, family mausoleums are not common in Mid-
western cemeteries. Though they certainly exist (there are numerous mausoleums in Mount Hope
Cemetery) only a few have been built since 1945 here, and a major one is in Roselawn. This notable
structure is the mausoleum for a family of newspaper publishers at the northwest corner of the
cemetery near a secondary entrance off Fourth Street. The Stevick-Chinigo mausoleum is an ele-
gant granite, cubic volume with adjacent urns on each side and two asymmetrically placed bronze
doors. David Stevick's ownership of the News-Gazette newspaper was taken over by his wife and
later his daughter, Marajen Stevick Chinigo, until death in 2002. The mausoleum is sited at a
45-degree angle with Fourth Street and has a paved forecourt with semicircular benches This is
one of the last family mausoleum constructed in the two cemeteries. See figure 3.5.8).

                        Figure 3.5.10. Headstone of Thomas D. "Dike" and Teddy G. Eddleman.

Roselawn also has the graves of a number of well-known persons from the University of Illinois.
Looking toward Memorial Stadium looming up across Fourth Street, it is possible to pick out
where the 50-yard line is located in relationship to the eastern facade. The field on which the Illini
play is known as Zuppke Field in honor of Robert Zuppke (1879-1957), the Illinois football coach
from 1913 to 1941. Zuppke's grave sits on the projected 50-yard line in Roselawn. One would think
he has the perfect seat except his boss, George Huff (1872-1936), sits one row closer to the field.

169 | Part 3.5. Making a Built Landscape: Cemeteries and Other Notes on Form
   Huff, for whom Huff Hall is named, was the athletic director for Illinois from 1901 to 1935. These
   family graves are marked on both sides and can be seen by passersby from Fourth Street (see figure
   3.5.9).

           Figure 3.5.11. The Atkins Family gravesite.

   Also noteworthy is the grave location of Thomas D. "Dike" Eddleman and his wife, Teddy. Eddle-
   man's headstone has images of the three sports he played as an Illini (basketball, football, and
   track). It is located at the extension of the south end zone. Presumably Eddleman's penchant for
   finding the end zone continues in the afterlife (see figure 3.5.10).
   Often plots were purchased for families and contain room for two or three generations. In the
   older area of Mount Hope Cemetery families such as the Burnhams (headed by Albert C. Burnham,
   1839-97) would establish a precinct of their own with stone stairs, border markers, and a large
   family monument--in the case of the Burnhams, a tall, light gray, granite vertical obelisk resting on

                  14

   a base --surrounded by individual grave markers. Today two relatively new family plots are on the

                                                                                                                                                                  Kevin J. Hinders | 170
south side of Roselawn. The first is owned by the Atkins Family. The patriarch of the Atkins family
was Clinton "Clint" Atkins (1946-2011), a businessman and philanthropist. The Atkins Tennis Center
is named in his honor. This section is similar to the plot created a century earlier for the Burnham
family. In each area is a delineation of boundaries by stone markers. Though a somewhat irregular
shape, the Atkins monument has carefully placed pylons of black granite that match the different
markers set aside for the family plots. In the center is a large, black obelisk that has the names of
family members listed, including children and grandchildren. Nearby is a sculpture of a male angel
with his arms around a female figure placed within a family columbarium.
Just to the east is a plot labeled Neiswender Soldwedel with a sculpture of an adult male lion and
an adult female lion along with three cubs. At the base of the monument is a grave for a young
child. This tender depiction of the bonds of family has a mourning bench enclosed by a granite
fenced area.

       Figure 3.5.12. Neiswender Soldwedel Family gravesite.

Along the way back to the Mount Hope Mausoleum one passes a variety of headstones, monu-

most recognizable obelisk in the United States, though not made of a single piece of stone, is the Washington Monu­
ment in Washington, DC.
171 | Part 3.5. Making a Built Landscape: Cemeteries and Other Notes on Form
   ments, and memorials. As in most Midwestern cemeteries there are a considerable number of
   obelisks from different eras in different colors and types of stone. The obelisk is a type of axis
   mundi. In the cemetery setting, it attempts to link the grave with the heavens while marking a
   particular place on Earth. It is a means to establish a miniature center of the universe for the
   deceased. It is also a form associated with Freemasonry and obelisks are commonly used to iden-
   tify the graves of masons.

   Another often seen marker is the "Woodmen's column" (see figure 3.5.13). Modern Woodmen of
   America was formed in 1883 as a financial fraternity by Joseph Cullen Root, who sought to "bind in
   one association the Jew and Gentile, the Catholic and the Protestant, the agnostic and the athe-

            15

   ist." The group's name was inspired by the pioneers who "cleared forests to build homes and

                                                                                                                       16

   communities and provide security for their families." Root later created Woodmen of the World
   (WOW) to be an organization that would "clear away problems of financial security for its mem-

                 17

   bers." A women's auxiliary of WOW, the Supreme Forest Woodmen Circle, was formed in 1892.
   From 1890 to 1900, WOW life insurance policies included free grave markers and from 1900 to the
   mid-1920s members needed to purchase a $100 rider to cover the cost of a monument. The prac-
   tice was finally discontinued because of the costs. To create uniformity but have local flexibility
   WOW would send templates to local stone carvers who might embellish the models with axes,
   mauls, and other woodworking instruments. These limestone markers are often found in family
   plots.

   On the backside of the multifamily mausoleum is a screened area for excavating equipment. Here
   the symbolic and poetic aspects of the cemetery meet the realities of the pragmatic digging and
   maintenance issues of the funerary business. This juxtaposition is readily seen as the equipment is
   stored adjacent to the chapel wall.

   Nearby is an exterior, aboveground burial wall located close to Pennsylvania Avenue. Similar to
   the interior of the Mount Hope Mausoleum, black granite slabs announce the presence of those
   interred behind. This is a columbarium. By European standards, where above ground burial is more
   common, this is a quite small. European cemeteries commonly have long "streets" in their necrop-
   olises ("cities of the dead"), see figure 3.5.14.

   In the Midwest, the cemetery has never been seen as a city, but rather is a rural landscape with a
   sense of peace. From here, one can freely wander through this landscape and enjoy a predecessor
   of the Midwest's public park.

Notes on the Landscape

The university has a beautiful relationship with the landscape, which is discussed in different parts
of this book. It is worth noting three other landscapes in brief: Illini Grove, the Arboretum with
Japan House, and the rain gardens.

                             Figure 3.5.13. A Woodsman Column.

Illini Grove was established in 1871 on the more than 13 acres originally called the Forestry. It was
planted with over 15 different tree species to educate farmers about which ones to use for fire-

   wood, fence posts, and shelter. More tree species were added as the area was enhanced, but the
   construction of Lincoln Avenue Residence Hall and McKinley Health Center trimmed it to only 9
   acres. A resolution was passed by the Illinois State Legislature to ask the university to keep this
   space wooded and open in honor of Senator Stanley Weaver and Mary Smith Weaver because of

                                                              19

   their dedication to nature.

    aesthetically enriched setting for education, research, conservation and enjoyment." The Arbore-
    tum occupies 160 acres and continues to be developed. It has a formal allusion as being an exten-
    sion of the President's House. The main formal garden is located on an axis with the house to
    create a perceptual, but not connected, axis. This is similar to what a Georgian/English house
    would have: a formal front with a parterre garden behind and an open Olmsted-style garden in the
    distance.

    Japan House is near this area but lies in a more naturalistic-appearing garden. Near the structure
    small theme gardens associated with traditional Japanese ceremonies change the scale of the

    Rain gardens are now used to help alleviate flooding on campus and downstream. These gardens
    are planted with native species and use swales to capture water that might otherwise move to
    storm sewers. The swales temporarily contain runoff and allow the ground to absorb the rainwa-
    ter as it percolates through the soil. A goal of these gardens and swales is to slow the flow of water
    from the watershed and allow it to be absorbed by the earth rather than flow across impermeable

dens help recharge the aquifer beneath.

Part 3.6. The Home and the Street: Erlanger
House and Its Environments

     About the Walk

     No matter how many different types of urban and rural environments a person may have experi-
     enced, people can recall a meaningful personal living condition--be it an apartment in a large com-
     plex or a single-family house. This part begins by discussing the development and values of the
     American Midwestern street and its typical landscape and homes. The discussion then moves on to a
     small home constructed in the early 1960s for Margaret Erlanger, a member of the Dance Depart-
     ment faculty. This home was designed by Jack S. Baker, a professor in the Illinois School of Architec-
     ture. The structure inverts many qualities of the typical neighboring houses while maintaining many
     aspects of them to make it an integral part of its neighborhood. The relationship between the user
     and structure to create a place suited to the owner's desires is emphasized. This unique home was
     bequeathed by Erlanger to the Illinois School of Architecture and now acts as both a home for visit-
     ing scholars and a retreat center for faculty colloquia.
     This walk begins at the intersection of West Indiana Avenue and South Lincoln Avenue in Urbana.
     Erlanger House is located at 303 West Indiana Avenue.

  In the 16th century the architect Baldassare Peruzzi and his protégé Sebastiano Serlio reasoned
  that there were two primary set designs for theatrical works that took place in the city: the scena
  tragica (tragic scene) and the scena comica (comic scene). The tragic scene was conveyed through
  heroic classical architecture and served as models for architects of the Renaissance. Structures
  included triumphal arches, obelisks, round arches, and palaces (see figure 3.6.1).

         Figure 3.6.1. Serlio's Tragic Scene from Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva.

  The perspective is laid out to reveal a space with buildings respectfully creating order. It is easy
  to imagine Shakespeare's tragedies in these heroic settings as one ponders the concepts of life,

                                          1

  mercy, and greed. The comic scene is populated with mostly medieval architecture, a ruin, and

1. Though many of Shakespeare's plays are set in the Middle Ages, the idea of a well-ordered and noble space supports the
  more serious subjects of plays such as Hamlet and contrasts with the more haphazard, unplanned spaces of happen­
  stance in the comic scene--the setting for plays like The Taming of the Shrew.
                                                                                                                                                                 Kevin J. Hinders | 178
a church with greenery growing out of its dilapidated bell tower. Buildings undulate in and out,
which leaves a space less clearly defined than what's found in the tragic scene (see figure 3.6.2).

                                          Figure 3.6.2. Serlio's Comic Scene from Tutte

These served the Renaissance well. But the United States is the product of the Enlightenment. A
move toward the sciences--both natural and political--was at the foundation of the nation. As this
country grew the pioneer spirit and the preference for living with, and in, nature was a part of the
national psyche. Here, a different model was essential. Serlio had published one other scene, the
scena satyrica (satyric scene), that seems to embody the Midwestern small town. The satyric scene
might be imagined as a setting for A Midsummers Night's Dream with structures under a canopy
of trees lining a path (see figure 3.6.3).

       The American small town is a dream town. . . . It is the Enlightenment garden city rendered
       in infinite variations. . . 237. But Elm Street--Elm Street elevates it all, occasionally to the
       level of poetry. With Elm Street, European hegemony in the development of urban streets
       is challenged, and in the process Serlio's "Satyric Scene," long ignored by Europe, is resur-
       rected, civilized, and brought center stage. Elm Street is the quintessential tree-lined res-
       idential street. . . .
       The house sits free in continuous Arcadia, discreetly varying but always addressing the
       great colonnade of trees that structure the public realm. Here public and private are both
       accommodated in a respectful dialogue; and adherence to the conventions of street, side-

179 | Part 3.6. The Home and the Street: Erlanger House and Its Environments
       walk, front yard, porch, and public rooms is precisely what allows invention and private

                               2

       variation.

A pre-World War II street with brick pavers and a clear sense of both public and private zones,
Indiana Avenue, between Orchard Street and Lincoln Avenue, is a version of this Elm Street, USA
(see figure 3.6.4).

Figure 3.6.3. Serlio's Satyric Scene from Tutte l'opere d'architettura
et prospetiva.

There is a beautiful balance created by the orderly adherence to simple patterns. On both sides of
the street is a green band before the presence of a sidewalk. This band is part of the city's right-
of-way but care for this zone is administered by the homeowners, who have planted turf grass,
ground cover, and flowers. The south side of the street also contains streetlights in this right-
of-way zone. The space between street and sidewalk is planted with shade trees, which provide
a primary ordering to the public realm. Combined with the driveways and streetlights a pleas-
ant rhythm is established. The lots on Indiana Avenue are typically a modest 60 feet wide and 130
feet deep. Most houses have detached garages located in the rear yards. The houses lining Indi-
ana Avenue are 1½ to 2½ stories tall. Though the styles of the houses vary, their masses are similar

                                                                        Kevin J. Hinders | 180
as they create a public face to the street. Almost all the houses have pitched roofs and sit back
approximately 50 feet from the street curb. The syncopation of house, side yard, side yard, house
repeats down the street and is accented by the driveways to the garages in the rear. A wall of res-
idences is raised slightly above grade, which allows for basement light and ventilation and places
the houses above street level. A hierarchy of space overlooking the street creates an extended set
of front yards often overseen by front porches, also raised above street level. These porches once
served an important social function. Not only did they announce the front door and entry into the
home, but they provided a place to overlook the street and passersby. On warm summer evenings
they provided a place for residents to take in cooler evening breezes. The romanticized picture
is of young couples who would promenade their baby carriages or take evening walks with chil-
dren while neighbors discussed news of the day on the porches--overseeing the scene is a strong
aspect of the American dream. The very idea of community is fostered by this setting.

        Figure 3.6.4. Indiana Street, Urbana Illinois.

The public and private aspects of life are further reflected in the Indiana Avenue houses built prior
to World War II. The homes typically have a porch that serves the entry. Rooms such as offices/
studies and living rooms are placed at the front of the house to overlook the street. Kitchens and
informal rooms, such as family areas, are located to the rear. Kitchens typically are entered off the
back or side of the house. Though side yards occasionally have gardens, most gardens--especially

181 | Part 3.6. The Home and the Street: Erlanger House and Its Environments
  the victory gardens created during the war to grow vegetables--are reserved for the backyard. The
  backyard is for the family and invited guests. It is a private realm, often fenced off from neighbors.
  After World War II a shift began to take place in the American house. Technological factors had a
  tremendous influence on the relationship between house and street. Three technological changes
  shall be discussed here: the growing use of the private automobile, the creation and proliferation

                                                                                                                3

  of air conditioning, and the invention of television.

                      Figure 3.6.5. Single Family Housing Lot Diagram. Read long description of figure.

  The automobile is credited with helping create the American suburb. The dream of owning one's
  own home was achievable for more people as getting to and from work became easier. After World
  War II the federal government, under President Dwight Eisenhower, created the Interstate High-
  way System. The highways made getting to workplaces and leisure activities faster and made peo-
  ple less dependent on commuter trains. As the arterial streets and highways began to crisscross
  the nation the countryside began to be consumed by suburbs. As the speed of the automobile
  increased so did the size of the suburban lot. The typical single-family house went from occupy-
  ing a narrow, deep lot to residing on wider, and then even wider, lots. Alleys were no longer built.

3. These are not stand-alone phenomena as they are dependent on fuel and advancements in energy delivery.
                                                                                                                                                                 Kevin J. Hinders | 182
Homes began to incorporate attached garages. Initially these were one-car garages and discreet
but eventually the designs grew to two-car garages or even larger structures with large, electron-
ically operated doors prominently displayed to the street. The house that was once deeper than it
was wide is now often wider than it is deep (see figure 3.6.5).

                           Figure 3.6.6. Plans of Erlanger House. Image courtesy of Jeff Poss. Read

Today the issue of sprawl is being questioned as people are becoming more aware of the depletion
of the Earth's resources and the burdens that fossil fuel use is placing on the environment.
The second technological factor dramatically affecting the house is the advent of air conditioning.
In the past, it was preferable to spend time in the summer evenings outdoors and wait for the
house to lose some of the heat gained through the course of a hot, sunny day. After the advent of
air conditioning, porches, especially covered porches, were often turned into weather-enclosed
spaces. These enclosures created additional interior living space. This internalization of the porch
tended to change the social quality of the street while also often changing the previous public-pri-
vate relationship. Today the back patio is the place reserved for outdoor activity. A simple privati-

183 | Part 3.6. The Home and the Street: Erlanger House and Its Environments
zation has occurred. In many suburbs the porch is no longer a relevant feature and in some cases
is a decorative element at best.

                              Figure 3.6.7. Erlanger House vertical slot as seen from Indiana
                              Avenue. Image Courtesy of Ken McCown.

The third technological factor is television. Though radio held an important place in America's cul-
ture, the rise of television began to create an internalization to the American home. Social dia-
logue often became a discussion of the previous night's TV program. Milton Berle became "Mr.
Television" and "Uncle Miltie" was like a family member in your family room. Today, the legacy of
television, including aspects of computers and the Internet, continue to contribute to the inter-
nalization of the American household.
The comforts of the internal space, made greater by the ability to have more square footage, have
changed the character of residential streets in the US. Today, many suburbs do not incorporate
sidewalks. If they do, it is often only on one side of the street. As homes have become retreats
the grid has given way to the curved street and the cul-de-sac. The automobile often dictates the
distance the house sits back from the street, so when a garage begins to become a repository for
material no longer capable of being stored inside the house proper, there is at least a space pro-
vided to accommodate the displaced automobile.

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 184

  The beauty of Indiana Avenue--Urbana's version of Elm Street--is fragile. Its success depends on
  the landscape and structures working in harmony. Any disruption in either leads to a greater
  destruction of the whole:

          Unfortunately, the very characteristics that give the small American town its positive qual-
          ities are also those that make it extremely vulnerable. Endless nuance and interpreta-
          tion are possible as long as the delicate balance of solids and voids is maintained. But the
          Neoclassical system is inherently biased in favor of the private icon, so balance is dou-
          bly dependent on maintenance of the public realm, the underpinnings of which are still,
          however faint, those of the classical structure of space--of street and square. What is not
          defined by the buildings must be completed by the trees, and slight weakening of either

                                                                                                                              4

          element can result in serious erosion of the system.

  The typical structure along Indiana Avenue has a prominent door and large windows overlooking
  the street. There is however an exception that demonstrates the rule. This house is an interesting
  insertion into the existing 1920s and 1930s street fabric. The house at 303 West Indiana Avenue

                                        5

  was built in 1964: a late addition to the neighborhood. It was designed by Professor Jack Baker of

5. Margaret Erlanger bequeathed the house to the University of Illinois School of Architecture in 1975.

the Illinois School of Architecture for Margaret Erlanger, a leader and instructor of dance. Stylis-
tically the house is considered a work of modern architecture in the international style (see figure
3.6.6).

Figure 3.6.9. Erlanger House view across the discussion area to the rear yard. Image courtesy of Ken McCown.

Baker sought to create a unique building that met the needs and personality of its owner while
still fitting into the existing neighborhood. He was able to create a structure that accepts the basic
materials, massing, and setbacks of the adjacent homes while changing just about everything else.
The house is a two-story brick building with one bedroom and 1½ baths. It has a flat roof. Designed
for a single woman, it guarded her privacy by turning inward and limiting the house's exposure to
the street. Instead the house, which sits on Carle Park, has only two tall, transparent slot windows
that allow limited views to one of Urbana's most beautiful parks (see figure 3.6.7).
Instead Baker placed the house between two exterior courtyards to the north and south. He then
opened the house up with two-story-tall walls set into the thick brick frames. The mass of the
building is symmetrical but the interior layout is not. Entering in the east slot one encounters a
foyer with a wooden staircase to the left and a coat/storage closet to the right. This slot of space
moves through the building to provide a view of the backyard. The floor is sandblasted concrete.
Moving into the main space from the foyer one encounters a lowered discussion area, a floating

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 186
fireplace, and a large, two-story dance space/living room. This is the central volume of the house
(see figures 3.6.8-3.6.11).

Figure 3.6.10. Erlanger House interior view of the dance floor/living area. Image courtesy of Ken McCown.

To the north is a gravel-floored courtyard connected to the discussion area with large, sliding
glass doors with glass above. To the south is the rear yard, also connected to the interior with
large sliding glass doors and glass above. The effect is a large space that blurs interior and exterior.
The spaces are defined more by the horizontal floor and ceiling than by the adjacent walls, which
have been designed to float between the entry and the kitchen. Materials are kept to a very limited
palette. Floors are concrete and wood on the first floor. Baker used three-wythe-thick masonry
bearing wall construction for the exterior walls and left the brick exposed on the interior. Glass
is inserted with limited framing to accentuate the interior/exterior connections. When not brick,
interior walls are limited to painted white drywall and painted black louvers for the mechanical
systems. The building is detailed to bring the gravel on the outside north court into the interior
space. The concrete aggregate in the floors matches the gravel in the courtyards. On the south
side a concrete pad moves from inside to outside, one step above the wooden floor of the dance
space.
The stairs have no outer handrail. Baker was well aware that the owner's movements were an inte-
gral aspect of the house. Ascending the stairs one moves across a bridge to the bedroom (see fig-
ures 3.6.12-3.6.14).

                         separating the exterior and interior. Image courtesy of Ken McCown.

This room floats above the discussion space with a bathroom beyond. Baker minimized the layout
to a simple east-west floor suspended above the main north-south axis. This space is detailed to
accentuate the suspended, hovering sense. The bedroom has no walls to the north and south. No
one can look into the bedroom. The floors are notched so as to not meet the exterior walls. Baker
was so concerned with minimizing the design and accommodating his client that he placed the
light switches under the carpeting to be activated by a tap of the foot.
Even the exterior landscaping is kept minimal. The yard is raised several steps above the sidewalk

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 188
and filled with gravel and ground cover. No garage was provided. Maintenance was kept as low as
possible.

Erlanger House is perceived by some as an eyesore and others as one of the finest pieces of
modern architecture in Champaign. It is historically contextual. In the late 1950s and early 1960s
numerous architects began creating symmetrical buildings--long disdained by the modern move-
ment. Today visitors with permission are able to experience the space and determine for them-
selves the appropriateness of the house.

PART 4. TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF
ARCHITECTURE

       Overview

       This part will discuss the professional responsibility of the designer (architect or designer) to the
       client (the owner) and the general public, beginning with an outline of general welfare and the need
       to adhere to codes. The text then progresses to an outline of typical services provided by the archi-
       tect/designer. This part uses three walks to illustrate technical responses to design requirements.
       Parts on mechanical systems (supply and demand) and structures give examples of how designers
       use codes and technical principles to inform the creation of design solutions.

  191 | Part 4. Technical Aspects of Architecture
          --Preamble, Constitution of the State of Illinois

  The US Constitution, along with most state constitutions, has a statement about general welfare:

                                                                                                                                                                                                          2

  the concern of the government for the health, peace, freedom, and safety of its citizens. The
  design of the built environment is greatly affected by these beliefs. Laws and codes have been
  adopted to protect health, safety, and welfare (of the public and the owner and future owners of
  a structure). Whereas in some cultures the architect is considered a purveyor of culture, in the
  United States a pragmatic approach is taken. In the United States architects and those partici-
  pating in the design of buildings are legally responsible to two primary groups: their clients and
  the general public. The architect is bound by law to deliver contractually agreed upon services
  for the owner and must also meet the requirements of codes adopted by law by the local com-
  munity, state, and federal governments. These codes (and sometimes covenants) are expected to
  protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community--thus fulfilling an obligation expressly
  stated in the US and Illinois Constitutions. Hence the design should fulfill the needs of the client
  while also meeting base standards to protect the owner and the public. Codes are created by orga-
  nizations that set standards. These organizations (for example, the International Code Council)
  operate independently from the jurisdictions responsible for adopting and enforcing codes. If a
  community does not specify the codes that will govern structures in their area, then the designer
  is expected to act "reasonably and responsibly," which typically means the designer will rely on
  best practices and/or codes they would normally use elsewhere. Codes also prescribe aspects of
  design that the community has declared valuable. For example, a local municipality may decide
  that there will be a minimum setback between buildings. For whatever reason, be it fire safety, pri-
  vacy, or servicing, this setback becomes the design criteria for that community.

  Adherence to codes is important because it assures a base level of quality control. It also gives
  future owners a level of assurance as to what they might expect from a specific structure built at a
  specific time under specific code restrictions. Since ownership of constructed environments often
  change hands, it is imperative that buildings have an acceptable, documented standard to ensure
  fairness. Laws and codes are enacted to protect not only the owner constructing the project but
  also future owners and occupants.

  The State of Illinois does not have a required building code per se. Instead, units of local govern-
  ment have authority to adopt and enforce building codes, zoning ordinances, and other instru-
  ments related to construction. If a local municipality does not have a code, only then does the
  State of Illinois have authority to impose a code compliance. In this way, the local authority deter-
  mines the laws for its constituents. It is important to note, however, that there is one federal code

  that supersedes local authorities: the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). First created in 1990
  and administered by the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, this code creates guide-
  lines for inclusive design. The design standards are to assist those with disabilities including sight
  and hearing impairment and those with mobility issues--such as those who use a wheelchair. ADA

  To gain some insight into codes, this text will look at the City of Urbana. The city has adopted the

  International Code Council's 2021 ICC Model Codes.

     · Updated Standards:
        The 2021 edition incorporates changes and updates based on advancements in technology,
        construction practices, and lessons learned from previous editions.

     · Structural Provisions:
        The 2021 IBC includes new construction types for tall wood or mass timber buildings (Type
        4A, 4B, and 4C) and provisions for hillside settings in the IRC.

     · Fire Safety Enhancements:
        The 2021 IFC includes provisions for emergency responder radio communication coverage in
        new buildings and other fire safety measures.

     · Energy Conservation:
        The 2021 IECC focuses on improving energy efficiency in buildings, contributing to sustain-
        ability and reducing energy consumption.

     · Residential Building:
        The 2021 IRC includes specific requirements for one- and two-family dwellings, including
        braced wall lines, fire separation, and emergency escape and rescue openings.

  In addition to these codes the city has zoning acts that determine what kind of building uses may
  be allowed in specific areas and parcels. Zoning guides the development of areas for specific uses
  such as industrial parks, residential neighborhoods, and mixed-use developments, to name a few.
  Zoning can also determine the sizes and heights of allowable structures. It cannot be overstated
  that adherence to prescribed zoning and codes has an enormous effect on the design of the built
  environment.

  Other great determinants of the form of the built environment are the needs and desires of prop-
  erty owners. Whether the owner is an individual, a company, or a governmental entity, the owner's
  goals dramatically shape the built outcome. As has been previously stated, buildings reflect con-
  text, ideals, and aesthetics but they also meet a specific owner's needs. It is good to understand the
  process that leads to the creation of a structure or a built landscape. The following text attempts

to clarify one process that leads to a design from the architect/designer's point of view in relation
to a legal responsibility.

An agreement between three entities is the most common method for the creation of a built
design. The prevalent process to having a building constructed (though certainly not the only one)

                                                                                                                                                                                           4

is when contracts are made between an owner, an architect (designer), and a contractor. This cre-
ates an owner-architect-contractor relationship. The owner provides the site and capital for the
project, the architect provides the design expertise, and the contractor is responsible for the con-
struction of the project. There are many variations on this model.

The owner-architect agreement usually outlines the scope of work and sets the expectations and
duties of each party for the project. A typical agreement has the following design services (though
contracts may be created that include greater or fewer services, this is a guideline for understand-
ing the general services provided by the design professional): schematic design, design develop-
ment, construction documents, bidding, and construction administration (includes payment). The
American Institute of Architects (AIA) has created standard contracts for different agreements.
The AIA contracts clarify each of these services. Below is a synopsis of these basic services.

Predesign is typically an additional service and is not included in a basic owner-architect agree-
ment. Predesign refers to efforts made to assist the owner in clarifying the project. This may
include programming, which is when the project's needs are clarified. Spaces and sizes are deter-
mined and project needs are worked out before design is commenced.

Schematic design involves the creation of early designs for the owner's review. The designer pre-
pares a preliminary evaluation of the owner's program, schedule, budget, site, and other aspects
of the project to generate at least one schematic design. During this phase, multiple approaches to
the problems are typically considered and explored, such as material choices, sustainability com-
ponents, building siting and massing, and cost. The designer's ideas are presented to the owner,
often in drawing and study model form, to determine the solution with the owner.

After a schematic solution is accepted the process moves to the design development stage. Here
the project continues to change and more explorations are undertaken in relation to technical
aspects of the project. The work often involves consultants to the architect specializing in areas
the project may require (these often include experts in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
[HVAC]; plumbing; electrical systems; structural engineering; civil engineering; soils; and others,
depending on the project). These consultants may have contracts with the architect or may have
contracts directly with the owner. In some cases, the design firm has these services in-house,

4. See Ramos, "Bid like a Winner."

                                    Kevin J. Hinders | 194
  which means the firm supplies both design and engineering services. The estimate of the cost of
  work is updated and the owner's approval is again requested.

  Once the designed project is determined to meet the needs expressed by the owner within an
  allocated estimate of probable cost, it can advance to the construction documents phase. Here the
  project has drawings and specifications refined further to describe the expectations of the struc-
  ture to be built and outline these expectations for the contractor. Specifications are written doc-
  uments that describe the scope of work, the materials to be used, and the methods of installation
  along with the quality of work required. Specifications are combined with construction drawings,
  which illustrate the project. These documents are meant to communicate the owner's intentions
  for the building so that the contractor can determine how it will be constructed.

  On completion of the construction drawings a project may be sent to the procurement phase. This
  involves either a bid process or a negotiated proposal. "A construction bid is the process of pro-
  viding a potential customer with a proposal to build or manage the building of a structure. It's
  also the method through which subcontractors make their proposals for their services to general

                               5

  contractors." During this phase the owner may choose to select specific contractors to provide
  a proposal for the construction of the project or may open the bidding up to interested, qualified
  contractors. During the procurement phase the designer assists by distributing documents, orga-
  nizing information for potential contractors, and guiding the bidding or negotiation process. The
  architect supplies the bidders with instructions and construction documents and clarifies ques-
  tions prior to bid submittal.

  After the successful selection of the contractor and an agreement between the owner and the
  contractor has been reached, the project enters the permitting and building stages. The designer
  enters into the construction administration phase. The designer provides for the administration
  of the contract between the owner and the contractor. In this phase the designer acts on behalf
  of the owner by evaluating the work of the contractor and advising the owner on the quality and
  progress of the project. The designer may reject work on behalf of the owner if he/she deter-
  mines it does not conform to the construction documents. The architect also acts for the owner by
  observing and verifying the completion of work so that the contractor can be paid. The architect
  issues certificates of payment after different agreed-on completions. The architect also reviews
  submittals from the contractor that assist in the completion of the project and answers questions
  that arise from the contractor as the project progresses. After passing final inspections and the
  transfer of warranties and documents, the project may be considered complete.

  There are numerous additional services and variations on these basic arrangements. Some firms
  offer design/build services, which is when a designer and a construction company have a contract

5. This information is taken from the US National CAD Standard.

   195 | Part 4. Technical Aspects of Architecture
  for both services. At other times a designer may be selected for only the first phases of the project
  and a second architect of record assumes the legal responsibility for the construction documents
  and the execution of the design. This is especially common when a designer is working in a foreign
  country and the legal situation calls for a local presence to complete the construction documents
  and oversee construction administration.
  The design of buildings and their sites may require an extensive team of contributors with special-
  izations, especially on larger projects. A typical project may have numerous considerations. The
  following is a list of drawings often used on a project, the contributors, and the letter designation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    6

  not comprehensive, these examples illustrate the complexities of constructing in today's environ-
  ment.

     About the Walk

     The university has an elaborate infrastructure to service its buildings and their occupants. The uni-
     versity maintains several facilities that produce heat, cooling, and electricity for the campus. These
     facilities include miles of steam service tunnels, shallow trench steam lines and direct buried steam
     line. There are other underground utilities such as direct buried chill water pipes, high voltage elec-
     trical conduits, natural gas pipelines, domestic water lines, sanitary sewage piping and storm sewer
     piping. The Abbott Power Plant produces the steam to over 300 customers. The steam is used for
     heating and domestic hot water usage. It is enough thermal energy for a city of over 45,000 people
     plus research facilities. Electricity and some steam is used to produce chilled water which serves
     most of the larger buildings on campus. There is also a large chilled water storage tank to reduce the
     total cost of cooling by reducing peak electric demand costs. This part focuses on this infrastructure
     that supplies heating, cooling, and electricity to the campus.
     This walk begins at the Abbott Power Plant located at 117 South Oak Street in Champaign. The walk
     also includes a tour of the Oak Street Chiller Plant located at 1305 South Oak Street in Champaign.

The university maintains a substantial infrastructure that services the buildings and grounds of the
campus. This infrastructure includes provisions for heating, cooling, electricity, telecommunica-
tions and computer access, water supply for both domestic use and fire safety, sanitary drainage,
stormwater drainage, and waste removal. These can be simplified into two areas: supply and post
consumption. In earlier times, structures on the prairie were stand-alone constructions with fire-
places, wells, and septic fields serving the needs of the inhabitants. Supplies came from nearby
forests, streams, and wells constructed for the inhabitants. Waste was either recycled, burned,
buried, or sent downstream. Today, elaborate systems have been created to service buildings and
their occupants. Often these systems are not even visible as more and more infrastructure is being
placed underground.

Supply of heating, electricity, and cooling is a substantial aspect of the university's budget and
is virtually unseen in day-to-day operations. As time has progressed these needs have expanded
dramatically The university has had four power plants to date. The first was built in 1881 and
was replaced in 1898. Both were located near Gregory Hall. In 1910 the Mathews Avenue Heating,
Lighting, and Power Plant was brought online. The central location on Mathews Avenue, north of

197 | Part 4.1. Mechanical Systems: Supply
Green Street, was preferred as the tunnels and supply lines could be kept short. As the university
expanded south, however, it became clear that a larger plant would be necessary. A compromise
was struck when locating the new Abbott Power Plant. Ideally the plant would be in the center of
the campus to limit the distances of supply runs but two factors contributed to selecting the cur-
rent location. First, it was preferable to put the plant at the edge of campus for aesthetic reasons.
Second, the plant would be near the Illinois Central Railroad tracks to facilitate train cars filled

  Since the Abbott Power Plant's construction in 1941, it has increased capacity to keep up with the
  demands of the expanding university.

          When Abbott was constructed the university's primary need was for steam to heat build-
          ings and for domestic water use (and sometimes for cooling). The peak electric load was
          very small on a per square foot of building space compared the buildings today. In the
          1940's the electric load was for lighting and some fans. There was not air conditioning. Now
          the buildings are almost all air conditioned. Additionally, some research spaces have very

                                                                                                                                        2

          strict indoor air temperature and humidity requirement.

  Located at 1117 South Oak Street, Abbott Power Plant is a cogeneration facility, which means that
  it simultaneously produces both steam and electricity and therefore is extremely efficient. With
  congeneration, a byproduct of the steam creation is the opportunity to produce electricity, which

                                                                                                                                                                                                               3

  makes it a two-for-one service that burns fuel to provide both heat and electricity to buildings.

  The university's cogeneration plant is over 80 percent efficient, which means less than 20 percent

                                                                                                                                                        4

  energy loss in the transformation of energy from one form to another. A typical power plant's pur-
  pose is to produce electricity, the most useful form of energy. Since the typical power plant does
  not have a large heat sink to absorb its heat by-product (like university buildings, for example) it
  loses a large amount of energy, which makes it less efficient. According to Bright Hub Engineering,
  most coal, natural gas, and fuel oil power plants run at efficiencies of between 30 and 45 percent
  (see "The Efficiency of Power Plants").

          Two gas turbines, which can operate on natural gas (or in an emergency fuel oil), are uti-
          lized to generate electricity. Each gas turbine is connected to a heat recovery steam gen-
          erator (HRSG) that captures the hot exhaust gases from the turbine and uses that heat
          to generate steam. Three gas-fired boilers (natural gas and/or fuel oil) and two coal-fired
          boilers convert water to steam.

          The steam generated in the HRSGs and boilers is used to operate steam turbine generators
          (STGs). The STGs use the high pressure steam from the boilers/HRSGs to spin a steam tur-
          bine that drives a generator to produce electricity. The low pressure exhaust steam from

   Cogeneration system harvests the latent heat of steam condensing back to water by sending the relatively lower pres­
   sure turbine exhaust steam to heat a building or heat exchanger. This almost doubles the economic thermal efficiency
   as compare to a remote power plant. The key is that the thermal and electrical loads have to be geographically close and
   comparable in size." Ibid.

limited to space heating, water heating, and space cooling.

Figure 4.1.1. Power Plant Diagram. Water is heated by a boiler which burns coal, fuel oil or natural gas. The steam
produced is sent to power turbines which produce electricity. This steam is then sent to the campus. Some steam
is sent to condensers which then is sent back to the feedwater pumps. Once steam is used by the campus the
remaining steam/condensed water is looped back to the power plant.

The power plant supplies low-pressure steam to over 250 buildings on campus while providing 88

                                                                                                                                                                                                  6

percent of the university's electrical needs by producing 85 megawatts (MW) of electricity.

The university chooses to remain flexible with its choice of fuel. Of the seven boilers in Abbott
three are duel fuel (natural gas or fuel oil), two are coal fired, and two are HRSGs. Having its own
plant, the university is able to negotiate preferred rates for fuels and even has its own natural gas
line, which runs from Monticello. This flexibility helps the university economize and be able to
change fuel when prices fluctuate. For example, should one fuel become scarce or have a price
spike, the power plant has the ability to shift to another fuel source to economize and deliver unin-
terrupted service. More recently with Illinois decommissioning large coal power plants with some
being converted to natural gas there have been natural gas shortages in the winter. There have
also been electrical shortages in the summer driving up the demand prices enormously. Having
onsite generation and fuel redundancy has helped manage that energy supply risk.

   The Abbott Power Plant is also environmentally compliant. A scrubber was installed in 1986 to
   clean flue gases and help protect the environment:

           18,000 automobiles off Illinois highways or the reforesting of 21,000 acres of land.

   Steam is distributed through three routes: walkable steam tunnels; shallow steam tunnels large
   enough for only two pipes (about 9 miles in total across campus); and direct-buried piping sys-
   tems, which utilize no tunnels (approximately 11 miles). All the tunnels are strictly off-limits to
   unauthorized individuals. An unauthorized person might become lost in the labyrinth of occupi-
   able, below-ground tunnels, where temperatures can reach 140 degrees Fahrenheit and lead to
   death. The university locks and monitors the entire system to safeguard against such possibilities.
   Tours of the tunnels are no longer available. Once steam is delivered to buildings it is distributed
   through radiators, hot water supplies, heating systems, and heat exchangers. The steam is also
   used to heat tap water, showers, and pools.

   The electricity produced by Abbott is shipped to the Main Campus Substation and accounts for

   the majority of the electricity used on campus--approximately 65 percent in 2023-2025.

   Renewable energy does fulfill a portion of the university's electric needs. In 2015, the university
   created Solar Farm 1.0, located south of Windsor Road near Neil Street on almost 21 acres. In its
   first year of operation it produced 2 percent of the university's electrical needs. Solar Farm 2.0 is a
   10 MW facility that occupies approximately 54 acres between First Street and Dunlap Avenue just
   north of Curtis Road. Solar Farms 1.0 and 2.0 provide approximately 6 percent of the campus elec-

                            9

   tric needs. There are discussions for a future Solar Farm 3.0.

   In December 2016 the university signed a power purchase agreement with a nearby wind farm. It
   is expected that the university's renewable sources will account for approximately 9 percent of its
   usage between 2017 and 2027. The university is aiming for carbon neutrality by the year 2050.

Following World War II the United States began to use air conditioning on a large scale. At that
time the university used stand-alone cooling towers and window units. When a new building was
constructed on campus it would have an accompanying cooling tower installed. Older buildings
were retrofitted with rooftop units when possible and window units were placed for specified
spaces.

Beginning in 2004 the university began constructing its Campus Chilled Water System (CCWS)
This single networked variable flow distribution piping system is served by five regional chiller

                                                 11

plants (see figure 4.1.2).

Figure 4.1.2. Campus Map indicating Abbott Power Plant and Chilled Water Plant Locations. There are five
chiller plants on campus with twenty-six miles of underground piping that connect ninety campus buildings.

This system is superior to other smaller cooling systems in that it provides highly reliable chilled
water service on a continual year-round basis. The central loop has reduced cooling energy con-

sumption by an estimated 20 percent. The plants are the Oak Street Chiller Plant (southwest),
the North Campus Chiller Plant (north central), the Library Air Conditioning Center (central), the
Animal Sciences Air Conditioning Center (central), and the Chemistry and Life Sciences Chiller
Plant (east central). These plants are designed to supply buildings with water chilled to 43 degrees
Fahrenheit. Buildings use the chilled water to cool throughout the year. Planning for the need for
chilled water can also be an issue of economy and timing. The university has an enormous thermal

   chillers during off-peak hours when building loads subside and electricity costs are low. Chilled

   Street.
   The university's plants service a campus of over 60,000 inhabitants in over 350 buildings. It is esti-
   mated that the output of Abbott Power Plant equals the services needed by 25,000 households.
   Though certainly a large undertaking it is small when compared with the services of Ameren Illi-
   nois, the energy and natural gas provider for central Illinois. Ameren delivers electricity to 2.5 mil-

   Different buildings on campus have different energy loads. For example, the Architecture Building
   does not have domestic hot water and only a few offices and classrooms are cooled. These rooms
   are serviced by window units. Temple Hoyne Buell Hall is one of only two buildings that have sep-
   arate cooling towers and it will be brought into the Oak Street plant's chilled water line only when
   it becomes economical or necessitated by equipment deterioration. The Business Instructional
   Facility utilizes all the services: steam, chilled water, and electricity. How buildings use provided

     About the Walk

     Buildings consume large amounts of energy and water. To provide comfortable, productive spaces
     buildings have the single greatest demand for energy on campus. A tour through Temple Hoyne
     Buell Hall provides an example of how building systems deliver a comfortable environment to its end
     users after receiving supply from the infrastructure, including Abbott Power Plant. Beginning with
     the two mechanical rooms, which house the main pumps and blowers, the principles of heating and
     cooling using a combination of radiant and forced air are explained. As one progresses through the
     building, explanations of water supply for domestic use, sprinklers, and electrical supply are pro-
     vided. Storm drainage, life-safety issues, and general code requirements are also discussed.
     This walk begins at Temple Hoyne Buell Hall located at 611 East Lorado Taft Drive in Champaign.
     Note: due to security issues, access to the mechanical rooms requires university permission.

Temple Hoyne Buell Hall (TBH), designed by Perkins Will, was conceived by its benefactor, Temple
Hoyne Buell, to be a place where the Departments of Architecture, Urban and Regional Planning,
and Landscape Architecture (the three concentrations within the College of Fine and Applied Arts
that are involved with the design of the built environment) could come together. Through the
sharing of a single building, interdisciplinary teaching and research might be undertaken. With
this vision in mind the parti is clear: The first floor of the main bar along the South Quad houses
the administrative offices of each department. Above this bar are the architecture studios. In the
bar along the military axis is the Plym Auditorium with the studios and classrooms dedicated
to urban planning and landscape architecture above. The third mass--a long, sweeping, curved
bar--contains faculty offices. The faculty are not segregated by discipline. Instead one finds a
mixed neighborhood of faculty from all three areas on the second floor, second mezzanine, and
third floor. These three bars form an interior space: the Blicharski Atrium. The atrium is a multi-
purpose space where planned and spontaneous functions can occur. Because the building leaves
much of its plumbing, heating and cooling ductwork, conduits, and other infrastructure exposed,
it lends itself to teaching students about mechanical systems (see figure 4.2.1).

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 204

Underlying and supporting this functional/conceptual layout of TBH are two factors that go hand
in hand with the designer's ideas of spatial layout: mechanical systems and how the structure
meets building codes. Most systems in other structures are not readily seen, but in TBH, however,
the systems are mostly exposed, labeled, and comprehensible.
This TBH tour begins in the lowest levels of the building--the mechanical rooms (these are
accessed via stairs and there has been no update for wheelchair access since they are not a part of
the public areas). The mechanical rooms announce their presence to the visitor. Cylindrical con-
crete forms located near the south and west entrances provide fresh air intake to the mechanical
systems. These spaces are grated to prevent unauthorized access and accidents while allowing air

  ment.

  feet one typically finds water-saturated soil, it
  is important to provide pumps that can move
  water away from the building. Without this
  preventative measure, below-ground water
  levels could cause infiltration, flooding, and
  possible structural damage. Pumps in the
  North Mechanical Room remove groundwater
  to alleviate hydrostatic pressure on the walls
  and floors of the structure. Groundwater is
  gravity fed to large cisterns below the floors in
  the basements. Building roof drains also feed
  into these cisterns. Once the cisterns reach
  capacity the water is pumped to storm drains.
  The principle is the same as in residential
  homes that utilize sump pumps to remove
  groundwater from basements and crawl
  spaces. Near these cisterns are pumps used for
  fire safety that provide pressurized water to Figure 4.2.1. Temple Hoyne Buell Hall parti diagram.
  fire standpipes located on the exterior of TBH. Read long description of figure.
  Should the fire department be needed, fire-
  fighters can hook hoses up to these rigid standpipes to access large volumes of water inside the
  building.

  The North Mechanical Room also has electrical panels and monitoring equipment, but the majority
  of the space is set up for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. Large
  amounts of ductwork, blower motors, and heating and cooling coils help manage temperatures in
  the 85,400 square feet of TBH. Two large rectangular metal boxes fed by pipes with ductwork at
  each end are used to heat and cool different zones. Providing zoned heating and cooling allows for
  flexibility and greater control and is an effective way to economize. For example, when the Plym

  those who have visited a beach and dug down to make a sandcastle one can readily understand the water table as the
  level at which one digs and finds the sand saturated with water. It generally marks the top of the zone where the pores
  in the surrounding rocks or sand are fully saturated. In Urbana-Champaign the water table is close to the surface since
  the area was a swamp for many centuries.

Auditorium is full to capacity with more than 200 people for a lecture in January, it may be neces-
sary to provide cooling to that space while other parts of the building require heating. Figure 4.2.2
shows the general zoning for TBH. The Plym Auditorium in zone 1 and the faculty offices in zone
2 are serviced by the North Mechanical Room while zone 3 and zone 4 (the Blicharski Atrium) are
serviced by the South Mechanical Room.

                                                          TBH utilizes a system that provides forced air
                                                          and radiant hot water. This dual system takes
                                                          advantage of radiant hot water sent to the

                                                          Radiant heating at the building's perimeter will
                                                          be discussed as the tour proceeds to inhabited
                                                          spaces.

                                                          (see figure 4.2.3).

                                                          Large blower motors pull air from the outside

                                                          already been supplied to the building. This is

systems zoning diagram. Read long description of figure.  This air is mixed together and some air is

exhausted from the system to get an appropriate mixture of fresh and treated air. This air is then

sent through filters before it is heated or cooled. The heating and cooling coils in the system con-

tain liquids that have reached a desired temperature to condition the air properly. As the air passes

over the coils it is conditioned and then sent to habitable spaces. These habitable spaces contain

thermostats that allow users to further control the temperature. The location where the air enters

the space is called the point of delivery. TBH uses a variable air volume (VAV) HVAC system. Unlike

constant air volume (CAV) systems, which supply a constant airflow at a variable temperature,

VAV systems vary the airflow at a constant temperature. So what does that mean? In a CAV system

the air is sent to rooms at a temperature created when the air leaves the central mechanical sys-

tem. Depending on the distance the air has to travel the temperature can change dramatically

before it gets near the end of its run. The VAV system seeks to resolve this problem by sending air

heated to a specified temperature and then allowing the user to vary the amount of the treated air

brought into the space. The VAV unit (also known as a VAV box) has a fan that is controlled by a

207 | Part 4.2. Mechanical Systems and Codes: Demand
local thermostat. The VAV box operates this fan and a damper system that allows or prohibits
treated air into the space. In addition to providing a VAV box at the point of delivery, TBH has
an added amenity. The VAV boxes have a reheat unit that uses radiant hot water supplied by the
primary hot water line. This additional heating coil can reheat the air before it enters the space.
Together the primary blower motors and the VAV units move the air to the spaces and provide
end users with a greater amount of thermostatic control. Ducts not only supply air to the spaces
but also evacuate air from the spaces. Just as it is nearly impossible to blow air through a clogged
straw, it is necessary to provide an exit tube for air to return to the mechanical room. This return
air is then recycled back into the system to complete the loop.

  faculty offices in addition to the VAV boxes is a manually operated damper system.
  Leaving the North Mechanical Room one enters the Blicharski Atrium. Near the base of the stairs
  are two large tubes that carry air to and from the mechanical room (the larger of the two is the
  return and extends to the roofline). The ducts service the faculty offices with both supply and
  return air. Once the air is taken to the roofline it is sent down between the walls of the faculty
  offices. From there, smaller ducts connected with T joints service two offices per floor, per verti-
  cal run. One faculty office is charged with controlling the heating and cooling of both offices (see

                              3

  figure 4.2.4).

  Figure 4.2.4. West Elevation of Buell Hall. The large black lines indicate the supply ducts as they service the
  faculty offices.

  Near these tubes is the west-facing wall of the atrium. This floor-to-ceiling wall of glass is tem-
  pered by a line of radiators resting near the floor at the window wall. Each radiator appears to be
  a linear box with a pipe fitting into it at the base at each end. This folded metal box houses a fin
  tube. Appropriately named, a fin tube is a pipe that has a series of metal pieces, or fins, that are
  heated by the hot water supply coming from the mechanical room. The fins are spaced about ¼
  inch apart, which allows them to maximize the amount of air they come in contact with as an air
  current sweeps past them. This current of air--cool at the bottom before being heated--then rises
  along the inside face of the glass, effectively creating a thermal blanket for the building. In TBH
  every exterior window has a radiating fin tube mounted near its base. By coupling this technology

   the needs of each office properly. Thus, some offices were being oversupplied with cooling. The manual dampers now
   allow for some individual control in faculty offices. Thank you to Anthony Battaglia and Thomas Keller of Facilities and
   Services for this insight.

with the forced air provided through the VAV boxes, the mechanical system maximizes the effec-
tiveness of the steam provided by Abbott Power Plant (see figure 4.2.5).

       Figure 4.2.5. Radiant hot water/fin tube detail. Read long description of figure.

The mechanical systems chosen, in this case, also have aesthetic design considerations. When the
weather is benign it might be preferable to have a series of doors that could open to the court-
yard outside. Even the tiles of the atrium seem to sense this desire as the designers and installers
took effort to line the interior tile joints with exterior paving joints. Care was taken to match the
appearance of the interior vinyl tile with the exterior concrete pavers so that their sizes match
exactly. Here is the notion of a space that continues from inside to outside, just as the atrium
stairs (south side) line up with the cascading terraces outside. A conflict, however, arises when the
mechanical system of radiators does not allow the glass to be operable along the western face of

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 210
the atrium. The compromise struck is to have a visual connection but not a physical one. Instead a
small door is located around the corner for courtyard access.
Across the atrium is a long corridor that serves a computer lab and three seminar spaces. Unex-
pectedly, at the end of the corridor is an illuminated exit sign. Passing through a pair of doors
one encounters a short, wide landing before descending a full flight of stairs. This corridor exit is
the solution to a problem of fire safety egress. A corridor of greater than 20 feet that results in
a dead end is considered a fire hazard. Someone could get to the end of such a corridor and be
enveloped by smoke or fire (for example, smoke coming out of the computer lab). Finding the dead
end, they may not be able to escape the corridor before being overcome by smoke inhalation. In
this instance the solution was to descend to a level dedicated to the South Mechanical Room. The
exiting corridor then links to the south fire stairs, which ascend two stories before providing an
at-grade exit.
The South Mechanical Room is similar to the one on the north side but here is where the steam
from Abbott Power Plant enters TBH and is gradually turned into hot water. From both mechanical
rooms it is possible to enter their air intake spaces. These are the same spaces one passes when
entering the building through the south and west doors. The spaces are cubic caverns with cir-
cular oculi that frame the sky. On sunny days these oculi cast ovoid shadows across their spaces.
Constructed of cast concrete retaining walls and infill concrete block masonry units, the spaces
have a quiet, zen-like quality (see figure 4.2.6).

intake looking up. Right: The north intake looking out.

211 | Part 4.2. Mechanical Systems and Codes: Demand
On the sides of the south air intake is a wall with air filters lining the top edge. These filters feed
fresh air into the nearby fire stairs. On exiting the mechanical room and ascending the stairs, one
is in a space dedicated to vertical circulation and fire safety. These stairs have glass that looks out
onto the exterior, but whenever the stairs abut an interior space the material shifts to concrete.

Fire stairwells are required to be designed to withstand a specified period of time before fire or
smoke can adversely affect the space and persons inside. The TBH fire stairs are considered fire-
rated enclosures. That means the spaces are designed so that someone could take refuge in the
stairwells for a time determined by code. Special fire-rated doors and construction assemblies are
used to protect people. The fire rating depends on a building's use and size and whether it has fire
sprinklers.

TBH has a fire rating designation of B, for business: "Business Occupancies include office, pro-
fessional, and service activities, and storage of related records and accounts. Business Occupancy
also includes educational facilities past the 12th grade, but does not include retail or wholesale

                                                                                                           4

sales, which are classified as Group M Mercantile."

The Plym Auditorium has an occupancy designation of A-3, for Assembly: "This group includes
recreational, amusement, and religious worship uses not specifically covered by other Assembly
subgroups, including, for example, galleries, churches, community halls, courtrooms, dance halls,

                                                                                                 5

indoor sports facilities without fixed seating."

Typically, any space exceeding an occupancy of fifty people is required to have two or more sepa-
rated exit doors. Plym Auditorium seats more than 200 people so it is required to have a minimum
of two means of egress. The width of these doors corresponds to the human occupancy load. This
is important in case of fire, but it is also a practical solution for people using the space. Several
studios in TBH also fall into this category, as does the Blicharski Atrium.

Since TBH is a four-story building it was required to have two-hour fire-rated stairway enclosures
when it was built. Typically, these spaces must have self-closing, fire-resistant doors to prevent
smoke infiltration and burn through. The code makes allowances to lower fire ratings if the build-
ings have sprinkler systems with the idea that the sprinklers will lessen the life-safety hazards and
therefore the duration one would need to inhabit the fire-rated enclosures would decrease. The
time designation is useful to consider in case of emergency. For example, a two-hour-rated enclo-
sure can be used to help determine the time one could expect for life-safety personnel, such as
firefighters, to have to save those awaiting rescue inside. This is particularly important for those
unable to ascend or descend stairs. In case of emergency, elevators are only to be used by fire-

fighters, who have special key access. All fire stairs are required to have positive air pressure with
their adjacent surroundings. This feature allows someone to open the door to the fire stairs with-
out allowing smoke to enter the space. The filters observed at the south mechanical air intake
serve to filter smoke before air is fed into the space with the fire stairs. Codes now require that fire
stairs have an area outside the zone of circulation for those unable to use the stairs as they await
assistance. This is referred to as the area of rescue and it must meet minimum space requirements
and allow others fleeing the building an unobstructed path to safety. The south fire stairs have a
heavy metal gate that opens from the basement in the direction one fleeing a fire would take to
exit the building. In the United States all emergency exits should open in the direction of travel
to flee the hazard. The gate at the ground floor of the south stairwell is there to protect someone
from an upper floor who might mistakenly attempt to descend beyond the fire exit door. In the
event of a fire this feature might save a disoriented person's life.

Leaving the south fire stairwell, one enters a vestibule between the inside and outside of the build-
ing. This space is also required to be fire rated, though it is not an area of rescue. The goal is to take
people from the fire stairs through a space that is not smoke filled. The door from a fire stairwell

coming from upstairs and downstairs.
This walk now moves to the exterior of the building and the west parking lot. From this vantage
point one can see the glass curtain wall that encloses TBH's west side. Above the third floor one
can see a steel tube feeding the office spaces below. The roof pitches slightly from north to south
as the duct gets smaller and smaller. Since the duct is feeding fewer and fewer offices as it runs
south, its size is diminished. This can be seen in figure 4.2.4. The architect chose to call attention
to this by having the corresponding roof above slope to follow the diminishing duct and expose
the ductwork to view from the outside. The glass allows the observant visitor to understand how
the mechanical systems are playing a role in the visual and aesthetic aspects of the building.

HVAC systems are a large portion of a building's initial budget. When one considers the money
spent on controlling the heating and cooling of a structure, the costs increase dramatically over
the life cycle cost of the building. In the mid-1970s the Centre Pompidou in Paris was designed by
the architecture team of Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano (see figure 4.2.7).
The structure, dedicated in 1977, houses the largest collection of modern art in Europe. Built as a
commentary on the Louvre in Paris, the building expresses its circulation, structure, and especially
its multicolored mechanical system's ducts and vents to become a statement about the movement
of people, forces, and air. TBH's expression of these building elements echo the Centre Pompidou
in a less flamboyant manner.

     About the Walk

     All buildings need to maintain a "resolution of forces" to stand. Architects and structural engineers
     are concerned with creating stability in structures. Typically, this is done with four basic structural
     types. Edifices must resist stress and strain. Forces can be simplified into two basic categories: gen-
     eral and lateral. General forces typically deal with resisting gravity while lateral forces act sideways
     on buildings. Lateral forces are typically due to wind and earth (quake) movement. The four most
     prevalent issues structural members need to be designed for are bending, shear, torsion, and buck-
     ling.
     This walk begins at Huff Hall located at 1206 South Fourth Street in Champaign. The walk also visits
     the Armory at 505 East Armory Avenue, the Irwin Indoor Football Facility at 301 East Peabody Drive,
     and the State Farm Center at 1800 South First Street in Champaign.

Before 1850, most structures were masonry bearing wall buildings, which means the walls, made
of brick and stone, held up the building. With advances in cast iron, reinforced concrete, and steel,
the vast majority of structures built since the Industrial Revolution have been frame buildings. In a
frame structure usually a grid of columns and beams hold up the building. The walls, including the
exterior enclosing walls, do not bear the weight of the structure. There are four basic structural
types: post and beam, arched, tensile, and a combination (see figure 4.3.1).

A post-and-lintel construction is also called a trabeated systems building. The ancient Greeks
employed this technique in the Parthenon's exterior colonnades. An arched structure, typically a
bearing wall building, relies on the arch to distribute the weight of the building to the ground.
Examples of this structure date as far back as the ancient Roman Coliseum and Pantheon. Tensile
structures rely on cables or skins to transfer weight, such as a tensile rope bridge across a chasm.
More often, tensile members are used in composite structures such as the Brooklyn Bridge or a
tent structure. The bridge structure relies on cables in tension stretching to large vertical towers

                                                                                                                                                              Kevin J. Hinders | 218
that act as compression members delivering load to the ground, while the tent structure relies on
cables and a taut skin over a set of posts that are in compression (see figure 4.3.2).

                             Part 4.3. Orientation Map.

The many kinds of forces applied to buildings are usually thought of in two categories: gravity
loads and lateral loads (including wind loads and potential earthquakes).
Buildings withstand many types of forces, including shear, bending, and buckling. It is easy to
imagine these forces at work on a pencil. Shear occurs when two forces are applied adjacent to

219 | Part 4.3. Structures: Huff Hall, the Armory, the Irwin Indoor Football Facility, and the State Farm Center
one another but do not align. Children often play with pencils, hanging a pencil over the edge of a
table and then giving a swift karate chop to the pencil near where it hangs. The pencil breaks in a
clean shear. For this reason, a pair of scissors, which applies forces adjacent to one another, is also
called a shear. Bending occurs over the length of a member as force is applied either continuously
or in specific locations along the member's length. Using a new pencil, one may apply opposite
forces in the middle: the pencil bends, and if enough force is applied it will break. These two forces
are most commonly applied to beams--horizontal members that hold up floors and roofs. Buckling
occurs when an axial force is applied at either end of a member. If one takes a pencil and presses
in on either end it will begin to deflect--to buckle. Buckling is typically a concern for columns--the
vertical members that carry load downward to the ground (see figure 4.3.3).

To understand bending one may apply forces to a wooden ruler. First, try bending the ruler from
the bottom of its narrow side. It is flexible and bends as force is applied to the flat side. An attempt
to bend the ruler along its longer side--by holding it vertically and pressing on it--however is far
more difficult. Though the ruler has the same amount of material, its form is able to resist the load
applied because of its orientation to the load. When force is applied to the ruler, the top half of

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 220
the ruler goes into compression (it wants to squeeze), while the bottom half of the ruler goes into
tension (it wants to stretch). The ruler resists the force based on the distance the material is from
its middle, or centroid (see figure 4.3.4).

             Figure 4.3.2. Examples of four basic structural types. A. Parthenon. B. Colosseum. C. Rope
             bridge. D. Brooklyn Bridge. The Parthenon is a trabeated system. The Colosseum uses a
             system of arches. The rope bridge is a tension system. The Brooklyn Bridge is a composite
             system using tensile cables and compression towers. Read long description of figure.

Thus a steel beam is designed to place a substantial amount of material at a distance from its cen-
ter (centroid) to strategically use the most economical amount of material to resist the greatest
load. In a wide flange beam, the outer material, the flanges, best resist bending, while the connect-
ing member, the web, resists shearing (see figure 4.3.5).

            Figure 4.3.3. Forces acting on a member and its deformation. Read long description of figure.

When spanning a significant distance, it is often desirable to use a member lighter and usually less
expensive than a single solid material. This member is called a truss. Trusses use the same prin-
ciples to resist bending as a wide flange beam: placing material as economically as possible in the
position to do the most work. A truss may vary in form dramatically, but its essential parts are con-
sistent: a top chord, a bottom chord, and a web that connects these two chords. Typically, the top
chord is designed to experience compressive forces and the bottom chord is designed to resist
tensile forces. Depending on the circumstances, materials, and function, a wide variety of trusses
are used (see figure 4.3.6).

            Figure 4.3.4. Diagram of compression and tension in a bending member.

Placing material at a distance from the centroid where the stresses are greatest allows the least
amount of material to do the greatest amount of work. Since a material such as steel is paid for by

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 222
weight, it makes sense that using a truss renders an economic advantage that exceeds the addi-
tional cost of fabrication.

       Figure 4.3.5. Cross section of a wide flange steel beam. Read long description of figure.

In most long-span structures, the center of the span is where the stress is the greatest. That is
why most trusses attempt to have the greatest distance between the top chord and the bottom
chord in the middle of the truss. Some trusses take on their form for additional reasons, such as
ease of construction or to create a form that sheds water efficiently, but the primary reason to use
a truss is to lighten the amount of material needed to span a distance efficiently. It is important to
note that trusses, however, do not address shear so designers are careful not to introduce shear
forces when using trusses.
Finally, different building materials have different properties. For example, steel is good in both
tension and compression. Therefore steel is often used in trusses. Some truss configurations are
more effective when made of wood than other materials. Stone and concrete are both very good in
compression but not in tension, thus, concrete and stone are often used when compressive forces
are the greatest concern. Concrete today is often reinforced with steel to specifically allow the
steel embedded within the concrete to resist the tensile forces of the structure while the concrete
resists compression.
In general, structure is charged with holding up an enclosure: the roof and walls. The best way
to understand a building's structure is to think of the building as having a system that allows the
sum of all forces to equal zero (when forces do not equal zero, movement occurs and movement
of buildings is rarely a good thing). This walk shall visit four long-span structures. For this walk we

223 | Part 4.3. Structures: Huff Hall, the Armory, the Irwin Indoor Football Facility, and the State Farm Center
will be considering gravity loads and the manner in which structures are designed to economically
span long distances for human use.

                              Figure 4.3.6. Examples of some types of trusses.

The primary role of a long-span structure is to enclose a large area for an intended use. Such
spaces often need to be rather high such as to allow for athletic play. For example, volleyball needs
a high space so it can be played with little or no interference. Some spaces must also provide seat-
ing for crowds to watch. Tall spaces also assist in ventilation when large crowds are present.
The structures to be visited are Huff Hall, the Armory, the Irwin Indoor Football Facility, and the
State Farm Center. In each one large interior spaces are created to allow unencumbered move-
ment, practice, and often spectators to view events.
The first building on this walk is Huff Hall at 1206 South Fourth Street near the intersection of
Gregory Street in Champaign. Designed by James White and Charles Platt, Huff Gymnasium, as
it was originally named, was built in 1925 to allow a large number of spectators to watch athletic
contests and to house classrooms and offices. Like all of Platt's structures on campus, the building
has a neo-Georgian exterior since the architect attempted to unify the campus design through
both style and material. Until 2002, Huff Hall's north side was left unfinished. At that time the Khan

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 224

             Figure 4.3.7. Huff Hall truss diagram. The top chord of the truss accepts the roof load. The top
             and bottom chords along with the diagonal bracing and vertical members of the truss carry the
             load through the truss to the columns. Read long description of figure.

  Huff Hall's main space holds 4050 seats. The long-span structure must transfer the weight of the
  roof down to the ground through a series of columns. To accomplish this, the roof is composed of
  a thin metal sheet over wood sheathing that rests on a series of small members that transfer their
  load to the long-span trusses (see figures 4.3.7-4.3.9).
  These trusses deliver the load directly to columns or indirectly through girders that connect to the
  columns. The entire system is in equilibrium. The main space uses a system of long-span trusses,
  girders, and columns to create an internal court space with decent sight lines for all but those
  people unfortunate to be seated behind columns. Huff Hall has four freestanding columns on each
  side and nine trusses spanning east-west. The north and south walls also carry load. Every other
  truss rests on a column, while in-between trusses rest on a girder that transfers its weight to the
  column and/or outer walls.

  Facility.

           Figure 4.3.8. Huff Hall structural members. Trusses either distribute their load directly to the
           columns or to a girder that carries the load over to an adjacent column. Using the girder
           alleviates the need for some columns, which improves the sight lines for spectators. Read long
           description of figure.

The best way to understand the entire system is to realize that the sum of all forces needs to equal
zero. To accomplish this, the roof is composed of a metal sheet over a wood sheet that rests on
a series of small members called purlins that transfer their load to the long-span trusses. These
trusses deliver the load directly to columns or indirectly through the girders that run perpendic-
ular to the trusses and connect to the columns. After the load has reached the column it is trans-
ferred down to the ground, which pushes back with an equal and opposite force. The manner in
which weight is distributed to the ground is called the load path. The equilibrium of the forces
creates a static building (see figure 4.3.10).
Just to the north of Huff Hall lies the Armory at 505 East Armory Avenue, built over a decade before
Huff Hall. When completed in 1914, the Armory was the largest structure in the world without a

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 226

  center support. Designed by Illinois state architect William C. Zimmerman, it was updated in 1927
  when Platt and White added side masses wrapped in a neo-Georgian facade.

           Figure 4.3.9. Huff Hall load path diagram. A load is carried from the purlin to the beam to a truss
           and onto a girder. Half this truss load transfers to the column to the north and the other half goes to
           the south. Read long description of figure.

  At its peak the Armory is 98 feet high and encloses an area of 80,000 square feet. It uses a system
  of three hinged arches to span almost 200 feet (see figure 4.3.11).
  As shown in figure 4.3.11, the structure is hinged at the top and sides where the arches touch the
  ground. By using pins as the means to connect the arch, the structure is thinnest at the top where
  the trusses touch. This pin is highlighted by a long, thin skylight at the apex of the structure (see
  figures 4.3.12-4.3.14).
  The 1927 addition, which was part of the original design, then hangs from the trusses on each side.
  This suspending of the second-story space above the floor allows for a larger, uninterrupted space
  free of columns (see figures 4.3.15 and 4.3.16).

The Irwin Indoor Football Facility at 301 East Peabody Drive is to the south of Huff Hall and the
Armory at the southwest corner of Peabody Drive and Fourth Street. Designed by Ratio Architects,
this structure was completed in 2000. The facility is used by a variety of Division of Intercolle-
giate Athletics teams. The design is meant to harmonize with the surrounding area. As a result the

perimeter walls are kept at a lower than typical height for this type of structure to better match
with adjacent buildings. It also has a brick veneer.

Because the perimeter walls were lowered to scale with adjacent buildings, the roof of the struc-
ture became a significant issue. To facilitate throwing and kicking balls inside, the center of the
building has a long box truss that runs north-south and rises above the practice field significantly
(see figures 4.3.17-4.3.19).
A pair of large concrete pylons carry the weight of the roof and mega truss while the outer walls of
the building bear the other half of the weight of the roof. The mega truss uses pinned connections
to ease the method of construction (see figure 4.3.20).
The east and west walls have embedded columns. Like in Huff Hall, every other truss bears directly
on a column while intermediate columns bear on a girder that carries the load horizontally to adja-
cent columns (see figure 4.3.21).

                              70 yards plus two 10-yard end zones). To keep the building's profile
                              relatively low, a large box truss supports secondary trusses that
                              span east-west. The mega truss curves from one end zone area to
                              the other.

  Moving south along Fourth Street, past the outdoor practice facilities adjacent to Memorial Sta-
  dium, is the State Farm Center. Located along Florida Avenue between First and Fourth Streets,
  the State Farm Center, formerly Assembly Hall, was completed in 1963 and until the opening of the
  Astrodome in 1965 was the largest domed structure in North America. Designed by Harrison and

                             3

  Abramovitz, Assembly Hall was a structural engineering first.

   ter for the Performing Arts (see part 5.2).

Thus far, the long-span structures examined on this walk have relied on trusses to span the inte-
rior spaces needing enclosure. The State Farm Center uses a different approach in which a thin
shell of concrete is folded to provide a rigid, low-profile dome. The forces of the dome are inclined
to spread, that is, to push outward toward the perimeter. To resist these spreading forces a cable
was strung at the bottom of the dome. The cable was wound around the perimeter in a taught ring
that was then encased in concrete. This innovative approach put a modern twist on how the ten-
sile forces of a dome, wanting to push outward, could be controlled (see figure 4.3.22). Similarly,
in the Renaissance, Michelangelo and Domenico Fontana employed a chain to resist the spread of
the dome of St. Peter's Basilica.

To understand why a folded plate was used for this building one may use a piece of paper sup-
ported only at one end. If one tries holding the paper out flat, it sags. Cupping the paper somewhat
gives it some resistance to gravity and its own weight, but if one folds the paper into an accordion
shape the paper is made sufficiently rigid to withstand deflection (see figure 4.3.23).

Figure 4.3.22. Schematic section diagram of the State Farm Center. The roof appears to thicken because of the
section cut and the curvature of the roof and its folds. The tension ring sits on the supporting pylons. The top of
the roof is 128 feet above the floor. The floor is recessed 24 feet below grade. The dome is over 400 feet wide.

This fan shape demonstrates the principle of the rigidity of a folded plate. The next manipulation
is to hold one end tight and spread the fan folds 360 degrees to form a complete ring. The final
step is to bend the fan-like structure into a shallow dome. The dome further resists any downward
force applied to the top. Fortunately, concrete is an ideal material for this manipulation because
it is relatively malleable while under construction and follows the shape of a formwork. Repeat-
ing this formwork creates a completed dome. The forces of the shallow dome are held in check
by a wound suspended cable at the building's perimeter. This cable is embedded in concrete and
forms a tension ring that keeps the dome from spreading outward. A series of equidistantly placed
pylons are used to hold up the tension ring. These pylons are shaped to suggest that they pull the
perimeter of the dome back to the center of the structure to resist the dome's tendency to spread.

  These large concrete pylons slope from the roof inward toward the center of the building. This
  visually counters the tremendous thrust of the dome and gives the State Farm Center the flying
  saucer profile so beloved by Illini fans. The folded roof seen from the exterior is echoed inside (see
  figures 4.24 and 4.3.25).
  These are only some of the many long-span structures on campus. There are numerous ingenious
  structural responses to unique circumstances. Often these creative solutions are not exposed to

   part 5.5) have trusses that are absorbed into the ceiling and are not exposed. In both cases this is for aesthetic distribu­
   tion of the mechanical systems and better acoustics.

PART 5. INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS AND
THEIR DESIGN

       Overview

       This part will explore structures on the Urbana-Champaign campus as they reflect specific
       approaches to design. To understand these approaches, a brief outline of the historical context that
       has led to today's designs is provided. Here shaping generalizations are used to assist in providing
       the context for the education of an architect and the changes in designers' approaches over time.

  Design has many influences. Historians point to each epoch and attempt to tie together the most
  influential aspects to explain what, why, and how things occurred. To gain a better understanding
  of our current built environment it is useful to clarify how past events and trends influenced the
  design of their time. For example, spatial preferences have changed as humans' understanding of
  the universe has changed (see part 3.5 for one example). Before looking at individual structures on
  the Urbana-Champaign campus, several shaping generalizations regarding patronage and educa-
  tion are necessary to understand.

  A first generalization is about the changes in patronage. The patron is the person or persons sup-
  plying the economic resources for the construction of the edifice. For several millennia the major
  patrons of architecture and urban planning were the nobility and the religious. Think of the pyra-
  mids of Egypt or the medieval cathedrals of Europe to understand the importance of sponsor-
  ship. The pharaohs' absolute control reverberates through time while the religious desires of those
  aspiring to build heavenly mansions for religious devotion can be seen across Europe. As our soci-
  ety has changed, so has our patronage. For example, In The Architecture of the Eighteenth Century,
  John Summerson writes: "The characteristic building types of the first half of the century were

                                                                                                                                                                                                         1

  churches and palaces, while those of the second half were public and institutional buildings." This
  statement underscores a shift that reflects the great changes brought by the Enlightenment and
  subsequently the Industrial Revolution. Summerson continues:

         The creation of types is a social matter. It is also a matter of cultural climate. The 18th Cen-

          tury was the century of the "Enlightenment", a familiar expression which is by no means
          self-explanatory and which, if we attempt to analyse it, becomes infinitely complicated.
          We may take refuge in the great names--Newton and Locke, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Hume,
          Rousseau, Diderot--but if we are considering architecture we shall find no obvious way of
          connecting their thought with what was going on in the building world. "Enlightenment"
          was not an all-pervading flood-light. It was a question of the formation of new attitudes by
          the acceptance of ideas filtering down from the philosophers to levels where they engaged
          with the practical business of living. . . . In other words, society could be visualized in an
          enlightened perspective in which technology, the arts, the law and its penalties, and the

                                                                                                                                                                                    2

          arts of administration began to be freshly seen, with a new humanitarianism.

  Summerson goes on to discuss new building types of the eighteenth century: theaters, libraries,
  museums, hospitals, prisons, and commercial buildings.

  Design changed as new societal structures were created to replace absolutism and feudal-
  ism--such as capitalism, socialism, fascism, and communism and governments that support them.
  New patrons required new building types. For example, the Industrial Revolution required never-
  before-imagined structures like railway stations and factories. Meanwhile new materials such as
  plate glass and carbon steel transformed the built environment by allowing longer spans, taller
  buildings, and different construction methods. Concurrently, rising populations led to new hous-
  ing needs filled by both private and governmental patrons.

  At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign one sees a different type of patronage. This land-
  grant institution, charged with education in agriculture and the mechanic arts and especially in
  the practical application of this knowledge, has changed since the university's inception. The mis-
  sion statement (approved by the Board of Trustees on January 31, 2019) reads: "The University of
  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is charged by our state to enhance the lives of citizens in Illinois,
  across the nation and around the world through our leadership in learning, discovery, engage-

                                                                               3

  ment and economic development." Patronage of the university's build environment is left to the
  Board of Trustees, which is charged with, among other responsibilities, providing the structures

                                                     4

  needed for instruction. The university is fortunate to have both governmental partners and pri-
  vate partners. Governmental partners include granting agencies such as the National Endowment

4. "The trustees shall have power to provide for the requisite buildings, apparatus, and conveniences; to fix the rates

   for tuition; to appoint such professors and instructors, and to establish and provide for the management of such
   model farms, model art, and other departments and professorships, as may be required to teach, in the most thorough
   manner, such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, and military tactics, without
   excluding other scientific and classical studies" (University of Illinois Act, 110 ILCS 305/7, chap. 144, par. 28, sec. 7,
   https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/ILCS/Articles?ActID=1086&ChapterID=18).

  for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation. Private partners--individuals and foun-
  dations--share their funds for the advancement of the university's goals. These partners may pro-
  vide resources to create or renovate structures for the good of the university. As a result, they
  support the Board of Trustees and indirectly become a part of the patronage to support the users
  of the university's facilities, students, faculty, and visitors.

  Parallel to this shift in political and economic power one can trace the changes in the manner
  in which the architect/designer was trained. The first master builders, such as those from the
  medieval period, trained first as apprentices. These individuals may have worked their entire lives
  on a single cathedral or may have, after a lengthy period of apprenticing, had an opportunity to
  inherit an existing project or become the master on a project in another location. These masters
  were commissioned by the nobility and religious to create their great works. During the Renais-
  sance patrons sought out artisans with the intention of creating art that would memorialize
  them. Thus, Pope Julius II commissioned the painting of the Sistine Chapel from Michelangelo
  and employed him throughout his papacy. Similarly, Pope Urban VIII financially supported Gian
  Lorenzo Bernini throughout his papacy. Michelangelo and Bernini, like their medieval predeces-
  sors, employed many apprentices and workers.

  With a shift in economic power, a change in worldview, and an expanding population brought on
  by the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution came a new means of educating architects
  and designers. Two schools dominated: the Beaux-Arts (originally the Académie des Beaux-Arts,
  founded in 1648, and changed in 1863 to L'École des Beaux-Arts) and the Polytechnique (École

                                     5

  Polytechnique). The former emphasized the arts while the latter emphasized engineering. These
  schools, based on meritocracy, educated students with faculty who each taught a different subject.
  Once a student demonstrated mastery of the material to the satisfaction of the faculty they were
  permitted to practice.

                                                                                                                                                                                                         6

  After World War I, the Bauhaus (1919-33) was formed as an avant-garde school in Germany. This
  school was a product of and a producer of modernism. Dissatisfied with looking to the past, its
  founder Walter Gropius sought to create a school for the arts based on design principles of com-
  position, materiality, color, and mass production. After an initial core course, masters of craft
  (blacksmiths, bricklayers, carpenters, etc.) and masters of form (renowned artists from many dis-
  ciplines) were brought in to teach studio courses. By the time the Bauhaus closed in 1933 because
  of political pressure from the Nazi Party, numerous instructors had relocated to the United States

                                                                                                                                7

  and brought aspects of the Bauhaus education with them.

   241 | Part 5. Individual Buildings and Their Design
In many universities in the United States, Beaux-Arts and Bauhaus courses were adapted to fit a
system in which architecture faculty from a department, school, or college determine a standard
set of courses required to prepare students for the profession. After passing this prescribed set of
required and elective courses a student would receive a professional degree--now a requirement
to practice architecture in the United States. Typically, the student must then serve an intern-
ship period under a licensed professional and pass a licensure exam before becoming a registered

                    8

architect.

Thus, what began as a time-consuming system of a single master with many apprentices (only one

or two of which would themselves become a master) has become one that produces numerous

architects in a relatively short period of time. As population growth and building complexity has

increased, teaching methods have changed and the number of architects has risen to keep pace

There is no singular path or approach to design. Today, some designers are associated with spe-
cific styles while many eschew such categorizations. Some designers choose to push the envelope
with new methods of construction, forms, etc. while others prefer to explore traditional forms and
their construction.

This part began with John Summerson, who went on to say: "Style is what immediately takes the

eye, excites curiosity and creates a receptive mood." Styles reflect thoughts about aesthetics and
construction. The values that patrons and designers bring to their projects dramatically affect the
resultant designs.

The next series of walks will address different approaches to design and will attempt to illustrate
principles that influence how individual buildings respond to their context differently. As has been
discussed previously, some buildings become figural and stand out from their surroundings while
others form the backdrop for spaces. This set of walks attempts to focus on specific aspects that
influence the form and design of the built environment. The campus structures selected to tour
provide examples of traditional building components (the orders), functional expression (Krannert
Center for the Performing Arts), meaning and metaphor (Smith Memorial Hall, the Literatures,
Cultures, and Linguistics Building, and the Carle R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology), synthe-
sis of ideas (the Education Building), and sustainability (the Business Instructional Facility).

Part 5.1. The Orders

       About the Walk

       The University of Illinois, by virtue of when it was constructed and its continuous planning, has its
       feet firmly planted in the past with its eyes on the future. As a result its built environment has many
       different stylistic aspects. One of the strongest influences on traditional architecture is the inclusion
       of the orders. The orders have been used by architects beginning with the ancient Greeks and
       Romans to create structural and aesthetic harmony. The five classical orders are the Doric, Ionic,
       Corinthian, Tuscan, and Composite. These orders and many derivatives can be found all over cam-
       pus and its surroundings.
       There is no formal walk for this part. Rather it explains the role of the orders in the creation of clas-
       sical architecture. The reader is instead asked to go on an architectural treasure hunt to find exam-
       ples of each order. Photographic examples are provided to assist in identification.

  Five orders are used in classical architecture. Tradition recognizes three as Greek: the Doric, the
  Ionic, and the Corinthian. The Romans adopted these three and created two others: the Tuscan
  and the Composite. There are two principle parts of an order: the column, which is the vertical
  supporting member, and the entablature, which is the horizontal spanning member. The column
  has three parts: the base, the shaft, and the capital. The entablature also has three parts: the archi-
  trave, the frieze, and the cornice (see figure 5.1.1).
  The classically established architectural column and entablature have long formed an important
  building component that sets the nature of the design. The orders help establish proportion sys-
  tems used by the designer.

         ORDER, in architecture, is a system of the several members, ornaments, and proportions
         of columns and pilasters; or a regular arrangement of the projecting parts of a building,

                                                                                                                                        1

         especially the column, so as to form one beautiful whole.
  The orders are described by Vitruvius in De Architectura, and Renaissance architects such as

1. Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1771, 442.
  245 | Part 5.1. The Orders
Sebastiano Serlio, Andrea Palladio, and Giacomo da Vignola all published their versions of the
orders. In fact, architects--ever interested in invention--have been tweaking the orders for cen-
turies. The proportions of the orders vary from structure to structure and age to age. A Greek
temple using the Doric order is easily distinguished from an Ionic temple, however, there is a great
variety among each type of temple. Over time the proportions of the orders and the manner in
which they are deployed have changed. For example, most Greek Doric columns such as those
used in the Parthenon in Athens did not have bases. The columns rested, rather, on a step (called
the stylobate) that unified the columns at the bottom. The Romans, however, translated the Doric
order and added a base as seen in the first floor of the Colosseum in Rome (see figure 5.1.2).

During the Renaissance architects often set the column on a pedestal. Again, one might look at
figure 5.1.2, which has a Doric order at the base, surmounted by an Ionic order at the second floor
and a Corinthian order at the third level. The second- and third-floor columns have pedestals,
while the first-floor Doric columns have bases but no pedestals. This use of the Doric order at
the base with more slender columns above has been used since antiquity. It reflects the structural
notion of a strong base becoming lighter as the wall ascends.

Given the fluctuation from age to age, it is surprising that a general consensus on the orders exists
at all. In the mid-sixteenth century the architect Vignola published a version that has been relied
on by many architects, especially American architects practicing in the early twentieth century
(see figure 5.1.3).

Figure 5.1.3 shows the proportions of the five orders according to Vignola. In this drawing the rela-
tionship between the height of the column and its entablature is four to one. Similarly, the rela-
tionship between the column's pedestal and the column (when a pedestal is used) is one to three.
The Tuscan and Doric orders, typically associated with the proportions of males, is one column
diameter to seven high in the Tuscan order and one column diameter to eight high in the Doric
order. The Ionic order, associated with female proportions, is one column diameter to nine high.
The Corinthian and Composite orders are all shown with a one to ten ratio.

The Tuscan order is similar to the Greek's Doric order and is the simplest and plainest order. Dat-
ing to pre-Roman times, it was standardized during the Renaissance and was included in pub-
lications by Renaissance architects such as Serlio and Palladio. The Doric order is often fluted,
meaning the column has concave undulations on its shaft, while the Tuscan order is not fluted. In
figure 5.1.3 all the columns are shown fluted except the Tuscan.

Each order has distinct characteristics. Observing the column capital is the easiest way to distin-
guish the order.

The Doric order depicts a wood construction technology translated into stone. A famous example
of a Doric temple is the Parthenon in Athens, Greece (see figures 5.15-5.18). (Note: the frieze in the
Doric order is more decorative than in the Tuscan order.)

The Tuscan Order

The Tuscan order features a simple capital and entablature (see figures 5.1.10-5.1.12).

( formerly the Women's Building) and Lincoln Hall. The
original Women's Building was designed by the New
York architects McKim, Meade, and White. The building
was added onto in 1913 with a colonnade facing the
Main Quad.

The Ionic Order

The Ionic order has scroll-like volutes (see figure 5.1.13). These volutes resemble a nautilus shell
spiraling out from the center. Many buildings on campus such as Foellinger Auditorium and Smith
Memorial Hall have Ionic columns (see figures 5.1.14-5.1.19).

the styles of the past and transform them.

The Corinthian Order

The Corinthian column has leaves carved (or cast) to resemble those of the acanthus plant (see
figure 5.1.20). This order was sometimes transformed and stylized to reflect plants of a particular
region such as corn or tobacco (Benjamin Latrobe designed a tobacco capital for Thomas Jeffer-
son's Monticello).

The Alpha Tau Omega and Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity houses at the university have stylized ver-
sions of the Corinthian capital with palm leaves springing from the traditional acanthus leaves
that date back to an early Greek Corinthian capital called the Tower of Winds Capital (see figures
5.1.21-5.1.25).

The Composite Order

The Composite order combines the Ionic and the Corinthian. This order has both Ionic volutes and
the Corinthian acanthus leaves (see figures 5.1.26-5.1.29). This order is rare in central Illinois. The
Architecture Building at 608 East Lorado Taft Drive has a stylized version of the Composite order.

It is from these basic building blocks that classical architecture is derived. The orders often help
establish a larger set of proportional systems. The orders are associated with many styles includ-
ing Greek, Roman, Renaissance, Baroque, neoclassical, and subsequent revivals. Many traditional
buildings on campus, including the Georgian buildings by Platt, use the typical orders or have styl-
ized variations. The examples provided are only a fraction of the buildings that feature the orders
and yet the variety of architecture they help create is quite extensive.

        About the Walk

        To illustrate the principle that the form of an object can be related to its function, a tour of both the
        public and production sections of Krannert Center for the Performing Arts is taken. The four pri-
        mary interior theaters and one exterior theater are visited to understand the manner in which a
        performance both comes about and is viewed. Backstage sites include the scene shop, the costume
        shop, and practice rooms and how all these relate to each theater. Theater visits include discussion
        of sight lines, acoustics, and crowd control.
        This walk begins in the lobby of Krannert Center for the Performing Arts located at 500 South
        Goodwin Avenue in Urbana.

          Form ever follows function.

          --Louis Sullivan
  Historically, two primary forms of music halls have been built in the last several centuries. One,
  like Carnegie Hall in New York, absorbs the stage and audience space into a larger mass. A grand
  entrance facade introduces the audience to a lobby. From the lobby one takes a procession to a
  seat. The Palais Garnier (Opera National de Paris) is a model for this type of performance hall. The
  second, like Finlandia Hall in Helsinki, expresses a performance hall as a distinct mass. Typically,
  the lobby and support spaces are kept low and horizontal in contrast to the sculptural perfor-
  mance spaces and audience seating. Perhaps the most famous of the second form were designed
  by the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. Krannert Center for the Performing Arts (KCPA) is often com-
  pared with Aalto's work. When Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa was the Plym Visiting Professor

                                                                                                                                                                                           2

KCPA is a world-class venue for the performing arts. Foellinger Great Hall has long been recog-
nized for its superb acoustical properties and many recordings have been made in it because of
its well-designed space. There are five public stages in the venue: Foellinger Great Hall, the Tryon
Festival Theatre, the Colwell Playhouse, the Studio Theatre, and Stage 5 (Stage 5 is located in the
lobby and has no designated boundary aside from a raised platform). There is also the outdoor
Amphitheatre (see figure 5.2.1).

Figure 5.2.2. Foellinger Great Hall foyer.

A large lobby connects and services all the interior audience spaces. This lobby allows people going
to different performances to mingle. The lobby has a parquet teak floor throughout and a cor-
rugated metal ceiling that houses lighting and mechanical diffusers. Guests may also visit Inter-
mezzo café. A large counter that functions as the main ticket office is located in the lobby on an
axis with Foellinger Great Hall. Each of the three larger performance spaces--Foellinger Great Hall,

265 | Part 5.2. Function and Design: Krannert Center for the Performing Arts
the Tryon Festival Theatre, and the Colwell Playhouse--has its own secondary lobby located one
floor below the main lobby. These lobbies serve to enhance the atmosphere while distributing the
audience to the seats. Visitors enjoy a well-choreographed experience once they arrive in the main
lobby.

Figure 5.2.3. Foellinger Great Hall foyer.

Inside KCPA is a parallel to the concept of figure-ground that shall be called server-served. Just
like a theater has performers and audience, the architecture here is divided into public or front-
of-house spaces where visitors mingle and watch the performances--these are the served areas.
The production or back-of-house spaces serve the performance and the performers--these are
the server areas. While one is in the lobby the theaters are a kind of poché, as they give form to
the lobby. Meanwhile their figural quality--size, shape, and color--enhance the audience's expec-
tation for what they shall experience inside. The enclosing walls of the theaters act almost like a
first curtain before the commencement of the performance (see figure 5.2.1).
The architecture is used to heighten expectations and deepen the experiences of those attending
events even before the performances have begun. The secondary foyers for Foellinger Great Hall,

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 266
  the Tryon Festival Theatre, and the Colwell Playhouse further control entrance to the performance
  halls (see figures 5.2.2-5.2.5).

  Figure 5.2.4. Tryon Festival Theatre foyer.

  Once the audience has entered a theater, the figure-ground flips. The audience has left the rest of
  the world behind to be transported by both space and spectacle (see figure 5.2.6).

                                                                                                                                                                                                              7

  Theatrical architect S. Charles Lee's unofficial motto was "The Show Starts on the Sidewalk." At
  KCPA it often begins in the parking garage. Though there are two primary pedestrian entrances
  off Goodwin Avenue and a number of secondary means to enter the building, a great many visitors
  arrive by automobile. KCPA has two levels of parking to the northeast and southeast of the the-

to the Studio Theatre. This smallest of the venues is called a black box theater because it is
unadorned, painted dark, and designed for experimental works. It has 200 seats that can be
arranged in a variety of configurations such as a theater in the round (when the audience encircles
the stage) or as a thrust stage (when the stage juts out into the audience on three sides). It has
audio and lighting capabilities similar to those in the larger venues, but the small seating capacity
and experimental quality for students and performers is designed to be less intimidating (see fig-
ures 5.2.7 and 5.2.8).

Figure 5.2.5. Colwell Playhouse foyer.

Returning to the lobby, the next space to visit is the Colwell Playhouse, which was designed for
theater and dance events. Seating 674, it was created to specifically support works with speech:
the walls are shaped to reflect voices from the stage to the audience, but the back walls are echo
proof. This theater uses continental seating, which has aisles only at the perimeter. In typical con-
tinental seating the rows are spaced wider to facilitate people moving to their seats from the sides.
Because of the level changes in the main space, two balconies are provided for wheelchair seating.

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 268

                                                                                                                                                                                                       9

                  theaters become figural interiors that remove the surrounding context and create an
                  exclusive environment for audiences to appreciate the performances. In the front of house,
                  one experiences the spaces set aside for different types of performance. When visiting the
                  back of house, one discovers how the spaces for performers, set designs, costumes, and
                  rehearsal are arranged to facilitate performance. This walk will weave between
                  back-of-house and front-of-house experiences. The main spaces will be explained, and
                  how they are served--something not experienced by the audience--will be revealed.

Progressing from the audience area to the stage one enters the world of the performers and stage-
hands. Directly above the stage is a large fly, or vertical space used for stage backdrops, that can
be moved to stage level from above. The fly also contains sections for lighting that can be manip-
ulated as required. The stage has access from all sides including the floor.

       Figure 5.2.7. Studio Theater ready for staging.

The Colwell Playhouse, Tryon Festival Theatre, and Foellinger Great Hall are all physically sep-
arated from the rest of the building to reduce vibration from being transmitted to the stages
and audience seating. Originally even the air conditioning systems were physically separated and
placed on the roof of nearby Illinois Avenue Residence Hall (KCPA is now served by a chilled water
line) to reduce the possibility of sound vibration in the served spaces.
Having descended to the stage area the viewer is now on level 2. This is the production level of the
building. After exiting stage left one is in a hall that is both wide and tall. The hall is looped around
the entire second level to link the stages of the Tryon Festival Theatre and the Colwell Playhouse
with the scene shop and the other production departments. The doors of the scene shop and
stages are oversized to allow completed theatrical sets to be moved into position without having
to be broken apart and reassembled. The internal corridors link the scene shop, the costume shop
(with over 40,000 costumes), and the dedicated rehearsal spaces with the performance spaces.

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 270

Past the costume shop is Foellinger Great Hall and its supporting spaces. Two corridors lead per-
formers to the stage from the rehearsal rooms. Nearby is a space designed to replicate the stage
of the Great Hall yet remain isolated from vibration to the performance space. Additional dance
and choral rehearsal spaces are also present. Near the entrances to each hall are dedicated dress-
ing rooms and makeup spaces. The hallway that connects the stages is made of concrete masonry
units that have been signed by performers (see figure 5.2.10).

   Foellinger Great Hall, used for a wide range of musical groups (including symphony orchestras,
   jazz groups, choirs, and opera singers) seats 2,078. It is located on an axis with the Main Quad's
   Daniel Street cross axis mentioned in part 2.2. This hall is perfectly symmetrical. The walls are
   finished with butternut wood (also known as white walnut) from Indiana forests that was book-
   matched (the grains were matched in mirror images) across the hall to ensure the best possible
   acoustics. A false door at the balcony has been introduced to match an active door on the other
   side. Side walls have been kept nonparallel to control reverberation. The folded panel ceiling hangs
   inside the shell of the hall to provide optimum sound reflection. Cushioned seats in the space are
   covered with a heavy cloth calculated to absorb and reflect sound in the same manner as someone

                                                  10

   occupying the seats. Sight lines from a shallowly raked main area allow views to a slightly ele-
   vated stage, while balconies along either side and the back also have uninterrupted sight lines (see
   figure 5.2.11).

                    Figure 5.2.10. Corridor signatures of past performers.

   Continuing along the service corridor loop one reaches the Tryon Festival Theatre backstage area.
   This theater seats 974 on two levels and was designed primarily for operas. The acoustics have
   been optimized for vocal performance. The seating is split between a main floor serviced by four
   aisles and a balcony with continental seating for 264 with some obstructed view seats to the sides.
   The floor of the stage may be manipulated with trapdoors, so performers can emerge from almost

ratus. The fly is capable of storing the backdrops used for the operas high above the stage to be
easily positioned when scenes change.

Ascending the aisles, one exits to a lower sublobby that then reaches the main lobby via grand
stairs. Crossing the lobby to the west side one exits onto a plinth overlooking Goodwin Avenue.
This plinth sits above the level 2 service area. The four theaters are sheathed in brick and terra
cotta and emerge out of the plinth on the four cardinal sides of the structure. Foellinger Great Hall
has a large glass curtain wall that illuminates its lobby while shining out toward the campus when
lit at night. The flies of the Tryon Festival Theatre and the Colwell Playhouse express their volume
and the presence of the stages as a counter to the curved enclosures of the audience seating. In
the foreground, between the two Goodwin Street entrances is the outdoor Amphitheatre. It has
a singular acoustic sweet spot from which it is easy to hear the presenter from anywhere in the
audience. From here one may ascend to the lobby roof and view the east side of campus.
KCPA is a striking example of a structure that communicates its use to passersby through clear
volumetric expression. The sculptural manner in which the theater volumes silhouette against the
sky allows KCPA to pull away slightly from the street and become a focal point for the area to the
east of the Main Quad (see figures 5.2.12-5.2.14). The main halls can easily be identified from the
street. This awareness can heighten visitors' anticipation of a performance and initiate memories
of past performances for passersby.

Meaning: A Study of Three Structures

       About the Walk

       This walk discusses a variety of approaches to the making of architecture. Smith Memorial Hall is an
       example of a traditional building arranged in a sequential manner to accommodate the visitor to a
       music performance. The orchestration of compressive and expansive spaces, spatial sequencing, and
       the crescendo of the performance halls is as integral to an event as the recital itself, while the lack of
       ornamentation and the functional qualities of practice and performing are equally represented. In
       the Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics Building one finds a structure very different from others
       on the Main Quad in some ways and very similar in others. The possible allegorical tale about the
       building as a response to the story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11:1-9 is examined. The Carl R.
       Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, a relatively new addition, illustrates a contemporary approach
       to ornament and stylistic minimalism while attempting to integrate into a complex context involving
       the Morrow Plots.
       This walk begins at Smith Hall located at 805 South Mathews Avenue in Urbana. It also looks at the
       Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics Building at 707 South Mathews Avenue and the Carl R. Woese
       Institute for Genomic Biology at 1206 West Gregory Drive in Urbana.

  Architecture is the product and creator of its context. Principles and precedents form the archi-
  tecture of the United States. The context that formed the design of the Midwestern United
  States is a product of a changing society and a sense of history derived from the blurring of
  three important nineteenth-century thinkers: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel--philosopher--Karl

                                                                                                                                                                                        1

  Marx--philosopher, sociologist, and political activist--and Charles Darwin--scientist. Hegel intro-
  duced the notion of history into philosophy and the idea of epochs rising from one to another.
  Marx astutely took the idea of organic change and applied it to sociopolitical subjects. Finally, Dar-
  win added the theory of evolution. When combined, these three independent sets of ideas can be
  seen at the heart of early modernism. No longer content to explore the creation of new architec-
  ture based on precedents of some previous golden age, modernism sought to break from the past

  277 | Part 5.3. Campus Buildings and a Search for Meaning: A Study of Three Structures
  and create architecture with aspirations for the future. It is noteworthy that the US was emerging
  on the world scene in the nineteenth century and became a super power in the twentieth century.
  Similarly, the University of Illinois was formed as a land-grant institution after the Civil War when
  these three concepts were being mentally stirred into a kind of intoxicating cocktail. Rather than
  emulate the past, modernists sought freedom from the shackles of precedent to create a fresh and

                                   2

  possible to create a better future with the belief that we can create a utopian society on Earth.

2. The US was an experiment in nonmonarchical government. It is important to note that the general shift away from
   monarchical systems of government and the divine right of kings was part of a fall of legitimacy, simply put the erosion
   of trust in a given institution that challenges the very foundational belief in a system's authority and justice, potentially
   leading to social discontent, unrest, resistance, and, in extreme cases, even systemic collapse parallels the rise of mod­

  The nineteenth century is often called the Age of Eclecticism. Many different styles including neo-
  classicism, Greek revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Gothic revival, Romanesque, and Renaissance
  revival coexisted: "In fact, the singularity of nineteenth century Revivalism, as compared with ear-
  lier revivals, was that it revived several kinds of architecture at the same time, and none of them
  was ever authoritative or fashionable enough to vanquish its competitors, or even to supersede

                                                                                                                              3

  the kind of architecture which had previously been built."

  And yet there was a sense that the age demanded its own style:

          One of the most curious and far-reaching phenomena of the mid-nineteenth century was
          the insistent and widespread demand for a new architecture, which reached its climax
          about 1853. After that date, the idea became dormant for half a century, mainly because
          it had by then become apparent that every argument had been expended without a new
          architecture seeming any nearer; for in point of fact, it was impossible for a truly new uni-
          versal architecture to establish itself before the invention of new structural systems, and
          this only occurred in the 1890's, with the commercial development of steel and reinforced

                                                   4

          concrete frames.

  The call for an architecture that represented the age was made as early as the 1830s. The idea that
  an age had a spirit, a zeitgeist, had been presented by Hegel and would have a profound effect on
  the twentieth century.

  The early decades of the twentieth century had numerous new styles including art nouveau, art
  deco, and the international style. Architects began exploring the possibilities of innovative mate-
  rials, construction technologies, and programmatic demands. Steel frames and elevators allowed
  for structures to span greater distances and be built higher. Novel building types such as commer-
  cial warehouses and skyscrapers were developed. It seems the style of the cladding was left to the
  architect to determine as one might dress a mannequin. In all this upheaval architects argued that
  new building needs demanded new building forms.

  In 1923 Le Corbusier, a prominent architect, painter, and writer, brought together a series of pam-
  phlets into the collection Vers un Architecture, which was translated into English as Towards a New
  Architecture. For Le Corbusier it was clear: Architecture was to be of its time and in opposition to
  the architecture of the past. Just as others had done before him, he called on architects to emulate
  engineers. He had chapters on planes, ocean liners, and automobiles. Writing shortly after World
  War I he stipulated that the problem of the epoch was housing and he warned an eager audi-

  ence of architects: "Architecture or Revolution. Revolution can be avoided." By maintaining that
  the problem of the epoch was housing, Le Corbusier empowered the architect. There was no hid-
  ing his reference to the Communist Revolution in Russia. According to many modernist architects,
  architecture was a cure for the problems of the age--the secular, messianic figure of the architect

                                                                                      6

  In his work, Le Corbusier replaced the five orders with his own five points of architecture that
  were in direct opposition to the authority of the orders. His five points were piloti--columns that
  structurally bore the weight of the building rather than masonry bearing walls; free plan--in which
  the walls, no longer needed to hold the building up, could be used for spatial enclosure indepen-
  dent of the structure; free facade--where the facade could also be hung from the horizontal floors
  and no longer have any structural responsibility; ribbon windows--since the exterior wall could

6. Hermann Finsterlin, a German expressionist, wrote in 1919: "He (the architect) will build his rampart out of the Will. He

   will conquer the centripetal spirits of the air, stretch and spring over the ether mantle which envelops him like a skin,
   shed layer after layer and climb higher and purer over and above each of these transcended remains...Thousands of
   naked souls, thousands of lesser souls and diminished souls await the goal which should gape in front of them, the king­
   dom of heaven on earth" (quoted in Rowe and Koetter, Collage City, 11). Thus we see the vision of the architect leading
   humankind to utopia.

larger amounts of light and ventilation; and roof gardens--because it was no longer necessary for
roofs to be pitched, the horizontal roof surfaces could be commissioned to serve as garden space.
The purity and simplicity of these five points were incredibly seductive.

The architecture of the revivalist period, which will be referred to as traditional architecture here,
had characteristics that can be juxtaposed with those of modern architecture. Traditional archi-
tecture was based on precedents from the past, often stressing symmetry and typically alluding to
bearing wall construction though often using the latest in construction technology, such as struc-
tural steel or concrete frame. The designs incorporated the conveniences and necessities of the
day. Meanwhile, modern architecture was associated with the avant-garde; eschewed precedent;
and utilized principles of composition, utility, and innovative materials. The compositional prefer-
ence was for asymmetry and the visual dispersal of elements to the periphery. This is reflected in
the art of the cubists and the purists.
During the 1930s there was an intense debate over the appropriateness of traditional versus mod-
ern architecture. Magazines such as Western Architecture often had articles espousing one over
the other in the same issue. Even the depiction of buildings in architectural drawings seemed con-
fused. The Beaux-Arts's ink washes, typically associated with traditional architecture, were some-
times employed to delineate modern architecture, and the simple line drawings associated with
modern architecture were employed in the depiction of traditional structures. The debate contin-
ued up until World War II with modern architecture gaining wider acceptance as the years passed.
Several factors helped push the pendulum in favor of modernism in the United States. In 1933 the

Bauhaus closed under pressure from the Nazi Party. Members of the famous Bauhaus School, a
design institution established by Walter Gropius in Germany, left Europe and immigrated to the
United States. Several faculty members became influential leaders in US schools such as Harvard
(Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer) and the Illinois Institute of Technology (Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe and László Moholy-Nagy). The Bauhaus teaching methods were also adopted at numerous
US schools. The second factor was World War II itself. The war demanded mass production using
new materials, new machines, and new delivery systems. Ornamentation was considered an unim-
portant affectation in the industrial buildings of this era. These industrial buildings and their prod-
ucts proved vital to the victory over the Axis powers. As a result, modern architecture was no
longer relegated to factories and utilitarian structures. It became celebrated in public buildings
such as embassies and post offices. The advancements in designing and building airplanes and
battleships, with their machine aesthetic derived from functional necessities, fueled a postwar era
that sought the new and improved. Modernism celebrated streamlining.

  generations until, beginning in the mid-1960s, there began a questioning of whether modern
  architecture and its partner, urban planning, were delivering on their utopian aspirations. By
  1966 two events signaled the significance of this questioning. In 1966 the US Congress passed
  the National Historic Preservation Act (Senate Bill 3035), which signaled a shift in the value placed
  on not just new architecture but the architecture of the past. The law was the most far-reaching
  preservation legislation ever created in the US. That same year Robert Venturi published Complex-
  ity and Contradiction in Architecture. In his text, Venturi questions the modernist value of mini-
  malism and suggests revaluing traditional architecture and nonmodern precedents. Books on city

                                                                                                                     7

  planning and urban design echoed these sentiments.

          Figure 5.3.4. Smith Hall section diagram. Read long description of figure.

  In the 1970s people became curious about both personal and national history. The US bicentennial
  sparked an interest across the country in events surrounding the Declaration of Independence and
  formation of the United States. "Bicentennial Minutes" describing historic events 200 years earlier
  were televised each evening. The book Roots: The Saga of an American Family (1976) was made into
  a miniseries (1977). It brought the history of one African American family into living rooms across
  the country and set in motion a coast-to-coast fascination with genealogy. The pendulum of inter-
  est swung back to exploration of the past as designers looked to historic works for ideas. This

                                                                                               8

  period became known as postmodernism. In theory, we are still living in a postmodern world as

7. Aldo Rossi's Architecture of the City, published in 1966, also sought to debunk the minimalist notions of postwar mod­
   ernism. Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter's Collage City explains the rise and fall of modern architecture, urban planning, and
   urban design.

8. At the time there were debates over the spelling of the term and its meaning. "Postmodern" is used here but "post mod­
   ern" and "post-modern" were also used. Each version stressed an aspect of the period. Today "postmodern" is typically
   used to describe a style.

no new philosophy has replaced this questioning of modernism. Stylistically, however, the pendu-
lum shifted back toward modernism in the 1990s. Architects explored parallels in literary criticism,
decomposition, and deconstruction as means to produce design and as a style. Many attribute this
shift to the power of the millennium- and ideas about the future. When the year 2000 approached,
fears of technological disaster resulting from the Y2K computer bug that could crash global sys-
tems were mixed with an optimistic sense for what the future had in store. As the twenty-first
century approached architects sought unconventional forms. Aided by computers for both spatial
exploration and manufacturing, architects created forms previously unimagined. Later there was
a shift to selective memory from the past, as celebrations and sales of midcentury modern design
became ubiquitous in both design and marketing.

       Figure 5.3.5. The south wall of the Memorial Room at Smith Hall.

This is a very brief cultural context for the campus buildings to be visited and explored. The Uni-
versity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus is composed of both traditional and modern struc-
tures.
Smith Memorial Hall is a clear example of a traditional structure designed in the Beaux-Arts style.
It was designed by James White and Edward Wright and was dedicated in 1922. Named for Tina
Weedon Smith (there is a large painting of Smith in the south stairwell), it was built with funds

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 284
  donated by her husband, Captain Thomas J. Smith, who had been on the university's Board of
  Trustees (1897-1903). Smith Hall was the public face of the Music Department. As such it turns its
  facade out toward the Urbana community at the corner of South Mathews Street and West Nevada
  Street. The visitor enters from the east up a grand set of stairs and through a monumentally scaled
  doorway framed by Ionic columns (see figures 5.3.1 and 5.3.2).

   Figure 5.3.6. The skylight of Smith Hall, north stair hall.

  The building receives the visitor through a long cork-floored lobby before one enters the large
  performance hall. This grand wood-paneled space seats 650 on the main level and 450 in the bal-
  cony. The hall is lined with mahogany to provide a fully occupied space with a period of rever-
  beration of 1.75 seconds. There are provisions to lower the period of vibration when the hall is

                              9

  unoccupied.
  The parti of Smith is simple: it has a central performance hall surrounded by a corridor with class-
  rooms and practice spaces to the outside (see figures 5.3.3 and 5.3.4).
  Moving upstairs on beautiful curving stairways to the south and north of the lobby one ascends
  to the second floor, where a second recital space sits above the entry and lobby. This space is the

   jewel of the school. The Memorial Room is a drawing room used for chamber music and student
   recitals. This elaborately decorated, stone veneer space is lined with marble and has crystal chan-
   deliers. The space itself is a simple rectangle with two fireplaces at each end. The room overlooks
   Mathews Street to the east (see figure 5.3.5).
   Leaving Smith Hall through the north exit one moves under the stairs landing. Before exiting one
   can look up and see the coffered ceiling with an inset skylight. The skylight has been blocked, but
   its presence in the ceiling is still apparent (see figure 5.3.6).

   To the north of Smith Memorial Hall is the Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics Building (LCLB;
   this was formerly the Foreign Languages Building and commonly referred to as FLB). This struc-
   ture was designed by Holabird and Root in the late 1960s and was dedicated in 1970. Stories abound
   about the LCLB to explain its appearance. It is rumored that the building's shape was determined
   by the presence of an early supercomputer housed in the basement. This story claims that should
   there be a catastrophe, the building's shell would fall outward, thus saving the computer below. In
   reality, this structure is similar to other buildings designed in the 1960s such as the Art and Archi-
   tecture Building at Yale University by Paul Rudolf, completed in 1963, or the gigantic Boston City

                                                                                                                                 10

   Many feel the structure is out of place on the Main Quad. It certainly looks different from the other

10. These structures are often grouped with the brutalist movement, which got its name from the French term béton brut,
    which translates to "raw concrete." This movement flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s.

   Main Quad. Its massing has an interesting interpretation worth exploring.

          Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As people moved east-
          ward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
          They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used
          brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a
          city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves;
          otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth."
          But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.
          The Lord said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this,
          then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and con-
          fuse their language so they will not understand each other."
          So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the
          city. That is why it was called Babel--because there the Lord confused the language of the

                                                                                                                                                                                                 11

   that the Tower of Babel was a ziggurat. The first ziggurats were built approximately 5000 years
   ago (3000 BCE). They were stepped pyramids predating the Egyptian pyramids (see figure 5.3.7).

                 Figure 5.3.9. Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics Building looking west at first floor.

   The LCLB is a spatial inversion of the Tower of Babel. Instead of a solid stepping up to the heavens,
   a spatial void steps down from the heavens to the ground floor (see figures 5.3.8-5.3.11).
   The poetry of the space is linked to this idea of spatial inversion. The light of the heavens shines
   through to the spaces below, illuminating the inhabitants:

           It is language, in the sense of a structured form of contact, communication, description
           and argument through signs and symbols, that makes us human not only as a species but

    baked bricks (see George, "Tower of Babel").

Language is seen as the means to create and hold society together. The ability to understand one-
self and one another is crucial to the function of a university. The expression of the LCLB's desire
to bring the people of the world together in an ability to communicate and share is, indeed, a noble
act. The flags lining its corridors represent a sample of cultures and their languages.

Did the architect really intentionally invert a Mesopotamian ziggurat to symbolically tie the LCLB
to the Tower of Babel and a story about the advent of the different human languages? It is uncer-
tain. What is certain is that the building is what it is. Its form is open to interpretation. Much
like a Picasso cubist painting evokes different reactions from viewers, so can architecture. In this
instance, the interpretation of this symbolic inversion may affect the visitor's opinion and yet
the building may not ever be interpreted in this manner. One aspect is clear. The building lacks
the ornamentation of Smith Memorial Hall. It has a limited material palette of brick, glass, plas-
ter walls, and acoustical tile ceilings. Floors are now carpeted. The building's striking appearance
comes from its exterior, multistory piers and its large interior volume.
Leaving LCLB one can move south to the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology (IGB). This
building is a relative newcomer to the Urbana-Champaign campus. A strategic site was chosen for
its construction that is both important and difficult to manage, as it is just east of the historic Mor-
row Plots. As a result the structure could not be allowed to throw a significant amount of shade
on the plants. The building's massing was carefully studied to avoid adverse consequences to the
research that has been ongoing for over a century. The IGB is now directly opposite the Library,
and faces the South Quad east of the Morrow Plots (see figure 5.3.12).

       can be seen beyond the pitched atrium roof. Read long description of figure.

Designed by CUH2A (now HDR) and dedicated in 2006, the building deliberately shares exterior
physical characteristics with nearby Georgian buildings such as Mumford Hall (see figure 5.3.13).

The basic parti of the building can be seen as three linked pavilions (see figures 5.3.14 and 5.3.15).

The IGB has a terrace to the west framed by a freestanding pavilion to the north and an attached
pavilion to the south. The lower-level plan shows labs and office spaces under the terrace. In the
north pavilion on the lower level are a small café and meeting area, along with conference and lec-
ture spaces (see figures 5.3.16 and 5.3.17).

Similar to the Temple Hoyne Buell Hall atrium stairway discussed in part 4.2, the stairway here
serves as both circulation and decoration. Though comparatively small, the atrium is a reception
space that juxtaposes materials to bring attention to the nature of the building. The stairs are
sleek, stainless steel with glass. One senses the clean, polished qualities of an efficient lab, while
the south wall is a simple, sumptuous wall of wood veneer and the floors are polished limestone.
The architects have contrasted natural materials--the limestone complete with fossilized remains
at one's feet and the wood panels with the grain patterns set onto a regular grid--with refined,
machined materials--a perforated metal screen contains images of genetic research material (see
figure 5.3.18).

The material palette is limited throughout the building. The same vocabulary used for the atrium
stairway is repeated in the north pavilion stairway that links the lobby with the lower level (see
figure 5.3.19).

   Smith Memorial Hall, the LCLB, and the IGB stretch across almost a century of construction on
   campus. Each strives to be a structure built for its time with the expectation that it will make sig-
   nificant contributions to the university for years to come. The attitudes toward the built environ-
   ment and the manner in which meaning can be presented to the user is apparent in each
   structure--even as our societal values and the manner in which we use our structures change.

       About the Walk

       The Education Building shows the vision of A. Richard Williams, professor emeritus of the Illinois
       School of Architecture. The building's design simultaneously attempts to merge itself with the exist-
       ing conditions while providing a very different vision and path for the university's future structures.
       The manner in which the building folds itself into the cultural and physical context, along with its
       superb gardens, shows the depth to which architecture and landscape architecture can become
       integrated.
       This walk takes place at the Education Building located at 1310 South Sixth Street in Champaign. The
       walk begins at the front door of the Architecture Building located at 608 East Lorado Taft Drive in
       Champaign.

  Designers synthesize many ideas when creating a part of the built environment. Ideas are often
  formed by looking at the work of others, exploring new mediums, and trying different materials,
  and these choices often reflect the values of society at the time of creation. The designer can be

                                                                                                                                           1

  seen as either the leader of culture or the mirror of our society.

  Three-dimensional design has been greatly influenced by drawing and modeling approaches
  throughout time. Newly developed techniques allow the designer to explore and understand
  the creation of the built environment in a different light. The Italian painter Giotto di Bondone
  (1269-1337) used layering and scaling of figures. Similarly, late medieval architects used the same
  principles of layering and positioning in their work. During the Renaissance one-point perspective
  was invented, which dramatically influenced painters and architects. The Florentine architect Fil-
  ippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446) first explored this technique of utilizing vanishing points to create
  the illusion of depth and three-dimensional space. This understanding of perspective led to a
  greater ideality in city design and the buildings that supported public spaces that then translated

to buildings that stressed frontality (the front directly facing the viewer) and eventually led to
the tragic scene discussed in part 3.6. In the 1700s the use of two-point perspective during the
Baroque period had an influence on stage set design, which then translated into an architec-
ture that was no longer frontal but was meant to be seen as an object, such as the royal hunting
lodge in Stupinigi by Filippo Juvarra (1678-1736), completed in 1731. Indeed two-point perspective
influenced many architects from Frank Lloyd Wright to Mies van der Rohe. The Carceri (prison)
series by Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-78) even had an influence on the design of Temple Hoyne
Buell Hall in the late twentieth century. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Paul Cézanne
(1839-1906), Pablo Picasso (1881-1973), Piet Mondrian (1872-1944), and others began shifting away
from perspective-based painting. In architecture, work began to reflect an asymmetrical aes-
thetic and a variety of architectural investigations that incorporated a drawing technique called
axonometric to depict structures. Just as Matisse explored combining perspective and axonomet-
ric drawing, architects experimented with this method as a new way to see the world and then
created novel designs. Gerrit Rietveld (1888-1964) created the Rietveld Schröder House in 1924
as a three-dimensional realization of Mondrian's paintings and realized axonometric space. This
movement was called De Stihl. More recently a whole new manner of spatial exploration based
on computer studies has been taking place. The computer has assisted in the realization of work
on many levels, most notably the ability to create structures unimagined until now and the abil-
ity to produce these designs using innovative materials and methods of production. Frank Gehry
(b. 1929) has created his forms using digital capture and computer-aided manufacturing of skins
and structures. The "blob architecture" begun in the mid-1990s was created using computer-aided
design techniques in parametric modeling. Today digital fabrication again is pushing the envelope
as designers rethink the nature of construction (see figures 5.4.1-5.4.5).

Historically, the orthogonal grid has been extremely influential for architects. The Romans utilized
it to great effect. Renaissance, neoclassical, and Beaux-Arts designs continued this tradition. The
use of axis and cross-axis organizational patterns is readily apparent on the Urbana-Champaign
campus, and the rectilinearity of the continental grid is ubiquitous in the inhabited areas of the
United States. One aspect of the history of the continental grid that puzzled designers for years
was the layout of Greek spaces, such as the Acropolis in Athens. One line of thinking is that the
buildings were no longer on a grid due to earthquakes. In 1937, the Greek architect Constantinos
A. Doxiadis (1913-75) published his ideas on Greek space planning in Architectural Space in Ancient
Greece. In this text, Doxiadis convincingly presents the theory that Greek sacred precincts are laid
out on a radial system that reveals the site to viewers sequentially. Buildings are arranged so as
to be seen as objects. The Parthenon, for example, is designed to be seen from the entrance gates
(called the Propylaea) at a three-quarters view. This is the classic image of the Parthenon. Inter-
estingly this is also the backside of the Parthenon. According to Doxiadis the viewer is meant to
proceed along a "sacred way" that draws them toward the entrance on the opposite side. From
there the viewer would see two "horned mountains," which represent the breasts of Mother Earth.

297 | Part 5.4. Synthesis of Ideas: The Education Building
Thus the Acropolis is arranged to hover over Athens and make the viewer aware of this sacred
landscape. Doxiadis's book revealed this ordering system for numerous ancient Greek sites. Con-
trasted with the Roman axis it would become an important revelation for the designer of the Edu-
cation Building.

The Education Building shows a variety of influences incorporated by A. Richard (Dick) Williams
(1914-2018) of the Illinois School of Architecture. The design simultaneously attempts to merge

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 298
itself with the existing conditions while providing a very different vision and path for the univer-
sity's future structures. The manner in which the building folds itself into the cultural and physi-
cal context, along with its superb gardens, shows the depth to which architecture and landscape
architecture can become integrated.
Williams's vision for the South Quad was different from its current state. He lobbied the university
administration to plant a grove similar to the Illini Grove over the entire South Quad and part
of the military axis. The space would then contrast with the Main Quad to provide a completely
different experience for future generations to enjoy. This arrangement of trees would form a tall
canopy over the entire spaces south of the Undergraduate Library. Buildings would occupy space
beneath the shading canopy and merge with it. In the early 1990s Williams proposed a new art
and architecture library at the crossing of the military axis and the South Quad axis where the
McFarland Memorial Bell Tower is now located. This same vision played a role in his design of the
Education Building.

Built in the early 1960s, the Education Building is a product of its time and contrasts with Wohlers
Hall (formerly Commerce West), which was built concurrently. Both are steel frame structures.
Wohlers Hall was designed to complete a composition with David Kinley Hall and the Architec-
ture Building (see part 1.1 and figure 1.7). Wohlers Hall has a steel frame structure designed to look
like a brick bearing wall building in the Georgian style. By contrast, the Education Building is a
steel frame structure deigned to look like a concrete frame building in the modernist style known
as brutalism, a subset of modernism that was popular from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. During
this period structures with coffered concrete floors and ceilings were being constructed around
the world. Architects were returning to symmetrical compositions, at least externally. Indeed,

Education Building. Jack Baker, the architect of Erlanger House, and Williams were close peers. It
is certain they shared their investigations.

The siting of the Education Building merges numerous ideas and concepts. In the early 1960s the
field of education anticipated growth. The Baby Boomers were completing their families and edu-
cation for a growing middle class was essential to the mission of the university. The design of the
Education Building included a long-term plan: to build two relatively identical structures that sat
across a shared public space. The precedent for this was seen at Mumford Hall and David Kinley
Hall and Charles Platt's unrealized plan for the Undergraduate Library and Main Library pairing.
Later the Undergraduate Library used the same idea in its entrances, which straddle a lower-level

                      2

courtyard. In the envisioned education complex the lower levels of the structures were to open
up to a shared sunken courtyard space.

The two buildings were to form a space that framed the Architecture Building to the north and
the Natural History Building to the south along a central axis (see figure 5.4.6).

2. Williams and Undergraduate Library designer Ambrose Richardson of Richardson, Severns, Scheeler, and Associates
   were contemporaries and friends. Richardson was involved in the design of numerous University of Illinois buildings
   including the Art and Design Building, the Florida Avenue Residence Halls, the Children's Research Center, the Civil Engi­
   neering Hydrosystems Laboratory, Krannert Art Museum, the Law Building, the Music Building, and the Water Survey
   Research Building (see Tate and Franch, Illini Place).

   303 | Part 5.4. Synthesis of Ideas: The Education Building
In addition the Education Building was designed to align with the spaces adjacent to the Archi-
tecture Building. The first floor of the Education Building is sized to correspond to the opening
between the Architecture Building and Wohlers Hall. As an avid sailor, Wiliams related the Educa-
tion Building to a ship that rested in direct alignment to the "boat slip" between the Architecture
Building and Wohlers Hall. Thus the complex relies on the strategies used by earlier campus plan-
ners: axis, cross axis, alignment across a figural void, and an attention to the landscape.

                         condition. On the right is an example of a possible site plan if a second
                         building had been constructed. The space between the buildings would have
                         been a sunken shared court space. Dashed lines indicate how the two
                         buildings frame the axis between the Architecture Building and the Natural
                         History Building. Secondary dashed lines show the relationship between
                         the Architecture Building's gates, the Natural History Building's secondary
                         entrances, and the north and south entrances of the two planned
                         structures.

What sets the strategy apart is the attention to siting based also on strategies outlined by Doxiadis.
The Education Building is sited to be approached at three-quarters view, similar to the Parthenon.
Just as Platt had been extremely conscious of designing for architects when creating the Archi-
tecture Building, Williams sited the Education Building to be viewed at a specific angle from the
Architecture Building's main entrance. The propylaea view of the Education Building (a monumen-
tal gateway to a sacred precinct in ancient Greece) is from the landing in front of the Architecture
Building (see figures 5.4.7-5.4.9).

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 304

                hipped and designed to disappear from view while the Parthenon's roof is a simple gable

Seen in this manner the Education Building can be interpreted as a modern Parthenon, stripped of
its perimeter columns. The upper floors of the Education Building are cantilevered using the steel
frame that renders the perimeter colonnade of its precedent unnecessary. Like the Parthenon, the
building has a monumental presence, raised on a platform, above the ground plane. In this aspect,
the Education Building is more like a Roman temple. Roman temples had axial stairs on one side,
whereas Greek temples had a platform that could be approached from all directions. This works
well in the case of the Education Building as the grade slopes down from south to north toward
Boneyard Creek, which allows for an accessible entrance on the south. The platform is at grade
to the south and has a commanding, axial staircase at the main entry on the north side. Adjacent
to the west side of the Education Building is a discreet garden. Walled off from the noise of Sixth
Street, this space is a quiet oasis for patrons. It is often used as an outdoor classroom on pleasant
days.

Ascending the north stairs deposits the viewer under the building canopy provided by the third-
floor overhang. A large picture window frames the view back toward the Architecture Building's
gates. Two concrete walks are consciously designed to relate to the gates across the way to the
north (see figure 5.4.10).

The large glass floor-to-ceiling window is intended to blur the distinction between interior and

exterior. On the outside the concrete sidewalks have been sandblasted to reveal different-sized
concrete aggregate. The interior spaces use a similar-sized terrazzo aggregate that moves from
inside to outside at the entries. This careful manipulation of the ground plane's concrete treat-
ment surrounds the building (see figures 5.4.11 and 5.4.12).

                     portion of the building's lower level.

zones on either side of the building's core (see figure 5.4.15).

This shift allows for central spaces on both the north and south ends of the building. Williams's
nautical analogy is made again. Just as a ship has decks fore and aft, the Education Building main-
tains its important communal spaces at each end (see figures 5.4.16-5.4.18).

                         eliminated and stair treads are placed on steel tubing connected to floor
                         plates and stair landings.

311 | Part 5.4. Synthesis of Ideas: The Education Building
Moving up the stairs to the third floor one encounters the faculty offices at the perimeter of the
plan. Like lifeboats, these offices are suspended over the terraces below (see figure 5.4.19).

             of the Queen Mary's sports deck with lifeboats. Bottom: Plan of the Education Building's
             third floor. The offices open onto a continuous perimeter walkway.

Economy, like in a ship's cabin, is used when allocating office space. The resemblance to a ship
becomes complete as the core links to a double-loaded corridor. The offices have a low roof
with wooden baffles in the ceiling. These baffles appear outside the building envelope in another
attempt to merge the interior and exterior environments. Today, the exterior baffles are well worn,
like material on a sea-faring ship, while the interior baffles remain unweathered.
The design of the Education Building masks the central core by lining the interior side of the cor-
ridors with wooden baffles. These baffles help soften the acoustics in the corridor and reduce the
echo from the hard surfaces. The baffles also mask the numerous vents that open into the cor-
ridor. Here Williams is using a precedent from the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, seen in multiple
works, including the interior of Finlandia Hall, that was used later at Krannert Center for the Per-
forming Arts as a treatment on the walls between the lobby and the Coldwell Playhouse and the
Tryon Festival Theater. (see part 5.2).
Thus, though radically different from its surrounding structures in appearance, and notably part

of an unfinished composition, the Education Building has woven itself into the campus fabric in
a unique manner. Temple Hoyne Buell Hall has supplanted a second, symmetrical building for the
College of Education. Yet there remains the germ of an idea that may someday lead to a court-
yard space between the two structures and perhaps the introduction of a grove. This is the nature
of design: it builds off the past with a hope for the future. The future becomes the present and
designers choose what to draw from and how to be inventive in their own time. Dick Williams
synthesized disparate concepts, construction technologies, and siting principles as he worked to
create an architecture of his time, built for future generations.

About the Walk

     The University of Illinois has pledged to build LEED-accredited structures in the future and to
     become a leader in sustainability. An explanation of the basic ideas and strategies of sustainability
     and LEED accreditation is followed by a walk through the Business Instructional Facility to illustrate
     the principles, successes, and failures of the university's first LEED-accredited building.
     This walk takes place at the Business Instructional Facility located at 515 East Gregory Drive in
     Champaign.

       As the flagship public university in the state of Illinois, the campus has a moral and ethical
       responsibility to lead, to set aggressive goals, to work to meet them, and to serve as a
       model for the community, state, and nation. The [Illinois Climate Action] Plan represents a
       roadmap to a new, prosperous, and sustainable future for the University. It outlines strate-

                                                                                                                                                                                                         1

       gies, initiatives, and targets toward meeting the stated goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.

Sustainability in architecture is the idea that a building can allow humans to coexist with nature
in a maintained balance. The notion continues: in creating this balance one generation will not
overburden future generations with a built environment that cannot be continued without great
hardship to either humankind or our natural environment. Whether perceived as a moral issue or
an issue of species survival, sustainability has become an international concern. A graduate archi-
tecture class (Architecture 577) on the Urbana-Champaign campus was asked about sustainability.
When questioned about the path necessary to achieve an environmental balance, the overwhelm-
ing majority felt that new technologies will solve current problems. A minority felt that funda-
mental changes, such as behavioral shifts toward conservation, are needed to reach a sustainable

  future. It is now becoming clear that both new technological approaches and conservation strate-
  gies are necessary to meet the goals set forth in 2008, when the University of Illinois Urbana-
  Champaign signed the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment:

          We believe colleges and universities must exercise leadership in their communities and
          throughout society by modeling ways to minimize global warming emissions, and by pro-
          viding the knowledge and the educated graduates to achieve climate neutrality. Campuses
          that address the climate challenge by reducing global warming emissions and by inte-
          grating sustainability into their curriculum will better serve their students and meet their
          social mandate to help create a thriving, ethical and civil society.

          We further believe that colleges and universities that exert leadership in addressing cli-
          mate change will stabilize and reduce their long-term energy costs, attract excellent stu-
          dents and faculty, attract new sources of funding, and increase the support of alumni and

                                                        2

          local communities.

  This signing committed the campus to carbon neutrality by the year 2050 and set a series of short-
  term goals. To fulfill this self-imposed responsibility the university created the Illinois Climate
  Action Plan (iCAP) in 2010, 2015, 2020 and a new version, the Illinois Climate Action Plan will be
  released in October 2025. Thes examine outcomes and set more goals. Specifically:

          iCAP 2020, the third update to the Illinois Climate Action Plan since 2010, contains 56
          SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based) objectives organized
          into eight key themes: Energy, Transportation, Land & Water, Zero Waste, Education,
          Engagement, Resilience, and Implementation.

          With the dedication, passion, and hard work of our campus and community, the University
          of Illinois Urbana-Champaign can become a model for innovative, progressive environ-

                                                           3

          mental stewardship.

  The 2015 iCAP outlined a path to carbon neutrality that uses conservation strategies (reduce,
  reuse, recycle) such as those outlined in the 2013 Energy Conservation Incentive Program, which
  encourage conservation through building improvements and behavioral changes. The 2015 iCAP
  estimated that half the emission reductions needed to get to carbon neutrality will come from
  conservation. The other half will come from a wide variety of strategies including alternative forms
  of energy generation, better management of transportation (especially air travel), better water
  and waste management, sequestration methods, curricular education, outreach, and sustainabil-

a comprehensive list of over 50 objectives for the campus and its inhabitants.

                         Part 5.5. Orientation Map.

In another attempt to be able to react to be responsible, the university committed to creating a
resilience plan in 2016, outlining how the campus will react to atmospheric conditions and climate
change:

       Illinois is a Charter Signatory of the Second Nature Climate Commitment, which combines
       a Carbon Commitment the campus signed in 2008 with the newly signed Resilience Com-
       mitment. The full Climate Commitment formally acknowledges that the effects of climate
       change are already felt--and that universities and colleges must pursue both mitigation
       and adaptation to combat the unfolding crisis.
       By adding the Resilience Commitment, Illinois has made a pledge to evaluate campus vul-

          tion--and to make an action plan that addresses those weaknesses.

  Managing this complex endeavor to incentivize conservation and promote smart growth is com-
  plicated. In 2017 the Urbana-Champaign campus began a master plan update. The Core Planning
  Committee, along with Smith Group, the consultant hired to create the document, met with cam-
  pus leaders. In one meeting with the deans of the colleges it became clear that iCAP's stated policy
  that the campus would not increase its building square footage was at direct odds with their plans.
  Many of the deans were not even aware of iCAP and were concerned that iCAP's edict about square
  footage ran contrary to their ambitions for growth. The iCAP strategy to limit physical growth to
  help limit energy consumption did not correlate to most colleges' intentions to increase enroll-
  ment by as much as 30 percent. The 2018 approved master plan seeks to remove inefficiencies
  by renovating outdated structures and replacing obsolete buildings with more sustainable ones.
  The largest inefficiency addressed in the plan is the use of existing campus spaces. The review of
  classroom, office, and research space use was pivotal in exploring how the university could better
  use its existing assets. Rather than build new structures it seems the university can benefit from
  scheduling and assigning space more efficiently.

  As the importance of building sustainably has increased so have the means to encourage intel-
  ligent design choices. Energy codes in Illinois have addressed the construction of commercial
  buildings since the 2004 Energy Efficient Commercial Building Act (based on the 2000 Interna-
  tional Energy Conservation Code). Since then the 2012 Illinois Energy Conservation Code and sub-
  sequent versions have required designers to meet basic energy conservation goals.

  In 1993 the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) was created. In 2000, Leadership in
  Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)--a green building certification system--was first used.
  The USGBC states that "LEED established a baseline--a universally agreed-upon, holistic system
  for reducing environmental impacts, saving resources, impacting human health, reducing carbon

                                                                                              5

  emissions and addressing climate change."

          We're committed to transforming how our buildings are designed, constructed and oper-
          ated through LEED.

          Our vision at the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is that buildings and communities
          will regenerate and sustain the health and vitality of all life within a generation. Our mis-
          sion is to transform the way buildings and communities are designed, built and operated,
          enabling an environmentally and socially responsible, healthy, and prosperous environ-

       and healthier for us to live, work and play in.

       LEED . . . is an internationally recognized green building certification system, providing
       third-party verification that a building or community was designed and built using strate-
       gies aimed at improving performance across all the metrics that matter most: energy sav-
       ings, water efficiency, CO2emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality,

                                                                                                                                               7

       and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts.

The USGBC created this system to assist designers in making decisions to create more sustainable
environments. Grading systems establish four levels of certification for a structure: Certification
(basic), Silver, Gold, and Platinum (the highest level). There is also a LEED certification called "Net
Zero" which can be achieved by purchasing enough renewable energy certificates to equal the
annual energy use for 5 to 10 years. The University has done this with the Campus Instructional
Facility, and Wymer Hall. The grading system updates periodically as industry standards, materi-
als, and construction methods change. Two issues should be underscored: that the LEED system
uses third-party verification to score and certify a building and the building's owner must pay for
this certification.

                                                                                                                                                                                              8

In 2009 the Business Instructional Facility (BIF), designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects, became
the first LEED-accredited building on campus. In 2025 over 12% percent of the gross square
footage on campus was LEED accredited and 35 buildings had achieved LEED certification with

                                                                                                      9

several others in an active certification process.

The Gies College of Business's Business Instructional Facility at 515 East Gregory Drive opened in
2008 and was certified with a LEED Platinum rating in 2009. The structure received 52 of 69 pos-
sible points in the system used at that time. The LEED scorecard indicated the building was rated
highly in all areas: 10 of 14 in the sustainable sites category; 4 of 5 in the water efficiency category;
13 of 17 in the energy and atmosphere category; 7 of 13 in the materials and resources category; 13
of 15 in the indoor environmental quality category; and 5 of 5 in the innovation category (see the
appendix for the scorecard).

The building is serviced by both a steam line and a chilled water line, which alleviates the need for
some equipment that might otherwise be needed on-site. The basement also serves as an area of
refuge in case of a tornado so it must have space suitable for occupants in case of emergency. The
building has numerous air-handling units to service multiple zones so that different areas of the
structure can be supplied with heating and cooling simultaneously--depending on the loads. For
example, when the auditorium is filled to capacity it may require cooling at the same time a small
classroom on the other side of the building requires heating.
Moving upstairs into the atrium one finds the main space with a window wall facing south. The
tall, four-story atrium organizes the building with a U-shaped parti that faces south (see figures
5.5.2 and 5.5.3).
The atrium's glass wall is carefully screened in two ways. A large series of trusses extend a can-
tilever beyond the building envelope to the south. This canopy shades the atrium in the sum-
mer months, allowing light into the space while preventing solar heat gain. The second screen is
a computer-controlled series of vertical shading devices just inside the glass curtain wall. These
shades are programmed to prevent heat gain when it is undesirable and, when it is cool, to allow
solar radiation into the atrium to passively warm the space. Ideally the shades would be located
externally for maximum efficiency (by mounting them outside less heat is gained in the interior),

319 | Part 5.5. Sustainability, LEED, and Conservation: Business Instructional Facility
however it is impractical to have exterior, operable shades because of cost, maintenance, and
weathering (see figures 5.5.4-5.5.7).

                                                sun infiltration for solar heat gain.

In the winter months the atrium acts as a large solar collector. The heat rises to the ceiling using
a convection HVAC system that reduces power consumption. The operable mesh solar shades are
controlled to allow daylight into the space. Photo sensors on lights help reduce energy consump-
tion as outside light entering the room often alleviates the need for the use of electric lighting. The
building employs triple-pane windows that absorb less solar radiation than traditional windows.
Surrounding the atrium are classrooms, support spaces, and offices. A staircase is suspended into
the atrium to serve the first three floors. Breakout/lounge spaces overlook the atrium on the east
and west sides. These spaces lead to corridors extending south. Along the west corridor on the
first floor are bathrooms and a series of changing rooms for patrons who run or bicycle to the
building. The rooms help promote alternative methods of transportation other than automobiles
and are necessary to secure points for LEED accreditation. They are located near the entrance and
are close to bike racks outside.
Down the corridor is a weather vestibule that gives access to the exterior garden and a 300-seat
auditorium. The garden has been designed to minimize water consumption and uses native plant
species. A goal was to make the landscaped area very low maintenance but patrons complained
that the space was "weed infested" and asked for some grassy areas. The garden today is a com-
promise.

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 320
From the courtyard one can see a photovoltaic array on the roof of the auditorium (see figure
5.5.8).

Figure 5.5.3. Business Instructional Facility first floor plan with poché. Read long description of figure.

These solar panels provide a fraction of the building's electrical needs but are symbolic of the
efforts toward creating a greener future. The photovoltaic panels harvest solar energy and convert
it to electricity as a clean, renewable energy source. To illustrate the complexity of sustainability it
is necessary to point out possible contradictions. One university facilities engineer was concerned

321 | Part 5.5. Sustainability, LEED, and Conservation: Business Instructional Facility
about the wisdom of the photovoltaic array. He believes the number of roof penetrations and the
likelihood of needing to replace the roof will far exceed the value of the array's energy savings.

Figure 5.5.4. Building section through the Business Instructional Facility atrium. The summer sun is shaded from
the building by the large overhang. This reduces cooling costs. The winter sunlight is allowed to penetrate deeply
into the space. Using the natural sunlight in the winter for passive solar heat gain lowers the amount of energy
the building needs to receive from Abbott Power Plant. Read long description of figure.

Above the southwest entry vestibule is a green roof, also visible from the courtyard (there was
once a roof garden above part of the third floor on the east side of BIF that was removed for an
addition). These gardens are equipped with native species plants that are already adapted to the
climate and also promote biodiversity. The purpose of a green roof is threefold. First, the plants
help absorb and slow down rainwater before it is discharged into the stormwater system. This is
an important aspect in cities where most of the soils have been replaced by hard surfaces such as
buildings and asphalt or concrete. Recognizing this, designers are turning to strategies that allow
for more absorption of rainwater into the soil surrounding buildings. This helps deter flooding and

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 322
assists in groundwater recharge, which helps sustain underground aquifers. The second purpose
of a green roof is to help reduce the heat island effect. Plants shade the roof and maintain evapo-
rative cooling during summer months and can assist in insulating. The third feature of a green roof
is that it is an attractive alternative to a large expanse of rubberized roof membrane. Roofs can be
made a visual and sometimes occupiable amenity for a structure's occupants.

                        Figure 5.5.5. Interior view of the Business Instructional Facility atrium from
                        the ground level.

Water management is an important aspect of green buildings. The roof gardens, permeable paving,
and native plantings help with stormwater control. Little irrigation or potable water is used for
BIF's landscaping. On the supply side, BIF uses low-volume showerheads, toilets, and faucets to
reduce water consumption. These fixtures reduce the amount of potable water used and thus
reduce the load on the Mahomet Aquifer, which supplies Urbana-Champaign.
When choosing building materials there are important considerations to be made. Long-term
resiliency is a university tradition. It is understood that the university builds structures to last
100 years and beyond. As a result, the choice of durable materials is an important one. Moving
through BIF one is confronted with a limited palette of materials specifically chosen to help create
a healthy, long-lasting environment. For example, BIF's zinc roof is employed to reflect heat away
from the building to lower cooling costs and it is expected to last 100 years or more.

   All materials require energy to extract, transport, manufacture, and install. Later these materials
   may need to be disassembled or deconstructed or they decompose. This total life cycle is referred
   to as the embedded energy (also referred to as embodied energy) of the material. Materials such
   as nonrecycled aluminum take a large amount of energy to extract, produce, and transport, which
   leads to a high embedded energy rating. In contrast, concrete produced nearby has a relatively low
   embedded energy rating. Choosing materials that balance their embedded energy and durability
   is essential to creating a more sustainable environment.

                        Figure 5.5.8. View of the Auditorium solar array and green roof.

   Some building materials may also have unhealthy characteristics. Volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs) can be found in caulks, adhesives, and paints. These VOCs are harmful to work and live
   with as they negatively impact air quality. Some materials can emit VOCs for years. Other mate-
   rials that may cause problems contain formaldehyde, such as some plywood and carpeting. The
   BIF has carbon dioxide monitoring to help sustain long-term occupant comfort and health. The

                                                                                                                       10

   building uses high-performance, low-VOC insulation. BIF scored high for its indoor environmen-
   tal quality because of the careful selection of nontoxic substances and this monitoring.
   BIF attracts students to its atrium for meetings, studying, and snacks. It has become a hub of activ-

ity to gather and exchange ideas. The building's success is that it has created a place people enjoy
and want to come to while helping to lower the university's carbon footprint through carefully
designed and executed construction.

Epilogue

          In a time when a new formalism represents the avant-garde, we, like Nathan Ricker, look
          beyond current fashion, striving to leverage technical virtuosity in the service of perfor-

                                                                                                                                             1

          mative design, aesthetic expression, and service to society.

  These walks have been designed to provide insight into why the built world looks the way it does.
  The goal of exposing the reader to contextual influences--historical, political, economic, tech-
  nological, and legal--that manifest themselves in how humans create structures and adapt their
  world to fit the situations of their time is at the heart of these pages.

  Though limited to the local context, many of these concepts translate to other places. Some of
  the influences are demographically derived. Most are determined by aesthetics--the tastes of the
  time and location. These continue to change as the university and its surrounding communities
  become more and more international in nature, with an increasingly diverse faculty and student
  body. When the university began as the Illinois Industrial University it had only a handful of build-
  ings--all of which are gone. The shift from freestanding buildings in a landscape garden or agricul-
  tural setting to enclosed quadrangles set into the urban grid of two adjacent cities has taken less
  than 150 years and continues to be altered to suit the needs of the present. As the university has
  grown, it has shifted from an institution focused on educating the peoples of Illinois in agriculture
  and industry to a leading global research 1 institution serving both the citizens of Illinois and the
  people of the world. The university, true to the nature of a top academic research institution, now

                                                                                      2

  features sixteen major academic units.

  Functional needs today have dramatically changed since the first classes were held in 1868.
  Greater control of interior environments has become a necessity. Teaching methods, technolo-
  gies, research facilities, and services have had to keep pace with the ever-changing world. Labora-
  tories, lecture halls, classrooms, and offices, and the infrastructure needed to support them, have
  all been adapted for the digital world of the twenty-first century.

  Structural innovations and changes in construction have long been incorporated into the univer-
  sity's built environment and surroundings. For example, new cladding techniques continue to be

explored, particularly to bring contemporary buildings into harmony with existing structures and
create a holistic environment without stifling innovation and appearing regressive.
Underlying all these shifts lies a single hope: That the designs created today are leading to a better
environment. This approach to design can result in a nonstatic, ever-changing world that will
adapt, adjust, and keep pace with the needs of its populace for their time. That is the nature of
design: to create something for the present, based on the lessons of the past, that will be found
valuable in the future.

Glossary

Aedicule

A small temple, room, or structure used as a shrine or a niche for a statue in ancient Roman
architecture. This became translated to mean an opening such as a door or a window, framed
by columns on either side, and a pediment above. In classical architecture a window or door-
way was celebrated as an opening in a wall with such a column and pediment treatment.
In contemporary architecture an aedicule can mark/celebrate a special location such as the
crossing of two circulation zones.

Aggregate

The inert material (sand, rocks, gravel, rubble, parts of broken sculptures, etc.) that is bound
together with lime mortar and cement to form concrete. Romans often used old pottery
shards, rocks and brick fragments along with sand as their aggregate. Today rocks and sand
form the bulk of aggregate used in the Midwestern United States.

Arcuated

Arched construction. This construction technology normally uses arches to play a structural
role, but that is not a rule.

Axis

A central or pivotal structure, typically a line, about which a composition is arranged.

Axis Mundi

Also referred to as a world axis: a line or stem through the earth's center connecting its sur-
face to the underworld and the heavens and around which the universe revolves.

Beam

A rigid member or structure supported at each end, subject to bending stresses from a     direc-
tion perpendicular to its length.

Bending

A force that tends to cause a member to deform (bend). In architectiure bending forces are
usually attributed to gravity loads which cause mambers to deflect (change their original

329 | Glossary
      form). A bending moment is the reaction induced in a structural element when an exter-
      nal force is applied to the element causing the element to bend. The most common or simplest
      structural element subjected to bending is the beam.

Buckling

      A deformation which occurs in a member when forces are applied axially to its ends. A column
      may deflect and buckle if the load applied to it is greater than its capacity to resist the force(s).

Buttress

      An exterior masonry structure that opposes the lateral thrust of an arch or a vault (abutment).
      When the buttress disengages from the adjacent pier it is called a flying buttress.

Centering

      A wooden framework on which an arch or dome is supported until the keystone in an the arch
      or the oculus in a dome is in place. Once the keystone (the top voussoir) is placed the center-
      ing can be removed and the compressive weight of the stones will hold the arcuated compo-
      nent in place.

Column

      A rigid, relatively slender, upright support. An engaged column is a column which is partially
      embedded in a wall.

Composite

      Made up of various parts or elements. A Composite Structure uses combinations of arcuated,
      trabeated and/or tensile systems to create a built structure.

Compression

      A force that pushes inward on a mass.

Concrete

      Mixture of lime + water + aggregate + cement. Cement is not concrete. Cement is a binding
      agent in concrete.

Concrete Masonry Unit (CMU)

      A prefabricated concrete member, much like a brick, which is used in construction. CMU can
      be be used as a load bearing element or to fill in between structure.

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 330
Dome

      A hemispherical vault (arch rotated 360 degrees on its vertical axis).
Elevations

      The outer vertical surfaces of a structure. The idea is that the plan is `elevated' into the third
      dimension in order to give spatial closure.
Façade

      The `face' of a building, especially the principal front that looks onto a street or open space.
Figure/Ground

      Relating to or denoting the perception of images by the distinction of objects from a back-
      ground from which they appear to stand out, especially in contexts where this distinction is
      ambiguous. This principle of allows viewers to determine and give preference to one figure (or
      set of figures) over another. There exists a drawing type referred to as a Figure/Ground.
Flange

      The top and bottom chord of a beam. This upper and lower portion of a beam or truss is used
      to resist bending.
Girder

      A large beam for supporting a structure. A girder typically carries point loads- that is loads
      which are not evenly distributed across the entire member.
Hierarchy

      A system of prioritization or ranking of things in order of one over another.
Keystone

      The wedge-shaped stone at the apex of an arch or vault. It locks all the stones into position
      and allows the arch to be self-supporting. It could look like the other voussoirs or be highly
      decorative.
Loggia

      A gallery or room with one or more open sides, especially one that forms part of a structure
      that has one side facing onto an open space such as a garden or plaza.

331 | Glossary
Oculus (plural occuli)

      In architecture it refers to the round central opening of a dome or a small round window (such
      as in a church).
Ompholos

      Greek word meaning `navel', the term can be used to describe: a religious stone which may
      provide a direct connection with the gods; the `center of the world' often believed in ancient
      Greece to be at Delphi; the symbolic navel of the world which then allows for the ordering
      of all else. Example-or a University of Illinois graduate the Main Quad could be seen as the
      ompholos.
Orders

      The primary column systems used in Classical Architecture. These columns have proportions
      and attributes which make them distinct. The Orders are: Doric, Ionic and Corinthian (typ-
      ically attributed top the Greeks) and Composite and Tuscan (typically attributed to the
      Romans). The Composite is a combination of the Ionic and Corinthian Orders.
Parti

      The basic idea or organizational strategy of a design.
Pilasters

      A shallow rectangular feature projecting from a wall, having a capital and base and usually imi-
      tating the form of a column.
Poché

      Noun- that which gives shape, for example, the walls that give shape to a hallway; Verb- to fill
      in the area between walls and spaces.
Proportion

      The relationship of one thing to another in terms of quantity, size, or number; ratio.
Quoin

      Rectangular stone set at the outside corners of walls. The effect is to strengthen the ends and
      make a neater line. During the Renaissance, quoins are sometimes purely decorative.

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 332
Revetment

      (French for "recover") In architecture it refers to a covering (stucco, marble, etc.) over a less
      attractive construction (such as brick or concrete). The Romans often covered their important
      structures, such as the Pantheon and the Colosseum in marble and/or stucco.
Rhythm

      A particular pattern formed by regularly recurring elements.
Shearing forces

      Unaligned forces pushing one part of a body in one specific direction, and another part of the
      body in the opposite direction. A scissors, sometimes called a shear, uses this principle. Shear
      forces can cause a member to fail where the forces pass by one another.
Span

      The distance between supports.
Spring Line

      The point where the arch begins to rise from a support (column, pier, foundation, impost
      block, etc.). The Spring Line is where the arch has horizontal as well as vertical components.
Tensile

      Relating to tension; capable of being stretched out. A tensile structure relies on members
      being in tension, such as a rope bridge.
Tension

      A force that tends to stretch a mass.
Thrust

      The outward force exerted by an arch or vault that must be counterbalanced by a buttress,
      pier or wall in order to resist movement.
Trabeated

      Post and lintel construction. This construction technology system refers to the use of hori-
      zontal beams or lintels which are borne up by columns or posts. The name is from the Latin
      trabs for beam.

333 | Glossary
Vault
      A masonry roof or ceiling constructed on the arch principle (extruded arch).

Voussoir
      A wedge-shaped stone used in building an arch, vault or dome.

Web
      The area of a beam or truss which resists shear forces. The web typically is used to separate
      the beam flanges so as to allow the beam to resist bending.

Wythe
      A continuous vertical section of masonry one unit in thickness. A wythe can be independent
      (as in a veneer) or interlocked with other wythes to form a thicker wall.

                                                                                                                                                             Kevin J. Hinders | 334
