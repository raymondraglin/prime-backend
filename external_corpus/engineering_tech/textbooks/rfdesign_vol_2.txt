Preface

The book series Microwave and RF Design is a comprehensive treatment
of radio frequency (RF) and microwave design with a modern "systems-
first" approach. A strong emphasis on design permeates the series with
extensive case studies and design examples. Design is oriented towards
cellular communications and microstrip design so that lessons learned can
be applied to real-world design tasks. The books in the Microwave and RF
Design series are:

     Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems, Volume 1
     Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines, Volume 2
     Microwave and RF Design: Networks, Volume 3
     Microwave and RF Design: Modules, Volume 4
     Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators, Volume 5

The length and format of each is suitable for automatic printing and binding.

Rationale

The central philosophy behind this series's popular approach is that the
student or practicing engineer will develop a full appreciation for RF and
microwave engineering and gain the practical skills to perform system-
level design decisions. Now more than ever companies need engineers with
an ingrained appreciation of systems and armed with the skills to make
system decisions. One of the greatest challenges facing RF and microwave
engineering is the increasing level of abstraction needed to create innovative
microwave and RF systems. This book series is organized in such a way that
the reader comes to understand the impact that system-level decisions have
on component and subsystem design. At the same time, the capabilities of
technologies, components, and subsystems impact system design. The book
series is meticulously crafted to intertwine these themes.

Audience

The book series was originally developed for three courses at North
Carolina State University. One is a final-year undergraduate class, another an
introductory graduate class, and the third an advanced graduate class. Books
in the series are used as supplementary texts in two other classes. There
are extensive case studies, examples, and end of chapter problems ranging
from straight-forward to in-depth problems requiring hours to solve. A
companion book, Fundamentals of Microwave and RF Design, is more suitable
for an undergraduate class yet there is a direct linkage between the material
in this book and the series which can then be used as a career-long reference
text. I believe it is completely understandable for senior-level students
where a microwave/RF engineering course is offered. The book series is a
comprehensive RF and microwave text and reference, with detailed index,
appendices, and cross-references throughout. Practicing engineers will find
the book series a valuable systems primer, a refresher as needed, and a
vi  PREFACE

    reference tool in the field. Additionally, it can serve as a valuable, accessible
    resource for those outside RF circuit engineering who need to understand
    how they can work with RF hardware engineers.

    Organization
       This book is a volume in a five volume series on RF and microwave

    design. The first volume in the series, Microwave and RF Design: Radio
    Systems, addresses radio systems mainly following the evolution of cellular
    radio. A central aspect of microwave engineering is distributed effects
    considered in the second volume of this book series, Microwave and RF
    Design: Transmission Lines. Here transmission lines are treated as supporting
    forward- and backward-traveling voltage and current waves and these
    are related to electromagnetic effects. The third volume, Microwave and RF
    Design: Networks, covers microwave network theory which is the theory
    that describes power flow and can be used with transmission line effects.
    Topics covered in Microwave and RF Design: Modules, focus on designing
    microwave circuits and systems using modules introducing a large number
    of different modules. Modules is just another term for a network but the
    implication is that is is packaged and often available off-the-shelf. Other
    topics that are important in system design using modules are considered
    including noise, distortion, and dynamic range. Most microwave and RF
    designers construct systems using modules developed by other engineers
    who specialize in developing the modules. Examples are filter and amplifier
    modules which once designed can be used in many different systems. Much
    of microwave design is about maximizing dynamic range, minimizing noise,
    and minimizing DC power consumption. The fifth volume in this series,
    Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators, considers amplifier and
    oscillator design and develops the skills required to develop modules.

    Volume 1: Microwave and RF Design: Radio Systems

    The first book of the series covers RF systems. It describes system concepts
    and provides comprehensive knowledge of RF and microwave systems.
    The emphasis is on understanding how systems are crafted from many
    different technologies and concepts. The reader gains valuable insight into
    how different technologies can be traded off in meeting system requirements.
    I do not believe this systems presentation is available anywhere else in such
    a compact form.

    Volume 2: Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines

    This book begins with a chapter on transmission line theory and introduces
    the concepts of forward- and backward-traveling waves. Many examples are
    included of advanced techniques for analyzing and designing transmission
    line networks. This is followed by a chapter on planar transmission lines
    with microstrip lines primarily used in design examples. Design examples
    illustrate some of the less quantifiable design decisions that must be made.
    The next chapter describes frequency-dependent transmission line effects
    and describes the design choices that must be taken to avoid multimoding.
    The final chapter in this volume addresses coupled-lines. It is shown how to
    design coupled-line networks that exploit this distributed effect to realize
    novel circuit functionality and how to design networks that minimize
    negative effects. The modern treatment of transmission lines in this volume
    emphasizes planar circuit design and the practical aspects of designing
PREFACE                                                                          vii

around unwanted effects. Detailed design of a directional coupler is used
to illustrate the use of coupled lines. Network equivalents of coupled lines
are introduced as fundamental building blocks that are used later in the
synthesis of coupled-line filters. The text, examples, and problems introduce
the often hidden design requirements of designing to mitigate parasitic
effects and unwanted modes of operation.

Volume 3: Microwave and RF Design: Networks

Volume 3 focuses on microwave networks with descriptions based on S
parameters and ABCD matrices, and the representation of reflection and
transmission information on polar plots called Smith charts. Microwave
measurement and calibration technology are examined. A sampling of
the wide variety of microwave elements based on transmission lines is
presented. It is shown how many of these have lumped-element equivalents
and how lumped elements and transmission lines can be combined as a
compromise between the high performance of transmission line structures
and the compactness of lumped elements. This volume concludes with an
in-depth treatment of matching for maximum power transfer. Both lumped-
element and distributed-element matching are presented.

Volume 4: Microwave and RF Design: Modules

Volume 4 focuses on the design of systems based on microwave modules.
The book considers the wide variety of RF modules including amplifiers,
local oscillators, switches, circulators, isolators, phase detectors, frequency
multipliers and dividers, phase-locked loops, and direct digital synthesizers.
The use of modules has become increasingly important in RF and microwave
engineering. A wide variety of passive and active modules are available
and high-performance systems can be realized cost effectively and with
stellar performance by using off-the-shelf modules interconnected using
planar transmission lines. Module vendors are encouraged by the market
to develop competitive modules that can be used in a wide variety of
applications. The great majority of RF and microwave engineers either
develop modules or use modules to realize RF systems. Systems must also
be concerned with noise and distortion, including distortion that originates
in supposedly linear elements. Something as simple as a termination
can produce distortion called passive intermodulation distortion. Design
techniques are presented for designing cascaded systems while managing
noise and distortion. Filters are also modules and general filter theory is
covered and the design of parallel coupled line filters is presented in detail.
Filter design is presented as a mixture of art and science. This mix, and the
thought processes involved, are emphasized through the design of a filter
integrated throughout this chapter.

Volume 5: Microwave and RF Design: Amplifiers and Oscillators

The fifth volume presents the design of amplifiers and oscillators in
a way that enables state-of-the-art designs to be developed. Detailed
strategies for amplifiers and voltage-controlled oscillators are presented.
Design of competitive microwave amplifiers and oscillators are particularly
challenging as many trade-offs are required in design, and the design
decisions cannot be reduced to a formulaic flow. Very detailed case studies
are presented and while some may seem quite complicated, they parallel the
level of sophistication required to develop competitive designs.

      Case Studies

      A key feature of this book series is the use of real world case studies
      of leading edge designs. Some of the case studies are designs done in
      my research group to demonstrate design techniques resulting in leading
      performance. The case studies and the persons responsible for helping to
      develop them are as follows.

         1. Software defined radio transmitter.
         2. High dynamic range down converter design. This case study was

             developed with Alan Victor.
         3. Design of a third-order Chebyshev combline filter. This case study was

             developed with Wael Fathelbab.
         4. Design of a bandstop filter. This case study was developed with Wael

             Fathelbab.
         5. Tunable Resonator with a varactor diode stack. This case study was

             developed with Alan Victor.
         6. Analysis of a 15 GHz Receiver. This case study was developed with

             Alan Victor.
         7. Transceiver Architecture. This case study was developed with Alan

             Victor.
         8. Narrowband linear amplifier design. This case study was developed

             with Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
         9. Wideband Amplifier Design. This case study was developed with Dane

             Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
        10. Distributed biasing of differential amplifiers. This case study was

             developed with Wael Fathelbab.
        11. Analysis of a distributed amplifier. This case study was developed with

             Ratan Bhatia, Jason Gerber, Tony Kwan, and Rowan Gilmore.
        12. Design of a WiMAX power amplifier. This case study was developed

             with Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
        13. Reflection oscillator. This case study was developed with Dane Collins

             and National Instruments Corporation.
        14. Design of a C-Band VCO. This case study was developed with Alan

             Victor.
        15. Oscillator phase noise analysis. This case study was developed with

             Dane Collins and National Instruments Corporation.
         Many of these case studies are available as captioned YouTube videos and
      qualified instructors can request higher resolution videos from the author.

      Course Structures

      Based on the adoption of the first and second editions at universities,
      several different university courses have been developed using various parts
      of what was originally one very large book. The book supports teaching
      two or three classes with courses varying by the selection of volumes
      and chapters. A standard microwave class following the format of earlier
      microwave texts can be taught using the second and third volumes. Such
      a course will benefit from the strong practical design flavor and modern
      treatment of measurement technology, Smith charts, and matching networks.
      Transmission line propagation and design is presented in the context of
      microstrip technology providing an immediately useful skill. The subtleties
      of multimoding are also presented in the context of microstrip lines. In such
PREFACE                                                                            ix

a class the first volume on microwave systems can be assigned for self-
learning.

   Another approach is to teach a course that focuses on transmission line
effects including parallel coupled-line filters and module design. Such a class
would focus on Volumes 2, 3 and 4. A filter design course would focus
on using Volume 4 on module design. A course on amplifier and oscillator
design would use Volume 5. This course is supported by a large number of
case studies that present design concepts that would otherwise be difficult to
put into the flow of the textbook.

   Another option suited to an undergraduate or introductory graduate class
is to teach a class that enables engineers to develop RF and microwave
systems. This class uses portions of Volumes 2, 3 and 4. This class then omits
detailed filter, amplifier, and oscillator design.

   The fundamental philosophy behind the book series is that the broader
impact of the material should be presented first. Systems should be discussed
up front and not left as an afterthought for the final chapter of a textbook, the
last lecture of the semester, or the last course of a curriculum.

   The book series is written so that all electrical engineers can gain an
appreciation of RF and microwave hardware engineering. The body of the
text can be covered without strong reliance on this electromagnetic theory,
but it is there for those who desire it for teaching or reader review. The book
is rich with detailed information and also serves as a technical reference.

The Systems Engineer

Systems are developed beginning with fuzzy requirements for components
and subsystems. Just as system requirements provide impetus to develop
new base technologies, the development of new technologies provides new
capabilities that drive innovation and new systems. The new capabilities
may arise from developments made in support of other systems. Sometimes
serendipity leads to the new capabilities. Creating innovative microwave
and RF systems that address market needs or provide for new opportunities
is the most exciting challenge in RF design. The engineers who can
conceptualize and architect new RF systems are in great demand. This book
began as an effort to train RF systems engineers and as an RF systems
resource for practicing engineers. Many RF systems engineers began their
careers when systems were simple. Today, appreciating a system requires
higher levels of abstraction than in the past, but it also requires detailed
knowledge or the ability to access detailed knowledge and expertise. So what
makes a systems engineer? There is not a simple answer, but many partial
answers. We know that system engineers have great technical confidence and
broad appreciation for technologies. They are both broad in their knowledge
of a large swath of technologies and also deep in knowledge of a few
areas, sometimes called the "T" model. One book or course will not make
a systems engineer. It is clear that there must be a diverse set of experiences.
This book series fulfills the role of fostering both high-level abstraction of
RF engineering and also detailed design skills to realize effective RF and
microwave modules. My hope is that this book will provide the necessary
background for the next generation of RF systems engineers by stressing
system principles immediately, followed by core RF technologies. Core
technologies are thereby covered within the context of the systems in which
they are used.

1.1 Introduction

The universe has a speed limit, the finite speed of causality or c, the speed
of light, which is embodied in Maxwell's equations and in the special
theory of relativity. The result of this is that a cause, say a voltage, in one
part of a circuit produces an effect, say a current, in another part of the
circuit after a delay. When using circuits at low frequencies the impact of
this delay is insignificant as the effect occurs long before there is even the
slightest discernible change in the cause. However the delay is important at
microwave and higher frequencies. Electromagnetic (EM) radiation travels
30 cm in a nanosecond in free space. Thus a circuit operating at 1 GHz that
is 1 cm across will just see an appreciable affect due to the finite speed of the
EM signal which, of course, is how the voltage and current "communicate."
The impact will be more significant at higher frequencies and if the EM signal
travels in a dielectric as a dielectric reduces the speed of light.

   A microwave engineer must design circuits to manage this finite delay, but
what is particularly interesting is that the effect gives rise to an enormous
number of useful circuit elements that have no analog at lower frequencies.
Whole circuits, and quite complex circuits at that, can be designed by
exploiting distributed effects. This book explores the design of circuits
with transmission lines and introduces effects, such as coupling from one
2  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

   transmission line to another, that can be exploited to build novel circuits.
      This book is the second volume in a series on microwave and RF design.

   The first volume in the series addresses radio systems [1] mainly following
   the evolution of cellular radio. The third volume [2] covers microwave
   network theory which is the theory that describe power flow and can be
   used to describe transmission line effects. Topics covered in this volume
   include scattering parameters, Smith charts, and matching networks that
   enable maximum power transfer. The fourth volume [3] focuses on designing
   microwave circuits and systems using modules introducing a large number
   of different modules. Modules is just another term for a network but the
   implication is that is packaged and often available off-the-shelf. Other topics
   in this chapter that are important in system design using modules are
   considered including noise, distortion, and dynamic range. Most microwave
   and RF designers construct systems using modules developed by other
   engineers who specialize in developing the modules. Examples are filter
   and amplifier chip modules which once designed can be used in many
   different systems. Much of microwave design is about maximizing dynamic
   range, minimizing noise, and minimizing DC power consumption. The
   fifth volume in this series [4] considers amplifier and oscillator design and
   develops the skills required to develop modules.

      The books in the Microwave and RF Design series are:

   1.2 Book Outline

   The telegraphist's equations, used to analyze transmission lines, and their
   interpretations are presented in Chapter 2 where transmission line theory
   is presented. This leads to the analysis of terminated transmission lines with
   key results being how these can be used as circuit elements to realize narrow-
   band inductors and capacitors. The chapter concludes by developing circuit
   models of transmission lines that are suitable for use in circuit simulators
   and in designing circuits using transmission lines.

      Chapters 2-6 describe transmission lines and the exploitation of
   transmission effects that are used in RF and microwave engineering. One
   of the aspects that distinguishes design at a few tens of megahertz and
   below from design above a few megahertz up to a terahertz is that at low
   frequencies design proceeds with the assumption that circuit elements and
   indeed whole circuits exist at a point and there is no time-of-flight, e.g.
   speed-of-light, limitation to a voltage and current at one point in a circuit
   instantaneously impacting the voltage and current anywhere else in the
   circuit. As the frequency of operation of a circuit increases, the effect of the
   finite speed of light becomes significant and distributed effects often need to
   be considered.

      Chapter 3 focuses on a class of transmission lines called planar lines which
   are lines usually fabricated starting with a low loss dielectric substrate with
   metal sheets on both sides. The most important planar transmission line
   is the microstrip line shown in Figure 1-1. This is the most widely used
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                                           3

                                                              Figure 1-1: Microstrip transmission line.

interconnect at microwave frequencies. The strip of the line is formed by
patterning the top conductor and etching away the unwanted metal. The
defining distinction between a microstrip line, and any planar transmission
line, and a trace on a printed circuit board is that at microwave frequencies
attention must be given to providing a signal return path and maintaining
as uniform an environment as possible for the electric and magnetic fields.
Any discontinuity will introduce reflections of EM energy. This may actually
be desired when implementing circuit elements but if not it is important that
geometrical uniformity be maintained. Considering the microstrip line, see
Figure 1-1, the width, w, of the strip and the thickness, h, of the substrate
define the ratio of the voltage and current signals traveling along the
microstrip line. This ratio is called the characteristic impedance of the line
and it is critical for reliable signal transmission, i.e., good signal integrity,
that the cross-sectional geometry be the same along the line as then the
characteristic impedance of the line is constant.

   While simple in concept, planar transmission lines needed to be invented.
As well as conceptualizing a transmission line that can be realized by etching
a planar metallic conductor on the printed circuit board, it is essential to
provide the analytic tools that enable the propagation characteristics of the
line to be calculated and enable structures such as couplers and filters to be
synthesized using planar transmission lines. The origins of microstrip trace
back to developments in the early 1940s, beginning with a coaxial line with
a flat center conductor forming a rectangular coaxial line [5]. At that time
printed circuit boards were being used for low-frequency circuits. In 1949
these came together when Barrett reasoned that the thick center conductor of
the rectangular coaxial transmission line could be very thin with little effect
on the properties of the line. This then meant that low-frequency printed
circuit board techniques could be employed in microwave circuits and the
transmission line system became known as stripline [5, 6].

   The conceptual evolution of stripline is shown in Figure 1-2. The stripline
configuration is developed by sandwiching a metallic strip between two
metal-clad dielectric sheets. As initially envisioned, the strip could be
stamped out or silk-screened using silver ink. Today it is most common
to begin with a continuous metallic sheet bonded to one or both sides
of a dielectric sheet. A pattern of an etch resistant material is then
photolithographically defined on the sheet and the strip pattern appears
after etching. The next advance in 1952 when Grieg and Engelmann removed
one of stripline's ground planes thus becoming microstrip [7]. With an
invention it is not sufficient to simply describe a structure, in this case
understanding had to be provided as evidenced by presenting design
equations for the electrical properties of the line. The essential electrical
properties of a transmission line are its characteristic impedance, the ratio
of the traveling voltage and current waves on the line, and its propagation
constant, which relates to the speed of propagation of the voltage and current
4  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

                            Planar lines are not ideal transmission lines and undesired effects must

                         be anticipated and design adjusted to reduce their occurrence or impact.
                         These extraordinary effects are considered in Chapter 4. Understanding and
                         anticipating these effects is really where the art of microwave design comes
                         into play. Many of the effects occur when dimensions are too large but at
                         the same time manufacturability improves when dimensions are large, so
                         a design trade-off is required. Rarely is a design successful on the first pass.
                         Thus it is important for a microwave engineer to interpret undesirable results
                         and know what to modify in a design. It is difficult to do measurements
                         at microwave frequencies as anything that is introduced in a measurement,
                         e.g. a probe, will have significant impact on a circuit. Often a few indirect
                         measurements, some analysis, and great intuition is required to correctly
                         identify and hence resolve design issues.

                            Chapter 4 begins by considering frequency-dependent characteristics of
                         planar lines and then moves on to developing analysis equations and
                         design concepts for microstrip lines at high frequencies. As the transverse
                         dimensions of a planar line approach a wavelength, say greater than a tenth
                         of a wavelength, it is possible for the EM signal to travel down the line in
                         two (or more field) orientations called modes and these travel at different
                         velocities and corrupt a signal. Multimoding is nearly always undesirable
                         so understanding the origins of multiple modes and designing to avoid
                         multiple modes is an important consideration. However in some situations
                         these modes is exploited, e.g. in realizing a small area inductor on an RFIC.

                            When two planar lines are close to each other the fields of one line can
                         be in the vicinity of the other line and the lines are coupled. A portion of
                         the energy of a signal traveling on one of the lines can appear on the other
                         line. Many circuit elements can be developed by exploiting parallel coupled
                         lines (PCLs). Chapter 5 begins by presenting the physics of coupling and
                         then a generalization of the telegraphist's equations for coupled transmission
                         lines. Design approaches and circuit models are developed and the circuit
                         models enable the synthesis of microwave designs using parallel coupled
                         lines Several PCL circuit elements are presented but many more will be
                         described in other volumes of this book series.

                            The final chapter of this volume, Chapter 6, discusses rectangular
                         waveguides. Instead of `rectangular waveguide' just the term `waveguide'
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                     5

is usually used with the understanding that reference is being made
to a rectangular waveguide. This is a little confusing because really all
transmission lines guide waves and so are waveguides. A rectangular
waveguide is a very different type of transmission line that confines the EM
fields inside a rectangular metal pipe. These are important elements starting
at low microwave frequencies, 1 GHz and above, as they can carry very
powerful signals with very little loss. They are almost always used in radar
and similar high power applications. Waveguides are also very important
at higher frequencies even when power levels are relatively low. They are
often used at 15 GHz and above as they have very little loss while the loss
of coaxial lines grows tremendously with frequency. With waveguides it is
very difficult to use voltage and current concepts except over very narrow
fractional bandwidths, a few percent at most. This means that it is very
difficult to do circuit design using waveguides.

1.3 Chapter Outline

The chapter begins by considering distributed circuits in Section 1.4 and
identifying the types of structures to be considered in this book. Then
Section 1.5 revisits Maxwell's equations from a perspective different from
the way it was (almost certainly) introduced to the reader. It is assumed
that the reader has a knowledge of Maxwell's equations which are nearly
always introduced following a treatment of the static field laws: Biot-Savart
law, Ampere's circuital law, Gauss's law, Gauss's law for magnetism, and
Faraday's law. The classic treatment follows the historical time line and
then Maxwell's equations are introduced. It was almost as though Maxwell's
equations were derived from the static field laws but that was never stated
because they were not. Maxwell's equations represent a separate physical
insight. Maxwell's equations cannot be derived from the static field laws,
however the static field laws can be derived from Maxwell's equations.
Maxwell had remarkable insight and interpreted the physical world in an
amazing way and this places him among the greatest physicists of all time.
He touched on relativity and quantum field theory in imagining that the
electric and magnetic fields, and light, formed a two-component field where
the spatial derivative of one component was related to the time derivative of
the other. He imagined that this relationship imposed a cosmic speed limit.
The components of Maxwell's field are the electric and magnetic fields but
the insight was much more fundamental than that.

   The next section, Section 1.6, demonstrates that all of the early static field
laws can be derived from Maxwell's equation. Maxwell unified what seemed
to be a number of unconnected observations but at the time many suspected
that there was an underlying reality. The next few sections derive some
important short-hand techniques that are useful in working with distributed
circuits and in particular transmission lines. Section 1.7 describes how the
EM fields interact with lossless materials. It is no secret that Maxwell's
equations are fiendishly difficult to work with unless great simplifications
are made. While tremendous computational EM analysis tools are available
the design engineer needs insight. One of the critical pieces of insight that
guides microwave engineers is to imagine a magnetic wall analogous to
a conductor which is an electric wall. A magnetic wall is approximated at
the interface of two dielectrics. The concepts of electric and magnetic walls
6  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

   analyzed in Section 1.8 provide an insight that is particularly useful to the
   microwave engineer is developed. These results will be used throughout
   the chapters in this book. Actual dielectrics and conductors are lossy so
   the effect of loss is considered in Section 1.9. Examples of how insight
   and fortuitous use of geometry, symmetries, and physical insight can be
   used in EM calculations are given in Section 1.9. Generally only particular
   structures with the requisite symmetries and simple geometry are used in
   design because if a structure is too difficult to analyze then the important
   intuitive insight is hard to acquire.

      The final part of this chapter is an appendix on mathematical foundations
   with the required essentials of trigonometric expansions, mathematical
   identities, complex arithmetic, Butterworth and Chebyshev polynomials
   used in matching network and filter design, the properties of circles on
   a complex plane are used in dealing with complex numbers plotted on
   a polar plot, Kron's method used in network condensation and thus in
   simplifying designs, and the mathematics of random processes which are
   used in working with digitally modulated signals and with noise. Everything
   in this appendix is used somewhere in this book series.

   1.4 Distributed Circuits

   RF and microwave engineering has as its basis transmission line effects also
   known as distributed effects. As is well known, the voltage and current
   at one point, A, cannot instantaneously affect the voltage and current at
   another spatially separated point B. However if points A and B in a circuit
   are sufficiently close then a circuit can nearly always be treated as a lumped
   element circuit. What constitutes sufficiently close is related to the distance
   between A and B, d, compared to a wavelength, . If d < /100 then nearly
   always the circuit can be considered as being lumped. If d  /10 then
   distributed effects, limitations imposed by the finite time-of-flight, must be
   considered and the circuit is always regarded as being distributed. When d
   is between /100 and /10 then it is not clear whether the circuit must be
   regarded as distributed or can be regarded as lumped. It is of course much
   simpler to analyze and design with lumped-element circuits.

      Distributed and transmission-line effects are synonymous. While a
   distributed circuit may be difficult to analyze, distributed effects can be
   exploited to realize a very large array of elements that usually have no
   equivalent at lower frequencies. For example, the fields from two adjacent
   transmission lines can overlap so that part of the signal (energy) from one of
   the lines appears on the other. This could be a problem in some situations but
   can be used to couple some of the power from one line onto another. Many
   novel circuit elements are based on this coupling effect.

      Distributed effects and transmission line effects result from a signal,
   voltage or current, at one point in space not being able to instantaneously
   change the voltage and current at another point in space. To be more
   physical, voltage and current can be replaced by electric and magnetic field.
   The finite speed of light is encapsulated in Maxwell's equations which
   were developed between 1861 and 1862 [8, 9]. For microwave engineers
   Maxwell's equations are the most convenient and complete description
   of reality. They are the classical limit of a more fundamental theory
   called quantum electrodynamics. Maxwell's equations are important to the
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                   7

physical understanding of transmission line effects and distributed effects,
but in reality are very difficult to manipulate and use in calculations. What
are much more useful are the transmission line equations, or telegrapher's
equations, developed by Heaviside in 1887 [10].

   The telegrapher's equations use voltage and current which are related to
the integral of electric field and integral of magnetic field respectively. The
teleprapher's equations relate the time derivative of voltage (or current)
to the spatial variation of current (or voltage). This is analogous to how
Maxwell's equations relate the electric and magnetic fields. Heaviside also
introduced the concept of phasors with the result that the four dimensions of
Maxwell's equations, time and three spatial dimensions, are reduced to just
one spatial dimension, along the length of a transmission line. Microwave
designers, as with all circuit designers, is that they design based on lumped-
element circuits that are naturally described by voltage and current. What
is particularly important about the telegrapher's equations is that they
enable direct relationship of transmission line circuits to lumped-element
circuits. Never-the-less the telegraphist's equations are not always sufficient
to understand distributed circuits so (sometimes reluctantly) microwave
engineers must have working familiarity with Maxwell's equations to
understand every situation that can be encountered. Putting this another
way, microwave engineers want to express circuit quantities as voltage
and currents rather than electric and magnetic fields but are always aware
that microwave circuits are intricately connected to electric and magnetic
fields and energy is stored in electric and magnetic fields. The telegraphist's
equations provide a link between the voltage/current and EM field worlds
and introduce concepts of traveling wave voltages and currents which
further aid the connection.

1.5 Maxwell's Equations

In this and following sections, EM theory is presented in a form that
aids in the understanding of distributed effects, such as propagation on
transmission lines, coupling of transmission lines, and how transmission line
effects can be used to realize components with unique functionality. While
this is a review of material that most readers have previously learned, it is
presented in a slightly different form than is usual. The treatment begins
with Maxwell's equations and not the static field laws. This is not the way
EM theory is initially presented.

   Maxwell's equations are a remarkable insight and the early field laws
can be derived from them. Most importantly, Maxwell's equations describe
the propagation of an EM field. Maxwell's equations are presented
in point form in Section 1.5.1 and in integral form in Section 1.5.5.
From these, the early electric and magnetic field laws are derived. The
effect of boundary conditions are introduced in Section 1.8 to arrive at
implications for multimoding on transmission lines. Multimoding is almost
always undesirable, and in designing transmission line structures so that
multimoding is avoided, it is necessary to have rules that establish when
multimoding can occur.
8  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

   1.5.1 Point Form of Maxwell's Equations

   The characteristics of EM fields are described by Maxwell's equations:

    E = - B - J칖 (1.1)                 H = D + J (1.3)
             t                              t
    D = V                                  B = mV ,
                (1.2)                                                      (1.4)

   where  is called the permeability of the medium and  is called the permit-
   tivity of the medium. (The left-hand side of Equation (1.1) is read as "curl E"
   and the left-hand side of Equation (1.2) as "div E.") They are the property
   of a medium and describe the ability to store magnetic energy and electric
   energy. The other quantities in Equations (1.1)-(1.4) are

        E, the electric field, with units of volts per meter (V/m), a time-varying
          vector

        D, the electric flux density, with units of coulombs per square meter
          (C/m2)

        H, the three-dimensional magnetic field, with units of amperes per
          meter (A/m)

        B, the magnetic flux density, with units of teslas (T)
        J, the electric current density, with units of amperes per square meter

          (A/m2)
        V , the electric charge density, with units of coulombs per cubic meter

          (C/m3)
        mV , the magnetic charge density, with units of webers per cubic meter

          (Wb/m3)
        J칖 is the magnetic current density, with units of webers per second per

          square meter (Wb  s-1  m-2).
   Magnetic charges do not exist, but their introduction in Maxwell's equations
   through the magnetic charge density, mV , and the magnetic current density,
   J칖, introduce an aesthetically appealing symmetry. Maxwell's equations are
   differential equations, and as with most differential equations, their solution
   is obtained with particular boundary conditions that here are imposed by
   conductors. Electric conductors (i.e., electric walls) support electric charges
   and hence electric current. By analogy, magnetic walls support magnetic
   charges and magnetic currents. Magnetic walls also provide boundary
   conditions to be used in the solution of Maxwell's equations. The notion
   of magnetic walls is important in RF and microwave engineering, as they
   are approximated by the boundary between two dielectrics of different
   permittivity. The greater the difference in permittivity, the more closely the
   boundary approximates a magnetic wall. As a result, the analysis of many
   structures with different dielectrics can be simplified, aiding in intuitive
   understanding.

      The fields in Equations (1.1)-(1.4) are three-dimensional fields, e.g.,

                E = Exx^ + Eyy^ + Ez^z,                                   (1.5)

   where x^, y^, and z^ are the unit vectors (having a magnitude of 1) in the x, y
   and z directions, respectively. Ex, Ey, and Ez are the electric field components
   in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

      The symbols and units used with the various field quantities and some of
   the other symbols to be introduced soon are given in Table 1-1. B and H, and
   D and E are related to each other by the properties of the medium embodied

                B = 킜  (1.6)       D = E.  (1.7)

    The quantity  is called the permeability and describes the ability to store
    magnetic energy in a region. The permeability in free space (or vacuum) is
    denoted 0 and the magnetic flux and magnetic field are related as (where
    0 = 4  10-7 H/m)

                          B = 0H.            (1.8)

    1.5.2 Moments and Polarization

    In this subsection the response of materials to electric and magnetic fields are
    described. In a later section there will be a more specific discussion about the
    interaction of dielectrics and metals to electric fields. The main purpose here
    is to define electric and magnetic polarization vectors.

    Material Response to an Applied Electric Field

    The generation of electric moments is the atomic-level response of a material
    to an applied electric field. With an atom the center of negative charge, the
    center of the electron cloud, and the center of the positive charge, the nu-
    cleus, overlap. When an electric field is applied the centers of positive and
    negative charge separate and electrical energy additional to that stored in
    free space is stored in a manner very similar to potential energy storage in
    a stretched spring. The separation of charge (charge by distance) forms an
    electric dipole which has an electric dipole moment p having the SI units of
    C  m or A  s  m. The same occurs with solids but now the centers of positive
    and negative charge could be separated even without an external electric
    field and the material is said to be polarized. If there are n electric dipole
    moments p per unit volume (in SI per m3), then the polarization density (or
    electric polarization or simply polarization) is

                          P = np.             (1.9)

    which has the SI units of C/m2. P has the same units and has the same effect
    as the electric flux density D. In a homogeneous, linear, isotropic material,
    P is proportional to the applied electric field intensity E. A homogenous
    material has the same average properties everywhere and an isotropic
    material looks the same in all directions. Materials that are not isotropic
    are called anisotropic and most commonly these are crystals that have
    asymmetrical unit cells so that the separation of charge, the electric energy
    stored by this separation of charge (the strength of the spring) in response to
    an applied field depends on direction. As a result

                          P = e0E             (1.10)

    where e is called the electric susceptibility of the material. The electric
    susceptibility has been written as a tensor, a 3  3 matrix that relates the
    three directions of E to the three possible directions of P. For an amorphous
    solid or a crystal with high unit cell symmetry, the nine elements of e are
    the same and so the tensor notation is dropped and e is used as a scalar.

Material Response to an Applied Magnetic Field

All materials contain electrons each having a charge and a spin. The
charges produce an electric field and the spin produces a magnetic field.
The magnetic field produced by an electron is almost that which would
be produced by a mechanically spinning charge, although there is no
actual mechanical rotation. Spin is a quantum mechanical property. Still it
is very hard to avoid using the rotating charge analogy. The spin of an
electron points in a particular direction and in most materials these spins
are randomly arranged and cancel each other out so that there is no net
magnetic effect. Some materials can be magnetized by a large externally
applied magnetic field and the spins are then permanently aligned even
when the external magnetic field is removed. Sometimes the alignment is
established by crystal geometry.

   Consider a magnetic material without permanent magnetization. When a
magnetic field is applied to these materials the electron spin vector tends to
rotate and energy is stored. The ability to store magnetic energy above that
which would be stored in vacuum is described by the concept of relative
permeability.

   The response of a material to an applied magnetic field is not directly
analogous to the response to an applied electric field because of the
fundamental difference in the source of magnetic moments. In most
materials the magnetic moment of one electron is paired with an electron
occupying the same orbital with a magnetic moment in the opposite
direction so that there is no net magnetic moment. In magnetic materials
there are some orbitals that do not have a pair of electrons so that there is
a net magnetic moment. Additional energy is stored when the net magnetic
moments are rotated away from their preferred long-term direction by an
externally applied magnetic field H. This is like storing energy in a spring.
It is as though there is an additional magnetic field called the magnetic
polarization which has a particular density. The net magnetic polarization
density is denoted M which has the SI units of A/m and

M = mH                                        (1.11)

where m is called the magnetic susceptibility of the material and in general
can be a 3  3 matrix. The relative permeability is defined as

탍 = 1 + m.                                     (1.12)

Summary

A vacuum can store electric and magnetic energy. Materials can store
additional energy and the propensity relative to vacuum is described by the
relative permittivity and permeability, respectively, of the material.

1.5.3 Field Intensity and Flux Density

Permeability, , is generally a scalar, but in magnetic materials it can be a 33
matrix called a dyadic tensor with the relative permeability tensor being 탍.
Then

B = 0(H + M )                               (1.13)
12  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    where M is the magnetization of the material. Introducing phasors

        B = 0(H + mH) = 탊탍H                                      (1.14)
                                                                        (1.15)

    Bz     Hz                          탚x 탚y    탚z  Hz

    The direction-dependent property indicated by this dyadic results from

    alignment of electron spins in a material. However, in most materials there

    is no alignment of spins and  = 0. The relative permeability, 탍, refers to

    the ratio of permeability of a material to its value in a vacuum:

                                       탍 =  .                         (1.16)
                                              0

    So 탍 > 1 indicates that a material can store more magnetic energy than can
    a vacuum in a given volume.

       The other material quantity is the permittivity, , which is denoted 0, and
    in a vacuum

                                       D = 0E,                          (1.17)

    where 0 = 8.854  10-12 F톗-1. The relative permittivity, r, refers to the
    ratio of permeability of a material to its value in a vacuum:

                                       r =  .                           (1.18)
                                              0

    So r > 1 indicates that a material can store more electric energy in a volume
    than can be stored in a vacuum. In some calculations it is useful to introduce
    an electric polarization, Pe. Then

               D = E = 0E + Pe,                                         (1.19)

    and so the polarization vector is

           Pe = ( - 0) E = 0eE,                                         (1.20)

    where e is called the electric susceptibility.
       Some materials require a dyadic form of . This usually indicates a

    dependence on crystal symmetry, and the relative movement of charge
    centers in different directions when an E field is applied. Some commonly
    used microwave substrates, such as sapphire, have permittivities that are
    direction dependent rather than having full dyadic permittivity. A material
    in which the permittivity is a function of direction is called an anisotropic
    material or is said to have dielectric anisotropy. In an isotropic material the
    permittivity is the same in all directions; the material has dielectric isotropy.
    Most materials are isotropic.

       Maxwell's original equations were put in the form of Equations (1.1)-
    (1.4) by the mathematician Oliver Heaviside from the less convenient form
    Maxwell originally used. The above equations are called the point form of
    Maxwell's equations, relating the field components to each other and to
    charge and current density at a point.
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                     13

   Maxwell's equations have three types of derivatives. First, there is the
time derivative, /t. Then there are two spatial derivatives: , called
curl, capturing the way a field circulates spatially (or the amount that it
curls up on itself); and , called the div operator, describing the spreading
out of a field (i.e., its divergence). Curl and div have different forms in
different coordinate systems, and in the rectangular system can be expanded
as (A = Axx^ + Ayy^ + Az^z)

 A = Az - Ay x^ + Ax - Az y^ + Ay - Ax z^ (1.21)
y z  z x                      x y

and  A = Ax + Ay + Az .                        (1.22)
                       x y z

Curl and div in cylindrical and spherical coordinates are given in Equations
(1.134), (1.135), (1.143), and (1.144). Studying Equation (1.21) you will see
that curl, , describes how much a field circles around the x, y, and z axes.
That is, the curl describes how a field circulates on itself. So Equation (1.1)
relates the amount an electric field circulates on itself to changes of the B
field in time (and modified by the magnetic current). So a spatial derivative
of electric fields is related to a time derivative of the magnetic field. Also in
Equation (1.3), the spatial derivative of the magnetic field is related to the
time derivative of the electric field (and modified by the electric current).
These are the key elements that result in self-sustaining propagation.

   Div, , describes how a field spreads out from a point. So the presence
of net electric charge (say, on a conductor) will result in the electric field
spreading out from a point (see Equation (1.2)). The magnetic field (Equation
(1.4)) can never diverge from a point, which is a result of magnetic charges
not existing. A magnetic wall approximation describes an open circuit and
then effectively magnetic charges terminate the magnetic field. What actually
happens in free space or on a transmission line depends on boundary
conditions, and in the case of transmission lines, the dimensions involved.

   How fast a field varies with time, B/t and D/t, depends on frequency.
The more interesting property is how fast a field can change spatially,  E
and  H--this depends on wavelength relative to geometry. So if the cross-
sectional dimensions of a transmission line are much less than a wavelength
(say, less than /4), then it will be impossible for the fields to curl up on
themselves and so there will be only one or, in some cases, no solutions to
Maxwell's equations.

    EXAMPLE 1.1 Energy Storage

          Consider a material with a relative permittivity of 65 and a relative permeability of 1000.
          There is a static electric field E of 1 kV/m. How much energy is stored in the E field in a
          10 cm3 volume of the material?
          Solution:
          Energy stored in a static electric field = D  E  dv:

                                                                                             V

                              D = E and field is constant (uniform)
             Energy stored = E2  (volume) = 650  103 2  10  10-6 = 5.75  10-9 J = 5.75 nJ.

          The complete calculation using SI units is

                               = 5.75  10-9 J = 5.75 nJ.

EXAMPLE 1.2 Polarization Vector

    A time-varying electric field in the x direction has a strength of 100 V/m and a frequency
    of 10 GHz. The medium has a relative permittivity of 10. What is the polarization vector?
    Express this vector in the time domain?

    Solution:
    D = E = 0E + P칎.
    The polarization vector is

                                P칎 = ( - 0) E = (10 - 1) 0E = 90E.

    Now E = 100cos 2    1010t x^
    and 0 = 8  85  1012, so

    P칎 = 9 8.85  10-12  (100) cos 6.28  1010t x^                    (1.23)
        = 79.7  10-10  cos 6.28  1010t x^
        = 7.79cos 6.28  1010t x^ nC/m2.

    1.5.4 Maxwell's Equations in Phasor Form

    Phasors reduce the dimensionality of Maxwell's equations by replacing
    a time derivative by a complex scalar. The phasor form is used with a
    cosinusoidally varying quantity so, for example, an x-directed electric field
    in rectangular coordinates,

                                     E = |Ex| cos (t + )x^,                                    (1.24)

    is represented as the phasor

                                     Ex = |Ex|ex^.                                              (1.25)

   E = |Ex| cos (t + x)x^ + |Ey| cos (t + y)y^ + |Ez| cos (t + z)^z

and has the phasor form                                                 (1.27)
                         E = |Ex|ex x^ + |Ey|ey y^ + |Ez|ez z^.

To express Maxwell's equations in phasor form, the full complex form of
Equation (1.26) must be considered. Using Equation (1.94), Equation (1.26)
becomes

       E = 1 |Ex|ex x^ + |Ey|ey y^ + |Ez|ez z^ et                e-t   (1.28)
            2
            + 1 |Ex|e-x x^ + |Ey|e-y y^ + |Ez |e-z z^
                2

with the time derivative

   E = 1  |Ex|ex x^ + |Ey|ey y^ + |Ez |ez ^z et                   e-t.  (1.29)

           - 1  |Ex|e-x x^ + |Ey |e-y y^ + |Ez |e-z ^z
              2

Equation (1.29) has the phasor form (from the et component)

2  et     E =  |Ex|exx^ + |Ey|ey y^ + |Ez|ez ^z . (1.30)

et component of t

Noting this, Maxwell's equations in phasor form, from Equations (1.1)-(1.4),
are

                           E = -B - J칖                              (1.31)
                           H = D + J                                (1.32)
                                                                        (1.33)
                            D = V                                     (1.34)
                            B = mV .

1.5.5 Integral Form of Maxwell's Equations

It is sometimes more convenient to use the integral forms of Maxwell's
equations, and Equations (1.1)-(1.4) become

           E  ds =        E  d = - B  ds -    J칖  ds           (1.35)
                                  s t                                   (1.36)
         s                C                         s                   (1.37)
                                                                        (1.38)
         H  ds =          H  d = D  ds + I
                             s t
       s                  C

           D dv = D  ds = v dv = Qenclosed

       v                  s  V

           B dv = B  ds = 0,

       v                  s

where Qenclosed is the total charge in the volume enclosed by the surface,
S. The subscript S on the integral indicates a surface integral and the circle
16  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    on the integral sign indicates that the integral is over a closed surface. Two
    mathematical identities were used in developing Equations (1.35)-(1.38). The
    first identity is Stoke's theorem, which states that for any vector field X,

         X  d  ( X)  ds.                                          (1.39)

                                  s

    So the contour integral of X around a closed contour, C (with incremental
    length vector d), is the integral of   X over the surface enclosed by the
    contour and ds is the incremental area multiplied by a unit vector normal
    to the surface. This identity is used in Equations (1.35) and (1.36). The
    divergence theorem is the other identity and is used in Equations (1.37) and
    (1.38). For any vector field X, the divergence theorem states that

                           X  ds =  X dv.                          (1.40)

         s                           v

    That is, the volume integral of  X is equal to the closed surface integral of
    X.

       Using phasors the integral-based forms of Maxwell's equations become

       E  d = - B  ds - J칖  ds                                 (1.41)
                                                                     (1.42)
    C                             s                               s  (1.43)
                                                                     (1.44)
       H  d =  D  ds + I

    1.6 Electric and Magnetic Field Laws

    Before Maxwell's equations were postulated, several laws of electromag-
    netics were known. These are the Biot-Savart law, Ampere's circuital law,
    Gauss's law, Gauss's law for magnetism, and Faraday's law. The laws are
    for specific circumstances and mostly for static fields. In this section they are
    derived from Maxwell's equations.

    1.6.1 Ampere's Circuital Law

    Ampere's circuital law, often called just Ampere's law, relates direct current
    and the static magnetic field H . The relationship is based on Figure 1-3. In
    the static situation, D /t = 0, and so one of Maxwell's equations, Equation
    (1.36), reduces to

                                             H  d = Ienclosed.     (1.45)

                                                            

    This is Ampere's circuital law.

    1.6.2 Biot-Savart Law

    The Biot-Savart law relates current to static magnetic field. With D/t = 0,
    Equation (1.3) becomes

                            H = J.                                (1.46)
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                     17

            Figure 1-3: Diagram illustrating Ampere's law. Am-
            pere's law relates the current on a wire to the mag-
            netic field around it.

                              Figure 1-4: Diagram illustrating the Biot-Savart
                              law. The Biot-Savart law relates current to
                              magnetic field.

In Cartesian coordinates,

 H = Hz Hy                  x^ +  Hx Hz           y^ +  Hy Hx  ^z, (1.47)
       -                                  -               -
       y z                          z x                   x y

and if the current is confined to a thin wire as shown in Figure 1-4,   H
reduces to an operation along the wire, but also with vector information. So
the first step in the development of the Biot-Savart law, Equation (1.46), is
simplified to (ignoring vector information for now)

                                    H  =     I  2.               (1.48)

                                     4R

With vector information and moving the infinitesimal length of wire, d, from
the left side of the equation to the right, the final form of the Biot-Savart law
is obtained:

                                     Id  a^R
                              dH =        4R    2,               (1.49)

which has the units of amps per meter in the SI system. In Equation (1.49),
I is current, d is a length increment of a filament of current I, a^R is the
unit vector in the direction from the current filament to the magnetic field,
and R is the distance between the filament and the magnetic field increment.
So Equation (1.49) is saying that a filament of current produces a magnetic
field at a point. The total static magnetic field from a current on a wire or
surface can be found by modeling the wire or surface as a number of current
filaments, and the total magnetic field at a point is obtained by summing up
the contributions from each filament.

1.6.3 Gauss's Law

The third law is Gauss's law, which relates the static electric flux density
vector, D, to charge. With reference to Figure 1-5, Gauss's law in integral
form is

                              D = v.dv = Qenclosed,             (1.50)

                           s        v

which states that the integral of the electric flux density vector, D , is equal
to the total charge enclosed by the surface, Qenclosed. This is just the integral
form of the third Maxwell equation (Equation (1.37)).
18  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    Figure 1-5: Diagram il-
    lustrating Gauss's law.
    Charges are distributed in
    the volume enclosed by the
    closed surface. An incre-
    mental area is described
    by the vector ds which is
    normal to the surface and
    whose magnitude is the
    area of the incremental area.

    Figure 1-6: Diagram
    illustrating Faraday's
    law. The contour 
    encloses the surface.

       There is a similar law called Coulomb's law which says that the magnitude
    of the force between two stationary point charges is directly proportional to
    the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the
    square of the distance between them. This law can be derived from Gauss's
    law but is less general. Coulomb's law applies only to stationary charges
    whereas with Gauss's law the charges can be moving.

       Gauss's law has also been used for magnetic field where it is called Gauss's
    law for magnetism. In integral form Gauss's law for magnetism is

                                      B = 0,       (1.51)

                                     s

    where B, is the static magnetic flux density. This law is the same as saying
    that there are no magnetic charges. "Gauss's law for magnetism" is a name
    that is not universally used and many people simply say that there are no
    magnetic charges.

    1.6.4 Faraday's Law

    Faraday's law relates a time-varying magnetic field to an induced voltage
    drop, V , which is now understood to be  E  d, that is, the closed contour
    integral of the electric field,

    V = E  d = - B  ds,                         (1.52)
                                               s t
                                   

    and this has the units of volts in the SI unit system. This is just the first of
    Maxwell's equations in integral form (see Equation (1.35)). The operation
    described in Equation (1.52) is illustrated in Figure 1-6.

1.7 Electromagnetic Fields in Dielectrics and Metals

The discussion in this section follows the description by Max Born [11] (who
was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics). Extensions
are made to relates quantum descriptions to effects important to microwave
engineering. In particular the descriptions here relate phenomena at the
discrete particle level to continuum properties such as permittivity, .

1.7.1 Electromagnetic Fields in a Dielectric

A dielectric has no electrons that are free to move through a material under
the influence of an electric field. When an EM field is incident on a dielectric
the electric field moves charge centers. For a crystal these charge centers
are at the scale of the lattice, and for composite materials like plastics the
centers are at the molecular scale. With some materials, which we know as
materials having high permittivity, the charge centers are normally separated
but by less than the intra-atom spacing. With all dielectric materials, the
major impact of an applied electric field is movement of the charge centers,
alternately moving them apart and moving them together as the applied
electric field alternates. Now being a dielectric, the charges cannot move
freely through the material and the energy that is transferred to the charges
is stored as electric potential energy in stretched bonds or, sometimes, as a
distorted lattice (such as with the piezoelectric effect). This energy storage
is much like storing mechanical energy in a spring. Now the charges move
and thus excite an electric field of their own. However the charges move
sluggishly and so the phase of the EM signal they produce is out of phase
with respect to an externally applied alternating EM field. The charge centers
are moving the fastest at the peak of the applied sinusoidal field and the net
effect is a 90 phase lag.

   Another phenomenon is that the combined effect of the reradiated fields
from the moving charge centers produces an EM wave with the same
frequency as the applied field but with a smaller phase velocity (smaller
because the phase velocity is averaged over many paths). The oscillating
charge centers radiate in all directions (which is called scattering) and so
some of the EM energy will be scattered in the direction from which the
applied EM wave came.

   An ideal dielectric has no loss. That is, there is no dielectric relaxation
loss associated with heating as the charge centers move, and there is no
conductivity due to moving free charges in the dielectric.

1.7.2 Refractive Index

Dielectrics were first characterized by their refractive index long before the
concept of EM waves and permittivity were developed. The refractive index,
n, of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light (i.e., of an EM
wave) in a vacuum, c, of an EM wave to the phase velocity, vp, of the wave
in the medium:

For a loss-free medium         c 1             (1.53)
                        n = vp = 00 1 .        (1.54)
                        n = r탍.
20  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    For a lossy medium the complex index of refraction is

       n~ = n + ,                                               (1.55)

    where n is called the refractive index and is directly related to the phase
    velocity, vp, and  is called the extinction coefficient, which describes loss
    when the EM wave propagates through the material.

       Conversion between refractive index and permittivity is as follows [12, 13];
    the complex permittivity

     = 1 + 2 = (n + )2,                                         (1.56)

    where 1 = n2 - 2 and 2 = 2n.                                . (1.57)
    The components of the complex index of refraction are then

    n = 21 + 22 + 1 and  = 21 + 22 - 1 .                        (1.58)
    2                                                      2

       The permittivity is just the square of the (complex) refractive index in a
    nonmagnetic medium (탍 = 1). The refractive index is used with optics and
    the permittivity is used when working with Maxwell's equations and with

    electronics.
       The refractive index, and thus permittivity, of a dielectric can vary

    significantly between microwave and optical frequencies, a result of how
    quickly different types of charge centers can move. For water at 20C and
    at the standard optical wavelength of 589 nm (the yellow doublet sodium
    D-line), n = 1.333 (r = 1.78) [14]. At 1 GHz n = 8.94 (r = 80) [15].

    1.7.3 Electromagnetic Fields in a Metal

    The discussion here refers to the behavior of EM fields in metals at
    frequencies from DC to 10 THz. Above these frequencies the EM wave
    changes direction much faster than electrons can move. Metals have a large
    number of free charges that can move through a metal under the influence
    of an electric field. On transmission lines the energy is contained in the EM
    fields between metal guides, and electric and magnetic fields are present at
    the surface of the metal. The main effect of the EM fields at the surface of
    the metal is to accelerate the free electrons at the surface, with the electrons
    accelerating in the direction opposite to that of the electric field. While some
    of the EM energy propagates into the metal, the overwhelming effect is
    transfer of energy from the EM photons to kinetic energy of the free electrons.
    There is also some transfer of energy to the bound electrons, however,
    this effect is smaller as the bound electrons are shielded by the sea of free
    electrons. Electrons have mass and accelerate relatively slowly. Even when
    the electric field is reversed, the electrons will continue moving considerably
    in the same direction as the electric field before reversing. The moving and
    accelerating electrons also produce electric fields of their own that in turn
    influence the movement of other electrons. Electrons are sluggish and their
    position is almost 180 out of phase with the applied E field. The net effect
    is that the electric field produced by the electrons almost completely cancels

the incoming electric field. It is therefore almost meaningless to talk about the
(group or phase) velocity of the EM fields in the metal. The overriding effect
is transfer of energy to moving electrons that eventually make the lattice
move and transfer their energy to the lattice, producing heat.

   The accelerating electrons radiate electric field in all directions and in turn
this field accelerates other electrons. There is also a damping force as the free
electrons collide with atoms. So there is a rapidly diminishing component
of the EM field that travels through the metal at the speed of light. Rather
than energy being stored in the electric field through the movement of
charge centers as in dielectrics, electric energy in the forward-propagating
field is almost entirely lost in the scattering and collision processes. So
at microwave frequencies the effective permittivity of a metal is almost
entirely imaginary (corresponding to loss), and this imaginary component
of the relative permittivity is 8-10 orders of magnitude greater than the
real component, which is believed to be 1 [16]. The real component of the
relative permittivity is 1 because the charge centers are masked by the sea
of free electrons. It is not possible to directly measure the real part of the
permittivity of metals at microwave frequencies. An ideal conductor has
infinite conductivity, so there are no EM fields inside the metal and net
charges are confined to the surface of the conductor. At optical frequencies
metals are known to have a negative permittivity (see Table 1-2).

1.8 Electric and Magnetic Walls

The boundaries imposed by conductors and the interface between dielectrics
define the mode structure (i.e., orientation of the fields) supported by
a transmission line. Understanding the fields at the interfaces provides
the intuition required to understand the operational frequency limits of
distributed structures such as transmission lines.

1.8.1 Electric Wall

An electric wall is formed by an ideal conductor, as shown in Figure 1-7,
where there are electric charges at the surface of the conductor. Consider
that the conductor in Figure 1-7(a) carries a current of density J and charge
of density V . As the conductivity of the conductor goes to infinity, the
conductor becomes a perfect conductor and forms an electric wall, as shown
in Figure 1-7(b). The current and charge now occupy the very skin of the
conductor at the interface to the region above which there is either free space
or a dielectric. The behavior of the fields at the interface can be understood
22  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    Figure 1-7: Properties of an electric wall: (a) the electrical field is
    perpendicular to a conductor and the magnetic field is parallel to it and is
    orthogonal to the current; (b) a conductor can be approximated by an electric
    wall; (c) cylinder used in deriving the normal electric field; (d) cylinder
    used in showing that the tangential electric field is zero; (e) contour used
    in deriving the tangential magnetic field in the y direction; and (f) contour
    used in deriving the z- and x-directed magnetic fields (they are zero).

    by considering the integration surfaces and volumes shown in Figure 1-7(c
    and d). The cylinder in Figure 1-7(c) with height h and diameter d enables
    Gauss's law (Equation (1.50)) to be applied. As h - 0 (h approaching zero),
    Equation (1.50) yields

                 s  D.ds = Dz 14 d2 = v.dv = Qenclosed = S 14 d2,      (1.59)
                                v                                       (1.60)

    where S is the surface charge density (in SI units of C/m2) and so

                                Dz = S.

    Now considering the cylinder in Figure 1-7(d), again as h - 0,

                 D.ds = Dx 14 d2 = v.dv = Qenclosed
              s           v

                    = Sdh - 0.                                          (1.61)
                                                                        (1.62)
    That is,     Dx = 0.

    Changing the orientation of the cylinder, it can be seen that

                                Dy = 0.                                 (1.63)

    So the electric field is normal to the surface of the conductor.
       The properties of the magnetic field at the electric wall can be deduced

    from Faraday's circuital law and the Biot-Savart law (Equation (1.49)).
    Consider the rectangular contour shown in Figure 1-7(e) with height h and
    width w. With h - 0, only the y-directed component of the magnetic field
    will contribute to the static magnetic field integral of Faraday's law, so from
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                                   23

Equation (1.52),

                               H  d = Hyw = Ienclosed = JS w,     (1.64)

                                          

where JS is the surface current density (with SI units of A/m) and

                  Hy = JS.                                          (1.65)

For the field oriented in the x direction, the rectangular contour shown in
Figure 1-7(f) can be used, but now no current is enclosed by the contour, so
that with h - 0,

      H  d = Hxw = Ienclosed = 0                                  (1.66)
                                                                    (1.67)
     

and  Hx = 0.

Hz has not yet been considered. Again, using the rectangle in Figure 1-7(f)
and with w - 0,

      H  d = Hzh = Ienclosed = 0                                   (1.68)
                                                                    (1.69)
     

and  Hz = 0.

This could also have been derived from the Biot-Savart law (Equation (1.49)).
Immediately above the electric wall R - 0 and only the filament of current
immediately below the magnetic field contributes. Thus aR is normal to the
surface so that H will be perpendicular to the current, but in the plane of the
current.

   Gathering the results together, the EM fields immediately above the elec-
tric wall have the following properties:

the dielectrics differ so that 2  1. Considering the top dielectric region,
the magnetic wall model can then be introduced at the interface between the

       What constitutes a good magnetic wall is subject to debate, as the
    contrast between dielectrics is not as great as the contrast between the
    conductivity of a good conductor and that of a good dielectric. However,
    it is an essential concept in understanding the coupling of signals and
    approximating transmission lines to yield intuitive understanding.

       The summary that is used in the text to understand multimoding is given
    in Table 1-3.

    1.9 Fields in Lossy Mediums

    Lossy mediums result in power loss of EM fields. In RF and microwave
    systems materials are ideally either perfect conductors or perfect dielectrics.
    In practice, conductors and dielectrics have finite conductivity and
    dielectrics have another type of loss called dielectric relaxation loss.
    Dielectric relaxation loss is due to heating that can result from the movement
    of charge centers in a material.

    1.9.1 Lossy Dielectrics

    In a lossy dielectric there can be both current flow and relaxation loss.
    Current flow results from applied electric field and is described by the
    conductivity, , of the material. Relaxation loss results from polarization
    of the material and the transfer of energy to the lattice of the material as the
    electric field changes direction. This is also referred to as dielectric damping.
    The polarization vector describes the additional energy storage capacity of a
    material (above that of vacuum) in response to an applied electric field. The
    capacity is described by the electric susceptibility, e, in Equation (1.20). In
    phasor form, loss is captured by a complex e or a complex permittivity:

                               =  -  = (1 + e).               (1.70)
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                                  25

Both current and relaxation respond to an applied electric field. In phasor
form, Maxwell's curl equation for a magnetic field, Equation (1.32), becomes

 H = D + J = E + E = ( - )E + E               (1.71)
         = E + ( + )E
         =   -  -   E.
                                 

In the above,  describes the ability to store electric energy,  describes
dielectric damping loss, and  describes conductivity loss. At a single

frequency, damping and conductivity losses are indistinguishable and so the
term ( + ) is taken as the effective conductivity. The effective (complex)

relative permittivity is

             e =  -  -   1 .                          (1.72)
                                     0

Another quantity that describes loss is the loss tangent, tan , which is the
ratio of power lost to energy stored:

             tan  =               + 
                                   .                  (1.73)
                                 

For many dielectric materials used with EM structures, tan  is approxi-
mately independent of frequency up to 100s of gigahertz, so it is commonly
used to characterize the dielectric loss of a material. Most exceptions are
semiconductors such as silicon which can have appreciable conductive loss.
The frequency independence of tan  indicates that conductivity loss is neg-
ligible.

EXAMPLE 1.3 Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in a Lossy Dielectric

Consider a plane EM wave propagating in a medium with permittivity  and permeability
. The complex permittivity measured at two frequencies is experimentally characterized
by the relative permittivity (/0) of the real,  {/0}, and imaginary,  {/0}, parts as
follows:

Measured relative permittivity:         Measured relative permeability:

Frequency Real Imaginary                Frequency Real Imaginary

       part  part                               part  part

1 GHz  1.9 -0.0490                      1 GHz   1.9   -0.001
2 GHz  1.9 -0.0314
                                        2 GHz   1.9   -0.001

Since there is an imaginary part of the dielectric constant, there could be loss due to either
dielectric damping or finite material conductivity, or both. When characterizing materials,
it is only possible to distinguish the contribution to the measured imaginary part of
the permittivity by considering the experimentally derived imaginary permittivity at two
different frequencies.

(a) Determine the dielectric loss tangent at 1 GHz.
(b) Determine the relative dielectric damping factor at 1 GHz (the part of the permittivity

     due to dielectric damping).
(c) What is the conductivity of the dielectric?
(d) What is the magnetic conductivity of the medium?

    Solution:
    (a) At 1 GHz,  = r0, and the measured relative permittivity is

         measurement.         Now      e   =

         dielectric conductivity, , as well as of dielectric damping, which is described by 

         alone. That is,

                                                 
                     e =  +  r = r,e = 0.0490 and tan  = 0.0490/1.9 = 0.0258.

    (d) Magnetic conductivity is nonexistent, thus magnetic conductivity is zero.

                     1.9.2 Lossy Conductors

                     Perfect conductors would have infinite conductivity, but since the conduc-

                     tivity of real conductors is finite, EM fields penetrate into the interior of a

                     conductor. Still the energy stored in the current is much greater than the (di-
                     electric) electric energy storage capability,   , and the losses from con-
                     ductivity are much higher than dielectric loss,   , so that the effective

                     relative permittivity from Equation (1.72) is

                                           e =  -  -   1  -  1   1 .                                                      (1.75)
                                                                       0               0                0

                     For most conductors the permeability is 0 and the working permittivity is

                                                                       = e0 =  .                                          (1.76)
                                                                                     

                     The propagation constant of the field in a conductor is

                                            =  +        (1 + )  .                                                      (1.77)
                                                                                                            2

                     So  = /2. The EM field in the conductor reduces in amplitude as e-x
                     after a distance x. Thus the field reduces to 1/e of its value after a distance
                     called the skin depth, s:

                                                                       s =        2.                                      (1.78)
                                                                                
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                              27

If the amplitude of the electric field at the surface of a conductor is A(0), after
a distance s the amplitude of the electric field will have the amplitude

                          
A(s) = e-x = e- /2 2/

                     = e-1.                                             (1.79)

   Table 1-4 lists the skin depth and phase velocities of conductors commonly
used in microwave circuits. The resistivity values here are those of a single
crystal. The phase velocity, vp, is calculated from the propagation constant .
From Equation (1.77),  = /2.

                            2
Now vp = /, so that  vp = =  =                       .                  (1.80)
                                     

   This can be simplified further if the relative permeability of the material is
1, as then  = 0 = 410-7 H/m. If SI units are used for f and :

vp =                 2 =        4f    107f .                            (1.81)
                     0      410-7 =    

From Table 1-4 note that the skin depth at gigahertz frequencies is close to
the thickness of microstrip lines which are often only a few microns thick.
Also the speed of an EM wave in a conductor is very slow. The speed of EM
in copper (ideal), for example, is 0.004% of the speed of light in a vacuum.

EXAMPLE 1.4 Electromagnetic Calculations

    This example provides a review of basic EM theory. In Figure 1-9, a plane wave in free space
    is normally incident on a lossless medium occupying a half space with a dielectric constant
    of 16. Calculate the electric field reflection coefficient at the interface referred to the medium.

    Solution:

    Since it is not explicitly stated, assume 1 = 0. (This should be done in general since 0 is

    the default value for , as most materials have unity relative permeability.) The characteristic

    impedance of a medium is  = /. Now  is used for characteristic impedance (also called

    wave impedance) of a TEM propagating wave in a medium. It is used instead of Z0, which

    is generally reserved for the characteristic impedance of transmission lines. The electric field

    reflection coefficient is     E = 1 - 0 = 1/0 - 1
                                          1 + 0 1/0 + 1

                               1 = 0  0 = 0 = 1 = 1 ,
                               0  1  0   1  16 4

    so
                                       E = 1/4 - 1 = 1 - 4 = - 3 = -0.6.

EXAMPLE 1.5 Intuitive Solution of Electromagnetic Problems

      This example provides an intuitive way of solving an EM problem. A plane wave in free
      space is normally incident on a lossless medium occupying a half space with a dielectric
      constant of 16. What is the magnetic field reflection coefficient?
      Solution:
      There are two ways to answer this question. An intuitive approach will be used first.
      Intuitively |H | = |E|,.
      With E and H being vectors, the Poynting vector E H points in the direction of propagation
      for a plane wave, since the reflected wave is in the opposite direction to the incident wave,
      thus

                                                  sign H = -sign E .

      Therefore H = -E = +0.6. (E was calculated in Example 1.4.)
      Now the second approach. The formula for the magnetic field reflection coefficient is

                                  H = 1 - 2 = 1 - 2/1 = 1 - 1/4 = 3 = 0.6.
                                          1 + 2 1 + 2/1 1 + 1/4 5

EXAMPLE 1.6 Wave Impedance and Propagation Constant

A 4 GHz time-varying EM field is traveling in the +z
direction in Region 1 and is normally incident on another
material in Region 2. The boundary between the two regions
is in the z = 0 plane. The permittivity of Region 1 is 1 = 0
and that of Region 2 is 2 = (4 -  0.4)0. For both regions,
1 = 2 = 0. The phasor of the forward-traveling electric
field (i.e., the incident field) is E+ = 100 y^, and the phase is
normalized with respect to z = 0.

What are the wave impedance and propagation constant of Region 2?

Solution:

The wave impedance is

                =  = 0 탍 = 0                          탍 = 377       1

1.10 Summary

This introductory chapter provided the background for the following
chapters on distributed effects. A review of Maxwell's equations and their
implications was presented. The notable change in the way these were
presented here to the first time they are introduced in electromagnetics
courses is the first time the static electric and magnetic field laws are
presented and then Maxwell's equations are covered almost as though
there was a continuous derivation. However Maxwell's equations cannot
be derived from the static laws even with some additional insight. Instead
Maxwell's equations embed the quantum field theory that there are two
inseparable component fields which we call electric and magnetic fields, and
the fundamental relativity effect of the finite speed of light which results
from relating the spatial derivative of each of the field components to the
time derivative of the other component. The insight places Maxwell among
the ten greatest physicists of all time.

   The finite speed for electromagnetic radiation is at the core of microwave
engineering. At microwave frequencies the finite speed at which information
can move means that microwave circuit design is quite different from low
frequency circuit design, and the distributed and electromagnetic coupling
effects lead to a large number of microwave circuit components that provide
a very rich design space.

1.A.4 Complex Numbers and Phasors

A complex number z is an ordered pair of two real numbers x and y, and a complex number
has a special meaning when working in thefrequency domain. The rectangular form of the
complex number is z = x + y, where  = -1 is an imaginary number.1 The polar form of
the complex number z = r  relates directly to the amplitude and phase of a cosinusoid. In
determining phase, reference is made to a cosinusoid of the form u(t) = r cos (t + ), as this
has a value of r when the radian frequency  = 0 (i.e., at DC). The cosinusoid is shown as the
solid line in Figure 1-11(a), where r is the amplitude and  is the phase of the cosinusoid. The
cosinusoid can be presented as the complex valued function

                                         f (t) = zet,           where           z = re                                (1.113)

1 Outside electrical engineering i (i without the dot) is used for -1, but this is replaced by  (j without the dot) in
  electrical engineering to avoid confusion with the usage of i for current.

and given the frequency of the cosinusoid, the original time-domain waveform can be
reconstructed. The time-domain form of the complex function is

    EXAMPLE 1.7 Complex numbers

          Consider the complex numbers w = -0.5 - 1.6 and z = 5 - 3, and the waveform
          v(t) = 2.3 cos(210t - 1.2).

               In polar form, w = 1.676 (-1.874), where 1.874 is in radians; alternatively w =
                 1.676 (-107.4).

               In polar form, z = 5.831 (-0.54).
               2w = -1 - 3.2 = 3.353 (-1.874).
               z  w = w  z = w  z = (1.676  5.831) (-1.874 - 0.54) = 9.774 (-2.414) = -7.3 - 6.5.
               z = 2.327 - 0.645.
               Alternatively z = 5.831 (-0.54/2) = 2.415 (-0.27).
               w/z = (1.676/5.831) [-1.874 - (-0.54)] = 0.287 -1.333 = 0.068 - 6.5.
               The radian frequency of v(t) is 20 rads/s.
               The frequency of v(t) is 10 Hz.
               The phasor of v(t) is v = 2.3 (-1.2) = 2.3 (-68.755) = 0.833 - 2.144.
               If w is a phasor and its frequency is 1 GHz, the waveform equivalent of w is w(t) =

                 1.676 cos(2  109t - 1.874) and the phase is -1.874 radians or -107.35 or 252.65.

1.A.5 Vector Operators

Vector Multiplication
There are two types of operations that multiply vectors. A, B, and C are vectors with

    A = aii + ajj + akk,                                                               (1.118)

where i, j, and k, are orthogonal vectors such as the unit vectors of the Cartesian coordinate
system, that is, x^, y^, and ^z in the x, y and z directions, respectively.

Dot Product
A  B is called the dot product, the scalar product or the inner product. It is read as "a dot b."
A  B = aibi + ajbj + . . . + akbk.
Commutative property: A  B = B  A.
Distributive property: A  (B + C) = A  B + A  C.
Bilinear property (r is a scalar): A  (rB + C) = r(A  B) + (A  C).
Scalar multiplication property (r and s are scalars): (rA)  (sB) = (rs)(A  B).
Orthogonal property: Two nonzero vectors A and B are orthogonal if and only if A  B = 0.
INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                    37

Cross Product A  B is called the cross product. It is read as "a cross b." Now the vector
components of A, B, and C need to be more tightly specified as orthogonal vectors, typically
having unit amplitude, that have the property

i  j = k, j  k = i, k  i = j, and i  i = 0 = j  j = k  k                    (1.119)
j  i = -k, k  j = -i, i  k = -j.                                               (1.120)

The unit vectors of the Cartesian coordinate system have this property with i, j, and k,
corresponding to the unit vectors x^, y^, and z^ in the x, y and z directions, respectively.

a  b = (aii + ajj + akk)  (bii + bjj + bkk)                                     (1.121)
        = aibii  i + aibji  j + aibki  k + ajbij  i + ajbjj  j + ajbkj  k+
           akbik  i + akbjk  j + akbkk  k
        = (aj bk - akbj)i + (akbi - aibk)j + (aibj - aj bi)k.

Anticommutative property: A  B = -B  A.
Distributive property: A  (B + C) = A  B + A  C.
Bilinear property (r is a scalar): A  (rB + C) = r(A  B) + (A  C).
Scalar multiplication property (r and s are scalars): (rA)  (sB) = (rs)(A  B).

Lagrange's formula
A  (B  C) = B(B  C) - C(A  B).

Del () Vector Operator
Operations in Cartesian, Cylindrical, and Spherical Coordinate Systems
This section defines the del, or the nabla , a calculus operator that operates on vector
quantities and also on a scalar to create a vector. The various del operators in the Cartesian
(rectangular), spherical, and cylindrical coordinate systems are presented. Here a scalar is
denoted by f and a vector by F:

     grad, , is the gradient of a scalar with direction. f is read as "grad f."

     div, , is a measure of how a vector is spreading out from a point.   F is read as "div F."

     curl, , is a measure of the rotation of a vector.  F is read as "curl F."

1.A.10 Special Polynomials

Several polynomials have special properties of use in the design of filters and matching
networks. Their arguments are put in terms of frequency and a transfer function of a two-port
is expressed in terms on one of the special polynomials or its inverse.

Butterworth Polynomial
The Butterworth polynomials have the general form

               n/2  2           (2k+n-1)  
               k=1 x - 2x cos          +1                         for n even
                                2n                                for n odd
     Bn(x) = (x + 1) (n-1)/2  k=1 x2  - 2x cos (2k+n-1)   2n + 1                       (1.192)

These of course do not look like polynomials but their expansions are, see Table 1-5.

Chebyshev Polynomial

The nth-order Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind,
Tn(x), (often just called the Chebyshev polynomial) has
the special property that the maximum absolute value of
Tn(x) for -1  x  1 is 1. This can be seen in the figure to
the right where the first four Tchebyshev polynomials are
plotted.

   When x is frequency this means that the frequency response in a bandwidth has equal
ripples across the passband and outside (both above and below) the value of Tn(x) rapidly
diverges (the magnitude becomes monotonically larger). For a filter or matching network
the reflection coefficient is expressed in terms of Tn(x) and so the skirts of the transmission
response are steep. Normalization of x and scaling of the Chebyshev polynomials is used to
scale the response in frequency and amplitude. The Chebyshev polynomial is obtained using
the recursion formula

    Tn(x) = 2xTn-1(x) - Tn-2(x) with T1(x) = x and T2(x) = 2x2 - 1.                    (1.193)

For example, with n = 3,

    T3(x) = 2xT3-1(x) - T3-2(x) = 2x(2x2 - 1) - x = 4x3 - 2x - x = 4x3 - 3x.           (1.194)

   Several useful expansions of Chebyshev polynomials are used in microwave engineering
to relate the frequency response of a function or circuit to the Chebyshev characteristic.
Generally the frequency is referred to the electrical length  (which for a transmission line 
is proportional to frequency). Some of the more useful expansions used in the text follow:

                                             Tn(cos ) = cos(n)                              (1.195)

and note that when  = /2, cos(n) = 0 when is odd and cos(n) = 1 when is even. From
this identity two more useful identities are derived:

    Tn(x) = cos n cos-1 x for |x|  1, and Tn(x) = cosh n cosh-1 x for |x|  1. (1.196)

   A normalized argument cos / cos m is often used to define a passband as being between
m and ( - m). That is that we can relate the Chebyshev response to frequency and define a
frequency bandwidth. Then a useful Chebyshev polynomial expansion is

          Tn (cos /cos m) = Tn(sec m cos ) = cos n cos-1 (cos /cos m) .                     (1.197)

From  Section  1.A.2  note  that  cos2    =  1  [1  +  c  o  s(2    )],  cos  cos(n)  =  1  cos[(n + 1)] cos[(n - 1)],
                                             2                                           2
and sec(m) = 1/ cos m. Then (after ingenious manipulation) Equation (1.193) becomes

T1(cos / cos m) = sec m cos 

T2(cos / cos m) = sec2 m[cos(2) + 1] - 1 = sec2 m cos(2) + (sec2 m - 1)

T3(cos / cos m) = sec3 m[cos(3) + 3 cos ] - 3 sec m cos 

                      = sec3 m cos(3) + 3(sec3 m - sec m) cos 

T4(cos / cos m) = sec4 m[cos(4) + 4 cos(2) + 3] - 4 sec2 m[cos(2) + 1] + 1

                      = sec4 m cos(4) + 4(sec4 - sec2 m) cos(2) + (3 sec4 m - 4 sec2 m + 1)

K5(cos / cos m) = sec5 m[cos(5) + 5 cos(3) + 7 cos ] - sec3 m[5 cos(3) + 11 cos ]

                      + 4 sec m cos 

                      = sec5 m cos(5) + 5(sec5 m - sec3 m) cos(3)

                      + (7 sec5 m - 11 sec3 m + 4 sec m) cos .                              (1.198)

Linear Interpolation

Linear interpolation can be used to extract data from tables. In the table below there are two
known points, (x0, y0) and (x1, y1), and the linear interpolant is the straight line between them.
The unknown point (x, y) is found by locating it on this straight line.

                             Variable
                 Independent Dependent

                   x0               y0

                   x                y

                   x1               y1

Thus                                     y - y0 = x - x0                                                                      (1.211)
so that, given x,                        y1 - y0 x1 - x0                                                                      (1.212)
                                    y = y0 + (x - x0) y1 - y0 .

Bilinear Interpolation

Bilinear interpolation is a two-dimensional generalization of linear interpolation. In the table
below, f (D) = f (x0, y0), f (A) = f (x0, y1), f (F) = f (x1, y0), and f (C) = f (x1, y1) are known
and f (x, y) is to be found. The bilinear interpolation technique is illustrated in the figure.

Independent   Variable          Dependent
             Independent
       x0                             f0
       x            y0                f
       x1           y                 f1
                    y1

First, find the value of the function at point B from the values at Point A and Point C. Thus,
from Equation (1.212),

             f (B) = f (x, y1) = f (A) + (x - x0) f (C) - f (A) .          (1.213)
                                                             x1 - x0

Similarly

             f (E) = f (x, y0) = f (D) + (x - x0) f (F) - f (D) .          (1.214)
                                                             x1 - x0

Linear interpolation between Point B and Point E yields

             f (x, y) = f (E) + (y - y0) f (B) - f (E) .                   (1.215)
                                                 y1 - y0

Combining these, the function obtained from bilinear interpolation is

f (x, y) =  f (x0, y0) (x1 - x)(y1 - y) +     f (x1, y0) (x - x0)(y1 - y)
            (x1 - x0)(y1 - y0)             (x1 - x0)(y1 - y0)

            + f (x0, y1) (x1 - x)(y - y0) + f (x1, y1) (x - x0)(y - y0).   (1.216)
            (x1 - x0)(y1 - y0)             (x1 - x0)(y1 - y0)

When interpolating from a table, choosing the points closest to the final point will yield greatest
accuracy.

1.A.13 Circles on the Complex Plane

A common situation that occurs when working with complex numbers involves equating the
magnitude of a complex number being equal to a real number. As will be shown, this defines a
circle in the complex plane. Consider the relation

                                |S - c| = r,                               (1.217)
46            STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

              Figure 1-15: A circle in the
              S plane defined by the
              relation |S - c| = r, where
              c = a + b and S = x + y.

where S = x + y and c = a + b are complex numbers and r is a real number. Substituting for
S and c in Equation (1.217) yields

that is,                           |(x - a) + (y - b)| = r,                    (1.218)
          [(x - a) + (y - b)] [(x - a) - (y - b)] = r2                         (1.219)
                                                                               (1.220)
                                   (x - a)2 + (y - b)2 = r2.

The above is a general equation for a circle in the x-y plane with center (a, b) and radius r (see
Figure 1-15).

1.A.14 Bilinear Transform

The bilinear transformation maps a circle in the complex plane onto another circle in the
complex plane [19]. The bilinear transformation of a complex variable z is

                                  w = Az + B .                                 (1.221)
                                         Cz + 1

where A, B, and C are real numbers. In RF and microwave usage, z and w could be reflection
coefficients or impedances. Rearranging Equation (1.221) results in

which can be rearranged again as        w = A + B - CA ,                       (1.222)
                                               C Cz + 1                        (1.223)

                                  w - AC = 1 .
                                  B - AC Cz + 1

The complexity of the derivation is reduced by introducing the intermediate variables W and

Z defined as

              W = w - AC          (1.224)                     and Z = Cz + 1,  (1.225)
                     B - AC

and noting that, from Equation (1.223), W = 1/Z.                               (1.226)

   If, in Equation (1.225), the locus of z describes a circle, then the locus of Z will also be a circle
since C is a constant. If the center of the circle in Z space is CZ and the distance from any point
on the circle to the center is the radius RZ , then

                                  |Z - CZ | = RZ.                              (1.227)

Considering Equation (1.225), then in z space, the center of the circle is

                                  Cz = CZ - 1                                  (1.228)

INTRODUCTION TO DISTRIBUTED MICROWAVE CIRCUITS                                               47

and its radius is

                                       Rz = RZ /C.                                           (1.229)

Removing the magnitude signs in Equation (1.227) leads to                                    (1.230)
                             (Z - CZ ) (Z - CZ ) = (Z - CZ ) (Z - CZ ) = RZ2 ,

or

                     ZZ - CZ Z - CZ Z + (|CZ |2 - RZ2 ) = 0,                                 (1.231)

which is the general equation for a circle in the complex plane.
   Now, the circle in the Z plane will be related to what happens in the W plane. Substituting

Equation (1.226) into Equation (1.231) results in

                     1              1     1                    2  2
                            - CZ  - CZ + (|CZ | - RZ ) = 0,                                  (1.232)
                     WW             W        W

and rearranging,

                        CZ                   CZ                         1
             WW -       2 2 W-               2 2W+                      2 2 = 0.             (1.233)
                     (|CZ | - RZ )     (|CZ | - RZ )              (|CZ | - RZ )

This is in the same form as Equation (1.231), so Equation (1.233) describes a circle in W space

with center

                                    CW =        C  Z                                         (1.234)

                                          (|CZ | - RZ )2 2

and radius

                                    RW =     2 2 RZ .                                        (1.235)
                                          |CZ | - RZ

    Now the locus of w will also be a circle. From Equation (1.224),

                              w=W B-A +A                                                     (1.236)
                                                CC

so that W is scaled and a constant added. The center of the circle in w space is

                     Cw = CW  B- A        A        C     (B    -  A/C)     A
                                    C     +=                      2+                         (1.237)
                                                      Z

                                          C (|CZ | - RZ ) C    2

and the radius is

                                          A (B - A/C)
                        Rw = RW B - =                             2.                         (1.238)
                                          C           |CZ | - RZ2

Substituting Equations (1.228) and (1.229) in the above relates the centers and radii in the w
and z spaces:

                   C (CC w = z + 1)(B - A/C) + A                                             (1.239)
                             |CCz + 1|2 - |CRz|2 C

                   Rw = |CCz + 1|2 - |CRz|2 (B - A/C)CRz = |CCz + 1|2 - |CRz|2 (BC - A)Rz .  (1.240)

Thus the bilinear transform, Equation (1.221), maps all points on a circle in the z plane to points
on a circle in the w plane.

1.A.15 Quadratic and Cubic Equations

Quadratic Equation
The general form of the quadratic equation in x is (a, b, and c can be complex)

                                               ax2 + bx + c = 0,                          (1.241)

where a = 0. There are two solutions, called roots, given by the quadratic formula, [20]

                                                                                          (1.242)
                                            x = -b  b2 - 4ac ,

                                                          2a

and  indicates two possible roots,

                                                                        
                                 -b + b2 - 4ac                        -b - b2 - 4ac
                      x+ =                            and x- =                       .    (1.243)

Even if a, b, and c are real, the roots may be complex and they could be degenerate, that is, the
same. The factors of the quadratic equation come from the roots, that is,

                                 ax2 + bx + c = a (x - x+) (x - x-) .                     (1.244)

Cubic Equation
The general form of the cubic equation in x is (a, b, c and d can be complex)

                                            ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0,                       (1.245)

where a = 0. There are three solutions, called roots, given by the cubic formula, [20]

                                 xk = 1 b + uk + 0 ,                  k  {1, 2, 3}                     (1.246)

                                                                                        -1 -  3 , and
where  the  uks  are  the  cube  roots  of  one:  u1  =  1, u2  =  1
                                                                   2

                                                                        1/3

                                 C=         1     1 +    2      -  430                    (1.247)
                                            2
                                                            1

with 0 = b2 - 3ac and 1 = 2b3 - 9abc + 27a2d. In Equation (1.247) any choice of the
square or cube roots can be made as the effect is simply to exchange x1, x2 and x3. Note that
ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = (x - x1)(x - x2)(x - x3).

1.A.16 Kron's Method: Network Condensation

Kron's method [21-23] is also called network condensation and is used in developing simpler
equivalent networks of large linear circuits with algebraic y parameters, that is, for resistive
networks, or for general linear circuits in frequency-domain analysis where the y parameters
are complex numbers. Network condensation is a numerical approach particular to circuits. It
is of use in reduced-order modeling of linear circuits and in filter design.

It is of no concern that the terminal voltages have been altered, as they have all had the
same quantity added to them. This has the same effect as choosing another reference terminal.

2.1 Introduction

A transmission line stores electric and magnetic energy, and for an alternat-
ing signal at a position on the line, energy is converted from one form to the
other as time progresses. As such a line has a circuit form that combines
inductors, Ls (for the magnetic energy), capacitors, Cs (for the electric
energy), and resistors, Rs (modeling losses), whose values depend on the
line geometry and material properties.

   The transmission lines considered in this chapter are restricted to just two
parallel conductors, as shown in Figure 2-1, with the distance between the
two wires (i.e., in the transverse direction) being substantially smaller than
the wavelengths of the signals on the line. The correct physical interpretation
is that the conductors of a transmission line confine and guide an EM field.
The EM field contains the energy of the signal and not the current on the line.

    However, with electrically small transverse dimensions, a two conductor line
    may be satisfactorily analyzed on the basis of voltages and currents.

       The earliest understanding of signal transmission led to telegraphy
    over distances. The critical theoretical step that enabled transmission over
    more than short distances was the development of an understanding of
    signal transmission on lines using phasor analysis [1]. This frequency-
    domain analysis is still the best way to understand transmission lines.
    This transmission line theory with modern developments is presented in
    Section 2.2 and useful formulas and concepts developed in Section 2.3 for
    lossless transmission lines. Section 2.4 presents several configurations of
    lossless lines that are particularly useful in microwave circuit design and
    used in many places in this book series. Section 2.5 repeats the analysis of
    lossless lines but now for lossy lines. Reflections and transmission of power
    at multiple interacting interfaces is considered in Section 2.6. Important
    network models for transmission lines are developed in Section Section 2.7.
    The last section, Section 2.8, presents summary formulas for many two-
    conductor transmission lines.

    2.1.1 When Must a Line be Considered a Transmission Line

    The key determinant of whether a transmission line can be considered as
    an invisible connection between two points is whether the signal anywhere
    along the interconnect has the same value at a particular instant. If the value
    of the signal (say, voltage) varies along the line (at an instant), then it may be
    necessary to consider transmission line effects. A typical criterion used is that
    if the length of the interconnect is less than 1/20th of the wavelength of the
    highest-frequency component of a signal, then transmission line effects can
    be safely ignored and the circuit can be modeled as a single RLC circuit [2].
    The actual threshold used--/20, /10, or /5--is based on experience and
    the particular application. For example, an interconnect carrying a digital
    signal clocking at 4 GHz has an appreciable frequency component at 20 GHz.
    Then the interconnect reaches the /10 threshold when it is 4.5 mm long.
    Thus it takes a finite time for the variation of a voltage at one end of the
    interconnect to impact the voltage at the other end. The ultimate limit is
    determined by the speed of light, c, but this is reduced by the relative
    permittivity and permeability of the material in which the fields exist. The
    relative permittivity and permeability describe the effect of excess potential
    energy storage in the material, above that of vacuum, in a manner that is
    analogous to storing mechanical energy in a spring.

    2.1.2 Movement of a Signal on a Transmission Line

    A coaxial line (Figure 2-2(a)) is the quintessential transmission line as it is
    one of the few transmission line structures that can be described exactly
    from first principles when there is no loss. This is because the cross section
    of a coaxial line matches the cylindrical coordinate system, an orthogonal
    coordinate system with boundary conditions that can be expressed in terms
    of just one coordinate (the radius). It is known how to solve Maxwell's
    equations,which are just differential equations, in an orthogonal coordinate
    system. This is done for a coaxial line in Section 2.9.

       When a positive voltage pulse is applied to the center conductor of the

coaxial line, as shown in Figure 2-2(a), an electric field results that is directed
from the center conductor to the outer conductor. Referring to Figure 2-2(b),
the component of the field that is directed along the shortest path from the
center conductor to the outer conductor is denoted ET , and the subscript
T denotes the transverse component of the field with the transverse plane
being perpendicular to the direction of propagation along the line. Figure 2-
2(b) shows the fields in the structure after the pulse has started moving along
the line. This is shown in another view in Figure 2-3 at four different times.
The transverse voltage, VT , is given by ET integrated along a path between
the inner and outer conductors: VT  ET (a - b). This is a good measure,
provided that the transverse dimensions are small compared to a wavelength
(otherwise the integral is then path dependent). The voltage pulse exciting
the line has a trapezoidal shape and Figure 2-3 shows the charge, QCENTER,
and current, ICENTER, on the center conductor and the transverse field, ET .
The voltage between the inner and outer conductor has the same form as
ET . As indicated by Maxwell's equations, a change in time of the electric
field results in a spatial change in the magnetic field and hence current. As
a result there is a variation of the current in time and this results in a spatial
change of the electric field. The chasing from a time variation to a spatial
variation and then back to a time variation causes the pulse to move down
the line.

   The pulse moves down the line at the group velocity, which for a lossless
coaxial line is the same as the phase velocity, vp.1 This is determined by the
physical properties of the region between the conductors. The permittivity,

1 The phase velocity is the apparent velocity of a point of constant phase on a sinewave and is
  almost frequency independent for a low-loss coaxial line of small transverse dimensions (less
  than /10).

               , describes energy storage associated with the electric field, E, and the
               energy storage associated with the magnetic field, H, is described by the
               permeability, . (Both  and  are properties of the medium--the material.)
               It has been determined that2

                                                         vp = 1/. (2.1)

               In a vacuum  = 0, the free-space permittivity, and  = 0, the free-space
               permeability. These are physical constants and have the values

               Permittivity of free space:  0 = 8.854  10-12 F/m.
               Permeability of free space:  0 = 4  10-7 H/m.

               One conclusion here is that EM energy can be stored in free space, i.e. in
               a vacuum. In free space vp = c = 1/00 = 3  108 m/s. The free-space
               wavelengths, 0 = c/f , at several frequencies, f , are

               Commonly 0 is used to indicate the wavelength in free space and g, the
               guide wavelength, is used to denote the wavelength on a transmission line.
               It is convenient to use the relative permittivity (or the less commonly used
               term dielectric constant), r, defined as

                                            r = /0.                                                   (2.2)

               Similarly the relative permeability is

                                            탍 = /0,                                                (2.3)

               and most materials have 탍 = 1. The permittivity, permeability, and
               conductivity of materials used in RF and microwave circuits are given in
               Appendix 2.A.

EXAMPLE 2.1 Transmission Line Wavelength

    A length of coaxial line is filled with a dielectric having a relative permittivity of 20 and is
    designed to be 1/4 wavelength long at a frequency, f , of 1.850 GHz.

    (a) What is the free-space wavelength?
    (b) What is the wavelength of the signal in the dielectric-filled coaxial line?
    (c) How long is the line?

    Solution:

    (a) 0 = c/f = 3  108/1.85  109 = 0.162 m = 16.2 cm.                            

    (b) Note that for a dielectric-filled line with 탍 = 1,  = vp/f = c/( rf ) = 0/ r, so
                    
     = 0/ r = 16.2 cm/ 20 = 3.62 cm.

    (c) g/4 = 3.62 cm/4 = 9.05 mm.

               2 This is derived from Maxwell's equations and describes the situation where the fields have a
                 very simple structure, in general where the fields are solely directed in the transverse plane.

2.2 Transmission Line Theory

This section develops the theory of signal propagation on transmission
lines. The first section, Section 2.2.1, makes the argument that a circuit
with resistors, inductors, and capacitors is a good model for a transmission
line. The complete development of transmission line theory is presented in
Section 2.2.2, and Section 2.2.3 relates the RLGC transmission line model to
the properties of a medium. The dimensions of some of the quantities that
appear in transmission line theory are discussed in Section 2.2.4. Section
2.2.5 summarizes the important parameters of a lossless line and then
two particularly important lines, coaxial lines and microstrip lines, are
considered in Sections 2.2.6 and 2.2.7.

2.2.1 Transmission Line RLGC Model

Regardless of the actual structure, a segment of uniform transmission line
(i.e., a line with constant cross section along its length) as shown in Figure
2-4(a) can be modeled by the circuit shown in Figure 2-4(b) with

Resistance along the line  =R

Inductance along the line  = L all specified

Conductance shunting the line = G per unit length.

Capacitance shunting the line = C

   Thus R, L, G, and C are also referred to as resistance, inductance,
conductance, and capacitance per unit length. (Sometimes p.u.l. is used
as shorthand for per unit length.) In the metric system, ohms per meter
(/m), henries per meter (H/m), siemens per meter (S/m) and farads
per meter (F/m), respectively, are used. The values of R, L, G, and C
are affected by the geometry of the transmission line and by the electrical
properties of the dielectrics and conductors. C describes the ability to
store electrical energy and is mostly due to the properties of the dielectric.
G describes loss in the dielectric which derives from conduction in the
dielectric and from dielectric relaxation. Most microwave substrates have
negligible conductivity so dielectric relaxation loss dominates. Dielectric
relaxation loss results from the movement of charge centers which result
in distortion of the dielectric lattice (if a crystal) or molecular structure.
The periodic variation of the E field transfers energy from the EM field
to mechanical vibrations. R is due to ohmic loss in the metal more than
anything else. L describes the ability to store magnetic energy and is mostly
a function of geometry, as most materials used with transmission lines have
탍 = 1 (so no more magnetic energy is stored than in a vacuum).

   For most lines the effects due to L and C dominate because of the relatively
low series resistance and shunt conductance. The propagation characteristics
of the line are described by its loss-free, or lossless, equivalent line, although
in practice some information about R or G is necessary to determine power

                       2.2.2 Derivation of Transmission Line Properties

                       In this section the differential equations governing the propagation of signals
                       on a transmission line are derived. These are coupled first-order differential
                       equations and are akin to Maxwell's Equations in one dimension. Solution of
                       the differential equations describes how signals propagate, and leads to the
                       extraction of a few parameters that describe transmission line properties.

                          Applying Kirchoff's laws applied to the model in Figure 2-4(b) and taking
                       the limit as z  0 the transmission line equations are

                                                   v(z, t) = -Ri(z, t) - L i(z, t) (2.4)
                                                       z                                   t

                                                    i(z, t) = -Gv(z, t) - C v(z, t) . (2.5)
                                                       z                                   t

V (z) is a phasor and  In sinusoidal steady-state using cosine-based phasors these become

                       units of nepers per meter (Np/m), and  is the phase-change coefficient,
                       or phase constant, and has units of radians per meter (expressed as rad/m
                       or radians/m). Nepers and radians are dimensionless units, but serve as
                       prompts for what is being referred to.

                          Equations (2.8) and (2.9) are second-order differential equations that have
                       solutions of the form

                       V (z) = V +e-z + V -ez0     0      (2.11)           and     I (z )  =      + -z    +    I - e z .  (2.12)

                                                                                                I0 e            0

                       The  physical    interpretation    of     these     solutions   is  that      V +(z)    =  V +e-z  and

                       Substituting Equation (2.11) in Equation (2.6) results in

The following quantities are defined:

Characteristic impedance:      Z0 = (R + L)/(G + C)                      (2.20)
     Propagation constant:                                               (2.21)
     Attenuation constant:      = (R + L)(G + C)                         (2.22)
              Phase constant:   = {}                                     (2.23)

where  = 2f is the radian frequency and f is the frequency with
the SI units of hertz (Hz). The wavenumber k as defined here is used in
electromagnetics and where wave propagation is concerned. Considering
one of the traveling waves, the phase velocity refers to the apparent velocity
of which a point of constant phase on the sinewave appears to move.

   For low-loss materials,   , and so   |k|, then the following
approximations are valid:

                 Characteristic impedance:      Z0  L/C                  (2.27)
                               Phase constant:                           (2.28)

                                                  2 = vp/f.

                                                      

The important result here is that a voltage wave (and a current wave) can be

defined on a transmission line. One more parameter needs to be introduced:

the group velocity,            vg =  .
                                      
                                                                         (2.32)

The group velocity is the velocity of a modulated waveform's envelope and
describes how fast information propagates. It is the velocity at which the
energy (i.e. information) in the waveform moves. Thus group velocity can
never be more than the speed of light in a vacuum, c. Phase velocity, however,
can be more than c. If the speed at which information moves varies with
frequency, then a signal such as a pulse will spread out. Such a line is said
58                       STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

                       to have dispersion. For a lossless, dispersionless line, the group and phase
                       velocity are the same. If the phase velocity is frequency independent, then 
                       is linearly proportional to .

                          Electrical length is used in designs with transmission lines prior to
                       establishing the physical length of the line. The electrical length of a line
                       is expressed either as a fraction of a wavelength or in degrees (or radians),
                       where a wavelength corresponds to 360 (or 2 radians). So if  is the phase
                       constant of a signal on the line and  is its physical length, the electrical length
                       of the line in radians is .

EXAMPLE 2.2 Physical and Electrical Length

      A transmission line is 10 cm long and at the operating frequency the phase constant  is
      30 rad/m. What is the electrical length of the line?

      Solution:

      The physical length of the line is  = 10 cm = 0.1 m. Then the electrical length of the line is
      e =  = (30 rad/m)  0.1 m = 3 radians. The electrical length can also be expressed in
      terms of wavelength noting that 360 corresponds to 2 radians, which also corresponds to
      . Thus e = (3 radians) = 3  360/(2) = 171.9 or e = 3/(2)  = 0.477 .

EXAMPLE 2.3 RLGC Parameters

    A transmission line has the RLGC parameters R = 100 /m, L = 80 nH/m, G = 1.6 S/m,
    and C = 200 pF/m. Consider a traveling wave at 2 GHz on the line.

    (a) What is the attenuation constant?
    (b) What is the phase constant?
    (c) What is the phase velocity?
    (d) What is the characteristic impedance of the line?
    (e) What is the group velocity?

    Solution:            (R + L) (G + C);  = 12.57  109 rad/s
    (a) :  =  +  =

     = (100 +   80  10-9) (1.6 + 200  10-12) = (17.94 + 51.85) m-1
     = {} = 17.94 Np/m

    (b) Phase constant:  = {} = 51.85 rad/m
    (c) Phase velocity:  2f 12.57  109rad  s-1 8

                             vp =  =  = 51.85 rad  m-1 = 2.42  10 m/s

    (d) Z0 = (R + L)/ = (100 +   80  10-9)/(17.94 + 51.85) = (17.9 + j4.3) 

    Note also that Z0 = (R + L)/(G + jC), which yields the same answer.

    (e) Group velocity:       vg = 
                                       f =2 GHz

    Numerical derivatives will be used, thus vg = /. Now  is already known at
    2 GHz. At 1.9 GHz,  = 17.884 + 49.397 m-1, and so  = 49.397 rad/m.

    vg =  2(2 GHz - 1.9 GHz)     2(2 - 1.9)109 Hz                        8
                              =                            -1 = 2.563  10 m/s.

2.2.3 Relationship of RLGC parameters to Permittivity and
         Permeability of a Medium

In the previous section the telegrapher's equations for a transmission
line modeled as subsections of RLGC elements was derived. Very good
accuracy is obtained if the length of a subsection is no more than one-
twentieth of a wavelength. The full transmission line model is the cascade
of many transmission line subsections (e.g. see Figure 2-5). In this section
the RLGC parameters are related to the physical parameters of permittivity
and permeability. The development does not go into much detail, as the
derivation is involved and can only be derived analytically for a few regular
transmission line structures. If you are curious, the development is done for
a parallel plate waveguide and a rectangular waveguide in Chapter 6 and
for a coaxial line in Section 2.9.

   The main parameters describing propagation on a transmission line are Z0
and , and these depend on the permeability and permittivity of the medium
and the spatial variation of the E and H fields resulting from the geometry of
the conductors. Only a few geometries permit analytic solution of the fields
so in general a numerical field solution is required and Z0 and  derived.
Very often equations are curve fit to the numerical solutions but the structure
of the equations have a theoretical foundation. It is found that there can be a
number of possible field solutions (not unusual for the solution of differential
equations) each of which is called a mode. Modes that have all the fields in
the transverse plane (perpendicular to the propagation direction) is called a
transverse EM (TEM) mode and these modes exist at DC. The other modes
are only possible above a cut-off frequency. It is found that the propagation
constant has the form

                    2 = -  k2  -    2  ,  (2.33)

                                  kc

where kc is the cutoff wavenumber and for a particular line usually has a
different value for each mode. The wavenumber of a homogeneous line is

                    k = .                (2.34)

A mode can only exist and describe a propagating signal when  = {}
is not zero which requires that 2 be negative. Thus a mode can support
a propagating mode only if the wavenumber is greater than the cut-off
wavenumber, i.e. when k > kc. A TEM mode has kc = 0 so a signal, other
than DC can always propagate on the line in a TEM mode. A homogeneous
line has just one type of medium supporting the EM fields. An example of
a homogeneous line is a teflon-filled coaxial line. A non-homogeneous line
has two or or more dielectric mediums, such as air and a dielectric. For non-
homogeneous lines the concept of an equivalent homogeneous line with an
effective permittivity eff and effective permeability 킻ff is used. Then

                    k = 킻ff eff          (2.35)

    Comparing  in Equations (2.10) and (2.35), an equivalence can be developed
    between the lumped-element form of transmission line propagation and the
    propagation of an EM wave in a medium. Specifically,

    -2킻ff eff = (R + L)(G + C).                                               (2.40)

    Lossless Medium
    If the medium is lossless ( and  are real and R = 0 = G), then

    킻ff eff = LC.                                                             (2.41)

    When the medium is free space (a vacuum), then a subscript zero is used.

    Free space is also lossless, so the following results hold:

    0 = 0 and 0 = - = 00 = LC.                                                (2.42)

    If frequency is specified in gigahertz (indicated by fGHz), in free space

    0 = 20.958fGHz units of rads/m.                                            (2.43)

    At 1 GHz, 0 = 20.958 rad/m and 0 = 29.98 cm (use 0  30 cm at 1 GHz

    as a reference). In a lossless medium with effective relative permeability

    킻 = 킻ff/0 = 1 and effective relative permittivity e = eff/0,

     = e0.                                                                     (2.44)

       Z0 depends strongly on the spatial variation of the fields. When there is
    no variation in the plane transverse to the direction of propagation (i.e. for
    plane wave propagation)

    Z0 = /.                                                                   (2.45)

    However, if there is variation of the fields

    Z0 =  킻ff/eff =  0/0 킻/e,                                               (2.46)

    where  captures the effect of geometric variation of the fields. Spatial
    variation of the fields stores additional energy in the E and H fields, affecting
     as well as Z0.

       If the boundary conditions on a transmission line are such that a required

    spatial variation of the fields cannot be supported, then the signal cannot
                                                                         

    propagate. The critical frequency at which k =   = kc is called the
    cutoff frequency, fc. Signals cannot propagate on the line if the frequency is
    below fc. For the rest of this chapter the only lines considered are those for
    which kc = 0, (and fc = 0), i.e. TEM modes on transmission lines. That is,
    the lines carry DC signals.

Low Loss Medium

Transmission line loss is due to the resistance of conductors, which is de-
scribed by R, and loss in the dielectric described by G. For most dielectrics
there is very little conductive loss and loss is due almost entirely to dielec-
tric relaxation. (The most common exception is when the dielectric is silicon
as there can be appreciable conduction in silicon.) In dielectric relaxation an
electric field causes charge centers to move and these cause the lattice to vi-
brate which we know is heat so energy is transferred from the electric field
to heat. The energy lost is proportional to frequency and so G is directly pro-
portional to frequency and consequently, provided there is no conduction in
the dielectric, the loss tangent of the transmission line is thus defined as:

tan  = G/C = independent of frequency.         (2.47)

One consequence of Equation (2.47), and noting that C is approximately
independent of frequency, is that if G is known at one frequency then its
value at another frequency can be quickly determined.

   The loss tangent of the dielectric medium and the loss tangent of the
transmission line may not be the same as the EM fields may not be confined
just to the medium, e.g. fields are in air and in a dielectric.

2.2.4 Dimensions of , , and 

The SI unit of  are inverse meters (m-1) and the attenuation constant, , and     The name for e
the phase constant, , have, strictly speaking, the same units. However, the      derives from John
convention is to introduce the dimensionless quantities Neper and radian         Napier, who
to convey additional information. Thus the attenuation constant  has the         developed the theory
units of Nepers per meter (Np/m) and the phase constant  has the units           of logarithms [3]. e is
radians per meter (rad/m). The unit Neper comes from the name of the             sometimes called
e (= 2.7182818284590452354. . .) symbol (written in upright font and not         Euler's constant.
italics since it is a constant), which is called the Neper. The Neper is used
in calculating transmission line signal levels, as in Equations (2.11) and       In engineering
(2.12). The attenuation and phase constants are often separated and then the     log x  log10 x and

travels down a transmission line. So when  = 1 Np, where  is the length of
the line, the signal has decreased to 1/e of its original value, and the power
drops to 1/e2 of its original value. The decrease in signal level represents
loss and the units of decibels per meter (dB/m) are used with 1 Np = 20 log e
= 8.6858896381 dB. So expressing  as 1 Np/m is the same as saying that
the attenuation loss is 8.6859 dB/m. To convert from dB to Np multiply by
0.1151. Thus  = x dB/m = x  0.1151 Np/m.

EXAMPLE 2.4 Transmission Line Characteristics

A line has an attenuation of 10 dB/m and a phase constant of 50 radians/m at 2 GHz.

(a) What is the complex propagation constant of the transmission line?
(b) If the capacitance of the line is 100 pF/m and the conductive loss is zero (i.e., G = 0),

     what is the characteristic impedance of the line?

Solution:

(a) |Np = 0.1151  |dB = 0.1151 (10 dB/m) = 1.151 Np/m,  = 50 rad/m
     Propagation constant,  =  +  = (1.151 + 50) m-1

(b)  = (R + L) (G + C), and Z0 = (R + L)/(G + C),
     therefore Z0 = /(G + C);  = 2  2  109 s-1; G = 0; C = 100  10-12 F,
     so Z0 = 39.8 - 0.916 .

    2.2.5 Lossless Transmission Line

    If the conductor and dielectric are ideal (i.e., lossless), then R = 0 = G and
    the equations for the transmission line characteristics simplify. The transmis-
    sion line parameters from Equations (2.15) and (2.21)-(2.26) are then

    Z0 =  CL         (2.48)           =0          (2.49)
     =  LC           (2.50)           vp = 1/ LC  (2.51)

    2         vp
    g =  = .
     LC f

       Note that there is a distinction between a transmission line and an RLC
    circuit. When a transmission line is referred to as having an impedance of
    50 , this is referring to the line having a characteristic impedance of 50 ,
    the line cannot be replaced by a 50  resistor.

       A line cannot be replaced by a lumped element except as follows:

    1. When calculating the forward voltage wave of a line that is infinitely
       long (or there are no reflections from the load). Then the line can be
       replaced by an impedance equal to the characteristic impedance of the
       line. The total voltage is then only the forward-traveling component.

    2. The characteristic impedance and load impedance are used to calculate
       the input impedance of the terminated line at a particular frequency.

    2.2.6 Coaxial Line

    The analytic calculation of the characteristic impedance of a transmission line
    from geometry is not always possible except for a few regular geometries
    (matching orthogonal coordinate systems). For a coaxial line, the electric
    fields extend in a radial direction from the center conductor to the outer
    conductor. So it is possible to calculate the voltage by integrating this E
    field from the center to the outer conductor. The magnetic field is circular,
    centered on the center conductor, so the current on the conductor can
    be calculated as the closed integral of the magnetic field. (Here the field
    lines and the conductor boundaries correspond to the cylindrical coordinate
    system.) Solving for the fields in the region between the center and outer
    conductors yields the following formula for the characteristic impedance of
    a coaxial line (the derivation is presented in Section 2.9):

              Z0 = 138 탍 log b  = 60 탍 ln b ,   (2.53)
                  r          a        r  a

    where r is the relative permittivity of the medium between the center and
    outer conductors, b is the inner diameter of the outer conductor, and a is
    the outer diameter of the inner conductor. With a higher , more energy is
    stored in the electric field and the capacitance per unit length of the line, C,
    increases. As the relative permittivity of the line increases, the characteristic
    impedance of the line reduces. Equation (2.53) is an exact formulation for
    the characteristic impedance of a coaxial line. Such a formula can only be
    approximated for nearly every other line.

       Most coaxial cables have Z0 of 50 , but different ratios of b and a yield
    special properties of the coaxial line. When the ratio is 1.65 for an air-filled
    line, Z0 = 30  and the line has maximum power-carrying capability. The
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                      63

ratio for maximum voltage breakdown is 2.7, corresponding to Z0 = 60  for
an air-filled line. The characteristic impedance for minimum attenuation in
an air-filled line is 77 , with a diameter ratio of 3.59. This optimum ratio of
outer-to-inner conductors for minimum loss is independent of the dielectric
and typical dielectrics have negligible loss with line loss due almost entirely
due to the conductors. If the dielectric filling the coaxial line is polyethylene
(which is most common) with r = 2.3, the characteristic impedance of the
minimum loss line is 50.6 .

   The velocity of propagation in a lossless coaxial line having uniform
medium is the same as that for a plane wave in the medium, i.e. vg =

  
c/ r. There is one caveat. This is true for all transmission line structures
supporting the minimum variation of the fields corresponding to a TEM
mode. Higher-order modes, with greater spatial variations of the fields will

                                           
travel more slowly (i.e. vg < c/ r), will be considered in Chapter 4. The
diameter of the outer conductor and the type of internal supports for the
internal conductor determines the frequency range of coaxial components.
At high frequencies, and hence short wavelengths, large internal dimensions
of a large diameter cable can support more than one spatial variation of
the EM fields, i.e. more than one mode. This is undesirable because two
modes will travel at different speeds and a propagating signal divides energy
between the two modes and, since the modes have different group velocities,
the signal will become garbled. Thus the transverse dimensions of the cable
determine its upper frequency limit for reliable signal transmission.

   There are various coaxial lines with different diameters and different levels
of attention given to the uniformity of the lines. Each type of line is called a
series and it is necessary to convert between series using adaptors. Various
adaptors are shown in Figure 2-6. Primarily these have different cost, loss,
and uniformity of Z0. It is often necessary to convert between series and also
to convert between the sexes (male and female) of connectors. Note that a
plug (or jack) could be either female or male.

   The different construction of connectors can be seen in Figure 2-7. With
the APC-7 connector shown in Figure 2-7(a) the inside diameter of the outer
conductor is 7 mm. The unique feature of this connector is that it is sexless,
with the interface plate being spring-loaded. That is, an APC-7 connector
can always be connected to another APC-7 connector. These are precision

               in Figure 2-7(b) and the SMA connector in Figure 2-7(c) are more common
               day-to-day connectors. Different views of these connectors are shown in
               Figures 2-7(d and e). Unlike an APC-7 connector, an N-type (or SMA) male
               connector, for example, can only be connected to a female N-type connector.
               There are a large number of different types or series of connectors for high-
               power applications, different frequency ranges, distortion levels, and cost.

                  There are also many types of coaxial cables, as shown in Figure 2-
               8(a). These are cables with SMA connectors (with 3.5 mm outer conductor
               diameter). Microwave cables without connectors are shown in Figure 2-8(b).
               These cables range in cost, flexibility, and the number of times they can be
               reliably flexed or bent. The semirigid cable shown at the bottom of Figure
               2-8(a) must be bent using a bending tool, as shown in Figure 2-8(c), and in
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                65

use in Figure 2-8(d). The controlled bending radius ensures minimal change
in the characteristic impedance and propagation constant of the cable.
Semirigid cables can only be bent once however. The highest precision bend
is realized using an elbow bend, shown in Figure 2-6(g). Various flexible
cables have different responses to bending, with higher precision (and more
expensive) cables having the least impact on characteristic impedance and
phase variations as cables are flexed.

   Precision measurements require that connectors be repeatably attached
using a torque wrench, as shown in Figure 2-9. A torque wrench can be
used in a conventional manner, but once the prescribed torque is obtained
the wrench breaks just above the head. This ensures that two connectors
are repeatably joined with the same force and so the contact resistance and
quality of the connection is repeatable.

2.2.7 Microstrip Line

A microstrip line is shown in Figure 2-10(a). This is a commonly used
transmission line, as it can be cheaply fabricated using printed circuit
board techniques. This line consists of a metal-backed substrate of relative
permittivity r on top of which is a metal strip. Above that is air. The
width of the strip determines the characteristic impedance of the line. The
characteristic impedance of microstrip lines having various strip widths is
shown in Figure 2-11 for several substrate permittivities. So the wider the
strip and the higher the substrate permittivity, the lower the characteristic
impedance of the line. The EM fields are partly in air and partly in the
dielectric and an effective permittivity must be used when calculating
the electrical length of the line. The results of field simulations of the
effective permittivity of lines of various widths and with various substrate
permittivities are shown in Figure 2-12, where it can be seen that the effective
relative permittivity, e, increases for wide strips. This is because more of the
EM field is in the substrate. Microstrip transmission line structures are often
drawn showing just the layout of the strip, as shown in Figure 2-10(b), where

    2.2.8 Summary

    The important takeaway from this section is that a signal moves on a
    transmission line as forward- and backward-traveling waves. The energy
    transferred is in the traveling waves. The total voltage and current at a point
    on the line is the sum of the traveling voltage and traveling current waves,
    respectively, but the total voltage/current view is not sufficient to describe
    how a transmission line works. Transmission line theory is expressed in
    terms of traveling voltage and current waves and these are akin to a one-
    dimensional form of Maxwell's equations. An argument was developed that
    posits a model of a line as cascaded sections of RLGC circuit and these circuit
    elements can be loosely related to the material properties of the medium
    in which the transmission line is embedded. There are a modification
    factors due to the actual orientation of the electric and magnetic fields and
    developing these requires detailed field analysis of the actual transmission
    line geometry. This can be done for a coaxial line but a microstrip line
    requires numerical analysis.

    2.3 The Lossless Terminated Line

    Microwave engineers want to work with total voltage and current when
    possible and the art of design synthesis usually requires relating the total
    voltage and current world of a lumped element circuit to the traveling
    voltage world of transmission lines. This section develops the important
    abstractions that enable the total voltage and current view of the world to
    be used with transmission lines. The first step in this process is in Section
    2.3.1 where total voltages and currents are related to forward- and backward-

traveling voltages and currents. Insight into traveling waves and reflections
is presented in Section 2.3.2. Important abstractions are presented first for
the input reflection coefficient of a terminated lossless line in Section 2.3.3
and then for the input impedance of the line in Section 2.3.4. The last section,
Section 2.3.5, presents a view of the total voltage on the transmission line and
describes the voltage standing wave concept.

2.3.1 Total Voltage and Current on the Line

Consider the terminated line shown in Figure 2-13(a). Assume an incident
                                                                V + e-z
or  forward-traveling  wave,    with    traveling   voltage              and  current
I+ e-z                                                            0

 0      propagating    toward      the  load  ZL    at  z  =    0. The characteristic

impedance of the transmission line is the ratio of the voltage and current

traveling waves so that

             V +(z) V + e-z V +(0) V +
             0 =0                       = 0 = 0 = Z0.                         (2.54)
             I0+(z)      I+ e-z         I0+(0)               +

                          0                                I0

The reflected wave has a similar relationship (but note the sign change):

                         V - ez         V-
                         0 -I- ez = 0 -I- = Z0.                               (2.55)

                                0             0

The load ZL imposes an additional constraint on the relationship of the total
voltage and current at z = 0:

                         VL = V (z = 0) = ZL.                                 (2.56)
                         IL I(z = 0)

When ZL = Z0 there must be a reflected wave with appropriate amplitude
to satisfy the above equations. Now the total voltage

                         V (z) = V + e-z + V - ez,0 0                         (2.57)

and the total current, I(z), is related to the traveling current waves by

                +                     -             + -z        - z

             V0 -z                 V0 z
             I(z) = Z0 e - Z0 e = I0 e + I0 e .                               (2.58)

Thus at the termination of the line (z = 0),

                         V (0)                   +      -
                                              V0 + V0
                                = ZL = Z0 + - .
                         I (0)                V0 - V0
68     STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    This can be rearranged as the ratio of the reflected voltage to the incident

    voltage:

                                       -   ZL - Z0    .

                                    V0
                                       +=
                                    V0 ZL + Z0

    This ratio is defined as the voltage reflection coefficient at the load,

                                       -       -
                             V V0 (0) V0 ZL - Z0
                          L = L = + = + =                      .              (2.59)
                                       V0 (0) V0 ZL + Z0

    That is, at the load

                                       -       +
                                       V0 = LV0 .                             (2.60)

       The relationship of the traveling waves on the line can also be described
    using the transmission coefficient T (this is the capital Greek letter tau which
    looks the same as the English letter `T'.)

       The voltage transmission coefficient from a port at position z to a port at
    position 0 is (for the transmission line)

                 V V0+(at end of line) V0+(0)               +        z
       T =T = +
                                                         V0
                                           = + = + -z = e .                   (2.61)
                 V0 (at start of line) V0 (z) V0 e

       The relationship in Equation (2.59) can be rewritten so that the input load
    impedance can be obtained from the reflection coefficient:

                                               1 + V
                                    ZL = Z0        V.                         (2.62)
                                               1-

    Similarly, the current reflection coefficient can be written as

                                    -
                             I I0 -ZL + Z0               V
                           = +=                       = - .                   (2.63)
                             I0           ZL + Z0

    The voltage reflection coefficient is used most of the time, so the reflection
    coefficient, , on its own refers to the voltage reflection coefficient, V = .

       There are several special cases that are noteworthy. The most important of
    these is the case when there is no reflected wave and  = 0. To obtain  = 0,
    the value of load impedance, ZL, is equal to Z0, the characteristic impedance
    of the transmission line as seen in Equation (2.59).

       The total voltage and current waves on the line can be written as

    V  (z)    =     + -z  +  e z ]     (2.64)           V+                    (2.65)
                                               I(z) = 0 [e-z - ez].
                 V0 [e
                                                         Z0

    From Equations (2.64) and (2.65) it can be seen that the total voltage and
    current on the line consist of superpositions of incident and reflected waves.

EXAMPLE 2.5 Forward- and Backward-Traveling Waves at an Open Circuit

A lossless transmission line is terminated in an open circuit. What is the relationship between
the forward- and backward-traveling voltage waves at the end of the line?

Solution:
At the end of the line the total current is zero, so that I+ + I- = 0 and so

                                               I- = -I+.                             (2.66)

The forward- and backward traveling voltages and currents are related to the characteristic
impedance by

                                     Z0 = V +/I+ = -V -/I-,                          (2.67)

Note the change in sign, as a result of the direction of propagation changing but the positive
reference for current is in the same direction. Substituting for I- at the termination,

                           V + = -V -I+/I- = -V -I+/(-I+) = V -.                     (2.68)

Thus the total voltage at the end of the line, VTOTAL, is V + + V - = 2V +. Note that the total
voltage at the end of the line is twice the incident (forward-traveling) voltage.

EXAMPLE 2.6 Current Reflection Coefficient

A load consists of a shunt connection of a capacitor of 10 pF and a resistor of 60 . The load
terminates a lossless 50  transmission line. The operating frequency is 5 GHz.

(a) What is the impedance of the load?
(b) What is the normalized impedance of the load (normalized to Z0 of the line)?
(c) What is the reflection coefficient of the load?
(d) What is the current reflection coefficient of the load?

Solution:
(a) C = 10  10-12 F; R = 60 ; f = 5  109 Hz;  = 2f ; Z0 = 50 

                           ZL = R||C = (1/R + C)-1 = 0.168 - 3.174 .

(b) zL = ZL/Z0 = 3.368  10-3 - 0.063.

(c) This is the voltage reflection coefficient. L = (zL - 1)/(zL + 1) = -0.985 - 0.126 =

     0.993 187.3.

(d)    I  =  -L  =  0.985  +  0.126  =  0.993  (187.3 - 180) = 0.993  7.3 .

2.3.2 Forward- and Backward-Traveling Pulses

Reflections at the end of a line produce a backward-traveling signal.
Forward- and backward-traveling pulses are shown in Figure 2-14(a) for
the situation where the resistance at the end of the line is lower than the
characteristic impedance of the line (ZL < Z0). The voltage source is a step
voltage that is zero for time t < 0. At time t = 0, the step is applied to the line
and it begins traveling down the line, as shown at time t = 1. This voltage
step moving from left to right is called the forward-traveling voltage wave.

   At time t = 2, the leading edge of the step reaches the load, and as the
load has lower resistance than the characteristic impedance of the line, the
70  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    total voltage across the load drops below the level of the forward-traveling
    voltage step. The reflected wave is called the backward-traveling wave and
    it must be negative, as it adds to the forward-traveling wave to yield the
    total voltage. Thus the voltage reflection coefficient, , is negative and the
    total voltage on the line, which is all that can be directly observed, drops. A
    reflected, smaller, and opposite step signal travels in the backward direction
    and adds to the forward-traveling step to produce the waveform shown at
    t = 3. The impedance of the source matches the transmission line impedance
    so that the reflection at the source is zero. The signal on the line at time
    t = 4, the time for round-trip propagation on the line, therefore remains
    at the lower value. The easiest way to remember the polarity of the reflected
    pulse is to consider the situation with a short-circuit at the load. Then the
    total voltage on the line at the load must be zero. The only way this can occur
    when a signal is incident is if the reflected signal is equal in magnitude but
    opposite in sign, in this case  = -1. So whenever |ZL| < |Z0|, the reflected
    pulse will tend to subtract from the incident pulse.

       The opposite situation occurs when the resistance at the load is higher
    than the characteristic impedance of the line (Figure 2-14(b)). In this case
    the reflected pulse has the same polarity as the incident signal. Again, to
    remember this, think of the open-circuited case. The voltage across the load
    doubles, as the reflected pulse has the same sign as well as magnitude as that
    of the incident signal, in this case  = +1. This is required so that the total
    current is zero.

       A more illustrative situation is shown in Figure 2-15, where a more

    (a) RL < Z0  (b) RL > Z0

lower than the characteristic impedance of the line, Z0; and (b) when RL is greater than Z0.

pulses. ZL > Z0.

complicated signal is incident on a load that has a resistance higher than
that of the characteristic impedance of the line. The peaking of the voltage
that results at the load is typically the design objective in many long digital
interconnects, as less overall signal energy needs to be transmitted down the
line, or equivalently a lower current drive capability of the source is required
to achieve first incidence switching. This is at the price of having reflected
signals on the interconnects, but these are dissipated through a combination
of line loss and absorption of the reflected signal at the driver.

2.3.3 Input Reflection Coefficient of a Lossless Line

The reflection coefficient looking into a line varies with position along the
line as the forward- and backward-traveling waves change in relative phase.
Referring to Figure 2-16, at a distance  from the load (i.e., z = -), the input

load ZL.                         (a)                                 (b)

Figure 2-17: The forward-

traveling wave v+(t, z) =

|V +| cos(t + (z)) and

the backward-traveling wave

v-(t, z) =

|V +| cos[t + (z)]. The

phase, , of the forward-

traveling wave becomes

increasingly negative along

the line as z increases, and

when reflected the phase 

of the backward-traveling

wave becomes increasingly

negative as the wave moves

away from the load (i.e. as z

decreases).

              reflection looking into a terminated lossless line is

                                 V -(z = -) V -(z = 0)e- V -(z = 0) e-       -2
              in|z=- = +         =+                    + = +         + = Le
                                 V (z = -) V (z = 0)e  V (z = 0) e

                                                                             (2.69)

              Note that in has the same magnitude as L but rotates in the clockwise

              direction (becomes increasingly negative) at twice the rate of increase of the

              electrical length .

                 It is important to graphical concepts introduced later that there be a full

              appreciation for the angle of in becoming increasingly negative at twice

              the rate at which the electrical length of the line increases. Figure 2-17 is

              a way of visualizing this. The transmission line here is /4 long with an
              electrical length of 90 and is terminated in a load with reflection coefficient
              L = +1. At position z = 0 the forward-traveling voltage wave is v+(t, 0) =
              |V +| cos(t), and this then propagates down the line in the +z direction. The

              forward-traveling voltage at point z = /8 at t = 0 will be the same as the
              voltage at z = 0 at a time one-eighth of a period in the past. The voltage at z =
              /8 is v+(t, /8) = |V +| cos(t - 2/8), i.e. there is a phase rotation of -45.
              Then at z = /4, v+(t, /4) = |V +| cos(t - 2/4), i.e. at time t = 0 there
              is a phase rotation of -90 relative to v+(0, 0), and this is the negative of the

              electrical length of the line. The voltage wave reflects at the load and becomes
              a backward-traveling wave. Here L = +1 and so, at the load, the phase of

              the backward- and forward-traveling waves are the same. The backward-
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                 73

traveling wave continues to travel in the -z direction and its phase at t = 0

becomes increasingly negative as z gets closer to the input of the line. The
phase of the backward-traveling wave at z = 0 is rotated -90 with respect
to the backward-traveling wave at the load, and has rotated -180 relative

to the forward-traveling wave at z = 0. For a lossless line, in general, the
angle of in = [phase of V -(z = 0) relative to the phase of V +(z = 0)] +

(the phase of L) = -2(electrical length of the line) + (the phase of L).

2.3.4 Input Impedance of a Lossless Line

The impedance looking into a lossless line varies with position, as
the forward- and backward-traveling waves combine to yield position-
dependent total voltage and current. At a distance  from the load (i.e.,
z = -), the input impedance seen looking toward the load is

Zin|z=- =  V (z = -)  = Z0    1 + || e(-2)             1 + Le(-2)
                                           (-2) = Z0           (-2) .  (2.70)
           I(z = -)           1 - || e                 1 - Le

Another form is obtained by substituting Equation (2.59) in Equation (2.70):

Zin = Z0  (ZL + Z0)e + (ZL - Z0)e-                     ZL cos() + Z0 cos()
                                           - = Z0
                 
          (ZL + Z0)e - (ZL - Z0)e                      Z0 cos() + ZL cos()

= Z0 ZL + Z0 tan  .                                                    (2.71)
      Z0 + ZL tan 

This is the lossless telegrapher's equation. The electrical length, , is in
radians when used in calculations.

2.3.5 Standing Waves and Voltage Standing Wave Ratio

The total voltage on a terminated line is the sum of forward- and backward-

traveling waves. This sum produces what is called a standing wave. Figure

2-18 shows the total and traveling waveforms on a line terminated in a

reactance and evaluated at times equal to multiples of an eighth of a period.

Here the traveling waves have the same amplitude indicating that the

termination of the line is reactive, || = 1. The interesting property here is

that the total voltage appears as a standing wave with fixed points called

nodes where the total voltage is always zero. This is more easily seen in

Figure 2-19(a), where the total voltage is overlaid for many times. If the

termination has resistance, then the magnitude of the backward-traveling

wave will be less than that of the forward-traveling wave and the overlaid

total voltage is as shown in Figure 2-19(b). This is still a standing wave, but

the minima are now not zero. The envelope of this standing wave is shown

in Figure 2-19(c), where there is a maximum amplitude Vmax and a minimum

amplitude Vmin.

Now this situation will be examined mathematically to relate the standing

wave to the reflection coefficient. If  = 0, then the magnitude of the total
                                              +
voltage on the line, |V (z)|, is equal to        anywhere on the line. For this
                                           V0

reason, such a line is said to be "flat." If there is reflection the magnitude of

the total voltage on the line is not constant (see Figure 2-19(b)). Thus from

Equations (2.64) and (2.65):

           |V (z)| =     +    1 + e2z      =        +  1 + e-2 ,       (2.72)

the phase term is e(-2l) = -1, and is given by

                      Vmin =     +   (1  -  ||).                          (2.75)

                              V0

A mismatch can be defined by the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR):

VSWR = Vmax = (1 + ||) . (2.76)      Also || = VSWR - 1 .                 (2.77)
             Vmin (1 - ||)                            VSWR + 1

Notice that in general  is complex, but VSWR is necessarily always real and
1  VSWR  . For the matched condition,  = 0 and VSWR = 1, and
the closer VSWR is to 1, the closer the load is to being matched to the line
and the more power is delivered to the load. The magnitude of the reflection
coefficient on a line with a short-circuit or open-circuit load is 1, and in both
cases the VSWR is infinite.

   To determine the position of the standing wave maximum, max, consider
Equation (2.73) and note that at the maximum

                    - 2max = 2n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .                     (2.78)

Here  is the angle of the reflection coefficient at the load:             (2.79)
                                     - 2n = 2 2 max .
                                                     g

Thus the position of the voltage maxima, lmax, normalized to wavelength is

             max = 1           -n ,  n = 0, -1, -2, . . . .               (2.80)
              g 2             2

Similarly the position of the voltage minima is (using Equation (2.73)):

                     - 2min = (2n + 1).                                   (2.81)

After rearranging the terms,

             min = 1  - n + 1 ,          n = 0, -1, -2, . . . .           (2.82)
             g 2 2            2

Summarizing from Equations (2.80) and (2.82):

1. The distance between two successive maxima is g/2.
2. The distance between two successive minima is g/2.
3. The distance between a maximum and an adjacent minimum is g/4.
4. From the measured VSWR the magnitude of the reflection coefficient

   || can be found. From the measured max the angle  of  can be
   found. Then from  the load impedance can be found.

In a similar manner to that above, the magnitude of the total current on

the line is

                               V+                                         (2.83)
                   |I()| = 0 1 - ||e(-2) .

                               Z0

Hence the standing wave current is maximum where the standing-wave
voltage amplitude is minimum, and minimum where the standing-wave
voltage amplitude is maximum.

   Zin in Equation 2.71 is a periodic function of length with period /2 and it
varies between Zmax and Zmin, where

Zmax = Vmax = Z0  VSWR and Zmin = Vmin = Z0 .                            (2.84)

  EXAMPLE 2.7  Standing Wave Ratio

In Example 2.6 the load consisted of a capacitor of 10 pF in shunt with a resistor of 60 . The
load terminated a lossless 50  transmission line. The operating frequency is 5 GHz.

(a) What is the SWR?
(b) What is the current standing wave ratio (ISWR)? (When SWR is used on its own it is

     assumed to refer to VSWR.)

Solution:
(a) From Example 2.6 L = 0.993 187.3 and so

                        VSWR = 1 + |L| = 1 + 0.993 = 285.
                                     1 - |L| 1 - 0.993

(b) ISWR = VSWR = 285.

EXAMPLE 2.8 Standing Waves

A load has an impedance ZL = 45 + 75  and the system reference impedance, Z0, is 100 .

(a) What is the reflection coefficient?
(b) What is the current reflection coefficient?
(c) What is the SWR?
(d) What is the ISWR?
(e) The power available from a source with a 100  Thevenin equivalent impedance is 1 mW.

     The source is connected directly to the load, ZL. Use the reflection coefficient to calculate
     the power delivered to ZL.
(f) What is the total power absorbed by the Thevenin equivalent source impedance?
(g) Discuss the effect on power flow of inserting a lossless 100  transmission line between
     the source and the load.

Solution:

(a) The voltage reflection coefficient is

               L = (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0) = (45 + 75 - 100)/(45 + 75 + 100)                                         (2.85)
                   = (93.0 (2.204 rads))/(163.2 (0.4773 rads))
                   = 0.570 (1.726 rads) = 0.570 98.9 = -0.0881 + 0.563 = V .

(b) The current reflection coefficient is                                                                        (2.86)
              I = -V = 0.0881 - 0.563 = 0.570 (98.9 - 180) = 0.570 81.1.

(c) The SWR is the VSWR, so     Vmax 1 + |V | 1 + 0.570

               SWR = VSWR =         =                                                      V=           = 3.65.  (2.87)
                                    Vmin 1 - | | 1 - 0.570

(d) The current SWR is ISWR = VSWR.
(e) To determine the reflection coefficient of the load, begin

     by developing the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the
     load. The power available from the source is PA =
     1 mW, so the Thevenin equivalent circuit is

The power reflected by the load is

               PR = PA L = 1 mW  (0.570) = 0.325 mW2                                      2

and the power delivered to the load is                                                     = 0.675 mW.

(f) It is tempting to think that the power dissipated in RTH is just PR. However, this is not
    correct. Instead, the current in RTH must be determined and then the power dissipated
    in RTH found. Let the current through RTHcdot be I, and this is composed of forward-
    and backward-traveling components:

                                             I = I+ + I- = (1 + I )I+,

where I+ is the forward-traveling current wave. Thus
                      PA = 21 |I+|2RTH = 21 |I+|2  100 = 1 mW = 10-3 W,

so I+ = 4.47 mA, and
        I = (1 + I )I+ = (1 + 0.0881 - 0.563)  4.47  10-3 A, |I| = 5.48 mA.

The power dissipated in RTH is

                    PTH = 21 |I|2RTH = 21 (5.48  10-3)2RTH = 1.50 mW.           (2.88)

The circuit is that shown in part (e) and so the current in RTH is the same as the current
in ZL. Thus the power delivered to the load ZL is due to the real part of ZL:

     PD = 21 I2 (ZL) = 21 (5.48  10-3)2  45 = 0.676 mW                         (2.89)

(g) Inserting a transmission line with the same characteristic impedance as the Thevenin
     equivalent impedance will have no effect on power flow.

VSWR Measurement

The measurement of standing waves can be used to calculate the impedance
of a load. The device that does this measurement, called a slotted line,
is shown in Figure 2-20(a). A probe is inserted a small distance into the
transmission line to measure the electric field. The RF electric field produces
an RF voltage on the probe that is rectified by the diode detector. The DC
voltage at the output of the detector is proportional to the total voltage on
the line. The probe can be moved along the line and the ratio of Vmax to Vmin
determined. This is just the VSWR. To find the complex load impedance it is
also necessary to determine the position of the node of the standing wave.
From the measured VSWR the magnitude of the reflection coefficient || can
be found. From the measured max the angle  of  can be found. From  the
load impedance can be found. This is demonstrated in the next example.
78  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

EXAMPLE 2.9 Slotted Line Measurement of Impedance

    A slotted line is used to determine the properties of the standing wave on a terminated 50 
    line see Figure 2-19(c). Vmax = 5 V and Vmin = 2 V, and the first minimum is 2 cm from the
    load. The guide wavelength is 10 cm. What is the load impedance ZL?

    Solution:

    Now VSWR = Vmax/Vmin = 5/2 = 2.5. So from Equation (2.77)

    || = |L| = VSWR - 1 = 2.5 - 1 = 0.428.                   (2.90)
                     VSWR + 1 2.5 + 1

    Equation (2.82) and the position of the first node can be used to determine the angle of L.
    For the first node (minimum), n = 0 and

    min  = g 21 2 + 12 .  (2.91) Rearranging,  = 2 2 min - 1 radians. (2.92)
                                                                       g 2

    Now min = 2 cm and g = 10 cm. So, in degrees,

     = 360 2 min - 1               = 360 2 2 - 1     = -36.  (2.93)
                     g 2                       10 2

    Thus L = 0.428 (-36) = 0.3463 - 0.2516, so the load impedance is (where Z0 = 50 )

                          ZL = Z0  1 + L  = 83.2 - 51.3 .    (2.94)
                                   1 - L

    2.3.6 Summary

    This section related the physics of traveling voltage and current waves on
    lossless transmission lines to the total voltage and current view. First the
    input reflection coefficient of a terminated lossless line was developed and
    from this the input impedance, which is the ratio of total voltage and total
    current, derived. At any point along a line the amplitude of total voltage
    varies sinusoidally, tracing out a standing wave pattern along the line and
    yielding the VSWR metric which is the ratio of the maximum amplitude
    of the total voltage to the minimum amplitude of that voltage. This is an
    important metric that is often used to provide an indication of how good
    a match, i.e. how small the reflection is, with a VSWR = 1 indicating
    no reflection and a VSWR =  indicating total reflection, i.e. a reflection
    coefficient magnitude of 1.

    2.4 Special Lossless Line Configurations

    The lossless transmission line configurations considered in this section are
    used as circuit elements in RF designs and are used elsewhere in this book
    series. The first element considered in Section 2.4.1 is a short length of short-
    circuited line which looks like an inductor. The element considered in Section
    2.4.2 is a short length of open-circuited line which looks like a capacitor.
    Then lengths of short-circuited and open-circuited lines, called stubs, used
    nearly always as shunt elements to introduce an admittance in a circuit, are
    described in Sections 2.4.3 and 2.4.4. Another type of element, described in
    Section 2.4.5, is a short length of line with either high or low characteristic
    impedance realizing a small series inductor or capacitor respectively. The
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                              79

final element described in Section 2.4.6 is a quarter-wave transformer, a
quarter-wavelength long line with a particular characteristic impedance
which is used in two ways. It can be used to provide maximum power
transfer from a source to a load resistance, and it can invert an impedance,
e.g. making a capacitor terminating the line look like an inductor.

2.4.1 Short Length of Short-Circuited Line

A transmission line terminated in a short circuit (ZL = 0) has the input
impedance (using Equation (2.71))

                    Zin = Z0 tan().                              (2.95)

So a short length of line,  < g/4, looks like an inductor with inductance Ls,

Z0 tan() = Ls,      and so  Ls = Z0 tan 2 .                      (2.96)
                                           g

   From Equation (2.96) it can be seen that for a given , Ls is proportional
to Z0. Hence, for larger values of Ls, sections of transmission line of high
characteristic impedance are needed. So microstrip lines with narrow strips
can be used to realize inductors in planar microstrip circuits.

2.4.2 Short Length of Open-Circuited Line

An open-circuited line has ZL =  and so (using Equation (2.71))

                    Zin = - Z0 .                                 (2.97)
                                tan 

For lengths  such that  < /4, an open-circuited segment of line realizes a
capacitor C0 for which

1 = Z0 and so C0 = 1 tan() .                                     (2.98)
C0 tan                                Z0 

   From the above relationship, it can be seen that C0 is inversely
proportional to Z0. Hence, for larger values of C0, sections of transmission
line with low characteristic impedance need to be used.

2.4.3 Short-Circuited Stub

A stub is a section of open-circuited or short-circuited transmission line and
is used as a series or shunt element in a microwave circuit. There are several
representations. A shorted stub is shown in Figure 2-21(a) as a transmission
line with characteristic impedance Z01 that is short circuited. The input
impedance of the line is Z1. If the line is lossless, the usual assumption,
then Z01 will be real and Z1 will be imaginary. Stubs are commonly used
in microwave circuits and generally all stubs in a network have the same
length, such as /4 long or /8 long. Which it is is specified in the design.
Realistically they do not need to have the same length but there are some
special properties for certain lengths, as will become clearer. A cleaner way
to indicate a shorted stub is shown in Figure 2-21(b), where the value of
the stub is as indicated. The absence of a 0 subscript (which would indicate

                     characteristic impedance) means that this is the reactive input impedance
                     of the stub. If a 0 subscript is used, as in Figure 2-21(c), the characteristic
                     impedance of the stub is indicated. If a numerical value is given then an
                     imaginary impedance indicates that the input impedance is being specified,
                     whereas a real impedance indicates the characteristic impedance of the stub.
                     The shorted stub is shown as a shunt element in Figure 2-21(d) and as a
                     series element in Figure 2-21(e). However in nearly all transmission line
                     technologies, including microstrip, only shunt stubs can be realized. The
                     open-circuited stubs with annotations are shown in Figures 2-21(f-j) with
                     similar assignments of meaning. The length of a stub is often indicated by its
                     resonant frequency, fr. This is the frequency at which the stub is /4 long.

                        The shorted stub in Figure 2-21(a) has the input impedance (from Equation
                     (2.71))

                     Z1 = Z01 tan ,             (2.99)

                     where  is the physical length of the line. Since the stub is /4 long at fr, then
                     at frequency f , the input impedance of the stub is

                     Z1 = Z01 tan  f .          (2.100)
                                          2 fr

                     A special situation, and the most commonly used in design, is when the
                     operating frequency is around one-half of the resonant frequency (i.e., f 
                     12 fr). Then the stub is one-eighth of a wavelength long and the argument
                     of the tangent function in Equation (2.100) is approximately /4 and Z1
                     becomes

                     Z1  Z01 tan  = Z01,        (2.101)

                     thus realizing an inductance at f = fr/2 with a reactance equal to the
                     characteristic impedance of the line.

EXAMPLE 2.10 Short-Circuited Stub

Develop the electrical design of the shunt stub shown
with a load of impedance ZL = 75 + 15  so that the
total impedance of the load and stub is real.

Solution:

The short-circuited stub has characteristic impedance Z01 and length 1. Choose Z01 = 75 
(generally this must be between 15  and 100  for most transmission line technologies).
The stub needs to be designed so that the susceptances of the stub and load sum to zero. The
admittance of the load YL = 1/ZL = 0.01282 - 0.002564 S. The required admittance of the
stub is YSTUB = 0.002564 S so, using Equation (2.99),

                     ZSTUB = 1/YSTUB = Z01 tan 1 = -390 .

Therefore, the electrical length of the stub is

1 = arctan(-390/75) = -1.381 + n radians, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .                                                    (2.102)

The first positive angle is taken so the stub has the shortest length. So                                         (2.103)
                                         1 = 1.761 radians = 100.9.

The complete electrical design of the stub is that it is a shunt short-circuited stub with a
characteristic impedance of 75  and with an electrical length of 100.9. The combined

impedance of the stub and load is ZX = 1/({YL}) = 1/0.01282 = 78.00 .

EXAMPLE 2.11 Model of a Resonant Shorted Transmission Line

This example presents an analytic approach to developing the equivalent circuit of a shorted
stub at resonance. Consider a shorted transmission line with characteristic impedance Z0 =
12.28  and resonant, i.e. a quarter-wavelength long, at 1850 MHz.

Solution:

At the first resonant frequency, fr = r/(2),
the transmission line presents an open circuit
and the appropriate circuit model is shown on
the right.

The strategy here is to develop the LC equivalent circuit by equating the derivatives of the
resonator and the LC circuit. This is in addition to equating the input admittances of the two
circuits at the resonant frequency fr = r/(2). That is, at frequency fr

                                                                                                               2  (2.104)

Yin(fr) = 0 = YLC(fr) =  [rC - 1/(rL)] and so r = 1/(LC).

The input impedance of the line at frequency f = /(2) is Zin() = Z0 tan (), and so its

input admittance is  Yin() = - cot ().

The derivative of the transmission line admittance is (using Equation (1.112))

                     Yin =  Yin =  -             - csc2 () .                                                      (2.106)

Now  is proportional to  for a lossless dispersionless line so

                       2.4.4 Open-Circuited Stub

                       An open-circuited transmission line is commonly used as a circuit element
                       called an open stub shown in Figure 2-21(f-j). From Equation (2.71) and
                       noting that ZL = , the open stub input impedance is

                                                    Z1 = -Z01 1 .                            (2.113)
                                                                   tan 

                       With the stub one-quarter wavelength long at the frequency fr, the input
                       impedance at fr is a short circuit and the stub is said to be resonant at fr.
                       Then at a frequency f , the input impedance of the stub is

                                                   Z1 = -Z01 tan-1  f .                      (2.114)
                                                                              2 fr

                       When f = 21 fr the stub is one-eighth wavelength long and

                                                   Z1 = -Z01  1          = -Z01.             (2.115)
                                                                  tan 4

                       So a /8 long open-circuited stub (/4 at fr, f = 12 fr) realizes a capacitance
                       with a reactance equal to the characteristic impedance of the line.

                          If the length of a stub can be changed then the stub can be used as a tuning
                       element. A common microstrip tuning technique is shown in Figure 2-22,
                       where bonding to different pads enables a variable length stub to be realized.
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                           83

                     using wire bonding from the fixed stub to one of the bond pads.
                     The bond pads are on the same layer as the strip metal layer and
                     bonding to them extends the length of the open-circuited stub.

EXAMPLE 2.12 Open-Circuited Stub

Develop the electrical design of the open-circuit stub
shown with a load of impedance ZL = 75 + 15  so
that the total impedance of the load and stub is real.

Solution:

The open-circuited stub has characteristic impedance Z01 and length 1. A good choice is to
choose Z01 around the impedance level of the load as long as it can be realized; so choose
Z01 = 75 . The stub needs to be designed so that the susceptances of the stub and load
sum to zero. The admittance of the load YL = 1/ZL = 0.01282 - 0.002564 S. The required
admittance of the stub is YSTUB = 0.002564 S, so, using Equation (2.113),

                     ZSTUB = 1/YSTUB = -Z01/ tan 1 = -390 .

Therefore, the electrical length of the stub is

            1 = arctan(75/390) = 0.1900 + n radians, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .         (2.116)

The first positive angle is taken so the stub has the shortest length. Then       (2.117)
                                        1 = 0.1900 radians = 10.89.

The complete electrical design of the stub is that it is a shunt open-circuited stub with a
characteristic impedance of 75  and an electrical length of 10.89. The combined impedance

of the stub and load is ZX = 1/({YL}) = 1/0.01282 = 78.00 .

2.4.5 Electrically Short Lossless Line

Consider the input impedance, Zin, of an electrically short line (i.e.,  is
small) (see Figure 2-23). Using Equation (2.71),

Zin  ZL + Z0()  [ZL + Z0()] 1 -  ZL () .                                 (2.118)
1 + (ZL/Z0)()                                                  Z0

Since Z0 =                                                   
            L/C( LC) = L and /Z0 = ( LC)/ L/C) = C

(where L and C are the inductance and capacitance per unit length of the

line), Equation (2.118) can be written as

            Zin  ZL  1 + ()2  +              (L)    -     2    (C  )  .  (2.119)

                                                       ZL

Since  is small, ()2 is very small, and so the ()2 term can be
ignored. Then the input impedance of an electrically short line terminated
in impedance ZL is

            Zin  ZL +           (L)        -     2    (C  )    .         (2.120)

                                              ZL

Some special cases of this result will be considered in the following examples.

              Capacitive Transmission Line Segment

    This example demonstrates that a predominantly capacitive behavior can be obtained from
    a short segment of transmission line, the Z01 line here, of low characteristic impedance.
    Consider the transmission line system shown below with lines having the characteristic
    impedances, Z01 and Z02, Z02  Z01 .

                                                     The value of Zin is (treating Z02 as the load)

                                     Zin = Z01 Z02 + Z01 tan  .                                                                 (2.121)
                                                  Z01 + Z02 tan 

    Now (1 + x)-1  1 - x - x2. Thus for a short line (and so dropping the tan2() term)

              Z02                                                                                                         Z02
    Zin  Z02 -  tan() + Z01 tan() = Z02 + Z01 tan() 1 - 2 .                                                                     (2.122)
              Z01                                                                                                         Z01

    For Z02  Z01 and for a short line, tan()  , and this becomes

                           Zin  Z02 -  Z022 tan()  Z02 -  Z022 ,                                                                (2.123)
                           Z01                                                                                       Z01

    which is capacitive. Now consider the circuit to the right
    where an effective capacitance Ceff is in shunt with a load
    Z02. This has the input impedance

    Zx =  Ceff + 1         -1 = Z02 = Z02[1 - Ceff Z02 - (Ceff Z02)2 + . . . .
                      Z02         1 + Ceff Z02
                                                                                                           (2.124)

    For Ceff Z02  1 (i.e. an electrically short line)                                                                           (2.125)

                                                                                                                  2

                                                  Zx  Z02 - Ceff Z02

    Equating Equations (2.123) and (2.125), the effective value of the shunt capacitor realized by
    the short length of low-impedance line, the Z01 line, is

                           1            2      
                           Ceff = 2         =                                                                        .          (2.126)
                                     Z02  

                           Z02 Z01              Z01

    Thus a shunt capacitor can be realized approximately
    by a low-impedance line embedded between two high-
    impedance lines. The microstrip layout of this is shown in
    the figure on the right. Recall that a wide microstrip line
    has a low characteristic impedance.

EXAMPLE 2.14 Inductive Transmission Line Segment

This example demonstrates that a (predominantly) inductive behavior can be obtained from
a segment of transmission line. Consider the transmission line system shown below with
lines having two different characteristic impedances, Z01 and Z02, Z02  Z01.

                                                 The value of Zin is (using Equation (2.71))

                                            Zin = Z01 Z02 + Z01 tan  ,            (2.127)
                                                         Z01 + Z02 tan 

which for a short line can be expressed as

                    Zin  Z02 [1 + tan(l)] + Z01tan() .                            (2.128)

Note that Z01tan() is the dominant part for  < /8 and Z02  Z01.

Thus a microstrip realization of a series inductor is
a high-impedance line embedded between two low-
impedance lines. A top view of such a configuration in
microstrip is shown in the figure. A narrow microstrip
line has high characteristic impedance.

   The previous two examples showed how a shunt capacitance or series
inductance can be realized using short sections of line, the Z01 line here, with
low or high characteristic impedance respectively. This enables realization
of some lumped element circuits in microstrip form. A lumped element
lowpass filter is shown in Figure 2-24(a) and this can be realized using wide
and narrow microstrip lines, as shown in Figure 2-24(b).

    impedance of the line is

    Z R in = Z1 L + Z1 tan() = Z R 1 L + Z1 = Z12 .                (2.129)
    Z1 + RL tan()                          Z1 + RL RL              (2.130)

    The input impedance is matched to the transmission line Z0 if

                              Zin  =       =  Z0,

                                      Z0

    since here the characteristic impedance is real. Thus

                              Z1 = Z0RL                            (2.131)

    and so the one-quarter wavelength long line acts as an ideal impedance
    transformer.

       Another example of the quarter-wave transformer is shown in Figure 2-
    25(b). The input impedance looking into the quarter-wave transformer (from
    the left) is given by

    Z Z in = Z0 01 + Z0 tan() = Z Z 0 01 + Z0 = Z02 .              (2.132)
    Z0 + Z01 tan()                         Z0 + Z01 Z01

    Hence a section of transmission line of length  = g/4 + ng/2, where
    n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., can be used to match lines having different impedances, Z01
    and Z02, by constructing the line so that its characteristic impedance is

                              Z0 = Z01Z02.                         (2.133)

       Note that for a design center frequency f0, the matching section provides
    a perfect match only at the center frequency and at frequencies where
     = g/4 + ng/2.

       The layout of a microstrip quarter-wave transformer is shown in Figure 2-
    26, where  = g/4 and the characteristic impedance of the transformer, Z0, is
    the geometric mean of the impedances on either side, that is, Z0 = Z01Z02.

       A quarter-wave transformer has an interesting property that is widely
    used. Examine the final result in Equation (2.132), which is repeated here:

                                       Z2                          (2.134)

                                              0

                              Zin = Z01 .

    Equation (2.134) indicates that a one-quarter wavelength long line is an
    impedance inverter presenting, at Port 1, the inverse of the impedance
    presented at port 2, Z01. This result also applies to complex impedances
    replacing Z01. This impedance inversion is scaled by the square of the
    characteristic impedance of the line. This inversion holds in the reverse
    direction as well.

2.4.7 Summary

The lossless transmission line configurations considered in this section are
those most commonly used in microwave circuit design. It is important
to note that the stub line is almost always used in shunt configuration to
provide an admittance in a circuit. Most transmission line technologies,
including coaxial lines and microstrip, only permit shunt stubs. The quarter-
wave transformer is a particularly interesting element enabling maximum
power transfer from a source to a load that may be different. An interesting
feature that is widely exploited is that the quarter-wave transformer
inverts an impedance. For example, turning a small resistance into a large
resistance, or even turning a small capacitor into a large inductance. These
transformations are valid over a moderate bandwidth.

2.5 The Lossy Terminated Line

Previously Section 2.3 presented abstractions that enabled a total voltage
and current view to be used with lossless transmission lines. A similar
development is presented here for lossy lines. Important abstractions are
presented first for the input reflection coefficient of a terminated lossy line
in Section 2.5.1 and then for the input impedance of first a long lossy line
in Section 2.5.2 and then for a finite length line in Section 2.5.3. Section
2.5.4 presents a simple approximation for the attenuation on a line if it is
low loss. Power flow on a lossy line is considered in Section 2.5.5 and then
the impact of dispersion on signal integrity considered in Section 2.5.6. The
final section, Section 2.5.7, describes a technique for the design of a finite
bandwidth dispersion-less line.

2.5.1 Input Reflection Coefficient of a Lossy Line

in of a lossy line can be developed by replacing  in Section 2.3.3 by .
Referring to Figure 2-16, at a distance  from the load (i.e., z = -), the input
reflection looking into a lossy line toward the load is

V -(z = -) V -(z = 0)e- V -(z = 0) e-
in|z=- = +          = + + = + +
V (z = -) V (z = 0)e            V (z = 0) e

= Le-2 = Le-2e-2                             (2.135)

As the line becomes longer the magnitude of indecreases exponentially,
approaching zero, because of attenuation described by the e-2 term.

2.5.2 Input Impedance of a Long Lossy Line

Figure 2-27(a) shows an infinitely long line with characteristic impedance Z0.
The input impedance Zin of the line is the ratio of the total voltage V1 to the
total current I1 at the input of the line:

                    Zin = V1 .               (2.136)
                            I1

If the line is infinitely long or sufficiently lossy there is negligible reflected
wave and thus the total voltage and current are just the forward-traveling

                   The infinitely long line is approximated by a very long, slightly lossy, cable.
                It will not matter how the line is terminated (e.g., in a resistor, open circuit,
                or short circuit), there will be a negligible backward-traveling wave, and the
                input impedance of the cable will be its characteristic impedance.

                2.5.3 Input Impedance of a Lossy Line

                The impedance looking into the line varies with position, as the forward-
                and backward-traveling waves combine to yield position-dependent total
                voltage and current. At a distance  from the load (i.e., z = -), the input
                impedance seen looking toward the load is

                Zin|z=- =           V (z = -)  = Z0  1 + || e(-2)         1 + Le-2
                                                               (-2) = Z0            -2 .  (2.138)
                                    I(z = -)         1 - || e             1 - Le

                Another form comes from substituting Equation (2.59) in Equation (2.138):

                Zin = Z0         (ZL + Z0)e + (ZL - Z0)e-          ZL cosh() + Z0 cosh()
                                                          - = Z0
                                    
                                 (ZL + Z0)e - (ZL - Z0)e           Z0 cosh() + ZL cosh()

                = Z0 ZL + Z0 tanh  .                                                      (2.139)
                       Z0 + ZL tanh 

                This equation is also known as the lossy telegrapher's equation.
                   Note that Zin is a quasi-periodic function of  and approaches Z0 for a

                long lossy line (i.e. provided that there is attenuation and the line's  has a
                real part as then tanh  goes to one).

                                   LC is an open circuit at resonance.
                                   If the line is lossless, R = 0.
      (b) Zin =  (for a lossless line).
      (c) From Equation (2.71) and with ZL = 0, Zin = Z0 tan().

           g/4 = 90.
      (d) Zin = 0 .

2.5.4 Attenuation on a Low-Loss Line

Recall that , the propagation constant, is given by

                         = (R + L)(G + C).                (2.140)
                                                          (2.141)
This can be written as

                           1+ R        1+ G .
             =  LC              L           C

With a low-loss line, R  L and G  C, and so, using a Taylor series
approximation (see Equation (1.174)),

            1+ R           1 1/2 R                           (2.142)
                                 1+ 2                        (2.143)
                        L           L                     g (2.144)

and         1+ G           1 1/2 G
thus                    C        1+ 2 ,
                                    C

              21 R CL + G LC + LC.

Hence for low-loss lines (in Np/m if SI units are used),

        12  R + GZ0        (2.145)                        (2.146)
            Z0                      and    LC .

What Equation (2.145) indicates is that for low-loss lines the attenuation
constant, , consists of dielectric- and conductor-related parts; that is,

 = d + c (2.147) d  GZ0/2 (2.148) and c  R/(2Z0) (2.149)

where d is the attenuation contributed by dielectric loss and is called
dielectric attenuation, and d is the attenuation contributed by the conductor
loss and is called ohmic or conductive attenuation.

    2.5.5 Power Flow on a Terminated Lossy Line

    In this section a lossy transmission line with low loss is considered so that
    R  L and G  C, and the characteristic impedance is Z0  L/C.
    Figure 2-29 is a lossy transmission line and the total voltage and current at
    any point on the line are given by

    V  (z)  =     +  e-z + ez                                          V+       (2.150)
                                                     and I(z) = 0 e-z - ez .
               V0
                                                                       Z0

    Section 2.5.3 derived the lossy telegrapher's equation:

                        Zin = Z0 ZL + Z0 tanh  .                                (2.151)
                                    Z0 + ZL tanh 

       For a lossy transmission line not all of the power applied at the input will
    be delivered to the load as power will be lost on the line due to attenuation.
    The power delivered to the load (which is at position z = 0) is

                     1                                       V0+2

                     PL = 2 R {V (0)I (0)} = 2Z0 (1- | L | ),      2            (2.152)

    where L is the reflection coefficient of the load. Similarly the power at the
    input of the line (at position z = -) is

               1                                       V0+2

                                                                   2 -4 2
       Pin = 2  {V (-)I (-)} = 2Z0 1- | L | e e                                 (2.153)

    and the power lost in the line is

    Ploss = Pin - PL =     +2                        e2 - 1 + | L |2 1 - e-2 .  (2.154)

EXAMPLE 2.16 Q of a Transmission Line Resonator Revisited

    Energy is stored on a transmission line and
    this must be considered in deriving the Q of a
    transmission line resonator. Consider the /4-
    long shorted transmission line examined in Ex-
    amples 2.5 and 2.11. This line has a charac-
    teristic impedance of 12.28 , it is resonant at
    1850 MHz, and a 10 k resistor, R, is at the in-
    put as shown in the left figure.
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                          91

Solution:

At resonance

Q = 2 Peak energy stored = r Peak energy stored                                    (2.155)
              Energy dissipated per cycle  Power loss in the resistor              (2.156)

Q = 1/(Fractional bandwidth),

where r is the radian frequency at resonance. So there are two fundamental ways that the
Q can be determined: determining the peak energy stored and the power loss, and finding
the fractional bandwidth. However, using the fractional bandwidth is only an approximate
method, as Q is a measure of energy stored and energy dissipated.

                     R C = rC                                                      (2.157)

                      LG

The narrowband lumped-element equivalent circuit of the resonator developed in Example
2.5, with C = 5.503 pF and L = 1.345 pH can be used. Thus

                                  
                         C       3 5.503  10-12
                    Q = R L = 10  10 1.345  10-9 = 640.

It is important to note that the input impedance of the transmission line at the resonant
frequency cannot be used to find the Q of the transmission line resonator, as it does not
convey any information about the energy stored. However, the narrowband model of the
resonator at resonance does capture the energy storage information and so can be used to
calculate the Q of the resonator, as was done here.

2.5.6 Lossy Transmission Line Dispersion

On a lossy line, phase velocity, group velocity, and attenuation constant are
frequency dependent and so a lossy line is, in general, dispersive. That is,
different frequency components of a signal travel at different speeds, and
the phase velocity, vp, and group velocity, vg, are functions of frequency. As
a result, the signal will spread out in time and, if the line is long enough, it
will be difficult to extract the original information.

   In the previous section it was seen, in Equation (2.146), that for a TEM line
/ = vp = vg is approximately frequency independent for a low-loss line.
This is true for most two-conductor lines (lines that support TEM modes), but
not for all transmission line structures that guide EM waves (a rectangular
waveguide is an example of where vg and vp differ significantly). Also, the
conductive component of the attenuation constant, c in Equation (2.149), is
approximately frequency independent. However, the dielectric component,
d in Equation (2.148), is frequency dependent even for a low-loss line. This
is because G is mostly due to energy loss when a material lattice or molecular
components are distorted by the E field. So there is more loss and G increases
linearly as the frequency increases. (Conductivity of the dielectric also affects
G, but this is usually a much smaller effect except for a silicon substrate.) If
the transmission line has moderate loss, all of the propagation parameters
will be frequency dependent and the line is dispersive.
92  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    2.5.7 Design of a Dispersionless Lossy Line

    Over a moderate bandwidth a lossy line can be designed to be dispersionless
    (i.e. vg  vp  constant). The parameters that are important in describing
    signal propagation on a transmission line are the propagation constant, ,
    and the characteristic impedance, Z0. When considering dispersion it is more
    appropriate to examine  and vp  / (for a low loss line), as these
    parameters are generally frequency dependent for a lossy line. For a line to

       For any low-loss line the propagation constant is

    If the line is designed so that
                                                                                    (2.158)

               R/L = G/C,                                                          (2.159)
                                                                                   (2.160)
    then        =  +  = LC 1 + R = R C + LC.
    From this                     L                                     L

                = R C ,  = LC and vp = / = 1/LC.
                          L

    The analysis is completed by considering the characteristic impedance

               Z0 = R + L = L R/L +  ,                                             (2.161)
                           G + C  C G/C + 

    and, referring to Equation (2.159), note that the last square root term is 1, so

                           Z0 = L/C,                                               (2.162)

    which is frequency independent. The important characteristics describing
    signal propagation are now frequency independent and the line is disper-
    sionless. In practice a lossy dispersionless line can only be approximated
    over a small bandwidth since G is linearly dependent on frequency because
    of the frequency dependence of dielectric relaxation loss.

    2.5.8 Summary

    An earlier section developed the input reflection coefficient and input
    impedance of a lossless line. This section did the same thing but for a lossy
    line. Short-hand derivations were presented for the attenuation of a low loss
    line in terms of the per-unit-length resistance and characteristic impedance
    of the line. Dispersion on a line was discussed and a design technique
    presented for the design of a dispersionless line. This design is valid over
    a narrow or moderate bandwidth and this bandwidth limitation applies to
    all transmission line-based designs.

    2.6 Reflections at Interfaces

    Transmission lines transfer power from one point to another and there are
    often many interfaces at which power is reflected and transferred. This
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                              93

section is focused on developing an intuitive understanding of reflection and
transmission of power at interfaces and over a transmission line. Section
2.6.1 presents an understanding of power flow and introduces the return
loss concept applying this analysis to a single interface in Section 2.6.3.
Microwave engineering is greatly concerned with maximum power transfer
and the analysis that supports design choices, the maximum power transfer
theorem, is revisited in Section 2.6.2. Section 2.6.4 presents bounce diagram
analysis which is concerned with reflection and transmission at multiple
interfaces. This can be a confusing analysis but it provides the essential
understanding for the development of intuition for how power flows, and
understanding of situations where power flow may be disrupted. The final
section, Section 2.6.5, presents the theory of small reflections, derived from
bounce diagram analysis, which is used in several places in this book series
in the synthesis of transmission line networks.

2.6.1 Power Flow and Return Loss

Now consider the power flow on the lossless line in Figure 2-13. The incident
(forward-traveling) wave has the power

P+ = 1 V + I+  = 1 V + V + 
2                     2                 Z0

= 1      + -z            + -z               =          +2  ,  (2.163)

      V0 e            V0 e                     1 V0
                          Z0
                                               2 Z0

and the reflected wave has the power (using Equation (2.60))

         P- =                 -2  =       2 +2  .             (2.164)

                      1 V0           || V0

                      2 Z0           2 Z0

Considering conservation of power, the power delivered to the load, PL, is
the difference of the forward- and backward-traveling powers:

      1                     +        -      +        2
PL = {VLIL} = P - P = P 1 - || .                              (2.165)
      2

   Noteworthy cases are when there is an open circuit, a short circuit, or a
purely reactive load at the end of a transmission line. These have || = 1.
Thus all power is reflected back to the source and PL = 0.

   The power that is absorbed by the load appears as a loss as far as the
incident and reflected waves are concerned. To describe this, the concept of
return loss (RL) is introduced and defined as

                    RL = -20 log || dB .                      (2.166)

RL indicates the available power not delivered to the load. A matched load
( = 0) has RL =  dB, and a total reflection (|| = 1) has RL = 0 dB.

EXAMPLE 2.17 Transmission Line Model at the Load

      A transmission line with a characteristic impedance of 75  supports a forward-traveling
      wave with a power of 1 킯. The line is terminated in a resistance of 100 . Draw the lumped-
      element equivalent circuit at the interface between the transmission line and the load.
      Solution:
      The equivalent circuit has the form

                                              where ETH is the Thevenin equivalent generator and ZTH is
                                              the Thevenin equivalent generator impedance.

    The amplitude of the forward-traveling voltage wave is obtained by calculating the power
    in the forward-traveling wave:

                           P + = 21 (V +)2/Z0 = (V +)2/150 = 1 킯 = 10-6 W.

    So  V  +  =           10-6  =  12.25  mV.  Note  that  V  +  is  not
                   150

    ETH. To calculate ETH, consider the circuit to the right

    that results in maximum power transfer.

    So ETH = 2V + = 24.5 mV. Since the line has a
    characteristic impedance of 75 , then ZTH = 75 .
    So the lumped-element equivalent circuit at the load is

                 2.6.2 Maximum Power Transfer Theorem

                 Many transmission line calculations can be solved using the concepts
                 of maximum available power, incident power, and reflected power. At
                 microwave frequencies the output impedance of sources, for example,
                 cannot be ignored as can often be done at low frequencies. Thus the output
                 of an RF source is defined in terms of maximum available power.

                    Consider the source shown in Figure 2-30 with an impedance ZS =
                 RS + XS driving a load ZL = RL + XL. The aim here is to find ZL for
                 maximum delivery of power to the load. The phasor current in the load is

                                                          I= E                           (2.167)
                                                                ZS + ZL

                 and thus the average power in the load is

                           PL    =  12 |I|2RL  =  1       |E|         2      21 |E|2 RL                  2.
                                                  2   |ZS + ZL|
                                                                       RL =  2(RS + RL) + (XS + XL)

                                                                                         (2.168)

                 The load required for maximum power transfer is obtained by first consider-
                 ing a fixed value of RL and then finding the value of XL required to minimize

                 Figure 2-30: A source terminated in a load. Maximum
                 power transfer occurs when ZL = ZS.
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                         95

Equation (2.168). Since XL only affects the denominator in Equation (2.168),
it is clear that the denominator is minimized by making XL = -XS. So now
Equation (2.168) reduces to

PL =  21 |E|2 RL          (2.169) and PL = 2 2          1 |E|2         . (2.170)

                       2                           (RS/RL + 2RS + RL)
      (RS + RL)

   Now the power delivered to the load is maximized by minimizing the
denominator in Equation (2.170), which will occur when the derivative of
the denominator in Equation (2.170) is zero. That is, when

      d                   2             2 -RS2
                          RS/RL + 2RS + RL = 2 + 1 = 0.                (2.171)
      dRL                                          RL

The derivative is zero when

      RS2 /RL2 = 1, that is, when RL = 켙S.                            (2.172)

When the derivative is zero, the power transferred to the load is either the

minimum or maximum power that can be delivered to the load. Clearly
RL = -RS is a nonsensical solution as the load and source resistance should
be positive. In addition, the situations at the extremes need to be check, that
is, when RL is very small, RL  0, and when RL is very large, RL  .
As RL  0, Equation (2.169) becomes PL  0, and as RL  , Equation
(2.169) becomes PL  0. Clearly there will not be negative power dissipated
in RL, so when RL = RS the maximum power, PL|max, is dissipated in the
load. Equation (2.169) becomes

                          PL|max  =  1  |E|2 RL    2=81 |E|2  .        (2.173)
                                     2
                                        (RS + RS)       RS

This is called the maximum available power, or simply the available power
of the source. So the conditions for maximum power transfer are RL = RS
and XL = -XS; that is, the maximum power transfer from source to load
requires

                                        ZL = ZS .                      (2.174)

Also note that if the source impedance in Figure 2-30 is resistive, V = 12 E at
maximum power transfer.

EXAMPLE 2.18 Available Power

A 75  source with an available power of 1 W is terminated in a short circuit. What is the
power dissipated in the Thevenin equivalent resistance of the source?

Solution:

At RF, "75  source" refers to a source with a Thevenin
equivalent resistance of 75  which here is ZS. The condition
for maximum power transfer, and when the full available
power is delivered to the load, is when the load impedance,
ZL is the complex conjugate of ZS = 75 . The circuit for
maximum power transfer is as shown to the right.
96                                 STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    To solve the problem we must determine E as this will not change even though the current

    through ZS, I, will depend on the load impedance. The available power is

    PA  =  1  |I  |2  (  ZS  )  =  12 |I |2   75  =  1  W  and  so  I  =  2  1/75 = 0.1633 A.
           2

    From this the voltage across the load can be determine:

    V = IZL = 0.1633  75 = 12.25 V and from symmetry E = 2V = 24.50 V.

    Now the condition with a short circuit, ZL = 0, can be
    determined. Note that I and V will change but E will be fixed.
    Considering the circuit to the right, now

      I = E/(ZS + ZL) = 24.50/(75 + 0) = 0.3267 A.
    The power dissipated in ZS is

      PS = 12 I2(ZS ) = 0.3267  75 = 4.002 W.
      Some comments on this result can be made. With a short circuit the current that flows in
    the circuit doubles compared to the maximum power transfer condition. Since the power
    dissipated in ZS is proportion to the square of the current the power dissipated in the
    Thevenin equivalent resistance increases by a factor of 4 (PS should be exactly 4 W). The
    ideal voltage source E can provide unlimited power. However no matter what the value of
    ZL, the power dissipated in ZL can never be more than the available power.

EXAMPLE 2.19 Forward-Traveling Wave Calculations

      A transmission line is driven by a generator with a maximum available power of 20 dBm
      and a Thevenin equivalent impedance of 50 . The transmission line has a characteristic
      impedance of 50 .

      (a) What is the Thevenin equivalent generator voltage?
      (b) What is the magnitude of the forward-traveling voltage wave on the line? Assume that

           the line is infinitely long.
      (c) What is the power of the forward-traveling voltage wave?

      Solution:

    (a) Maximum available power is delivered to the load when it is conjugately matched to
         the generator impedance (see right diagram). Then PLOAD = 12 V 2/R (V is peak voltage)
         (i.e., PLOAD = 20 dBm = 0.1 W) and

                                             
              V = 2PLOAD  R = 2  0.1  50 Vpeak = 3.16 V,                    EG = 2V = 6.32 V.

    (b) This is just V , so V + = 3.16 V.                   (c) P + = 20 dBm.

                      2.6.3 A Single Interface

                      Many transmission line calculations are most conveniently addressed using
                      the maximum available power concept. This is particularly so when there
                      are multiple transmission lines. The concept is that the maximum available
                      power from a source is incident on a load and if there is a mismatch, power
                      is reflected and the rest of the power is transmitted. The circuits used to
                      illustrate these calculations are shown in Figure 2-31. The available power
                      of the source is Pav, which is incident on the reference plane shown in Figure
                      2-31(b) where it is called the incident power PI . At the reference plane power

is reflected, PR, and power is transmitted, PT . Using the reflection coefficient
normalized to the impedance of the source (i.e., ZS)

PR = ||2 PI ,       (2.175)            where  = ZS - ZL                 (2.176)
                                                        ZS + ZL

and the transmitted power is

                    PT = 1 - ||2 PI .                                   (2.177)

EXAMPLE 2.20 Transmission Line Power Calculations

The transmission line shown in Figure 2-27(b) consists of a source with Thevenin impedance
Z1 = 40  and source E = 5 V (peak), connected to a /4 long line of characteristic
impedance Z01 = 40 , which in turn is connected to an infinitely long line of characteristic
impedance Z02 = 100 . The transmission lines are lossless. Two reference planes are shown
in Figure 2-27(b). At reference plane 1 the incident power is PI1 (the maximum available
power from the source), the reflected power is PR1, and the transmitted power is PT 1. PI2
(the maximum available power from Z01), PR2, and PT 2 are similar quantities at Reference
Plane 2. PI1, PR1, PT 1, PI2, PR2, and PT 2 are steady-state quantities.

(a) What is PI1?
(b) What is PT 2?

Solution: Since the infinitely long line does not have a backward-traveling wave this problem
reduces to a single transmission line interface problem.

  First develop some expectations. This will be a sanity check during the problem. PI1 and
PI2 are maximum available powers and since the Z01 line (this is a short way of talking about
the line with a characteristic impedance Z01) is lossless they should be equal: PI1 = PI2. PT 1
and PT 2 are the total powers delivered to the right of the respective interfaces. Again since
the Z01 line is lossless PT 1 = PT 2, Also PT 1  PI1 as power PR1 is reflected from the
interface. Similarly PT 2  PI2.

(a) PI1 is the available power from the generator. Since the
     Thevenin impedance of the generator is 40 , PI1 is the
     power that would be delivered to a matched load (the
     maximum available power). An equivalent problem is
     shown to the right where V = 21 E = 2.5 Vpeak. So

PI1 = power in ZL = 21 (V )2 1Z = L 21 (2.5)2 140 = 0.07813 W = 78.13 mW. (2.178)

Note  that  the  1  occurs    because  peak  voltage  is  used  in  RF  calculations.
                 2

(b) Now the problem becomes interesting and there are many ways to solve it. One of the

key observations is that the first transmission line has the same characteristic impedance

as the Thevenin equivalent impedance of the generator, Z01 = Z1, and so can be ignored

where appropriate. This observation will be used in this example. One way to proceed is

to directly calculate PT 2, and a second approach is to calculate the incident and reflected

powers at reference plane 2 and then to determine PT 2.
98  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

    (i) First approach: looking to the left from reference
        plane 2, the circuit can be modeled as an
        equivalent circuit having a Thevenin equivalent
        resistance of 40  and a Thevenin equivalent
        voltage that has an available power of 78.13 mW.
        So in the circuit to the right, E2 is just E or 5 V.
        The load is 100  as the second transmission line is infinitely long. A reasonable
        question to ask is why E2 is not 2.5 V, as this would be the voltage across ZL =
        40  in part (a). However, 2.5 V is the voltage of the forward-traveling voltage wave
        on the first transmission line with characteristic impedance Z01 = 40 . It is not the

        Thevenin equivalent voltage of the source. The voltage across the load is

    V = E2 100 = E 100 = 3.57 Vpeak.                                     (2.179)

    The power transmitted at reference plane 2 is also the power delivered to the load:

    PT 2 = PL = 21 (V )2 1Z = 1 (3.57)2 1 = 0.0638 L 2 100 W = 63.8 mW.  (2.180)

         A quick check is that this is less than PI1, as it should be.
    (ii) Second approach: This time PR2, the reflected power at reference plane 2, will be

         calculated. The incident power at plane 2, PI2, is just PI1. PI2 is the maximum
         available power at reference plane 2 and not necessarily the power that is incident
         there. In general, to calculate PI2 the Thevenin equivalent source looking to the left
         from reference plane 2 would need to be calculated. However since here Z01 = Z1,
         PI2 = PI1 = 78.13 mW.
         PR2 can be calculated from the voltage reflection coefficient at reference plane 2:

    2 = ZL - Z01 = 100 - 40 = 0.429                                      (2.181)
           ZL + Z01 100 + 40                                             (2.182)

    PR2 = 2PI2 = 0.429  78 mW = 14.36 mW.22

          So PT 2 = PI2 - PR2 = 78.13 mW - 14.36 mW = 63.7 mW, which is the same as the
          transmitted power calculated in the first approach, allowing for rounding error.
    (iii) A third approach is to calculate the input impedance
          looking to the right from reference plane 1, call
          this Zin1. Using the lossless telegrapher's equation,
          Equation 2.71, Zin1 is calculated to be 16 .
          The voltage across the 16  resistor is 16/(40 + 16)(5 V) = 1.429 V. So the power
          dissipated in Zin1 is

                                    P = 21 (1.429 V)2 116 = 0.0638 W = 63.8 mW,

          as before. All of this power must be transmitted to the infinitely long line, i.e. it is
          PT 2, as the system is otherwise lossless.

    2.6.4 Bounce Diagram

    A bounce diagram is a graphical representation of reflections at the interfaces
    between networks. A microwave network is shown in Figure 2-32 where
    there are two reference planes at boundaries between different parts of the
    network. At each boundary there are reflections and transmissions of what
    could be viewed as small packets of sinusoidal signals. While the bounce
    diagram yields a steady-state result such as the input impedance, the thought
    experiment is that small sinusoidal packets bounce around the transmission-
    line network. Bounce diagrams are used to explore the impact of multiple
TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                             99

reflections in a network leading to understanding, and from that to design
decisions. Bounce diagrams are best illustrated through an example.

Reflection and Transmission Coefficients at a Boundary

Bounce diagram analysis requires that the reflection and transmission
coefficients at a boundary be referenced to a common impedance. Figure

2-33(a) shows the interface of two transmission lines of characteristic
impedance Z01 and Z02 at a reference plane. The problem is determining
the reflection coefficient, , and transmission coefficient, T , at the boundary
referencing them to the same impedance. Here they will be referenced to Z01.
The reflection coefficient as seen from the Z01 line referenced to Z01 is

                                       = Z02 - Z01 .                               (2.183)
                                            Z02 + Z01

Now the transmission coefficient referenced to Z01 is

                                              Z01 + +                              (2.184)

                                      T = V2 /V1 ,

where    Z01 +   is  the  forward-traveling    voltage  wave  on   the  Z02  line  (traveling

             V2

to the right) referenced to Z01. It is not the actual forward-traveling voltage

on  the  Z02  line.        =          is  the  traveling  voltage  wave  on  the   Z01  line

     the forward-traveling wave on the Z01 line at the left of the boundary is

                               +                         Z01                       Z01   .

                                                     Z01 + Z01               2(Z01)

     (For  real  impedances           +  =   12 E.)

         The  next  parameter      to  determine         is         V2    .  This  begins   by  determining   the

     total voltage, V2, at the boundary using the circuit in Figure 2-33(c):

                                             V2 = E Z02 .                                                    (2.186)
                                                      Z01 + Z02

         Now consider that the Z02 line is infinitely long, then it is clear that
              Z02V +.
     V2  =               This  is  the   actual forward-traveling voltage                       on  the  Z02  line.
                      2                                                                                   +

     Now    the  problem   is  how       to  change      the    reference          impedance    of     V2 .  This  is

     done by noting that the forward-traveling power wave is independent of the

     reference impedance, therefore the forward-traveling power wave on the Z02

     line traveling to the right, away from the reference plane, is

                                             Z02 + 2                         Z01 + 2
                                                     V2
                         PZ02      =     1   (Z02) = 2              1            V2                          (2.187)
                                         2                                                 .

                                                                             (Z01)

     So  the  desired    forward-traveling           voltage        wave     is  (since  Z02 +      =  V2)

                                                                                             V2

                 Z01 +             (Z01) V2 = E (Z01) Z02 .                                                  (2.188)
                                   (Z02)                     (Z02) Z01 + Z02
                     V2 =

     So the transmission coefficient referenced to Z01 is

                       Z01V +                (Z01)                  Z02            2(Z01) 1
                 T = 2 + = E                 (Z02)              Z01 + Z02             Z01 E

                         V1

                    = (Z01) (Z01)                               2Z02 .                                       (2.189)
                          (Z02) Z01                          Z01 + Z02

        An alternative way of determining T is to consider power conservation at
     the boundary. Then

                         |T |2 = 1 - ||2, that is |T | =  1 - ||2.                                          (2.190)

     This can be used if T is expected to be real, which it will be if Z01 and Z02 are
     real. The positive sign should be taken. The more general formula, Equation
     (2.189), can be used with complex impedances.

EXAMPLE 2.21 Bounce Diagram

In the transmission line system in Figure 2-32 the electrical length of the Z01 line (i.e., the
line with characteristic impedance Z01) is 45 and the Z02 line is infinitely long. The aim here
is to find the input impedance, Zin. This will be arrived at in two ways. The first technique
uses a bounce diagram approach and emphasizes reflection and transmission at the interface
planes. The second approach uses the telegrapher's equation.

(a) What are the reflection and transmission parameters at reference plane A?

     A11 is the reflection coefficient of signals incident on Reference Plane A from the left.
     AT21 is the transmission coefficient at the plane for signals from the left. A22 and AT12
     are the corresponding parameters for scattering from signals coming from the right to
     the plane. So, normalizing to Z1,

         A11 = Z01 - Z1 = 0.333;              A22 = -A11 = -0.333.                    (2.191)
                    Z01 + Z1

Using Equation (2.189),

                  AT21 =  Z1 2Z01 =           30 2  60 = 0.943.                      (2.192)
                          Z01 Z1 + Z01        60 30 + 60

Similarly, AT12 = 0.943, which is due to reciprocity. As an additional sanity check (this
can only be done if Z01 and Z02 are real)

         AT21 =     1  -  A2       =  0.943,  AT12 =       1  -  A 2       =  0.943.  (2.193)

                               11                                      22

(b) What are the scattering parameters 2 and T2 at reference plane B?

The reference is Z0, and so the reflection coefficient going from the Z01 line to the Z02

line is                               B 11 = Z02 - Z0 .
                                                 Z02 + Z0
                                                                                      (2.194)

The question now is what system reference impedance to use? Should it be Z1, Z01, or
even Z02? The problem could be solved using any of these, but the simplest procedure
is to use the same reference impedance throughout, and since the eventual aim is to
calculate the overall input reflection coefficient, the appropriate choice is Z0 = Z1. Note,
however, that the actual voltage levels on the lines are not being calculated (which would
need to be referenced to the characteristic impedance of the lines being considered), but
instead a traveling wave referenced to a universal system impedance. So the scattering
parameters at reference plane B referenced to the impedance Z1 are

         B 11 = Z02 - Z1 = 0.143;             B 22 = -B 11 = -0.143                   (2.195)
                    Z02 + Z1                                                          (2.196)

         B T21 =    1  -  A2       =  0.990;  BT12 =       1  -  B 2       =  0.990.

                               11                                      22

     The second transmission line is infinitely long and so no signal from the line will be
     incident at reference plane B from the right.
(c) What is the transmission coefficient of the Z01 transmission line referenced to Z01?

     T01 is the ratio of the forward-traveling wave at the end of the line to its value at the
     start of the line. Using a reference impedance of Z01, the magnitude of the transmission
     coefficient is one and it rotates by the line's electrical length 1 = 45 or 0.785 radians:
102               STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

                  T01 = e-1 = exp (-0.785) = 0.707 - 0.707.                                          (2.197)

     (d) Draw the bounce diagram of the transmission line network.

          The bounce diagram is shown in Figure 2-34.
     (e) What is in and hence what is Zin?

          in is the steady-state input reflection coefficient and is obtained by adding all of the
         signals going to the left from reference plane A in Figure 2-34. So

                  A           AA            2B

                  = 11 + T12 T21T01 11 1 + x + x +    ,                                           (2.198)

                                 1 - (0.707 - 0.707)  (-0.2)  (-0.333)2

                  = 0.345 - 0.177.                                                                   (2.199)

     in is the reflection at reference plane A and is referenced to Z1 = 30 . So the input
     impedance is

     Zin = Z1     1 + in      = 30  1 + 0.345 - 0.177              = 55.39 + 23.08 .                 (2.200)
                  1 - in            1 - 0.345 + 0.177

     (f) Use the lossless telegrapher's equation, Equation (2.71), to find Zin.

     The infinitely long line presents an impedance Z02 to the 60  transmission line. So the

     input impedance looking into the 60  line at reference plane A is, using the lossless

     telegrapher's equation,  Zin = Z01 Z02 + Z01 tan l ,
                                              Z01 + Z02 tan l

     where the electrical length l is 45 or /4 radians. So

                  Zin = 60 40 + 60 tan (/4) = 55.39 + 23.08 ,
                                60 + 40 tan (/4)

          equivalent to the result obtained using the bounce diagram method (see Equation
          (2.200)).

     The bounce diagram technique aids in physical understanding, however using the
     telegrapher's equation is a less error prone approach to solving transmission line problems.

               2.6.5 Theory of Small Reflections

               If the discontinuity at the boundary A in Figure 2-32 is small (i.e. Z1 is
               close to Z01 instead of the 30 /60  discontinuity shown) then a useful
               approximation is obtained by noting that A11 and A22 are small and
               AT 21  AT 12  1 so that in Equation (2.198) x  0. Then Equation (2.198)
               becomes, using Equation (2.197), [6]

                              A     AA                2B              A                B     -21
                  in  11 + T12 T21T01 11  11 + 11e                                                .  (2.201)

               That is, if the discontinuity at reference plane A is small then the input
               reflection coefficient is dominated by the initial reflection at A, from Z1 to Z01,
               and the initial reflection at B, from Z01 to Z02, rotated by twice the electrical
               length, 1, of the line.

                                                                                                     Figure 2-32.

EXAMPLE 2.22 Advanced Power Calculations

     This example is similar to Example 2.20. Again, the transmission line network of Figure 2-27
      is considered, but now the characteristic impedance of the first transmission line is not the
      same as the generator impedance and so the simplification used in the previous example
      can no longer be used. Now the generator has a Thevenin impedance Z1 = 40  and source
      E = 5 Vpeak, connected to a one-quarter wavelength long line of characteristic impedance
      Z01 = 30  that in turn is connected to an infinitely long line of characteristic impedance
      Z02 = 100 . The transmission lines are lossless. Two reference planes are shown in Figure
     2-27. At reference plane 1 the incident power is PI1 (the maximum available power from
      the source), the reflected power is PR1 and the transmitted power is PT 1. PI2 (the maximum
      available power from Z01), PR2, and PT 2 are similar quantities at reference plane 2. PI1,
      PR1, PT 1, PI2, PR2, and PT 2 are steady-state quantities.
      (a) What is PI1?
      (b) What is PT 2?
      (c) Determine PT 1, PI2, PR1, and PR2.

      Solution:

      One of the first things to note is that the infinitely
      long 100  transmission line is indistinguishable
      from a 100  resistor, so the reduced form of the
      problem is as shown to the right.
      (a) PI1 was calculated in Example 2.20 in

           Equation (2.178):

                       PI1 = 78.13 mW. (2.202)

           PI1 is the available power from the source and this is the power that would be delivered
           to a load that is conjugately matched to the Thevenin equivalent source impedance.
      (b) The problem here is finding PT 2. Recall that the powers here are steady-state quantities
           so that multiple reflections of, say, a pulse are not being considered. Since the system
           is lossless, the power delivered by the generator must be the power delivered to the
           infinitely long transmission line Z02 (i.e., PT 2). The telegrapher's equation can be used
           to calculate the input impedance, Zin, of the two transmission line system; that is, the
           input impedance of Z01 from the generator end. However, a simpler way to find this
           impedance is to realize that the Z01 line is a /4 transformer so that
104             STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

                                                           
                              Z01 = 30  = ZinZ02 = 100Zin,                                       (2.203)

     and so                                  Zin = 9 .                                           (2.204)

     The equivalent circuit is as shown to the right,
     where E is the original generator voltage of 5 V and

               V = 9 5 = 0.9184 V. (2.205)
                      40 + 9

     The power delivered by the generator to the 9  load is

                              PT 2 = 21 V 2/9 = 0.04686 W = 46.86 mW.                            (2.206)

     (c) The power transmitted into the system at reference plane 1, PT 1, is the same as the power
          transmitted to the 100  load, as the first transmission line is lossless; that is,

                                       PT 1 = PT 2 = 46.86 mW.                                   (2.207)

     Also       PR1 = PI1 - PT 1 = (78.13 - 46.86) mW = 31.27 mW.                                (2.208)

     The two remaining quantities to determine are PI2 and PR2. There can be a number of
     interpretations of what these should be, but one thing that is certain is that

                                PT 2 = PI2 - PR2 = 46.86 mW.                                     (2.209)

     One interpretation that will be followed here is based on the equivalent circuit at

     reference plane 2. Let Zout be the impedance looking to the left from reference plane

     2. Again, using the property of a one-quarter wavelength long transmission line,

     and so                                                                                      (2.210)
                                       Z01 = 30 = Zout  40                                      (2.211)

                              Zout = Z01/40 = 30 /40 = 22.5 .22

     The equivalent circuit at reference plane 2 is then

     Now determine Vx that results in a power PT 2 being delivered to the 100  load, so

     PT 2    =  12         =  0.04686  W     (2.212)         and Vx = 3.06 V.                    (2.213)
                                             (2.214)       and so E3 = 3.75 V.                   (2.215)
                2 Vx /100
     From the circuit above,

             Vx = 100 E3
                    100 + 22.5

     The available power from this source is obtained by considering

                                                                                              .
     The available power at reference plane 2 is

                PI2 = 2       1 (E3/2)2 1.8752        = 0.07813 W = 78.13 mW.
                                       =                                                         (2.216)
                              22.5 2  22.5

     From Equation (2.209),

                PR2 = PI2 - PT 1 = (78.13 - 46.86) mW = 31.27 mW.                                (2.217)

     Note that PR2 in Equation (2.217) is the same as PR1 in Equation (2.208), as expected.

2.7 Models of Transmission Lines

Models of transmissions lines enable lines to be incorporated in simulators
and related to lumped-element circuits. Section 2.7.1 presents models used
in circuit simulators such as Spice. Synthesis of microwave circuits often
requires that a lumped-element design be realized using an equivalent
transmission line network. The ABCD parameter technique described in
Section 2.7.2 is the main means for relating these networks and thus
synthesizing transmission line-based designs. This method is used many
times in designs in this book series.

2.7.1 Circuit Models of Transmission Lines

Circuit models of transmission lines are required if they are to be used
in a circuit simulator. RF and microwave engineering uses two types
of simulators. Spice-like simulators use lumped-element transmission line
models in which an RLGC model of a short segment of line is replicated for
the length of the line. If the ground plane is treated as a universal ground,
then the model of a segment of length z is as shown in Figure 2-35(a). In
this segment r = Rz, l = Lz, g = Gz, and c = Cz, where R, L, G, and
C are the per unit length parameters of the line. Cascading the segments to
get the length of the line yields the complete lumped-element model of the
line, as shown in Figure 2-35(b). This model is adequate if there is a well-
defined ground plane. Otherwise the more accurate form of the segment
model shown in Figure 2-35(c) is used. The L and C of a two-conductor
transmission line model relate to the fields between the conductors and not
to the conductors themselves. So assigning them to just one conductor is not
accurate. The capacitor is already shared between the two conductors in the
original model, Figure 2-35(a), but the inductor was assigned to just one. The
change in the distributed ground model of Figure 2-35(c) is that inductance

106             STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

                       is assigned to each of the conductors.
                          One of the problems with the lumped-element model is that it is not

                       possible to handle G correctly. G is largely due to dielectric relaxation loss
                       and so is linearly dependent on frequency. Fortunately it is very small for
                       RF and microwave substrates and so it can nearly always be ignored. An
                       exception is a silicon integrated circuit where there is appreciable dielectric
                       loss. Parasitic extraction software is used in silicon integrated circuit design
                       to extract models similar to that in Figure 2-35(d) but account for coupling
                       with other circuits. Especially in digital circuits, it is sometimes difficult to
                       identify a ground plane (a current return path) except for critical interconnect
                       networks such as clock and power distribution circuits.

EXAMPLE 2.23 Transmission Line Resonator

     Communication filters are often constructed using several shorted transmission line
     resonators that are coupled to each other. Consider a coaxial line that is short-circuited at one
     end. The permittivity filling the coaxial line has  = 20 and the resonator is to be designed to
     resonate at a center frequency, f0, of 1850 MHz when it is /4 long.

     (a) What is the wavelength in the dielectric-filled coaxial line?
     (b) What is the form of the equivalent circuit (in terms of inductors and capacitors) of the

          one-quarter wavelength long resonator if the coaxial line is lossless? Note that the input
          impedance of a shorted /4-long line is infinite.
     (c) What is the physical length of the resonator?

     Solution:

     The first thing to realize with this example is that the first resonance will occur when the

     length of the resonator is one-quarter wavelength (/4) long. Resonance generally means

     that the impedance is either an open or a short circuit and there is energy stored. When the

     shorted line is /4 long, the input impedance is an open circuit and also energy is stored.
     (a) g = 0/r = 16.2 cm/20 = 3.62 cm. (Here 0 = 30 cm at 1 GHz was used. Thus at

     1850 MHz 0 = (30 cm)/1.85 = 16.2 cm.)

(g) Derive the numeric values of the equivalent circuit of the resonator at resonance.

Solution:

The first thing to realize is that the first resonance will occur when the length of the resonator

is one-quarter wavelength (/4) long. Resonance generally means that the impedance is

either an open or a short circuit and there is energy stored. When the shorted line is /4

long, the input impedance will be an open circuit. When the line is of zero length energy is

not stored, so a zero-length line is not a resonator.

(f) ZL = 0 ,  = (0.0362 m)/4 = 9.05 mm,  = 0 r, where 0 is the phase constant of

     free space. From Equations (2.43) and (2.44),

     At 0.99f0 and using Equation (2.71), Zin = 781.7 ; Yin = -0.001279 S.
     At f0, Zin = - ; Yin = 0 S. At 1.01f0, Zin = -781.7 ; Yin = 0.001279 S.
     So the derivative of the input admittance is

(g) The LC circuit resonates at f0 = 1.85 GHz when 1/(0L) = -0C; 0 = 2f0. Thus

                                LC = 0-2 = 0.7401  10-20 s2.                            (2.220)

     Equating Equations (2.218) and (2.219):

       21 + C = 1.101  10-11 F               and so   C = 1.101  10-11 - 21 F.         (2.221)
     0 L                                                                            0 L

     Substituting this in Equation (2.220) (noting the SI unit equivalence S-1  s-1 = H:

                    L 1.101  10-11 - 21               = 0.7401  10-20 H
                                               0 L

     1.101  10-11L = 1.4802  10-20 H and L = 1.345  10-9 H = 1.345 nH. (2.222)

     From Equation (2.221),                                                              (2.223)
                            C = 0.7401  10-20/L = 5.503  10-12 F = 5.503 pF.

                                       admittance and the derivative of the admittance.

     2.7.2 ABCD (Chain) Parameters of a Transmission Line

     ABCD parameters, also called chain parameters, are used in RF and
     microwave engineering to electrically equate two different structures such
     as a lumped-element network and a transmission line structure. Often the
     electrical design is undertaken using lumped elements and then these are
     converted to equivalent transmission line structures with the equivalence
     achieved using ABCD parameters.

        Figure 2-36, shows the voltages and currents of a two-port in cascadable
     form so that the input variables can be written in terms of the output
     variables:

                                                 Va Ia = A B C D Vb Ib .                              (2.224)

     Note that the current at port 2 is in the opposite direction to the usual
     definition of the two-port current. So in terms of the port voltage and current
     at port 1, (V1 and I1), and the port voltage and current at port 2, (V2 and I2),

                     Va = V1, Ia = I1, Vb = V2, and Ib = -I2.                                         (2.225)

     In terms of traveling-wave voltages, the total voltage and current on a line of
     length , propagation constant , and characteristic impedance Z0 = 1/Y0 at
     position z are

                                                  + -(z-)            - (z-)

     Substituting these into Equations (2.226) and (2.227),

            V (z) = 12 (V2 + Z0I2) e-(z-) + 12 (V2 - Z0I2) e(z-)                                      (2.229)

Ia = I1 = Y0 sinh()V2 - cosh()I2 = Y0 sinh()Vb + cosh()Ib.      (2.234)

That is, the ABCD parameters of a lossy line are

     A = cosh() B = Z0 sinh()                                   (2.235)

and the ABCD parameters of a lossless transmission line, where  = , are

     A = cos () B = Z0 sin () C = Y0 sin () D = cos () .        (2.236)

EXAMPLE 2.25 Lumped Element Model of a Quarter-Wavelength Long Line

Develop the lumped-element model of a one-quarter wavelength long lossless transmission
line having characteristic impedance Z0.

Solution:

The model is developed by equating ABCD parameters. The ABCD parameters of a one-
quarter wavelength long lossless line (with  = /2) are

     A = cos() = 0                       (2.237)            C = Y0 sin() = /Z0     (2.239)
     B = Z0 sin() = Z0                   (2.238)            D = cos() = 0.         (2.240)

The ABCD parameters of a Pi network (see Table 2-1 of [7]) are

     A = 1 + y2/y3                       (2.241)            C = y1 + y2 + y1y2/y3  (2.243)
     B = 1/y3                            (2.242)            D = 1 + y1/y3.         (2.244)

Equating Equations (2.238) and (2.242),                     y3 = 1/(Z0),           (2.245)

and with Equations (2.237), (2.240), (2.241), and (2.244),

                        y1 = y2 = -y3 = -1/(Z0).                                   (2.246)

The lumped equivalent circuit of the quarter-wave transformer in Figure 2-37(a) is shown
in Figure 2-37(b). An alternative lumped-element model is shown in Figure 2-37(c). The
lumped-element model of the 50  line at 400 MHz is shown in Figure 2-37(b) with
L = 19.89 nH and C = 7.968 pF. This is a simpler and more accurate model of a /4 long
line than a model with multiple short line segments as in Figure 2-35.

2.8 Two-Conductor Transmission Lines

Nearly every two-conductor transmission line supports EM fields at
frequencies down to DC. As a result, such lines can usually be characterized
at DC and the properties of the lines will be essentially the same at RF
frequencies. In the following, the characteristic impedances of the most
common types of two-conductor lines are presented. For all of these lines the
phase constant is the same as it would be in the medium without conductors

              
(i.e.,  =  ). The characteristic impedances are modifications of the free-
space wave impedance 0 = 0/0 = 120  = 376.73 . The properties
of many other transmission lines are given in [8].

2.9 Coaxial Line

In this section the characteristic impedance of a coaxial line is calculated.
The technique assumes that the dynamic electric and magnetic fields will
be the same as they would be at DC. This physical insight enables the
problem to be solved relatively simply using the static field laws. Later the
dynamic situation is considered when the fields on a realistic coaxial line are
considered.

2.9.1 Characteristic Impedance of a Coaxial Line

In the following the per unit length parameters--R, L, G, and C--of a coaxial
line are obtained. From these the characteristic impedance and propagation
constant of the coaxial line are derived. The development is an example of
how these parameters can be developed for any transmission line. The key
is using a coordinate system that matches the structure being considered.
Then Maxwell's equations can be expressed very simply, usually as one-
dimensional ordinary differential equations. Very often the static electric and
magnetic field laws can be used that make the development even simpler. If
an orthogonal coordinate system does not coincide with the dimensions of
the line, then sometimes it is possible to use a mathematical technique called
conformal mapping to map a nonconforming shape such as a microstrip line
into a shape that matches an orthogonal coordinate system [20]. Once the
transmission line parameters are derived the result is mapped back to the
original structure. Fortunately most transmission line structures conform to
an orthogonal coordinate system.

   The cross section of a coaxial line is shown in Figure 2-46(a) and it has two
concentric conductors with the inner conductor having an outer radius of
a and the inside of the outer conductor with a radius b. The fields between
the conductors can be solved by expressing the field relations in cylindrical
coordinates. The following is a simplification of the treatment in [21], which
can be applied to a broader range of coaxial cables than just the circularly
symmetrical conventional coaxial cable in Figure 2-46. The simplest possible
field distribution is shown in Figure 2-46(b). The first parameter to be
112                   STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     developed is C. For this, the charge on one of the conductors is related to
     the voltage between the conductors. Consider a section of line of length z,
     then using Gauss's law, Equation (1.50), the electric flux is related to the total
     charge enclosed. So at radius r,

                                   D = Qenclosed  2rEr(r)z = z,        (2.255)

                                       s

                      2rDr(r)z = z and

     where  is the charge on the inner conductor per unit length (in the z
     direction). So the radial electric field is

                                         E = Er(r)^r =  ^r             (2.256)
                                                            2r

     and r is the unit vector in the radial direction. The voltage between the
     conductors is

                                 b b V = E  r.dr =  .dr =  ln b .       (2.257)
                                         a 2r            2 a
                                 a

     Now, the total capacitance of a section of line is

                                 CTOTAL = Cz = Q = z ,                  (2.258)

     and so the capacitance per unit length of line is (with SI units of F/m)

                                         C = 2 .                        (2.259)

        The conductance of the line is found beginning with the current density in
     the dielectric, which is

                                         J = E + E.                     (2.260)

     Integrating this over the volume of the dielectric,

                                         I = GV + CV.                   (2.261)

     Using a similar development to that which led to Equation (2.259), the
     conductance per unit length is found to be (with the SI units of S/m)

                                         G = 2 .                        (2.262)

   The development of the expressions for L and R is more involved, as
there will be current in the interior of the inner conductor. To simplify
matters the high-frequency limit will be considered where the skin effect is
fully established so that the currents on the inner and outer conductors are
confined to a thin layer near the surfaces of the conductors at radius a for the
inner conductor and at radius b for the outer conductor. Then the magnetic
field will be confined to the region between the conductors. Using Ampere's
circuital law, Equation (1.45),

        H  d = H^  d = Ienclosed = I,                              (2.263)

                    

where the closed line integral is on a circle of constant radius. Noting that Hr
is only a function of r, then for a < r < b,

I = 2rHr(r) and Br = 킜r = 킝 .                                       (2.264)
                                              2r

This enables the line inductance to be calculated as the total magnetic flux
(obtained by integrating over the cross section of the coaxial line between
radii a and b) per unit current. So the inductance of the line per unit length is

        b L =  dr =  ln b ,                                         (2.265)
                    a 2r     2 a

which has SI units of H/m.
   The resistance of the lines is calculated using the surface resistance of the

conductors, Rs. So the resistance of the line per unit length is

                    R = Rs 1 + 1 ,                                    (2.266)
                          2 a b

which has the SI units of /m.
   Then the lossless characteristic impedance of the coaxial line is

        Z0 =        L= 1      ln b ,                                 (2.267)
                    C 2      a

which has units of s if all the quantities in the expression are in
SI units. A complex characteristic impedance is derived using Z0 =

   (R + L)/(G + C), but if the loss is small, this will be very close to the
lossless characteristic impedance. Also

Z0 =    탍 1        0 ln b = 60 탍 ln b .                            (2.268)

Note that the 60 is exact and not an approximation.
   For actual coaxial lines the dielectric has negligible loss and the resistance,

R, is small. Using the results developed in Section 2.5.4 for a low-loss line, the
attenuation coefficient for a low-loss coaxial line is, from Equation (2.149),

  c = R = Rs 1 + 1 2  = 1 + 1 Rs  (2.269)

                which is the attenuation due to the conductor, that is, due to ohmic or
                conductor loss. From Equation (2.269) it is seen that for a given characteristic
                impedance, and hence a fixed ratio b/a, the attenuation coefficient and thus
                loss, is minimized when the line has a large cross section (i.e., large a and b).
                With a fixed a, attenuation is minimized with b/a = 3.59 independent of 
                and  [17]. For an air-filled coaxial line with 탍 = 1 = r, the characteristic
                impedance of this minimum-loss line is 76.7 . For a typically Teflon-filled
                coaxial line r = 2.1 and the characteristic impedance of a minimum loss line,
                from Equation (2.268), is 52.9 . The above result is when the conductivity
                of the inner and outer conductors is the same and the internal inductance of
                the conductors is negligible. If the internal inductance is not negligible, or the
                conductors have different conductivity, which happens when the conductors
                are not solid, then the optimum characteristic impedance could be higher
                or lower [17]. The choice of 50  for the characteristic impedance is a good
                compromise. Other optimum line dimensions can be derived for maximizing
                breakdown voltage and optimizing power transfer [22].

                   The upper operating frequency and dimensions of coaxial lines are chosen
                to ensure single-mode propagation [23-25]. A useful approximation to the
                cutoff frequency of the first higher-order mode is [23]

                             c  (a + b) ,        (2.270)
                                         2

                which is the circumference of a circle halfway between the inner and outer
                conductors. Since b is several times a, then the radius of the outer conductor
                largely determines the upper operating frequency. Minimizing loss given a
                fixed cutoff frequency of the first higher-order mode yields another optimum
                value of b/a for minimum loss (see [22]).

                2.9.2 Electromagnetic Fields on a Realistic Coaxial Line

                In this section a realistic coaxial line is considered with conductors having a
                small amount of loss. This expands on the discussion in Section 2.1.2. When
                a positive voltage pulse is applied to the center conductor of the coaxial
                line, as shown in Figure 2-47(a), an electric field results that is essentially
                directed from the center conductor to the outer conductor. A much smaller
                component of the electric field will also be directed along the line. These
                fields are shown in Figure 2-47(b), where the direction of the electric field is
                the direction in which a positive charge would move if it was released into
                the field. The component of the field that is directed along the shortest path
                from the center conductor to the outer conductor (in the transverse plane)

(The subscripts T and L denote transverse and longitudinal components,
respectively.) Thus, while EL  ET , it is necessary to accelerate electrons on
the conductors and so give rise to current flow, and hence the movement of
the pulse along the line. The electrons do not accelerate indefinitely, as they
collide with atoms and scatter so that there is a net velocity of free electrons
along the inner and outer conductors.

   Snapshots of a pulse traveling along a line are shown in Figure 2-48 at four
different times.

2.10 Summary

In this chapter a classical treatment of transmission lines was presented.
Transmission lines are distributed elements and form the basis of microwave
circuits. A distinguishing feature is that they support forward- and
backward-traveling waves and they can be used to implement circuit
functions. RF and microwave engineers are, of course, electrical engineers
who learned how to design circuits using lumped elements. Distributed
circuits can be made functionally equivalent to lumped-element circuits,
at least over a narrow frequency range. The most important technique for
establishing this is equating the ABCD parameters of the distributed circuit
and those of a lumped-element circuit. As will be seen, this technique will
be exploited many times in the rest of this book. Distributed circuits enable
an RF designer to realize functions that often have superior performance to
their lumped-element analogs. At least at microwave frequencies, the loss
of lumped elements can be significantly higher than those of distributed
elements. Superior performance can be obtained by exploiting the intrinsic
behavior of distributed structures. Sometimes functionality can only be
conceived of using transmission-line structures, then, often, a low-frequency
lumped-element equivalent can be developed. Exploiting the functionality
of distributed structures requires a solid understanding of the behavior,
modeling, and circuits that can be realized using transmission lines. The
technology covered in this chapter provides the theoretical underpinning for
all of the other topics covered in this book.

   The most important of the formulas presented in this chapter are listed

2.A.1 SI Units

The main SI units used in RF and microwave engineering are given in Table 2-1. Symbols for SI units3
(from the French name Syste`me International d'Unite큦) are written in upright roman font. (Source: U.S.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (2006) [26], and 2002 CODATA recommended values of
constants [27].)

   The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) maintains the International System of
Quantities (ISQ) defines the quantities that are measured in SI units [28]. These are set out in the ISO 8000
standard (which is jointly published with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as the
IEC 8000).

      The fundamental units of the SI system are meter, kilogram, second, candela, mole, and Kelvin.
      The unit of length is spelled meter in the United States and metre in other countries.
      The unit designations, such as m for meter, is called a symbol and not an abbreviation.
      Symbols for units are written in lowercase unless the symbol is derived from the name of a person.

        For example, the symbol for the unit of force is N as it is named after Isaac Newton. An exception
        is the use of L for liter to avoid possible confusion with l, which looks like the numeral one and the
        letter i.
      A space separates a value from the symbol for the unit (e.g., 5.6 kg). There is an exception for
        degrees, with the symbol . For example, 45 degrees is written 45.

SI Unit Combinations

When SI units are multiplied a center dot is used. For example, newton meters is written N톗. When a unit

is derived from the ratio of symbols then either a solidus (/) or a negative exponent is used; the symbol for
velocity (meters per second) is either m/s or m톝-1. The use of multiple solidi for a combination symbol is
confusing and must be avoided. So the symbol for acceleration is m톝-2 or m/s2 and not m/s/s. Another
example is the thermal conductivity of aluminum at room temperature which is k = 237 kW톗-1 텸-1

and not k = 237 kW/m/K or 237 kW/m텸. However, 237 kW /(m텸) is sometimes used.

   Consider calculation of the thermal resistance of a rod of cross-sectional area A and length :

                                 RTH =  .                                                  (2.271)
                                           kA

If A = 0.3 cm2 and  = 2 mm, the thermal resistance is                                      (2.273)

This would be an error-prone calculation if the thermal conductivity was taken as 237 kW/m/K.

units through calculations. This requires that the SI unit of the final result be known and assigned. Re-

SI Prefixes

A prefix before a unit indicates a multiple of a unit (e.g., 1 pA is 10-12 amps). (Source: 2015 ISO/IEC 8000
[28].) In 2009 new definitions of the prefixes for bits and bytes were adopted [28] removing the confusion
over the earlier use of quantities such as kilobit to represent either 1,000 bits or 1,024 bits. Now kilobit
(kbit) always means 1,000 bits and a new term kibibit (Kibit) means 1,024 bit. Also the now obsolete
usage of kbps is replaced by kbit/s (kilobit per second). The prefix k stands for kilo (i.e. 1,000) and Ki is
the symbol for the binary prefix kibi- (i.e. 1,024). (Note that "K" is sometimes used as an abbreviation for
1,024 but this is non-standard.) The symbol for byte (= 8 bits) is "B".

Accuracy and Precision

Precision is a description of statistical variability or random error while accuracy includes
systematic errors in a measurement or calculation (and these are not random) combined with
statistical variability. For example, consider the calculation of the resistance of a uniform length
of metal using dimensions (length , width w, thickness t, which are known accurately) and
resistivity  where the  may not be known accurately. The resistance R = /(wt).

   The resistance calculation would not be accurate if the resistivity is not known accurately.
However the calculation would be precise if the resistivity of the metal is known to be fixed
(and not statisically variable). If the resistivity of the metal varies from place to place, i.e. it is
not homogeneous, then there is statistical variability of the resistivity depending on the section
of metal chosen and so both the precision and the accuracy of the resistance calculation would
be poor. You can have a precise answer that is not accurate, but you cannot have an accurate
result that is not precise.

   The number of significant digits in a calculation or measurement implies the accuracy and/or
precision of a number. Sometimes the accuracy is explicitly stated, for example 4.01  0.02 m,
but more commonly in engineering the number of significant digits implies the accuracy
and/or precision. Error is taken to be one half of the last significant digit. So 1200 m implies
an accuracy of 0.5 m. While 1.2 km would imply an accuracy of 0.05 km or 20 m. Usually 4 is
enough but there are departures from this.

   One common situation is when we are talk about the center frequency of a carrier in a
communication system. That is because we can precisely set the frequency of a carrier and
can put communication bands very close together. For example, if we have frequency bands
that are 25 kHz wide on a carriers near 900 MHz. We would need to indicate the frequency of
the carrier to a fraction of a kilohertz. So there is a significant difference between specifying a
carrier as being at 1.000000 GHz or at 1.000001 GHz. Sometimes however it is not important
126  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

to specify frequency so accurately. In the great majority of situations four digits of accuracy is
enough, in any case it is very difficult to fabricate something with better than 0.1% accuracy.

   When using decibels, a logarithmic scale, two digits after the decimal point is the usually
sufficient and required. One digit after the decimal point is not enough accuracy. For example,
0 dB = 100 = 1.000 and 0.1 dB = 100.01 = 1.023. So if there is only one digit after the decimal
point is used then the accuracy implied is 1%. Now 0.01 dB = 100.001 = 1.0023 and so with
two digits after the decimal point the implied accuracy is 0.1% which is about four digits of
precision. With four digits after the decimal digit, 0.0001 dB = 100.00001 = 1.000023. which is
the same as claiming around 6 digits of accuracy. Achieving this is highly unlikely except in
circumstances involving frequency or when circuits are tuned after fabrication.

   There are a few exceptions to the accuracy implied by the number of digits used with
decibels. When a number is written as 0 dB or 10 dB, for example, with no digits after
the decimal point, then the implication is that it is exactly 0 dB (= 1.00000000) or 10 dB (=
10.0000000). Another exception is a factor of 2 which in decibels is 3.01 dB. It is common to
write this as 3 dB and when one sees 3 dB then most people automatically recognize this as a
factor of exactly 2. Similarly for 6 dB the implication is that it refers to a factor of exactly 4.

   Using more significant digits in a result than is justified can leave an impression of a
lack of understanding, that the result was simply a matter of plugging numbers into a
calculation rather than understanding what was being done. When an engineer presents
results, the observer, usually another engineer, wants to develop trust for the engineering
process. Engineering is pragmatic and abstractions are made, you always want to create an
impression that you are in control and know what you are doing. Sure interim results can have
many significant digits of accuracy but final results should have reasonable accuracy.

Some calculations require the use of volumetric heat capacity, cv obtained from

                                           cv = cp                               (2.276)

but ensure the use of SI units, i.e. convert the denisty  to kg  m-3.
   The electrical resistivities listed in Table 2-8 for single-element metals are those of single-

crystal metals. The resistivity of the best fabricated metal with multiple crystal grains tends to
be up to 5% above that of a single-crystal. Poorly fabricated metals can have a resistivity twice
as high.

3.1 Introduction

The majority of transmission lines used in high-speed digital, RF, and
microwave circuits are planar, as these can be defined using masks,
photoresist, and etching of metal sheets. The most common planar
transmission line is the microstrip line shown in Figure 3-1 and in cross
section in Figure 3-2. This cross section is typical of what would be found
on a semiconductor or printed wiring board (PWB), which is also called
a printed circuit board (PCB). Current flows in both the top and bottom
conductor, but in opposite directions. The physics is such that if there is a
signal current on the top conductor, there must be a return signal current,
which will tend to be as close to the signal current as possible to minimize
stored energy. The provision of a signal return path close to the signal path is
important in maintaining the integrity of (i.e., a predictable signal waveform
on) an interconnect.

                                                          Figure 3-1: Microstrip transmis-

line showing electric and magnetic field lines and
current flow. The electric and magnetic fields are
in two mediums--the dielectric and air. If the line
is homogeneous (the same dielectric everywhere)
the electric and magnetic fields are only in the
transverse plane, a field configuration known as the
transverse electromagnetic mode (TEM).

(c) top view with via indicated by X; (d) schematic

schematic representation; and (f) representation as a
circuit element.

                            In the microstrip line, electric field lines start on one of the conductors and
                         finish on the other and are located almost entirely in the plane transverse
                         to the long length of the line. The magnetic field is also mostly confined
                         to the transverse plane, and so this line is referred to as a transverse
                         electromagnetic (TEM) line. Integrating the electric field along a path gives
                         the voltage. Since the voltage between the top and bottom conductors is more
                         or less the same everywhere, longer E field lines correspond to lower levels
                         of E field. The strength of the E field is also indicated by the density of the
                         E field lines. This is a drawing convention for both electric and magnetic
                         fields. A further comment is warranted for this line. This line is more
                         accurately called a quasi-TEM line, as the longitudinal fields, particularly
                         in the air region, are not negligible. The relative level of the longitudinal
                         fields increases with frequency, but below about 10 GHz and for typical
                         dimensions used, the line is still essentially TEM. In Figure 3-2 current flows
                         in the strip and a return current flows in what is normally regarded as the
                         ground conductor. Both the signal and return currents induce a magnetic
                         field and the closed path integral of the magnetic field is equal to the current
                         enclosed by the path.

                            Various schematic representations of a microstrip line are used. Consider
                         the representations in Figure 3-3 of a length of microstrip line shorted by
                         a via at the end denoted by "2" (specifically the "2" refers to Port 2).
                         The views in Figure 3-3(a and b) provide perspectives. The representations
                         shown in Figure 3-3(d-f) are symbols used in circuit diagrams with the one
                         used depending on the number of microstrip lines in a circuit diagram.
                         If a circuit diagram has many transmission line elements, then the simple
                         representation of Figure 3-3(f) is most common. If there are few transmission
                         line elements, then the representation of Figure 3-3(d) is most common.

                     3.2 Substrates

                         Planar transmission line design involves choosing both the transmission line
                         structure to use and the substrate. In this section the electrical properties of
                         materials will be discussed and then substrates commonly used with planar
PLANAR TRANSMISSION LINES                                                              133

interconnects will be considered.

3.2.1 Dielectric Effect

The presence of material between the conductors alters the electrical
characteristics of the interconnect. With a dielectric, the application of an
electric field moves the centers of positive and negative charge at the atomic
and molecular level. Moving the charge centers changes the amount of
energy stored in the electric field--a process akin to storing energy in a
stretched spring. The extra energy storage property is described by the
relative permittivity, r, which is the ratio of the permittivity of the material
to that of free space:

                                   r = /0.  (3.1)

The relative permittivities of materials commonly used with interconnects
range from 2.08 for TeflonTM, used in high-performance PCBs and coaxial
cables, to 11.9 for silicon (Si), to 3.8-4.2 for silicon dioxide (SiO2), and 12.4 for
gallium arsenide (GaAs).

   When the fields are in more than one medium (a nonhomogeneous
transmission line), as for the microstrip line, the effective relative
permittivity, r,e (or usually just e = r,e), is used. The characteristics of
the nonhomogeneous line are then more or less the same as for the same
structure with a uniform dielectric of permittivity, eff = e0. The eff
changes with frequency as the proportion of energy stored in the different
regions changes. This effect is called dispersion and causes a pulse to spread
out as the different frequency components of the pulse want to travel at
different speeds.

3.2.2 Dielectric Loss Tangent, tan 

Loss in a dielectric comes from two sources: (a) dielectric damping (also
called dielectric relaxation) and (b) conduction losses in the dielectric.
Dielectric damping originates from the movement of charge centers resulting
in mechanical distortion of the dielectric lattice. An alternating electric field
results in vibrational (or phonon) energy in the dielectric, thus energy is lost
from the electric field. It is easy to see that this loss increases linearly with
frequency and is zero at DC. Because of this, in the frequency domain loss
is described by incorporating an imaginary term in the permittivity. So now
the permittivity of a dielectric becomes

 = r0 =  -  = 0 (r - r) .                   (3.2)

If there is no dielectric damping loss,  = 0. The other type of loss that

occurs in the dielectric is due to the movement of charge carriers in the

dielectric. The ability to move charges is described by the conductivity, ,

and the loss due to current conduction is independent of frequency. So the
energy lost in the dielectric is proportional to  +  and the energy stored
in the electric field is proportional to . Thus a loss tangent is introduced:

                                    + 
tan  =                               .      (3.3)
                                   
134  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     Also the relative permittivity can be redefined as

                                                         .
                  r = r -  r +                                           (3.4)
                                       0

     With the exception of silicon, the loss tangent is very small for dielectrics that
     are useful at RF and microwave frequencies and so most of the time

                            |r|  r,                                      (3.5)

     and this is what is quoted as the permittivity of a material. Thus

     r  =      -         +  /(0))          (1            -    tan  )  .  (3.6)

           r        (r                 r

     3.2.3 Magnetic Material Effect

     A similar effect on energy storage in the magnetic field occurs for a few
     materials. The magnetic properties of materials are due to the magnetic
     dipole moments that result from alignment of electron spins--an intrinsic
     property of electrons. In most materials the electron spins occur in pairs
     with opposite signs, with the result that there is no net magnetic moment.
     However, in magnetic materials, some of the electron spins are not canceled
     and there is a net magnetic moment. This net magnetic moment aligns itself
     with an applied H field and so provides a mechanism for additional storage
     of magnetic energy. The relative permeability, 탍, describes this effect and

                             = 탍0.                                    (3.7)

     Most materials have 탍 = 1. One notable exception is nickel, which has a
     high permeability, is a very convenient processing material, and is often used
     in electronic packaging for its desirable processing properties.

        As with dielectrics, the effect of loss in a magnetic material can be
     described by its complex permeability:

                          =  - .                                      (3.8)

     Lossy magnetic effects are due to the movement of magnetic dipoles, which
     creates vibrations in a material and hence loss.

     3.2.4 Substrates for Planar Transmission Lines

     The properties of a number of common substrate materials are given in Table
     3-1; more are given in Appendix 2.A. Crystal substrates such as sapphire,
     quartz, and semiconductors (Si, GaAs, and InP) have very good dimensional
     tolerances and uniformity of electrical properties. Many other substrates
     have high surface roughness and electrical properties that can vary. For
     example, FR4 is the most common type of printed circuit board substrate
     and is a weave of fiberglass embedded in resin. So the material is not uniform
     and in the assembly of a multilayer circuit board layers of FR4 are pressed
     together and the resin flows so that there is an unpredictable localized
     variation in the proportion of resin and glass. High-performance FR4 for
     microwave applications has a fine weave.

3.3 Planar Transmission Line Structures

Planar transmission lines are the most common transmission lines for high-
speed digital, RF, and microwave circuits. Two planar transmission line
structures are shown in Figure 3-4. The reason these are so popular is that
they can be mass produced. For the microstrip line in Figure 3-4(a) the
fabrication process begins with a dielectric sheet with solid metal layers
on the top and bottom. One of these is covered with a photosensitive
material, called a photoresist, exposed to a prepared pattern that defines
the interconnect line network, then the photoresist is developed and the
unexposed (or exposed, depending on whether the photoresist is positive
or negative) metal on one side is etched away. The stripline in Figure 3-4(b)
is fabricated similarly to microstrip but followed by one more step in which
a dielectric sheet with a ground plane only is bonded on top.

   There are two major categories of planar transmission lines that can
be sorted according to the uniformity of the medium surrounding the
transmission line conductors. When the embedding medium is uniform the
transmission line structures are referred to as homogeneous. If there are two
or more regions with different permittivity the transmission line is called
inhomogeneous. The most important planar transmission line structures
are shown in Figure 3-5. With the homogeneous lines virtually all of the
fields are in the plane transverse to the direction of propagation (i.e., the
longitudinal direction). Transmission lines where the longitudinal fields are

                       almost insignificant are referred to as supporting a TEM mode, and they are
                       called TEM lines.

                          The most important inhomogeneous lines are shown in Figure 3-5(a-c).
                       The main difference between the two sets of configurations (homogeneous
                       and inhomogeneous) is the frequency-dependent variation of the EM field
                       distributions with inhomogeneous lines. With inhomogeneous lines, the EM
                       fields are not confined entirely to the transverse plane even if the conductors
                       are perfect. However, they are largely confined to the transverse plane and
                       so these lines are called quasi-TEM lines. The inhomogeneous lines are
                       simpler to make. Each transmission line structure comprises a combination
                       of metal (shown as dense black) and dielectric (indicated by the shaded
                       region and having permittivity ). It is common not to separately designate
                       the permeability, , of the materials because, except for magnetic materials,
                         = 0. The region with permittivity 0 is air. In most cases the dielectric
                       principally supports the metal pattern, acting as a substrate, and clearly
                       influences the wave propagation. The actual choice of structure depends on
                       several factors, including operating frequency and the type of substrate and
                       metallization system available.

                       3.3.1 Microstrip

Microwave circuits     Microstrip (Figure 3-5(a)) is the simplest structure to fabricate beginning
                       with a thin dielectric substrate with metal on both sides. One metal
on compound semi-      sheet is kept as the electrical ground plane while the other is patterned
                       using photolithography. The metal is chemically etched to form a
conductor substrates   microstrip transmission network. Although microstrip has a very simple
                       geometric structure, the EM fields involved are complex and cannot
(e.g. GaAs) are        be determined analytically. However, simple approaches to the field
                       calculations combined with frequency-dependent expressions yield quite
called monolithic      accurate designs. Microwave integrated circuits (MICs) using microstrip
                       can be designed for frequencies up to several tens of gigahertz. At higher
microwave integrated   frequencies, particularly into the millimeter wavelength ranges (above
                       30 GHz), losses (including radiation) increase significantly, the transmission
circuits (MMICs).      line characteristics vary greatly with frequency (called frequency dispersion),
                       the field directions cannot be confined to the transverse plane, and
Microwave circuits     fabrication tolerances become exceedingly difficult to meet as the required

substrate thickness becomes very thin. With monolithic ICs, fabrication
tolerances are much finer than with hybrid MICs and the options available
for both microstrip and other transmission structures are extended.

3.3.2 Coplanar Waveguide

Coplanar waveguide (CPW) (Figure 3-5(b)) [1] supports a quasi-TEM mode
of propagation with the active metallization and the ground planes on the
same side of the substrate. Each "side-plane" conductor is grounded and
the center strip carries the signal, thus much less field enters the substrate
when compared with microstrip. In conventional CPW the ground planes
extend indefinitely, but in finite ground CPW (FGCPW), the extent of
the grounds is limited. It is important to connect the ground strips every
tenth of a wavelength or so. This is done using wire bonds, via structures,
or in integrated circuit form using air bridges. CPW does a good job of
suppressing radiation, it has low frequency dispersion, and is preferred
to microstrip for large spatially distributed circuits at frequencies above
20 GHz or so. It does have drawbacks, including the increased area required
(compared with microstrip) and the need to use ground straps.

3.3.3 Coplanar Strip and Differential Line

This simple transmission structure (Figure 3-5(c)) is formed by two
conductors in the same plane. As with the embedded differential line, the
possible existence of ground planes is incidental and ideally these should
not influence the field pattern. In one realization, one of the conductors
is grounded, and this form is called coplanar stripline or coplanar strip
(CPS) [2-12]. In this configuration, CPS is used as an area-efficient variation
of CPW. When neither of the conductors is grounded and the line is driven
differentially, the interconnect is called a differential line. A differential line
is used extensively with RFICs and in critical nets in high-speed digital
ICs. The two forms have essentially identical electrical characteristics, with
differences resulting from interaction with other metallic structures such as
ground planes.

   Silicon-based RFICs generally use differential signaling for analog signals
to overcome the problem of field coupling in high-density circuits and
problems due to the finite conductivity of the silicon substrate that results
in high levels of circuit noise in the substrate. The currents on each of
the differential signal paths balance each other and thus each provides the
signal return path for the other. This design practice effectively eliminates
RF currents that would occur on ground conductors.

3.3.4 Stripline

Stripline (Figure 3-5(d)) is a symmetrical structure somewhat like a coaxial
line completely flattened out so that the center conductor is a rectangular
metal strip and the outer grounded metal is an extended rectangular box. The
entire structure is 100% filled with dielectric, and therefore transmission is
TEM and completely dependent upon the relative permittivity, r. Therefore
the wavelength is simply the free-space value divided by the square root of
r. Stripline is fabricated similarly to microstrip, but now a substrate with a
ground plane backing is placed on top.

                     3.3.5 Embedded Differential Line

                         This simple transmission structure (Figure 3-5(e)) is formed by having just
                         two conductors embedded in a substrate with no specific ground plane.
                         In this structure the possible existence of ground planes is incidental, and
                         ideally these should not influence the field pattern. Essentially the substrate
                         acts as a mechanical supporting element and a quasi-TEM mode forms the
                         main propagating field distribution.

                     3.4 Modeling of Transmission Lines

                         Describing the signal on a line in terms of E and H requires a description
                         of the E and H fields in the transverse plane. This can be quite difficult. It
                         is fortunate that current and voltage descriptions can be successfully used
                         to describe the state of a transmission line at a particular position along
                         the line. This is an approximation and the designer needs to be aware of
                         situations where this breaks down. Such extraordinary effects are left to the
                         next chapter. Once the transmission line descriptions have been simplified to
                         current and voltage, R, L, G, and C models of the line can be developed. A
                         range of models are used for transmission lines depending on the accuracy
                         required and the frequency of operation.

                            Uniform interconnects (with regular cross section) can most accurately be
                         modeled using EM modeling software. Most commonly a specialized type
                         of software called 2 12 D EM is used, which only considers current flowing
                         in the horizontal plane or in the vertical direction. A consequence is that
                         planar interconnects are modeled as having zero thickness, as shown in
                         Figure 3-6. This is reasonable for microwave interconnects, as the thickness
                         of a planar strip is usually much less than the width of the interconnect.
                         Many analytic formulas have also been derived for the characteristics of
                         uniform interconnects. These formulas are important in arriving at synthesis
                         formulas that can be used in design (i.e., arriving at the physical dimensions
                         of an interconnect structure from its required electrical specifications). Just
                         as importantly, the formulas provide insight into the effects of materials and
                         geometry.

                            Simplification of the geometry of the type illustrated in Figure 3-6 for
                         microstrip can lead to appreciable errors in some situations. More elaborate
                         computer programs that capture the true geometry must still simplify the
                         real situation. An example is that it is not possible to account for density
                         variations of the dielectric. Consequently characterization of many RF and
                         microwave structures requires measurements to "calibrate" simulations.
                         Unfortunately it is also difficult to make measurements at microwave
                         frequencies. Thus one of the paradigms in RF circuit engineering is requiring
                         intuition, measurements, and simulations to develop self-consistent models
                         of transmission lines and distributed elements.

3.5 Microstrip Transmission Lines

Transmission lines with conductors embedded in an inhomogeneous                                    The original analysis
dielectric medium cannot support a pure TEM mode. This is the case even if                         of microstrip was
the conductors are lossless. The most important member of this class is the                        based on the un-
microstrip transmission line (Figure 3-5(c)). Part of the field is in the air and                  folding of a coaxial
part in the dielectric between the strip conductor and the ground. In most                         line [13].
practical cases, the dielectric substrate is electrically thin, that is, h  . Then
the transverse field is dominant and the fields are called quasi-TEM.

3.5.1 Microstrip Line in the Quasi-TEM Approximation

In this section a number of relations are developed based on the principle

that the phase velocity of an EM wave in an air-only homogeneous

transmission with a TEM field line is just c. It is also shown that the static

solutions for the transverse electric field alone can be used to calculate the

characteristics of a transmission line. The procedure described is used in

many EM computer programs to calculate the characteristics of transmission

lines.
   As a first step, the potential of the conductor strip is set to V0 and Laplace's

equation is solved using an EM simulator for the electrostatic potential

everywhere in the dielectric. Then the per unit length (p.u.l.) electric charge,

Q, on the conductor is determined. Using this in the following relation gives

the line capacitance:

                           C = Q.
                                 V0

In the next step, the process is repeated with r = 1 to determine Cair (the
capacitance of the line without a dielectric).

If the microstrip line is now an air-filled lossless TEM structure,

vp,air = c = 1             (3.9)                             1         (3.10)
                LCair                   and so L = 2 .

                                                          c Cair

L is not affected by the dielectric properties of the medium.1 L calculated
above is the desired p.u.l. inductance of the line with the dielectric as well as
in free space. Once L and C have been found, the characteristic impedance
can be found using

Z0 = L ,                   (3.11)  rewritten as Z0 = 1  1 ,            (3.12)
          C                                                  c C Cair

and the phase velocity is

                           vp = 1 = c   Cair .                         (3.13)
                                    LC   C

Now the field is distributed in the inhomogeneous medium and in free space,
as shown in Figure 3-7(a). So the effective relative permittivity, e, of the
equivalent homogeneous microstrip line (see Figure 3-7(b)) is defined by

                           e = c .                                     (3.14)
                                    vp

1 The assumption that L is not affected by the dielectric is a good approximation. However,
  there is a small discrepancy as a change in the electric field orientation affects the magnetic
  field, but there is little additional magnetic energy storage.

where the strip is embedded in a dielectric of semi-infinite extent with effective relative
permittivity e.

        Combining Equations (3.13) and (3.14), the effective relative permittivity
        (usually just the term effective permittivity is used) is obtained:

                                     e = C .                                                          (3.15)
                                            Cair

        The effective permittivity can be interpreted as the permittivity of a
        homogeneous medium that replaces the air and the dielectric regions of the
        microstrip, as shown in Figure 3-7. Since some of the field is in the dielectric
        and some is in air, the effective relative permittivity must satisfy

                                     1 < e < r.                                                       (3.16)

        However, the minimum e will be greater than 1 as electrical energy will be
        distributed in air and dielectric. The wavelength on a transmission line, the

                                                                                                       
        guide wavelength g, is related to the free space wavelength by g = 0/ e.

EXAMPLE 3.1 Microstrip Calculations

     A microstrip line has a characteristic impedance Z0 of 50  derived from reflection coefficient
     measurements and an effective permittivity, e, of 7 derived from measurement of phase
     velocity. What is the line's per-unit-length inductance, L, and capacitance, C?

     Solution: The key equations areZ0 = L/C, e = C/Cair, and for the air-filled microstrip
     line (with a TEM mode) vp = 1/ LCair = c. Also assume that 탍 = 1 which is the default if

     not specified otherwise and also that L does not change if only the dielectric is changed. Thus
                                     L e e
     C       e
     Cair = e and then L = c2C so that Z0 = C = cC , that is C = cZ0 .
      8 -10 2
     So C = 7/(2.998  10  50) = 1.765  10 = 176.5pF/m and L = Z0 C = 441.3 nH/m.

thick gold (conductivity  = 42.6  106 S/m) and the alumina substrate height is h = 600 탆
with relative permittivity r = 9.8 and loss tangent 0.001. The size of the simulation box is defined
by W = 6 mm, L = 12 mm, and box height H = 2.61 mm.

   The schematic of the microstrip line is shown in Figure 3-8(a). This is what
the microstrip looks like from above, with the black region indicating metal
and the white cross indicating a via that connects the strip to the ground
plane. The distance from the start of the line to the wall of the via is . The
via has a finite length and it is important to take the length of the line up to
the wall that terminates the propagating electric and magnetic fields of the
microstrip line and not to the center point of the via. While vias are typically
cylinders, and so there is not an electric wall across the microstrip, the part of
the wall of the via that first encounters the EM fields guided by the microstrip
line is a good approximation.

   To perform an EM analysis of this line it is necessary to define an enclosure
with the cross section shown in Figure 3-8(b) and the top view shown in
Figure 3-8(c). The enclosure sets up the walls that terminate the EM field
lines. Here the enclosure is a metal box length L = 12 mm and width
W = 6 mm. The height of the enclosure depends on the thicknesses assigned
to the three materials that comprise the microstrip environment (see Figure
3-8(b)). The enclosure here is a metal box, but options are usually provided
to define walls as electric or magnetic walls, and in addition the top walls
of the box can be defined as absorbing walls. An absorbing or free-space
wall presents an approximation to the free-space conditions. In this example
six electric walls are used, with the side walls and top wall spaced a good
distance from the line so that the fields are not perturbed by the presence of
the side walls.

   There are two main types of frequency-domain EM solvers used in
microwave engineering. One type uses the finite element method (FEM),
which solves for the fields at every grid point in a three-dimensional volume.
This can provide a wealth of information and handle a broad range of
microwave structures. However, it is very slow and runs into memory
problems for all but the simplest structures. The other type of solver is called

     a two-and-a-half dimensional (or 2 12 D) field solver. This type of solver uses
     what is called the method of moments to solve for the charges on the surfaces
     of metals. Fields are not found at every point in space and so a 2 12 D field
     solver is much faster than a 3D solver. The type of solver that will be used
     here is a 2 12 D field solver available in the AWRDE environment and also
     used in the Sonnet simulations used elsewhere in this book. The restriction
                                              1
     that  comes  with  using           a  2  2  D  field  solver  is  that  the  conductors    and  dielectrics

     must be arranged in layers, as shown in Figure 3-8(b). Metals are treated as

     infinitely thin and, in some tools, dielectrics can be arranged as blocks, but

     still following the layering protocol.

        The layout in the horizontal x-y plane in Figure 3-8(c) is very close to

     the schematic view shown in Figure 3-8(a). Port 1 (the only port) of the

     microstrip line is shown on the left in Figure 3-8(a) and in Figure 3-8(c) it
     is embedded in the left electric wall. As was mentioned, a 2 12 D field solver
     finds the charges on the metal. A grid of cells is established and most often

     the grid is a regular rectangular mesh and curves and oblique angles can only

     be approximated. Even when more sophisticated meshes are used, a curved

     shape is approximated by straight lines. In Figure 3-8(c) the via is inserted as

     a  rectangular  cuboid.            Another     restriction    of  2  1  D  field  solvers  is  that  currents
                                                                          2
     must flow either in the x-y plane or in the vertical (z) direction. So as long as

     the via has a small (relative to a wavelength) dimension in the z direction and

     the x-y dimensions of the via are small, this is a small restriction in exchange

     for a simulation that can be thousands of times faster than full 3D methods.

        The dimensions of the microstrip were chosen for a characteristic

     impedance of 50  yielding w = 500 탆 for the alumina dielectric with

     relative permittivity r = 9.8 and height h = 600 탆. Also  = 1 cm. Often

     it is necessary to include realistic loss for the materials to obtain physically

     meaningful results. Here the metal of the line and of the bottom wall is gold

     with conductivity  = 42.6  106 S/m and the loss tangent of the alumina

     is 0.001. The strip has a thickness t = 6 탆. The metal strip is simulated

     as though it was infinitely thin, but the thickness is used in calculating

     the resistance of the strip. The dielectric above the strip is free space with

     permittivity 0 and with a thickness of 2 mm. So the height of the box

     H = h + t + 2 mm = 2.610 mm.

        The input impedance, Zin, of the shorted microstrip line is shown in

     Figure 3-9. The plots show the magnitude and phase of the input impedance.

     The phase is mostly +90 or -90, indicating that Zin is mostly reactive.

     At low frequencies near 0 GHz, the input impedance is inductive since

                                                                             tan  = 0.1.

the phase is approximately +90. Zin increases as would be expected from
the approximate model of a shorted line. At 3 GHz, Zin changes from
inductive to capacitive going through a near-open circuit. The transition is
not instantaneous, as the line is lossy. Zin continues to cycle as the excitation
frequency increases.

   It is interesting to view what happens when the loss is greatly increased.
Here this is done by increasing the loss tangent of the dielectric, tan , to
0.1. This is much higher than that of any useful substrate. The reflection
coefficient of the high loss line is shown in Figure 3-10. At very low

physical understanding. First, assume that the thickness, t, is zero. This is     mean effective relative

   Hammerstad and others provide well-accepted formulas for calculating
the effective permittivity and characteristic impedance of microstrip lines
[14-16]. Given r, w, and h, the effective relative permittivity is

       e = r + 1 + r - 1      1 + 10h          -a톌             (3.17)

                                        r + 3            (3.19)

   Take some time to interpret Equation (3.17), the formula for effective
relative permittivity. If r = 1, then e = (1 + 1)/2 + 0 = 1, as expected.
If r is not that of air, then e will be between 1 and r, dependent on the
geometry of the line, or more specifically, the ratio w/h. For a very wide line,
w/h  1, e = (r + 1)/2 + (r - 1)/2 = r, corresponding to the EM energy
being confined to the dielectric. For a thin line w/h  1, e = (r + 1)/2, the
144  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     average of the dielectric and air permittivities.
        The characteristic impedance is given by

                                                Z01                                                  (3.20)

     and F1 = 6 + (2 - 6) exp - (30.666h/w)

     The accuracy of Equation (3.17) is better than 0.2% for 0.01  w/h  100 and

     1  r  128. Also, the accuracy of Equation (3.21) is better than 0.1% for

     w/h < 1000. Note that Z0 has a maximum value when w is small.

     Now consider the special case where w is vanishingly small. Then e has

     its minimum value:

                                        e = 12 (r + 1).                                              (3.23)

     This leads to an approximate (and convenient) form of Equation (3.17):

     e = (r + 1) +  (r - 1) 1 .                                                                      (3.24)
                                     2     2             1 + 12h/w

     This approximation has its greatest error of 1% for low and high r and
     narrow lines, w/h  1. Again, Equation (3.20) is used to calculate the
     characteristic impedance. A comparison of the line characteristics using the
     more precise formula for e (Equation (3.17)) and the slightly less accurate fit
     (Equation (3.24)) is given in Table 3-2.

        The more exact analysis, represented by Equation (3.17), was used to
     develop Table 3-3, which can be used in the design of microstrip on a silicon
     dioxide (SiO2) substrate and on an FR4 printed circuit board that both have
     a relative permittivity of 4, on alumina with a permittivity of 10, on a silicon
     (Si) substrate with a relative permittivity of 11.9, and on a gallium arsenide
     (GaAs) substrate with a relative permittivity of 12.85.

Figure 3-11: Dependence of the q factor
of a microstrip line at 1 GHz for
various permittivities and aspect (w/h)
ratios. (Data obtained from EM field
simulations using Sonnet.)

     3.5.4 Filling Factor

     Defining a filling factor, q, provides useful insight into the distribution of

     energy in an inhomogeneous transmission line. The effective microstrip per-

     mittivity is2                       e = 1 + q(r - 1),

                                                                   (3.25)

     where for a microstrip line q has the bounds

                                         1           q    1.       (3.26)
                                         2

     The useful aspect of q is that it is almost independent of r. A q factor
     of 1 would indicate that all of the fields are in the dielectric region. The
     dependence of the q of a microstrip line at 1 GHz for various permittivities
     and aspect (w/h) ratios is shown in Figure 3-11. The properties of a microstrip
     line, and uniform transmission lines in general, can be described very well
     by considering the geometric filling factor, q, and the dielectric permittivity
     separately. Fitting of the microstrip data yields a formula for q in terms of the
     geometry parameters [19]:

                                         q = 12 1 +         1.     (3.27)
                                                        1 + 12h/w

     3.5.5 Microstrip Resistance

     R for a microstrip line is the sum of the resistance of the strip and the
     resistance of the ground plane:

                                         R = Rstrip + Rground      (3.28)

     (with SI units of /m). At low frequencies the current is uniformly
     distributed in the strip and so

                                         Rstrip =  = Rs ,          (3.29)
                                                    wt w

     2 The effective permittivity in Equation (3.25) is the upper bound on the permittivity of mixtures
       [17] and is known as the Maxwell Garnett mixing rule [18].
PLANAR TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                     149

where  (with units of m) is the resistivity of the strip metal, Rs = /t (with
units of  but referred to as /sq, ohms per square) is the sheet resistance
(also called the surface resistance) of the strip, t is the thickness of the strip,
and w is the width of the strip. The sheet resistance is used to indicate the
resistance of a sheet of conductor without needing to factor in the thickness
t in calculations.

   At DC the current is distributed in the ground plane over the full width of
the ground. At quite low frequencies this transitions so that the current is not
uniformly distributed in the ground plane and the resistance of the ground
plane is approximated as [19]

Rground = Rsg  w/h , for 0.1  w/h  10,                            (3.30)
           w w/h + 5.8 + 0.03h/w

where the sheet resistance of the ground plane is Rsg. The transition
frequency from DC to the low-frequency approximation above has been
found to be 1.3 MHz for a microstrip with w = 200 탆, h = 100 탆, r = 4,
and a ground plane width of 2 mm (i.e., a very wide ground) [20]. So at
RF and microwave frequencies Equation (3.30) should be used as the low-
frequency value of Rground. Both Rstrip and Rground will increase at higher
frequencies as then the charges rearrange at much higher frequencies. This
will be considered in the next chapter.

   Finally, the attenuation due to the conductor loss, c, from Equation
(2.149), is R/2Z0 and so

               c = Rstrip + Rground .                             (3.31)
                              2Z0

EXAMPLE 3.3 Microstrip Attenuation

If the strip in Example 3.2 has a resistance of 1 /cm and the ground plane resistance can be
ignored, what is the attenuation constant at 5 GHz?

Solution:

                           For a low-loss line,  = R/(2Z0) (since there is no
                           dielectric loss), R = 1 /cm, Z0 = 75.3 , and so, using
                           Equation (2.149),

                                                  = 0.664 Np/m.

3.5.6 Microstrip Conductance

For a microstrip line, an estimate of G is [19]

               G = e - 1 (tan )rCair,                             (3.32)
                     r - 1

where tan  is the loss tangent of the microstrip substrate and  is the radian
frequency. So from Equations (2.148), (3.12), and (3.32),

             Or, using Equation (3.15), this can be written as

             transmission line in which the fields are perpendicular to the direction of
             propagation.

EXAMPLE 3.4  Microstrip "Rule-Of-Thumb"

     A rule of thumb is a guideline that is not intended to be accurate but can be easily
     applied. The accurate formulas for the characteristic impedance and effective permittivity of
     a microstrip line, Equations (3.20)-(3.24), indicate an underlying trend. The very approximate
     `rule of thumb,' for characteristic impedance of a microstrip line is

                          Z0,ROT =       kh   .                              (3.35)

                                         r w

     where k is a constant which is established for a reference line. Taking the reference as
     r = 10 and w/h = 0.954 then from Tables 3-2 and 3-3, Z0,REF = 50 . For this reference
     k = 154.4 . The following table indicates the accuracy of this rule of thumb.

     r w/h actual approximate error r w/h actual approximate error

             Z0 () Z0,ROT ()                       Z0 () Z0,ROT ()

     Thus the trends are correctly described. Even the worst case ( = 4, w/h = 4.364) has an
     error of 23% for a factor of 11 parameter change from the reference ( = 10, w/h = 0.954).

             3.6 Microstrip Design Formulas

             The formulas developed in Section 3.5.3 enable the electrical characteristics
             to be determined given the material properties and the physical dimensions
             of a microstrip line. In design, the physical dimensions must be determined
             given the desired electrical properties. Several people have developed
             procedures that can be used to synthesize microstrip lines [15, 21-24]. This
             subject is considered in much more depth in [19], and here just one approach
             is reported. The formulas are useful outside the range indicated, but with
             reduced accuracy. Again, these formulas are the result of curve fits, but
             starting with physically based equation forms.

                                                                                                     (3.37)

For Z0 > (63 - 2r) , [24]

e = r + 1 1 + 29.98           2 1/2  r - 1                                  2

                                               2 r 

The formula for e is accurate to better than 1% for Z0 > (44 - 2r)  (i.e
w/h < 1.3) for 8 < r < 12 [24]. Overall the synthesis of w/h has an accuracy
of better than 1%.

3.6.2 Low Impedance

Strips with low Z0 are relatively wide and the formulas below can be used
when Z0 < (44 - 2r) . The cross-sectional geometry is given by

w = 2 [(dr - 1) - ln (2dr - 1)] + (r - 1)   ln (dr - 1) + 0.293 - 0.517 ,

                   59.952
where dr =  .                                                                 (3.40)

For Z0 < (63 - 2r)  [24]

      e =                            r .                (3.41)
           0.96 + r(0.109 - 0.004r)[log (10 + Z0) - 1]

The expression for e is accurate to better than 1% [24] for 8 < r < 12 and
8  Z0  (63 - 2r) .

EXAMPLE 3.5 Microstrip Design

Design a microstrip line to have a characteristic impedance of 75  at 10 GHz. The microstrip
a substrate that is 500 탆 thick with a relative permittivity of 5.6. (a) What is the width of
the line? (b) What is the effective permittivity of the line?

Solution:

(a) The high-impedance (or narrow-strip) formula (Equation (3.36)) is to be used for Z0 >
     (44 - r) [= (44 - 5.6) = 38.4] .
     With r = 5.6 and Z0 = 75 , Equation (3.37) yields H = 2.445. From Equation (3.36),
     w/h = 0.704, thus w = w/h  h = 0.704  500 탆 = 352 탆.

(b) The effective permittivity formula is Equation (3.38), and so e = 3.82.

3.7 Stripline

A symmetrical stripline is shown in Figure 3-12(a). A stripline resembles
a microstrip line and comprises a center conductor pattern symmetrically
embedded completely within a dielectric, the top and bottom layers of which
are conducting ground planes. The strip of width w is considered to have a
thickness t that is very small so that the strip is a distance h from each of the
ground planes and the ground planes are separated by b = 2h. The strip
is completely surrounded by the dielectric and so this is a homogeneous
medium and there is no need to introduce an effective permittivity.

                   The characteristic impedance of a stripline is [25, 26]

                   where the effective width of the strip, weff , is obtained from

                   Cf accounts for the fringing capacitance at the edges of the strip and
                   incorporates the effect of the strip thickness for t  b. The fringing

                   capacitance per unit length (e.g., F/m) at each corner of the strip is

                                                 0rCf                                     (3.45)

                   and is shown in Figure 3-13. The accuracy of these formulas is better than 1%

   A stripline supports a purely TEM mode and there is no dielectric
dispersion due to an effective permittivity change with frequency. Losses
in a stripline are due to dielectric, conductor, and radiative losses. Radiative
losses are confined to energy lost to excitation of the parallel plate waveguide
mode, but this can be suppressed by shorting the ground planes together at
regular intervals (say every tenth of a wavelength).

   Formulas have also been developed for the characteristic impedance of
asymmetrical stripline, that is, when the strip is not centered between the
ground planes [27].

EXAMPLE 3.6 Stripline

A thin strip of a symmetrical stripline has a width of 0.5 mm, is embedded in a
dielectric of relative permittivity 5.6, and is between ground planes separated by
1 mm. What is the characteristic impedance of the stripline?

Solution:

The structure is shown in Figure 3-12(a) with w = 0.5 mm and b = 1 mm. Since the
strip is thin, consider that t = 0. So from Equations (3.43) and (3.44)

                       weff = 0.5 and Cf = 0.441,                                 (3.49)
                        b

and so

                       Z0 =                    = 42.77 .                          (3.50)
                            5.6 (0.5 + 0.441)

3.7.2 Attenuation on a Stripline

For a low-loss stripline with radiation loss suppressed by vias between
the ground planes, the attenuation, , comprises two parts, the conductive
attenuation, c, and the dielectric attenuation, d, so that  = c + d. From
Equation (2.149)

                       c = R ,                                           (3.51)
                              2Z0

where R is the resistance per unit length of the line. R is the sum of the strip
and ground resistances. At low frequencies the resistance of the strip is

                       Rstrip = Rs/w,                                    (3.52)

where Rs is the sheet resistance of the strip and w is the width of the strip.
The treatment for the ground resistance is similar to that described in Section
3.5.5 for microstrip. At low microwave frequencies

Rground = 1 Rsg        w/h , for 0.1  w/h  10,                           (3.53)
        2 w w/h + 5.8 + 0.03h/w
154          STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

             where the sheet resistance of the ground plane is Rsg. The factor of one-
             half arises because there are two grounds and the resistance from each is
             in parallel. The effect of the ground on the line resistance is small. Both Rstrip
             and Rground will increase at higher frequencies as the charges rearrange at
             much higher frequencies. This will be considered in the next chapter.

                The formula for the dielectric attenuation comes from Equation (3.34). The
             general formula for the attenuation constant due to dielectric loss is, for a
             low-loss TEM line,

                                       r(e - 1)
             d = (tan )                            Np/m.                                      (3.54)
                                    c  2 e(r - 1)

             Since the effective permittivity of a stripline is just the relative permittivity
             of the substrate, e = r, then Equation (3.54) reduces to

             d = 2c (tan )r Np/m = 21 00r(tan ) Np/m.                                        (3.55)

                (Note that here  is the radian frequency and not the width w.)
                The suspended stripline structure shown in Figure 3-12(b) has minimal
             dielectric and hence minimal dielectric loss. Resonators built using a
             suspended stripline have a high Q and this structure can be used to realize
             high-performance filters.

EXAMPLE 3.7  Stripline Attenuation

     What is the attenuation of a symmetrical stripline at 1 GHz with w = h = 0.5 mm, a
     t = 4 탆-thick strip, silver metallization, and an FR-4 substrate. The ground planes
     are 4 탆 thick. Assume that high frequency effects on line resistance can be ignored.

     Solution:

     The strip is very thin and the results of Example 3.6 can be used so Z0 = 42.77 .
     The resistivity of silver is Ag = 14.87 n  m and so the sheet resistivity of the
     strip, Rs = Ag/t = (14.87 n  m)/(4 탆) = 3.968 m. From Equation (3.52) the
     resistance of the strip is Rstrip = Rs/w = (3.968 m)/(1 mm) = 3.968 /m. The
     sheet resistance of the grounds is the same as the strip so Rsg = 3.968 m. From
     Equation (3.53) the resistance of the grounds is

     Rground = 21 Rsg w/h w w/h + 5.8 + 0.03h/w                                   (3.56)
               = 21 (3.968 m) 1 (1 mm) 1 + 5.8 + 0.03 = 3.968 /m 6.83 = 0.581 /m

     so that the total line resistance R = Rstrip + Rground = 4.549 /m. Thus the
     attenuation due to conductor loss is c = R/(2Z0) = 0.1064 Np/m = 0.924 dB/m.

     FR-4 has negligible conductivity and loss in the dielectric is due to dielectric
     relaxation. FR-4 has a loss tangent at 1 GHz of 0.01 and a relative dielectric constant
     of 4.3. From Equation (3.55)

     d = 21 00r(tan ) Np/m. = 0.2172 Np/m = 1.886 dB/m.                          (3.57)

     The total attenuation  = c + d = (0.924 + 1.886) dB/m = 2.810 dB/m.

3.7.3 Design Formulas for a Stripline

The synthesis of a symmetrical stripline with a substrate having a relative
permittivity r and thickness b requires determination of the width of the
strip for a particular characteristic impedance [25]. The width w is obtained

3.8 Coplanar Waveguide

Microstrip is the most popular medium for circuit design at frequencies
ranging from several hundred megahertz to tens of gigahertz. However,
the electrical characteristics of a microstrip line are sensitive to variations
of substrate thickness, and radiation from a microstrip line increases when
the substrate is thick. The substrate thickness is not well controlled and can
vary by 1%-5% in many substrate technologies. As a result, the characteristic
impedance will change by about the same amount. This is not acceptable
in many designs where it is desirable that microstrip synthesis be accurate
to 1% or so. The lateral dimensions, however, are well controlled being
photolithographically defined and then etched.

   A solution to the problems of microstrip is coplanar waveguide (CPW)
shown in Figure 3-14(a). CPW consists of a central strip flanked by two
metal half-planes that carry the return current. The outer conductors can
be regarded as ground, but they do not need to be explicitly connected
to ground. Provided that the substrate is sufficiently thick, in practice this
means that the substrate thickness is two or three times greater than both
the strip width w and the metal separation s, the electrical characteristics
of CPW are entirely determined by the lateral dimensions, since all of the
metallization is on one layer.

   Of course, the infinite half-grounds of CPW cannot be produced so a
more realistic implementation of CPW is finite ground CPW (FGCPW),
shown in Figure 3-14(b), where the signal return conductors are of finite
width. For both the CPW and FGCPW lines, the vitalization and currents

                are confined to a single layer. However, the following discussion focuses
                on the idealized CPW structure in Figure 3-14(a) as this has been studied
                extensively. However, the characteristics of FGCPW are very close to those
                of CPW if w1  3w (see Figure 3-14(b)).

                3.8.1 Effective Permittivity and Characteristic Impedance of
                         CPW

                The fields in CPW, and thus the EM energy, are almost equally divided
                between air and dielectric, especially when the gap is small relative to the
                thickness of the dielectric. The effective relative permittivity of CPW is [28]

                e = r,e =0.5(r + 1) {tanh[1.785 log(h/s) + 1.75]                                 (3.60)
                               +(ks/h)[0.04 - 0.7k + 0.01(1 - 0.1r)(0.25 + k)]} ,

                which is accurate to 1.5% for h/s  1. In Equation (3.60)                         (3.61)
                                                          k= w .
                                                                w + 2s

                Simply taking the effective permittivity as (r + 1)/2 is a good starting point
                in analysis and design.

                   The characteristic impedance of CPW is [29]

                       30 K(k)
                       Z0 =                ,                                                     (3.62)
                            e K(k)                                                               (3.63)

                where  k = (1 - k2) and           K(k) = K(k).

                K(k) and K(k) are elliptic integrals, but the ratio, which is all that is

                required, is much simpler [30]:

                       K (k)                1 ln           0  k  0.707                           (3.64)
                       K  (k)                     2 1 + k                     .

                       K  (k)               1 ln   1- k    0.707 < k  1
                       K (k)                             

                                                  2 1 + k
                                                   1 - k

                   Note that with CPW, Z0 is determined by the ratio of the center strip width
                w to the gap width s. This makes the design of a CPW line with a particular
                Z0 non unique because an infinite range of w and s values will result in a
                specific Z0 requirement. This provides additional design flexibility.

EXAMPLE 3.8     CPW

     A CPW line is fabricated on a 500 탆 thick GaAs substrate, has a strip with a width
     of 200 탆, and a gap of 200 탆 between the strip and the ground planes. The relative
     permittivity of the substrate is 12.85 and the strip is 10 탆 thick. What is the effective
     permittivity and characteristic impedance of the CPW line?

     Solution:

     The structure is that shown in Figure 3-14(a) with w = 500 탆, s = 200 탆, h = 500 탆,

     and t = 10 탆. From Equation (3.61),

                       k = w = 500 = 0.556.                                      (3.65)
                             w + 2s 500 + 400
PLANAR TRANSMISSION LINES                                                                        157

From Equation (3.60),

e = 0.5(12.85 + 1) {tanh[1.785 log(500/200) + 1.75]

+(0.556  200/500)[0.04 - 0.7  0.556 + 0.01(1 - 0.1  12.85)(0.25 + 0.556)]}

= 6.28.                                                                                  (3.66)

This compares to e = 6.925 if the permittivities of air and the substrate are averaged.

Several quantities need to be calculated before calculating Z0. Since 0  k  0.707,

                            K K(k) (k) = 1 ln           = 0.833.                         (3.67)
                                               2 1 + k

                                                1- k

Thus from Equation (3.62),

                            30 K(k)            = 45.1 .
                            Z0 =                                                         (3.68)
                                   e K(k)

3.8.2 Loss of CPW lines

Loss of a CPW line is primarily due to dielectric, radiative, and conductor
losses. Dielectric loss is lower in a CPW line than in a microstrip line as the
electric field lines are evenly divided between the air and dielectric, whereas
with a microstrip line most of the field is concentrated in the dielectric. Also,
radiation loss with CPW is much lower than with microstrip as the fields
lines with a CPW line are much more tightly confined. In practice, when
s/h is near to or greater than 1 the structure partially turns into a microstrip
transmission line and it is of no use as a CPW line. This transfer of energy
into the microstrip mode is another form of loss but can be avoided.

   At low frequencies the strip resistance is

                            Rstrip = Rs/w,                        (3.69)

where Rs is the sheet resistance of the strip and w is the width of the central
strip. The ground resistance can be ignored as the ground current spreads out
considerably and the resistances of each ground are in parallel, thus further
reducing the ground resistance.

   Approximately, the dielectric and conductive components of the attenua-
tion are (if , 0, and 0 have SI units) [19]

D = 21 00r tan  Np/m and C = Rstrip 2Z Np/m, 0                   (3.70)

respectively. So D is almost entirely due to the choice of substrate material.
   In summary, it is necessary to calculate the loss of CPW lines using EM

simulation software to obtain the required accuracy. This is due to the
more tightly confined fields and the greater variation of current densities
compared to microstrip and stripline. A key attribute of CPW is the relative
frequency independence of the effective permittivity, as this leads to almost
dispersion-free transmission of signals. Also, devices can be connected along
the signal path without using vias.

The various CPW structures shown in Figure 3-15 are used to realize
transmission line elements. The CPW-to-microstrip transition shown in

     Figure 3-16: Differential line or coplanar
     strips (CPS).

     Figure 3-15(k) requires vias to transfer the ground plane from the same
     surface as the strip in the CPW line to the second metal plane that forms
     the ground of microstrip.

     3.8.4 Differential Line and Coplanar Strip

     A coplanar strip (CPS) line is shown in Figure 3-16. CPS has only two
     conductors separated by a narrow longitudinal slot. It is a balanced
     line structure and is occasionally implemented in applications including
     radiating elements and transitions. CPS has become important for on-
     chip implementations, especially for RFICs and high-speed digital signal
     transmission, where it is usually referred to as differential line.

        CPS is closely related to CPW, as the signal return path is well defined
PLANAR TRANSMISSION LINES                                                          159

and the electrical characteristics are independent of substrate thickness. CPS
is a good structure to use instead of CPW when space is at a premium.
Differential line is commonly used with RFICs, as the signal path on the IC is
almost always differential since differential circuits on-chip remove many of
the distortion and noise-coupling concerns. CPS suffers from relatively high
radiation losses when realized on low-permittivity substrates. The radiation
also results in substantial interaction and cross talk between adjacent circuits,
although this is lower than with a microstrip line.

3.8.5 Summary

Coplanar waveguide is the transmission medium of choice above 20 GHz
or so, although the threshold for the switch from microstrip to CPW is
higher for on-chip lines. CPW confines the EM fields in a more localized
manner than does microstrip, thus reducing spurious coupling, radiation,
and dispersion. The electrical characteristics of CPW are defined by the
lateral dimensions that can be accurately defined photolithographically. This
is a significant advantage when the thickness of a substrate cannot be
accurately controlled. CPW provides a precisely defined signal return path
and this reduces capacitive coupling of signal lines. CPS lines are also used as
digital interconnect mediums where the desirable attribute is the differential
signaling. Differential lines, having the same structure as CPS, are commonly
used as off-chip transmission lines connecting RFICs.

3.9 Summary

This chapter considered the most important planar transmission lines:
microstrip, CPW and stripline. These lines can be produced using printed
circuit board techniques. At frequencies below 1 GHz, economics require that
standard FR4 circuit boards be used. The weave of a conventional FR4 circuit
board can be a significant fraction of critical transmission line dimensions
and so affect electrical performance. Nonwoven substrates and sometimes
hard substrates such as alumina ceramic, sapphire, or silicon crystal wafers
are often required. These also provide higher-dimensional tolerance than
can be achieved using conventional woven FR4 substrates. In general, once
a design has been optimized in fabrication so that the desired electrical
characteristics are obtained, microwave circuits using planar transmission
lines can be cheaply and repeatably manufactured in volume. This is true
even with ceramic substrates that shrink when they are fired in a process
performed after the transmission lines have been patterned. Microstrip
and CPW are ideal transmission lines enabling surface modification in
design optimization. Buried transmission line mediums such as stripline
are difficult to rework, but of course allow more compact designs and thus
lower unit costs. However, the rework difficulty results in higher design
cost. Stripline does have an advantage over microstrip. Microstrip radiates,
but with the fields confined between ground planes, stripline does not. Also
stripline design enables multilayer circuit boards to be used, and thus results
in smaller overall circuit size, at the price of higher design cost since design
on-the-bench optimization are much more difficult.

4.1 Introduction

Previous chapters discussed the low-frequency operation of transmission
lines. This chapter describes the origins of, particularly of planar lines. Figure
4-1 shows the typical frequency dependence of a line's RLGC parameters.
The variations of R, L, and C are of most interest, and, except with some
semiconductor substrates, G is usually negligible.

   The major limitation on the dimensions and maximum operating
frequency of a transmission line is determined by the origination of
higher-order modes (i.e., orientations of the fields). Different modes on a
transmission line travel at different velocities. Thus the problem is that if
a signal on a line is split between two modes, then the information sent
from one end of the line will reach the other end in two packets arriving
at different times. The two modes have random partitioning of the signal

                            Figure 4-1: Frequency de-

     energy and it is the combination that will be detected, and in general the
     information will be lost as the two modes combine in an incoherent manner.
     Multimoding must always be avoided.

     4.2 Frequency-Dependent Characteristics

     All interconnects have frequency-dependent behavior. In this section the
     origins of the frequency-dependent behavior of a microstrip line are
     examined because microstrip has the most significant frequency dependence
     among interconnects of general interest. Frequency-dependent behavior
     other than multimoding often results in dispersion. The effect can be seen
     in Figure 4-2 for a pulse traveling along a line. The pulse spreads out
     as the different frequency components travel at different speeds. For a
     long line, successive pulses will start merging and the signal will become
     unintelligible.

        The most important frequency-dependent effects are

          changes of material properties (permittivity, permeability, and conduc-
            tivity) with frequency (Section 4.2.1),

          current bunching (discussed in Section 4.2.3),
          skin effect (Sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.5),
          internal conductor inductance variation (Section 4.2.4),
          dielectric dispersion (Section 4.2.6), and
          multimoding (Section 4.4).

     While the discussion focuses on microstrip lines, the effects occur with other
     planar and nonplanar transmission lines.

     4.2.1 Material Dependency

     Changes of permittivity, permeability, and conductivity with frequency are
     properties of the materials used. Fortunately the materials of interest in
     microwave technology have characteristics that are almost independent of
     frequency, at least up to 300 GHz or so.

     4.2.2 Frequency-Dependent Charge Distribution

     Skin effect, current bunching, and internal conductor inductance are all due
     to the necessary delay in transferring EM information from one location to
     another. This information cannot travel faster than the speed of light in the
     medium. In a dielectric material the speed of an EM wave will be slower

than that in free space by a factor of r, where r is the relative permittivity
of the material. Thus the speed of an EM wave in microwave dielectrics
is reduced typically by a factor ranging from just over 1 to 300. However,
the velocity in a conductor is extremely low because of high conductivity.
In brief, current bunching is due to changes related to the finite velocity of
information transfer through the dielectric, and skin effect and variations of
internal conductor inductance are due to the very slow speed of information
transfer inside a conductor. As frequency increases, only limited information
to rearrange charges can be sent before the polarity of the signal reverses and
information is sent to reverse the changes. The skin and charge-bunching
effects on a microstrip line are illustrated in cross section in Figure 4-3.

4.2.3 Current Bunching

Consider the charge distribution for a microstrip line shown in the cross-
sectional views in Figure 4-3. The microstrip cross sections shown here are
typical of an interconnect on a printed circuit board or a monolithically
integrated circuit where the top dielectric is a passivation layer. The
thickness of the microstrip is often a significant fraction of its width, although
this is exaggerated in Figure 4-3.

   The charge distribution shown in Figure 4-3(a) applies when there is a
positive DC voltage on the strip (the top conductor). In this case there
are positive charges on the top conductor arranged with a fairly uniform
distribution. The individual positive charges (caused by the absence of
balancing electrons exposing positively charged ions) tend to repel each
other, but this has little effect on the charge distribution for practical
conductors with finite conductivity. (If the conductor had zero resistance
then these net charges would be confined to the surface of the conductor.)
The bottom conductor is known as the ground plane and there are balancing
168  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     (a) DC  (b) High frequency

Figure 4-4: Current bunching effect in time. Positive and negative charges are shown on the strip
and on the ground plane. The viewpoint is on the ground plane.

     negative charges, or a surplus of electrons, so that electric field lines begin
     on the positive charges and terminate on the negative charges. The negative
     charges on the ground plane are uniformly distributed across the whole of
     the ground plane. An important point is that where there are unbalanced
     charges there can be current flow. So the charge distribution at DC, shown
     in Figure 4-3(a), indicates that for the top conductor, current would flow
     uniformly inside the conductors and the return current in the ground plane
     would be distributed over the whole of the ground plane.

        The charge distribution becomes less uniform as frequency increases
     and eventually the signal changes so quickly that information to rearrange
     charges on the ground plane is soon (half a period latter) countered by
     reverse instructions. Thus the charge distribution depends on how fast the
     signal changes. Another way of looking at this effect is to view the charges
     on the strip of the microstrip line at one time. This is shown in Figure 4-4
     for a DC signal on the line and for a high-frequency signal. The DC situation
     is shown in Figure 4-4(a) where there is a uniform distribution of negative
     charges on the strip. This uniform distribution (in this case of negative
     charges) is seen from the viewpoint shown. The field then induces uniformly
     distributed positive charges on the ground plane. At a high frequency the
     charges on the strip alternate between negative and positive charges, as
     shown in Figure 4-4(b). Now the effective charge on the strip that is "seen"
     depends on how far the viewpoint is from the strip. When the viewpoint is
     at a large distance, it will seem as though the positive and negative charges
     cancel each other out. Thus on the ground plane at a large distance from the
     strip there will effectively be very little net charge on the strip. Consequently,
     at distance, there will be few matching charges on the ground plane that
     match the charges on the strip. Closer into the strip the ground will "see" a
     more concentrated charge on the strip and the charges on the ground plane
     will correspond more closely to the DC situation.

        The electric field lines, which must originate and terminate on charges,
     will concentrate in the substrate more closely under the strip as frequency
     increases. There will be fewer electric field lines in the air that go out to the
     fewer distant charges in the ground plane. The two major effects are that
EXTRAORDINARY TRANSMISSION LINE EFFECTS                                                      169

the effective permittivity of the microstrip line increases with frequency, and
resistive loss increases as the average current density in the ground, which
corresponds to the net charge density, increases. Thus the line resistance
and capacitance increase with frequency (see Figure 4-1(a) and 4-1(d),
respectively). For the majority of substrates G is due to dielectric relaxation
rather than conduction in the dielectric. As such, G increases linearly with
frequency with a superlinear increase at very high frequencies when the
electric field is more concentrated in the dielectric (see Figure 4-1(c)).

   In the frequency domain the current bunching effects are seen in the
higher-frequency views shown in Figures 4-3(b and c). (The concentration
of charges near the surface of the metal is a separate effect known as the
skin effect.) The longitudinal impact of current or charge bunching alone is
illustrated in Figures 4-5, 4-6, and 4-7. These figures present amplitudes of
the current and charge phasors at various frequencies and were calculated
using the Sonnet EM simulator. In interpreting these figures, take into
account the magnitudes of the current and charge distributions as identified
in the captions, as the scales are normalized. An alternative view (or time-
domain view) is the instantaneous snapshot of current and charge shown in
Figure 4-8.

   This situation is not just confined to the transverse plane, and regions
further along the interconnect also send instructions. The net effect is
bunching of charges and hence of current on both the ground plane and the
strip.

4.2.4 Skin Effect and Internal Conductor Inductance

At low frequencies, currents are distributed uniformly throughout a
conductor. Thus there are magnetic fields inside the conductor and hence
magnetic energy storage. As a result, there is internal conductor inductance.
Transferring charge to the interior of conductors is particularly slow, and
as the frequency of the signal increases, charges are confined closer to the
surface of the metal. This effect is seen in Figure 4-9 where the current density
inside the strip of a microstrip line is plotted at various frequencies. Thus
time-varying EM fields are not able to penetrate the conductors as much
as frequency increases. This phenomenon is known as the skin effect. With
lower internal currents, the internal conductor inductance reduces and the
total inductance of the line drops [1-4]. Thus the redistribution of the current
results in a change of the inductance with frequency (see Figure 4-1(b)). Only
above a few gigahertz or so can the line inductance be approximated as a
constant for the transverse interconnect dimensions of a micron to several
hundred microns.

   The skin effect is characterized by the skin depth, s, which is the distance
at which the electric field, or equivalently the charge density, reduces to 1/e
of its value at the surface. The skin depth is determined to be

s = 1/ f 02.                                        (4.1)

Here f is frequency and 2 is the conductivity of the conductor. The

conductivity is a measured quantity that is determined by the same physical
phenomenon.1 The permittivity and permeability of metals typically used

for interconnects (e.g., gold, silver, copper, and aluminum) are that of free
space, 0 and 0, respectively, as there is no mechanism to store electric
energy (there is no separation of charge centers) and, except for magnetic
materials, no mechanism to store magnetic energy (no unbalanced magnetic
moments).

4.2.5 Skin Effect and Line Resistance

The skin effect is illustrated in Figure 4-3(b) at 1 GHz. The situation is
more extreme as the frequency continues to increase (e.g., to 10 GHz) as in
Figure 4-3(c). There are several important consequences of this. On the top
conductor, as frequency increases, current flow is mostly concentrated near
the surface of the conductors and the effective cross-sectional area of the
conductor, as far as the current is concerned, is less. Thus the resistance of
the top conductor increases. A more dramatic situation exists for the charge
distribution in the ground plane. From the previous discussion of current
bunching it was noted that charge is not uniformly distributed over the
whole of the ground plane, but instead becomes more concentrated under

  accelerates free electrons that in turn radiate around the direction of motion. This process is
  repeated as the field penetrates the conductor. While the leading edge of the electric field
  propagates quickly through the conductor it rapidly diminishes in amplitude. The average
  field penetrates very slowly due to the large number of free electrons and multiple scattering
  of the field. A rough guide is that the effective velocity at microwave frequencies for transfer
  of the bulk of the energy is about c/1000. It is not possible to determine an accurate number.
172  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     the strip as frequency increases. In addition to this, charges and current
     are confined to the skin of the ground conductor so that the frequency-
     dependent relative change of ground plane resistance with increasing
     frequency is greater than that of the strip. On the strip, current bunching
     results in charges being concentrated on the edges of the strip. This effect is
     more pronounced the higher the permittivity of the substrate.

        The skin effect and current bunching result in frequency dependence of
     the line resistance, R, with

                     f such that t  3s
               R(0)

     R(f ) =                                         (4.2)

               R(0) + Rskin(f ) f such that t > 3s,

     where R(0) = Rstrip(0) + Rground(0) is the resistance of the line at low
     frequencies (see Equation (3.28)). R(f ) describes the frequency-dependent
     line resistance that is due to both the skin effect and current bunching.
     Approximately,

                                                     (4.3)
              Rskin(f ) = R(0)k f .

     Here k is a constant, and while Equation (4.3) indicates proportionality to
       f , this is an approximation, but R(f ) always increases more slowly than

     frequency [4, 6-8]. The dominant breakpoint is indicated in Equation (4.2).
        The increased resistance of the strip at high frequencies results from both

     current bunching, increasing the current density at the edges of the strip and
     reducing it in the middle with respect to the width of the strip, and skin
     effect, increasing the current density on the top and bottom surfaces of the
     strip and reducing it in the middle with respect to the thickness of the strip
     (this is of concern at frequencies where t > 3s [4, 7]). At low frequencies the
     contribution of the ground to the resistance of the line is small, but because
     of current bunching the resistance of the ground becomes significant [8] at
     higher frequencies. The resistance of the ground further increases because
     of the skin effect and at high microwave frequencies the resistance of the
     ground can be comparable to that of the strip. Surface roughness of the
     metal also affects line resistance [9]. This is easy to imagine if the roughness
     is comparable to the skin depth as the current path is increased by the
     roughness. Roughness of the metal surface primarily reflects the roughness
     of the substrate for hard substrates. With soft substrates the underside of the
     metal is intentionally roughened so that the rough needle-like metal surface
     penetrates into and anchors to the dielectric when the metal and dielectric are
     pressed together. For these reasons it is not possible to develop a simple and
     accurate expression for the frequency-dependent resistance of a microstrip
     line, and EM simulation is also necessary, but even then roughness cannot
     be accounted for. EM simulation is necessary in any case to determine
     attenuation due to radiation. It is essential to incorporate measurements into
     the design cycle of circuits at high microwave frequencies to account for
     effects that cannot be modeled [10, 11]. One observation on the frequency
     dependence of resistance is that it is pointless to make the thickness of the
     strip or of the ground thicker than three times the skin depth.

4.2.6 Dielectric Dispersion

Dispersion is principally the result of the propagation velocity of a sinusoidal
signal being dependent on frequency. For a pulse on the line, dispersion
manifests as the various frequency components of a signal traveling with
different velocities.

   The electric field lines shift as a result of the different distributions of
charge, with more of the electric energy being in the dielectric as frequency
increases. Thus the effective permittivity of a microstrip line increases
with increasing frequency. At high frequencies, the fundamental result of
the field rearrangement is that the capacitance of the line increases, but
this change can be quite small--typically less than 10% over the range
of DC to 100 GHz. (This effect is described by the frequency dependence
of the effective permittivity of the transmission line.) To a lesser extent,
dispersion is also the result of other transmission line parameters changing
with frequency, such as an interconnect's resistance. For an IC where the
interconnects can have very small transverse dimensions (e.g., microns) on
digital ICs, the line resistance is the most significant source of dispersion.
The qualitative effect of dispersion is the same whether it is related to
the resistance (resistance-induced dispersion) or change in the effective
permittivity (dielectric-inhomogeneity-induced dispersion).

   Different interconnect technologies have different dispersion characteris-
tics. For example, with a microstrip line the effective permittivity changes
with frequency as the proportion of the EM energy in the air region to that in
the dielectric region changes. Dispersion is reduced if the fields are localized
and cannot change orientation with frequency. This is the case with copla-
nar interconnects--in particular, coplanar waveguide (CPW) and coplanar
strip (CPS) lines. The stripline of Figure 3-5(k) also has low dispersion, as the
fields are confined in one medium and the effective permittivity is just the
permittivity of the medium. Thus interconnect choices can have a significant
effect on the integrity of a signal being transmitted.

   As discussed earlier, as the frequency is increased, the fields on a
microstrip line become more concentrated in the region beneath the strip.
Thus there is a frequency-dependent effective microstrip permittivity, e(f ).
This quantity increases with frequency and the wave is progressively slowed
174  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     down. The effective microstrip permittivity is now

     e (f ) = {c/ [vp (f )]}2 .                          (4.4)

     Fundamentally, characterizing the dispersion problem then consists of

     solving the transmission line fields for the frequency-dependent phase
     velocity, vp(f ). The limits of e(f ) are readily established; at the low-
     frequency extreme it reduces to the static TEM value e (or e(0)), while
     as frequency is increased indefinitely, e(f ) approaches the substrate
     permittivity itself, r. That is,

     e (f )  e(0) as f  0 r as f  . (4.5)

     Between these limits e(f ) changes smoothly.

     4.2.7 Summary

     Various transmission line technologies have different frequency dispersion
     characteristics. The two most important technologies for microwave circuits
     are coaxial lines and microstrip. With both the variation of resistance with
     frequency due principally to the skin effect are significant. However this has
     little effect on characteristic impedance and effective permittivity with the
     dominate effect being increased loss at higher frequencies. With microstrip,
     but not with a coaxial line, variations due to changing orientation of the
     EM fields is the most significant effect. With increasing frequency the
     proportion of signal energy in the air region reduces and the proportion in
     the dielectric increases. The overall trend with microstrip is for the fields
     to be more concentrated in the dielectric as frequency increases and this
     increases a microstrip line's effective relative permittivity and hence slows
     down propagation. The variation of characteristic impedance of microstrip
     with frequency is more complex as the increasingly tight transverse rotation,
     i.e. curl, of the fields tends to increase characteristic impedance but the
     increasing effective permittivity tends to decrease characteristic impedance.
     Thus following the initial design of a microstrip circuit, it is important to use
     EM simulations to adjust designs to account for dispersion.

     4.3 High-Frequency Properties of Microstrip Lines

     Here the high-frequency properties of microstrip lines are discussed and
     formulas incorporating frequency dependence are presented for effective
     permittivity, characteristic impedance, and attenuation loss. The effective
     permittivity at DC (as calculated in the previous chapter) is denoted e(0)
     and the characteristic impedance at DC is Z0(0). These are also called the
     quasi-static effective permittivity and quasi-static characteristic impedance.
     Detailed analysis [12] yields the following formula for the frequency-
     dependent effective permittivity of a microstrip line:

     e(f ) = r - m r - e(0) ,                            (4.6)

4.3.1 Frequency-Dependent Loss

The effect of loss on signal transmission is captured by the attenuation
constant, . There are two primary sources of loss: that resulting from the
dielectric, captured by the dielectric attenuation constant, d, and that from
the conductor loss, captured by the conductor attenuation constant, c. Thus

                          |dB = d|dB + c|dB .                            (4.13)

When dielectric loss is significant (e.g., the substrate is silicon which has
appreciable conductivity), the previous formula for d (Equation (3.34))
provides a good estimate for the attenuation when e is replaced by the
frequency-dependent effective relative permittivity, e(f ).

   Frequency-dependent conductor loss, described by the conductor attenu-
ation c, results from the concentration of current as frequency increases:

                                  c(f ) = R(f ) ,                        (4.14)
                                              2 Z0

where R(f ) is the frequency-dependent line resistance described in Section
4.2.5.

   A third source of loss is radiation loss, leading to an attenuation factor, r.
At the frequencies at which a transmission line is generally used, it is usually
smaller than dielectric and conductor losses. So, in full,

                    (f ) = d(f )  c(f )  r(f ),                        (4.15)

                      4.3.2 Field Simulations

                      In this section, results are presented for EM simulations of microstrip lines
                      with a variety of parameters. These simulations were performed using the
                      Sonnet EM simulator. Figure 4-10 presents calculations of Z0 for various
                      aspect ratios (w/h) and substrate permittivities (r) when there is no loss. The
                      key information here is that narrow strips and low-permittivity substrates
                      have high Z0. Conversely, wide strips and high-permittivity substrates have
                      low Z0. The dependence of permittivity on aspect ratio is shown in Figure 4-
                      11, where it can be seen that the effective permittivity, e, increases for wide
                      strips. This is because more of the EM field is in the substrate.

                         When loss is incorporated, e becomes complex and the imaginary
                      components indicate loss mostly due to conductor loss. Figure 4-12 presents
                      the frequency dependence of three microstrip lines with different substrates
                      and aspect ratios. These simulations took into account finite loss in the
                      conductors and in the dielectric. In Figure 4-12(a) it can be seen that the
                      effective permittivity, e, increases with frequency as the fields become
                      confined more to the substrate. Also, the real part of the characteristic
                      impedance is plotted with respect to frequency. Up to 20 GHz a drop-off in Z0
                      is observed as frequency increases. This is due to both reduction of internal
                      strip and ground inductances as charges move to the skin of the conductor
                      and also to greater confinement of the EM fields in the dielectric as frequency
                      increases. It is not long before the characteristic impedance increases. This
                      effect is not due to the skin effect and current bunching that were previously
                      described. Rather it is due to other EM effects that are only captured in EM
                      simulation. It is a result of spatial variations being developed in the fields
                      (related to the fact that not all parts of the fields are in instantaneous contact).

     4.3.3 Summary

     Today's microwave designer is indeed fortunate that in the 1980s
     considerable effort was put into developing frequency-dependent formulas
     for effective permittivity and characteristic impedance, Equations (4.6) and
     (4.12), and these can still be used. One effect that is not captured by these
     formulas is the increased transverse curl of the EM fields with increasing
     frequency and this tends to increase the characteristic impedance, e.g. see
     Section 4.3.2. But the frequency-dependence of effective relative permittivity
     is captured. To incorporate the geometric impact on frequency-dependent
     characteristic impedance it is necessary to optimize a design using EM
     field simulation following an initial design using the frequency-dependent
     formulas.

     4.4 Multimoding on Transmission Lines

     Multimoding is a phenomenon that affects the integrity of a signal as it
     travels on a transmission line. For transmission lines, multimoding occurs
     when there are two or more EM field configurations that can support a
     propagating wave. Different field configurations travel at different speeds
     so that the information traveling in two or modes modes would combine
     incoherently and, if the energy in the modes is comparable, it will be
     impossible to discern the intended information being sent. It is critical
     that the dimensions of transmission line structures be designed to avoid
     multimoding. The most common mode on a transmission line is when there
     is no, or the minimum possible, variation of the fields in the transverse
     direction (perpendicular to the direction of propagation).

        The transmission structures of interest here are those that have conductors
     that establish boundary conditions to guide a wave along an intended
     path. For these lines the lowest-order mode with minimum transverse field
     variations is called the TEM mode. Higher-order modes occur when the
     fields can vary. From here the discussion necessarily invokes EM theory. If
     you need to do this, see Section 1.5, where EM theory is reviewed specifically
     with respect to multimoding. One of the important concepts is that electric
     and magnetic walls impose boundary conditions on the fields. Electric walls
     are conductors, whereas a magnetic wall is formed approximately at the
     interface of two regions having different permittivity.

        It is the property of EM fields that spatial variations of the fields cannot
     occur too quickly. This comes directly from Maxwell's equations that relate
     the spatial derivative (the derivative with respect to distance) of the electric
     field to the time derivative of the magnetic field. The same is true for spatial
     variation of the magnetic field and time variation of the electric field. How
     fast a field varies with time depends on frequency. How fast an EM field
     changes spatially, its curl, depends on wavelength relative to geometry and
     on boundary conditions. Without electric and magnetic walls establishing
     boundary conditions, as in free space, a full wavelength is required to obtain
     the lowest-order variation of the fields. With electric or magnetic walls where
     the fields can terminate, a smaller distance is sufficient. Between two electric
     walls one-half wavelength of distance is required. The same is true for
     magnetic walls. With one electric wall and one magnetic wall, a quarter-
     wavelength separation of the walls will support a higher-order mode. A

general rule for avoiding multimoding is that critical transverse geometries
must be kept to under a fraction of a wavelength (say, < /2 or < /4).

   One type of multimoding has already been described. In the previous
chapter it was seen that the signals on a regular transmission line have two
simple solutions that are interpreted as the forward-traveling and backward-
traveling modes. Each mode is a possible solution of the differential
equations describing the signals. THese are not the modes being referred
to by the term multimoding. The boundary conditions in the longitudinal
direction are established by the source and load impedances, and so the
variation can be any fraction of a wavelength. This section is concerned
with other solutions to the equations describing the fields on a transmission
line structure. In general, the other solutions arise when the transverse
dimensions, such as the distance between the two conductors of a two-
conductor transmission line, permits a variation of the fields.

   The boundary conditions established at electric and magnetic walls were
derived in Section 1.8 and are summarized in Table 4-1. Circuit structures
such as transmission lines, substrate thicknesses, and related geometries are
nearly always chosen so that only one solution of Maxwell's equations is
possible. In particular, if the cross-sectional dimensions of a transmission line
are much less than a wavelength then it will be impossible for the fields to
curl up on themselves and so perhaps there will be only one or, in some cases,
no solutions to Maxwell's equations.

4.5 Parallel-Plate Waveguide

The parallel-plate waveguide shown in Figure 4-13 is the closest regular
structure to planar transmission lines such as a microstrip line. The aim here
is to develop design guidelines that will enable transmission line structures
to be designed to avoid multimoding.

     4.5.1 Electromagnetic Derivation

     The development of the wave equations begins with Maxwell's equations
     (Equations (1.1)-(1.4)). A simplification to the equations is to assume a linear,
     isotropic, and homogeneous medium, a uniform dielectric, so that  and 
     are independent of signal level and are independent of the field direction
     and position. Thus (in the time domain)

                      E = B        H = J + D                             (4.17)
                                 t                      t                       (4.18)

                      D = V          B = 0,

     where V is the volume charge density and J is the current density. J and
     V will be zero except at an electric wall. The above equations do not include
     magnetic charge or magnetic current density. These do not actually exist
     and so a modified form of Maxwell's equations incorporating these is not
     necessary to solve the fields on a structure.

        In the lateral direction, the x direction, the parallel-plate waveguide in
     Figure 4-13 extends indefinitely. For this regular structure, and with a few
     assumptions, the form of Maxwell's equations with multidimensional spatial
     derivatives can be simplified. One approach to solving differential equations
     is to assume a form of the solution and then test to see if it is a valid solution.
     The first solution to be considered is called the TEM mode and corresponds
     to the minimum possible variation of the fields. Also, it is assumed that the
     variation in the z direction is described by the traveling-wave equations. So
     the only fields of interest here are E and H in the transverse plane; all that is
     seen in Figure 4-13(b). If all the fields are in the xy plane, then it is sufficient
     to apply just the boundary conditions that come from the top and bottom
     ground planes. At first it appears that there are many possible solutions to
     the differential equations. This is simplified by assuming certain variational
     properties of the Ex, Ey, Hx, and Hy fields and then seeing if these solutions
     can be supported. The simplest solution is when there is no variation in the
     fields and then the only possible outcome is that Ex = 0 = Hy. This is the
     TEM mode indicated in Figure 4-14(a). At the boundaries, the top and bottom
     metal planes, there is a divergence of the electric field, as immediately inside
     the (ideal) conductor there is no electric field and immediately outside there
     is. This divergence is supported by the surface charge on the ground planes
     (see Equation (1.2)).

        In Figure 4-14(a), the thickness of the lines indicates relative field strength
EXTRAORDINARY TRANSMISSION LINE EFFECTS                                            181

and there is no variation in field strength in either the electric or magnetic

fields shown. The coefficients of the field components are determined by the
boundary conditions. The trial solution used here has Ex = 0 = Hy and Ez =
0 = Hz; that is, the trial solution has the electric field in the y direction and
the magnetic field is in the x direction. Maxwell's equations (Equations (4.17)
and (4.18)) become (note that E = E칧x^ + E칪y^ + E칬^z)

  Eyy^ = - B칧x^       Hxx^ = D칪x^

Expanding the curl, , and div, , operators using Equations (1.21) and
(1.22) these become (with D = E and B = 킜)

These equations describe what happens at each point in space.
   Equation (4.21) indicates that if there is a time-varying component of

the x-directed B field then there must be a z-varying component of the
Ey field component. This is just part of the wave equation describing a
field propagating in the z direction. Equation (4.22) indicates the same
thing, but now the roles of the electric and magnetic fields are reversed.
Equation (4.21) shows that the y component of the electric field can be
constant between the plates, but at the plates there must be a charge on
the surface of the conductors (see Equation (4.23)), to terminate the electric
field (as indicated by Equation (4.23)), as there is no electric field inside the
conductors. Equation (4.24) indicates that the x component of the magnetic
field cannot vary in the x direction (i.e., Bx and Hx are constant). Thus the
assumption behind the trial solution about the form of this mode is correct.
The electric and magnetic field are uniform in the transverse plane, the xy
plane, and the only variation is in the direction of propagation, the z direction
(but there is no z-directed component of the fields). Thus the test solution
satisfies Maxwell's equations. This is the TEM mode, as all field components
are in the x and y directions and none are in the z direction. The TEM mode
can be supported at all frequencies in the parallel-plate waveguide.

   In exploring the existence of higher-order modes, Maxwell's equations
need to be simplified further. Putting Equations (4.21)-(4.24) in phasor form,
and considering the source free region between the plates (so J = 0 and
 = 0), these become (note that Ex is the phasor of Ex)

   Ey = 킜x            Hx = Ey               (4.25)
    z                   z                    (4.26)
   Ey = 0               Hx = 0
    y                    x
182  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     and the solution becomes

      2 Ey                     2           2 Hx  2
                               =  Ey and     2 =  Hx,  (4.27)
     z2                                   z

     where  =  and there is no variation of the Ey component of the
     electric field in the y direction and no variation of the Hx component of the
     magnetic field in the x direction.

        Another possible set of modes occurs when the electric field is only in the
     y direction, but then there must be a variation of the field strength, as shown
     in Figure 4-14(b). The simplest variation is when there is a half-sinusoidal
     spatial variation of the Ey field component. Applying the methodology
     described above, it is found that there must be a component of the magnetic
     field in the z direction to support this mode. Hence these modes are called
     transverse electric (TE) modes. (Interchanging the roles of the electric and
     magnetic fields yields the transverse magnetic (TM) modes where there is
     an electric field component in the z direction.) The half-sinusoidal variation
     still enables the charge to support the existence of an Ey electric field.

        A key result from our previous discussion is that there must be enough
     distance for the field to curl and this is related to wavelength, . This
     transverse electric mode can only exist when h  /2. When h is smaller
     than one-half wavelength, this mode cannot be supported, and is said to be
     cut off. Only the TEM mode can be supported all the way down to DC, so
     modes other than TEM have a cutoff frequency, fc, and a cutoff wavelength,

                                                                          
     c. The concept of wavenumber k(= 2/ =  ) is also used. The
     cutoff wavelength, c, and the cutoff wavenumber, kc, are both related to
     the dimension below which a mode cannot "curl" sufficiently to be self-
     supporting. For the lowest TE mode, kc = 2/c with c = 2h. In general,
     for TE modes, there can be n variations of the electric field, and n indicates
     the nth TE mode, denoted as TEn, for which kc,n = n/h and c = 2h/n. The
     propagation constant of any mode in a uniform lossless medium (not just in
     a parallel-plate waveguide mode) is

                                   = k2 - kc2.         (4.28)

     For the TEM mode, kc = 0. High-order modes are described by their own kc.
        TM modes are similarly described, and again kc = n/h for the TMn

     mode. A mode can be supported at any frequency above the cutoff frequency
     of the mode, it just cannot be supported at frequencies below the cutoff
     frequency as it is not possible for the fields to vary (or curl) below cutoff.

     4.5.2 Multimoding and Electric and Magnetic Walls

     In the above discussion, the parallel-plate waveguide had two electric
     walls--the top and bottom metal walls. Here results will be presented when
     magnetic walls are introduced. A magnetic wall can only be approximated,
     as magnetic conductors do not exist (since magnetic charges do not exist).
     Whereas an electric wall appears as a short circuit, a magnetic wall is an
     open circuit. Maxwell's equations and the electric and magnetic walls estab-
     lish the following requirements on the fields:
EXTRAORDINARY TRANSMISSION LINE EFFECTS                                                       183

                                         Tangential electric field

Table 4-2: Requirements imposed on fields by electric and magnetic walls.

The lowest-order modes that can be supported by combinations of electric
and magnetic walls are shown in Figure 4-15. With two electric or two
magnetic walls, a TEM mode (having no field variations in the transverse
plane) can be supported. Of course, there will be variations in the field
components in the direction of propagation. The modes with the simplest
geometric variations in the plane transverse to the direction of propagation
establish the critical wavelength. In Figure 4-15 the distance between the
walls is d. For the case of two like walls (Figures 4-15(a and c)), c = 2h,
as one-half sinusoidal variation is required. With unlike walls (see Figure
4-15(b)), the varying modes are supported with just one-quarter sinusoidal
variation, and so c = 4h.

  EXAMPLE 4.2 Modes and Electric and Magnetic Walls

A magnetic wall and an electric wall are 1 cm apart and are separated by a lossless material
having r = 9. What is the cut-off frequency of the lowest-order mode in this system?

equations require that the fields vary spatially, i.e.      The cut-off frequency is
curl. Without electric and magnetic walls the minimum
distance over which the EM fields will fold back on to      f = (2.998  108 m/s)/(0.12 m)
themselves is a wavelength. With parallel electric and
magnetic wall separated by h the minimum distance           = 2.498 GHz               (4.30)
for a solution of Maxwell's equations is a quarter
wavelength, , of the walls as shown on the right in
Figure 4-15(b). That is

    h = /4 or  = 4h = 4 cm = 0/(t탍). (4.29)

4.6 Microstrip Operating Frequency Limitations

Different types of higher-order modes can exist with microstrip and the two
maximum operating frequencies of microstrip lines are (a) the lowest-order
TM mode and (b) the lowest-order transverse microstrip resonance mode.
In practice, multimoding is a problem when two conditions are met. First it
must be possible for higher-order field variations to exist, and second, that
energy can be effectively coupled into the higher-order mode. Generally this

order modes sup-

tions of electric and

                         requires significant discontinuity on the line or that the phase velocities of
                         two modes approximately coincide. An early discussion said that the phase
                         velocities of two modes would be different and this is when the dielectric
                         is uniform. However, with a nonhomogeneous line like microstrip, there
                         can be frequencies where the phase velocities of two modes can coincide.
EXTRAORDINARY TRANSMISSION LINE EFFECTS                                                        185

Since discontinuities are inevitable it is always a good idea to use only the
first consideration. As was noted previously, the modal analysis that was
possible with the parallel-plate waveguide cannot be repeated easily for the
microstrip line because of the irregular cross section, but the phenomena is
very similar. Instead of a TEM mode, there is a quasi-TEM mode and there
are TE and TM modes.

4.6.1 Microstrip Dielectric Mode (Slab Mode)

A dielectric on a ground plane with an air region (of a wavelength or more
above it) can support a TM mode, generally called a microstrip dielectric
mode, substrate mode, microstrip TM mode, or slab mode. The microstrip
dielectric mode is a problem for narrow microstrip lines. Whether this
mode exists in a microstrip environment depends on whether energy can
be coupled from the quasi-TEM mode (which is always generated) of the
microstrip line into the TM dielectric mode. The critical frequency at which
the TM mode becomes important is when there is significant coupling.
Coupling is a problem with a microstrip line having a narrow strip, as the
field orientations of the quasi-TEM mode and the dielectric mode align. Also,
coupling occurs when the phase velocities of the two modes coincide. A
detailed analysis reported in Chapter 11 of [12] and in [13] shows that this
occurs at the first critical frequency,

c tan-1 (r)
fc1 =                              .                  (4.31)
2h r - 1

At fc1 the dielectric mode will be generated even if there is not a
discontinuity. If there is a discontinuity, say a split of one microstrip line into
two microstrip lines, multimoding will occur when the dielectric mode can
exist. From Figure 4-15(b), the dielectric slab mode can be supported when

                                                                                             
h > g/4, where g is the wavelength in the dielectric. Now g = 0/ r =

     
c/(f r), so the second critical frequency is

fc2 =                        c                        (4.32)
                             .
                             4h r

This development assumes that the interface between the dielectric and air
forms a good magnetic wall. With a dielectric having a permittivity of 10,
typical for microwave circuits, the effective value of h would be increased by
up to 10%. However, it is difficult to place an exact value on this.

   In summary, fc2 is the lowest frequency at which the dielectric mode will
exist if there is a discontinuity, and fc1 is the lowest frequency at which the
dielectric mode will exist if there is not a discontinuity.

EXAMPLE 4.3 Dielectric Mode

The strip of a microstrip has a width of 1 mm and
is fabricated on a lossless substrate that is 2.5 mm
thick and has a relative permittivity of 9. At what
frequency does the substrate (or slab) mode first
occur?
186           STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     Solution:                                       variation of the magnetic or electric field can
                                                     be supported between the ground plane and

     c tan-1 (r)

     2h r - 1                                        is the critical frequency to use.

     The other critical frequency is when a

     4.6.2 Higher-Order Microstrip Mode

     If the cross-sectional dimensions of a microstrip line are smaller than a
     fraction of a wavelength, then the electric and magnetic field lines will
     be as shown in Figure 3-2. These field lines have the minimum possible
     spatial variation and the fields are almost entirely confined to the transverse
     plane; this mode is called the quasi-TEM microstrip mode. However, as the
     frequency of the signal on the line increases it is possible for these fields to
     have one-quarter or one-half sinusoidal variations. Deriving the frequency
     at which a higher-order microstrip mode is supported is involved.

        The following is a summary of a more complete discussion on operating
     frequency limitations in Section 7.8 of [12]. Some variations of the fields
     or modes do not look anything like the field orientations shown in Figure
     3-2. However, the variations that are closest to the quasi-TEM mode are
     called higher-order microstrip modes and the one that occurs at the lowest
     frequency corresponds to a half-sinusoidal variation of the electric field
     between the edge of the strip and the ground plane. This path is a little longer
     than the path directly from the strip to the ground plane. However, for a wide
     strip, most of the EM energy is between the strip and the ground plane (both
     of which are electric walls) with approximate magnetic walls on the side of
     the strip. The modes are then similar to the parallel-plate waveguide modes
     described in Section 1.5. The next highest microstrip mode (or parallel-plate
     TE mode) occurs when there can be a half-sinusoidal variation of the electric
     field between the strip and the ground plane. This corresponds to Figure 4-
     15(a). However, for finite-width strips the first higher-order microstrip mode
     occurs at a lower frequency than implied by the parallel-plate waveguide
     model. This is because the microstrip fields are not solely confined to the
     dielectric region, and in fact the electric field lines do not follow the shortest
     distance between the strip and the ground plane. Thus the fields along the
     longer paths to the sides of the strip can vary at a lower frequency than on
     the direct path. With detailed EM modeling and with experimental support
     it has been established that the first higher-order microstrip mode can exist
     at frequencies greater than [12]

                                             fHigher-Microstrip =  c .          (4.33)

     This is, however, only an approximate guide.

EXAMPLE 4.4 Higher-Order Microstrip Mode

      The strip of a microstrip has a width of 1 mm and is fabricated on a lossless substrate that

fHigher-Microstrip = c/(4h r - 1) = 10.6 GHz.

4.6.3 Transverse Microstrip Resonance

For a wide microstrip line, a transverse resonance mode can exist. This is
the mode that occurs when EM energy bounces between the edges of the
strip with the discontinuity at the strip edges forming a weak boundary. This
is illustrated in Figure 4-16, where the microstrip shown in cross section in
Figure 4-16(a) is approximated as a rectangular waveguide in Figure 4-16(b)
with magnetic walls on the sides and an extended electrical wall on the top
surface of the dielectric. Figure 4-16(b) is called the microstrip waveguide
model. The transverse resonance mode corresponds to the lowest-order H
field variation between the magnetic walls. At the cutoff frequency for this
transverse-resonant mode, the equivalent circuit is a resonant transmission
line of length w + 2d, as shown in Figure 4-17, where d = 0.2h accounts for
the microstrip side fringing. A half-wavelength must be supported by the
length w + 2d. Therefore the cutoff half-wavelength is

c = w + 2d = w + 0.4h, that is,  c                              (4.34)

Hence the critical frequency for transverse resonance is        (4.35)

4.6.4 Summary

There are four principal higher-order modes that need to be considered with
microstrip transmission lines:

Mode                                                  Critical
                                                      frequency
Dielectric (or substrate) mode with no discontinuity
Dielectric (or substrate) mode with discontinuity     Equation (4.31)
Higher order microstrip mode                          Equation (4.32)
Transverse resonance mode                             Equation (4.33)
                                                      Equation (4.35)

The lowest frequency determines the upper frequency of transmission line
operation with a single mode.

4.7 High-Frequency Considerations for Coplanar
       Waveguide

The field orientation on CPW is little affected when frequency increases and
as such the effective permittivity of CPW has little frequency dependence.
(This is in marked contrast to microstrip. )Thus dielectric-related dispersion
of CPW is minimal and this is one of the main advantages of using CPW over
microstrip. CPW has the frequency-dependent line resistance

R(f ) =  R(0)              f such that t  3s                           (4.37)
         R(0) + Rskin(f )  f such that t > 3s,

where R(0) (= Rstrip(0) + Rground(0)) is the resistance of the line at low
frequencies. R(f ) describes the frequency-dependent line resistance, which

is due to both the skin effect and current bunching. Approximately,

         Rskin(f ) = R(0)k f ,                                         (4.38)

where k is a constant. As with microstrip, EM simulations are recommended
to determine line loss. This is necessary in any case to determine attenuation
due to radiation, which can be ignored at low microwave frequencies.

   The discussion of multimoding on CPW will consider the finite ground
CPW structure (FGCPW) shown in Figure 4-18. Most of the considerations
pertaining to multimoding on microstrip apply to FGCPW. However, with
CPW the fields penetrate into the substrate a lesser distance and so it is
less likely that the substrate mode or microstrip mode will be excited.
To avoid the microstrip mode the FGCPW should be a sufficient distance
from the bottom ground plane. Generally a substrate height three or more
times both the gap and strip width is sufficient. A mode that can exist on
FGCPW that does not have an equivalent with microstrip occurs when the
ground strips on either side of the center strip acquire different voltages.
The correct functioning of FGCPW requires these to be at the same potential.
The solution is to connect the two side strips together using grounding
straps as shown in Figure 4-19(a). The straps are realized using bond wires
if FGCPW is used on a circuit board, or using air bridges if the line is on a
monolithic integrated circuit. Placing the strips at approximately one-quarter
wavelength distances is appropriate, although this can be relaxed if the line

            is fairly free of discontinuities. The straps should be placed randomly to
            avoid any filtering effect that could result from placing the straps at regular
            intervals. The straps should also be used whenever there is a discontinuity
            (see, e.g., the junction in Figure 4-19(b)).

            4.8 High-Frequency Considerations for Stripline

            A stripline transmission line is shown in Figure 4-20. Being a homogeneous
            line, stripline does not have a frequency-dependent permittivity until
            molecular effects become important at hundreds of gigahertz (depending on
            the substrate). Stripline has the frequency-dependent line resistance

            R(f ) =  R(0)                  f such that t  3s                (4.39)
                     R(0) + Rskin(f )      f such that t > 3s,

            where R(0) = Rstrip(0) + Rground(0) is the resistance of the line at low
            frequencies. R(f ) describes the frequency-dependent line resistance, which
            is due to both the skin effect and current bunching. Approximately,

                     Rskin(f ) = R(0)k f ,                                  (4.40)

            where k is a constant.
               As with microstrip, EM simulations are recommended to determine line

            loss. However, provided that regular vias are used between the ground
            planes (and eliminating the TEM parallel plate mode), attenuation due to
            radiation loss is minimal.

               The moding that is of most concern with stripline is the parallel plate
            waveguide mode that can be excited at stripline discontinuities. The simplest
EXTRAORDINARY TRANSMISSION LINE EFFECTS                                          191

parallel plate waveguide mode has no variation of the fields in the transverse
direction, so there is a uniform electric field from the top plate to the
bottom plate. This mode can propagate down to DC. In normal operation
a stripline has an E field directed from the strip to the top ground plane and
an oppositely directed E field from the strip to the bottom ground plane.
Thus excitation of the parallel plate waveguide mode can be suppressed
by making sure that the two ground planes are at the same potential. This
is done by periodically shorting the two ground planes together using
through-substrate vias. Apart from this consideration, the multimoding
considerations presented for the microstrip should also be considered.

4.9 Power Losses and Parasitic Effects

Four separate mechanisms lead to power losses in microstrip lines:
  (a) Conductor losses.
  (b) Dissipation in the dielectric of the substrate.
  (c) Radiation losses.
  (d) Surface-wave propagation.

The first two items are dissipative effects, whereas radiation losses and
surface-wave propagation are essentially parasitic phenomena. The reader
is directed to Chapter 8 of [12] for an extensive treatment. Here, summary
results are presented.

   Conductor losses greatly exceed dielectric losses for most microstrip
lines fabricated on low-loss substrates. Lines fabricated on low-resistivity
silicon wafers, however, can have high dielectric loss. These wafers are
most commonly used for digital circuits, and the interconnect transverse
dimensions are generally very small so that line resistance is very high, and
again, resistive losses dominate.

   Radiation from a microstrip line results from asymmetric structures. In
particular, discontinuities such as abruptly open-circuited microstrip (i.e.,
open ends), steps, and bends will all radiate to a certain extent. Such
discontinuities form essential features of microwave circuits and therefore
radiation cannot be avoided. Efforts must be made to reduce such radiation
and its undesirable effects. In most cases, radiation can be represented by a
shunt admittance.

   Surface waves, trapped just beneath the surface of the substrate dielectric,
will propagate away from microstrip discontinuities as TE and TM modes.
The effect of surface waves can be treated as a shunt conductance.

   Various techniques can be used to suppress radiation and surface waves:

  (a) Metallic shielding or "screening."
  (b) The introduction of lossy (i.e., absorbent) material near any radiative

       discontinuity.
  (c) The utilization of compact, planar, inherently enclosed circuits such as

       inverted microstrip and stripline.
  (d) Reducing the current densities flowing in the outer edges of any metal

       sections and concentrate currents toward the center and in the middle
       of the microstrip.
  (e) Possibly shaping the discontinuity in some way to reduce the radiative
       efficiency.

          4.10 Lines on Semiconductor Substrates

          Propagation on transmission line structures fabricated on semiconductor
          substrates can have peculiar behavior. The interest in such lines is in rela-
          tion to RF integrated circuits (RFICs) and monolithic microwave integrated
          circuits (MMICs) using both silicon and compound semiconductor technolo-
          gies. More specifically, interconnects on metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)
          or metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) systems, where an insulating layer,
          such as oxide, exists between the conductor and the semiconductor wafer
          (see Figure 4-21(a)), are of particular interest due to their ability to support a
          slow-wave mode. A slow-wave mode propagates much slower than would
          be expected. In the case of a semiconductor substrate with intermediate con-
          ductivity, the magnetic field penetrates into the substrate but the electric field
          does not. This separation of magnetic and electric fields slows the wave.
          Slow-wave structures find major use in distributed elements on-chip at RF.
          In particular, a silicon substrate can have a significant impact on microstrip
          propagation that derives from the charge layer formed at the silicon-silicon
          dioxide interface. The slow-wave effect is utilized in delay lines, couplers,
          and filters. With Schottky contact lines, the effect is used in variable-phase
          shifters, voltage-tunable filters, and various other applications.

             Now, an intuitive explanation of the propagation characteristics of
          microstrip lines on layered substrates can be based on the parallel-plate
          structure shown in Figure 4-22. For an exact EM analysis of the slow-
          wave effect with silicon substrates, see [14]. As well as developing a very
          useful approximation for the important situation of transmission lines on
          an insulator such as silicon oxide on a semiconductor, the treatment below
          indicates the type of approach that can be used to analyze unusual structures.
          In this structure, assume a quasi-TEM mode of propagation. In other
          words, the wave propagation parameters , , and Z0 can be deduced from
          electrostatic and magnetostatic solutions for the per unit length parameters
          C, G, L, and R.

             The analysis begins with a treatment of the classic Maxwell-Wagner
          capacitor. Figure 4-23(a) shows the structure of such a capacitor where there
          are two different materials between the parallel plates of the capacitor with
          different permittivities and conductivities. The equivalent circuit is shown in

Equation (4.43). Using Equations (4.43) and (4.45) yields

                                1 + 2 -  +  122 d
                               e =                                 2.                                (4.46)

   Consider now the case when R1 goes to infinity (i.e., Layer 1, the top layer,
in Figure 4-23 is an insulator). For this case, Equation (4.46) becomes

                               1 + 1 + d2 1 2 2
                                              2 2 d1 2 2 1 d .
                           =                                          d1                             (4.47)

                                                             2

It is clear from Equations (4.46) and (4.47) that the effective complex
permittivity has a frequency-dependent component. Consider how this
varies with a few cases of . For  = 0, the static value of the effective
permittivity is

                                                        d
                                         e,0 = 1 .                                                   (4.48)
                                                        d1

For the case where  goes to infinity (the optical value), the real part of the
effective permittivity is

                                  e, =        12 (d1 + d2)         .                                 (4.49)

                 4.10.1 Modes on the MIS (MOS) Line

                 The previous description of the properties of a Maxwell-Wagner capacitor
                 leads to a discussion of the possible modes on the MIS (MOS) line. To make
                 the problem tractable, the transmission line shown in Figure 4-21(a) will be
                 approximated as having the cross section shown in Figure 4-24(a).

                 Dielectric Quasi-TEM Mode

                 The first possible mode is the dielectric quasi-TEM mode, for which the

                 sectional equivalent circuit model of Figure 4-24(b) is applicable. In this

                 mode    2      2.  This      implies  from  the  earlier  discussion  that       =        and

                                                                                              e       e,

                   e  =  0.  Thus  the  per  unit  length  parameters  are

                                L = 0 d1 , C1 = 1 W , C2 = 2 W , G2 = 2 W .                              (4.51)

                 These have the SI units H/m for L, F/m for C1, F/m for C2, and S/m for G2.

Skin-Effect Mode

The second possible mode is the skin-effect mode, for which the sectional
equivalent circuit model of Figure4-24(c) is applicable. Here, 2  2 is

Slow-Wave Mode

The third possible mode of propagation is the slow-wave mode [15, 16], for

which the sectional equivalent circuit model of Figure 4-24(d) is applicable.

This mode occurs when f is not so large and the resistivity is moderate so

that  the  skin   depth,  s,  is  larger  than  (or  on  the  order  of)  d2.  Thus       =  e,0,

                                                                                      e

but    e  =  0.  Therefore

4.11 Summary

Design is an iterative process and initial RF design is based on frequency-
independent characteristics. For a transmission line, quantities such as the
characteristic impedance, effective permittivity, phase and group velocities,
and the RLGC parameters are taken as fixed. The RLGC parameters are
the basis of the simplest lumped-element circuit model of a transmission
line. Each of the components of this model will vary with frequency. The
resistance per unit length, R, increases with frequency as charges concentrate
on the surface of conductors and charges bunch (i.e., become less spread out).
Both of these effects are due to the finite time it takes to transmit the EM
signal that rearranges charges to support an alternating wave.

   An EM signal on a transmission line is described by Maxwell's equations
and there can be many possible solutions depending on the boundary
conditions. With transmission lines and other microwave structures such
as resonators these are called modes. All transmission lines have at least
two solutions, the forward- and backward-traveling waves. While strictly
these are also modes, this classification is avoided by microwave engineers.
Microwave engineers identify modes as different solutions to Maxwell's
equations that, for transmission lines, are different orientations of the
196              STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

fields largely in the transverse direction to propagation. Each mode will,
in general, have forward- and backward-traveling components. A two-
conductor transmission line is designed to have dimensions that are small
enough that there is only one mode, or else special precautions are taken
to avoid a second mode being established. Sometimes multimoding is
desirable. If these multimoded structures are used there are strict design
criteria that enable the special functionality that is made available to be
exploited. Multimoding sets the upper bound on the frequency of operation
of most transmission line structures.

   The most popular microwave transmission lines--microstrip, stripline
and CPW--can all support multiple modes, but most are cut off by keeping
transverse dimensions small with respect to a wavelength. When it is
possible for a second (or higher-order) mode to exist, whether that mode
is generated depends on the coupling mechanism between modes. This
coupling mechanism is a discontinuity, which of course is common if circuit
structures are to be incorporated. Stripline and CPW can support a second
mode at quite low frequencies. With stripline the dominant second mode is
the parallel-plate waveguide mode supported by the two ground planes of
stripline.

   A microwave designer must always be aware of frequency dependence
and multimoding and choose dimensions to avoid their occurrence except
when the use is intentional and controlled.

5.1 Introduction

This chapter describes what happens when two transmission lines are so
close together that the fields produced by one line interfere with the other
line. Then a portion of the signal energy on one line is transferred to the
other resulting in coupling. For microstrip lines the coupling reduces as the
lines separate and usually the coupling is small enough to be ignored if the
separation is at least three times the height of the strips. Transmission line
coupling may be undesirable in many situations, but the phenomenon is
exploited to realize many novel RF and microwave elements such as filters. A
coupled pair of transmissions lines also enables the forward- and backward-
traveling waves on a line to be separately measured.

   The chapter begins with a discussion of the physics of coupling which
leads to the preferred description of propagation on a pair of parallel
coupled lines (PCLs) as supporting an even mode and an odd mode,
and forward- and backward-traveling versions of each. Many microwave
circuit elements are based on PCL elements such as PCL filters. The
separation of the fields into even and odd modes comes naturally from
a consideration of the fields. This is leads to a low-frequency circuit
model described in Section 5.4. Section 5.4.1 presents a high frequency
204  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     model of a PCL with the L and C model of a single transmission line
     replaced by multiple inductances, capacitances, and mutual inductances and
     capacitances. As with single microstrip lines, formulas have been developed
     for the propagation characteristics of a pair of coupled microstrip lines, and
     these are presented in Section 5.6. The rest of the chapter builds up design
     concepts and presents some particular applications on the way.

        Section 5.7 presents the analysis used to determine reflection coefficients
     of terminated coupled lines. The next section, Sections 5.8, describe two
     types of couplers that use a pair of coupled lines to selectively separate
     and tap off a portion of the power in either the forward-traveling wave,
     the backward-traveling wave, or both. A design technique for synthesizing
     them is presented and this is key to nearly all design using a pair of
     coupled lines as a circuit element. Section 5.9 presents the circuit models
     for various coupled line configurations and these models are essential to
     the synthesis of PCL-based microwave components. There are other ways to
     partition the modes on a pair of coupled lines and with RFICs the preferred
     description uses differential and common modes as described in Section 5.10.
     The difference between these modes and odd and even modes comes down
     to bookkeeping with a preference to use differential and common modes
     with circuits, and a preference to use odd and even modes when relating
     to fields. The final section, Section 5.11, describes another type of coupling,
     common impedance coupling. This is not always related to PCLs but this is
     the appropriate place to consider this phenomenon.

     5.2 Physics of Coupling

     If the fields of one transmission line intersect the region around another
     transmission line, then some of the energy propagating on the first line
     appears on the second. This coupling discriminates in terms of forward- and
     backward-traveling waves. In particular, consider the coupled microstrips
     shown in Figure 5-1. The direction of propagation comes from E  H. Using
     the right-hand rule, the direction of propagation of the signal on the left-
     hand strip is out of the page. This is called the forward-traveling direction.
     Now consider the fields around the right-hand strip, the inactive line, and
     note the direction of the E field. The H field immediately to the left of the
     right-hand strip is stronger than on the right of the strip. So effectively there
     is a clockwise circulation of the H field around the right hand strip. By
     applying EH to the signal induced on the right-hand strip, it is seen that the
     induced signal travels into the page, or in the backward-traveling direction.
     The coupling with parallel-coupled microstrip lines is called backward-
     wave coupling. This is, of course, a frequency-domain view of coupling. In
     practice, there is also a small component of forward coupling.

        In digital systems the forward coupling is of most importance because
     of the way traveling waves are reinforced. To appreciate this, consider a
     voltage step traveling in the forward direction on one strip. The step edge
     couples across to the neighboring line, producing a large backward-traveling
     pulse and a smaller forward-traveling pulse (approximately the derivative of
     the original step signal). The coupled forward-traveling pulse travels at the
     same velocity as the step signal so that the coupled forward-traveling signal
     integrates over time, whereas the backward-traveling signal does not.

        The discussion now returns to the frequency-domain view, as this is the

required orientation in designing narrowband systems (i.e., most RF and
microwave circuits). Previously forward- and backward-traveling waves on
an individual transmission line were introduced as separate modes; each
mode is a self-sustaining and propagating field orientation on a transmission
line. By analogy, in understanding coupled line behavior, and to facilitate
design using transmission line coupling, it is a good idea to treat a pair of
coupled lines as a single transmission structure. This structure supports two
families of modes called the even mode and the odd mode, and both have
forward- and backward-traveling components (see Figure 5-2).

   In the even mode (Figures 5-2(a and b)), the amplitude and polarity of
the voltages on the two signal conductors are the same. In the odd mode
(Figures 5-2(c and d)), the voltages on the two signal conductors are equal
but have opposite polarity. Any EM field orientation on the coupled lines
can be represented as a weighted addition of the even-mode and odd-mode
field configurations.

   It is just as valid to consider the field orientations based on each of
the lines (taken one at a time) and to consider the effect of the other line
as a perturbation of the fields of the first line. However, the odd- and
even-mode view of the fields assists in understanding and quantitatively
describing coupling. This view facilitates the design of components that
exploit coupling. The configuration of the fields supported by the coupled
lines depends on how the lines are driven and terminated. The actual fields
will be a superposition of the even and odd modes. Also, at any instant the
voltages on the lines are composed of even and odd components.

   The characteristic impedances of the even and odd modes will differ
because of the different field orientations. These are termed the even-
mode and odd-mode characteristic impedances, denoted by Z0e and Z0o,
respectively. Here the e subscript identifies the even mode and the o subscript
identifies the odd mode. With coupled microstrip lines, the phase velocities

                of the two modes will differ since the two modes have different amounts
                of energy in the air and in the dielectric, resulting in different effective
                permittivities of the two modes.

                   Coupled lines are modeled by determining the propagation characteristics
                of the even and odd modes. Also, at the circuit level, coupling can be
                described by network parameters that relate total voltage and current. Using
                the definitions shown in Figures 5-3 and 5-4, the total voltage and current
                phasors on the original structure are a superposition of the even- and odd-
                mode solutions:

V2 = VF e - VF o        I1 = IF e + IF o 
V3 = VBe + VBo
V4 = VBe - VBo          I2 = IF e - IF o  ,
                        I3 = IBe + IBo
                        I4 = IBe - IBo

with the subscripts F and B indicating the front and back, respectively, of
the even- and odd-mode components. Also

VF e = (V1 + V2)/2                                           (5.2)
VF o = (V1 - V2)/2      IF e = (I1 + I2)/2
VBe = (V3 + V4)/2
VBo = (V3 - V4)/2       IF o = (I1 - I2)/2 .
                        IBe = (I3 + I4)/2
                        IBo = (I3 - I4)/2

The forward-traveling components can be written as

    +  +  +             + + -
V1 = VF e + VF o        I1 = IF e + IF o 
    +  +  +             +       +     -

V4 = VBe - VBo          I4 = IBe - IBo

The backward-traveling components are written similarly so that the total
front and back even- and odd-mode voltages are

VF e = VF e + + VF e -  VBe = VBe + + VBe - 
VF o = VF o + + VF o -             +                -.       (5.4)
                        VBo = VBo + VBo

   With an ideal voltmeter the V1, V2, V3, and V4 voltages would be measured
from a point on the strip to a point on the ground plane immediately
below. The voltages 2VF o and 2VBo are the voltages that would be measured
between the strips at the front and back of the lines, respectively (see Figure
5-2). It would not be possible to directly measure VF e and VBe.

   One set of network parameters describing a pair of coupled lines is the
port-based admittance matrix equation relating the port voltages, V1-V4, to
the port currents, I1-I4:

                                       
I1        y11 y12 y13 y14                           V1

 I3   I2  =  y31 y32 y33 y34   V3   y21 y22 y23 y24   V2  .  (5.5)

I4        y41 y42 y43 y44                           V4

These are port-based y parameters as the currents and voltages are defined
for ports. Since microstrip lines are fabricated (most of the time) on non-
magnetic dielectrics, then they are reciprocal so that yij = yji. Coupling from
one line to another is described by the terms y12 (=y21) and y34 (=y43).

Summary

The important concept introduced in this section is that fields and the
propagating waves on a pair of parallel coupled lines can be described as
a combination of odd and even modes each of which has forward- and
backward-wave versions.

     5.3 Coupled Transmission Line Theory

     In this section coupled transmission line theory is developed in terms of the
     quantities shown in Figure 5-4. The voltages and currents shown here are
     phasors that vary along the line and are functions of x.

        The quasi-TEM mode of propagation is also assumed, and the transmis-
     sion line system is completely lossless with perfect conductors and insula-
     tors. In phasor form, the generalized telegrapher's equations for a pair of
     coupled lines are1

             dV1(x) = -L11I1(x) - L12I2(x)                   (5.6)
               dx                                            (5.7)
                                                             (5.8)
             dV2(x) = -L21I1(x) - L22I2(x)                   (5.9)
               dx

             dI1(x) = -C11V1(x) - C12V2(x)
               dx

             dI2(x) = -C21V1(x) - C22V2(x).
               dx

     These are generalizations of the telegrapher's equations of a single
     transmission line, and for reciprocity, C12 = C21 and L12 = L21. Compaction
     of the equations is obtained by introducing the per unit length inductance
     matrix, L, and the per unit length capacitance matrix, C, defined as

         L=  L11 L12              and C = C11 C12 C12 C22 .  (5.10)
             L12 L22

     The next step is to express the voltage on the pair of coupled transmission
     lines in vector form as

             V(x) =       V1(x)   = [V1(x) V2(x)]T,          (5.11)
                          V2(x)

     where T indicates transpose and converts the row vector into a column
     vector. Similarly the vector of currents on the coupled transmission lines is

                          I(x) = [I1(x) I2(x)]T.             (5.12)

     Using the above relations, the telegrapher's equation, from Equations (5.6)-
     (5.9), is represented in matrix form as

         d V(x) = -LI(x)  (5.13)  and d I(x) = -CV(x).       (5.14)
         dx                               dx

     Rearranging Equations (5.13) and (5.14), taking derivatives, and after
     substitution, the final wave-equation form is obtained:

     d2 2V(x) + 2LCV(x) = 0 (5.15) and d2 2I(x) + 2LCI(x) = 0. (5.16)
     dx                           dx

     Solving these second-order differential equations yields descriptions of the

     1 In Figure 5-4(a) V1 and V2 are the voltages at terminals 1 and 2 of lines 1 and 2. They are also

       port voltages referenced to the ground immediately below the appropriate terminal. V1(x)

       and V2(x) are the total voltage anywhere on lines 1 and 2, respectively, as shown in Figure

      5-4(b). Similar notation will be used for voltages and traveling-wave components.
COUPLED LINES AND APPLICATIONS                                                                     209

propagation characteristics. With confidence, a solution in the form of
propagating waves can be assumed:

V(x) = V0 = V0 diag(e-1x, e-2x) = V0 0 e-2x e . (5.17) -1x 0

Substituting this into Equation (5.15) yields             (5.18)
                                  -2V0 + 2 LCV0 = 0.

For a nontrivial solution of Equation (5.18), the determinant of the matrix
equation should be zero:

              2                                       10
det LC - 2 U = 0, where the unit matrix U =               . (5.19)
                                                      01

Equation (5.19) is the characteristic equation that can be solved to determine
the phase constant, . There are many possible solutions, and weighted
linear combinations of the solutions are also solutions.

   If only the quasi-TEM modes are considered, then there are two possible
sets of solutions for the phase constant, with one set of solutions being

1 = 켚1             (5.20) and the other 2 = 켚2. (5.21)

The different signs here are physically interpreted as referring to the
forward- and backward-traveling waves. Thus the coupled pair of
conductors supports two unique families of modes (each family comprising
forward- and backward-traveling waves) with each family relating to a
particular field configuration on the coupled line system.2 That is, S1 and S2
are each single numbers and, just considering the forward-traveling waves,
S1 is the propagation constant of one mode and S2 is the propagation
constant of the second mode.

   The circuit-level model of a coupled line pair is developed by considering
the calculation of the L and C matrices. The elements of the capacitance
matrix are obtained in two simulations in which the line charge is
calculated. A variety of commercially available software packages exist
for the extraction of the per unit length L and C matrices. The matrix C
is calculated, in most packages, from the solutions of a two-dimensional
electrostatic problem. The steps involve solving for the charges on the lines
with voltages set on the conductors. With total voltages V1 and V2 on lines 1
and 2, the charges on lines Q1 and Q2 are

Q1 = C11V1 + C12V2  (5.22) and Q2 = C12V1 + C22V2.        (5.23)

Simulation 1: With V1 = 1 and V2 = 0, the charges are calculated with the
result that

C11 = Q1 > 0        (5.24) and C12 = Q2 < 0.              (5.25)

(Note that Cij , i =j, is negative.)

2 Also it is up to the user to decide the form of the families to use. The most convenient family
  in microwave analysis is to use even and odd modes. In general, a system with N active
  conductors (and one reference conductor) will support 2  N (quasi-) TEM modes.
210  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     Simulation 2: With V1 = 0 and V2 = 1, the charges are recalculated, and now

     C22 = Q2 and C12 = Q1.  (5.26)

        The characterization of the lines is completed by determining the elements
     of the inductance matrix. This is done by calculating the capacitances with
     and without the dielectric. The principle effect of the dielectric is to alter
     the configuration and magnitude of the electric field. The dielectric has
     little effect on the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field. With
     the same current on the coupled lines, the same magnetic energy is stored,
     and the inductances of the coupled line are unchanged by the dielectric.
     The other assumption is that with a TEM mode on thelines, and in the
     absence of a dielectric, the velocity of propagation is c = 1/ LC. Specifically,
     the assumption is that for a TEM mode and without a dielectric, the
     phase velocity is just c. This is a very good approximation and is exact
     if the conductors have infinite conductivity. (If the conductors have finite
     conductivity there would be field inside the conductors, and the wave slows
     down slightly.) Determining the capacitance matrix without the dielectric
     enables the inductance matrix to be calculated:

                   1 -1      (5.27)
     L = L0 = 2 C0 ,

                  c

     where the subscript 0 indicates free space (but a subscript 0 on Z, e.g., Z0,
     indicates characteristic impedance).

     5.3.1 Summary

     This section introduced the telegrapher's equations for a pair of coupled
     lines in a form that is an extension of the telegrapher's equations of a single
     line but with the L and C of a single line replaced by 2  2 L and C matrices.
     It is no longer necessary to deal with fields and a circuit model can be used.

     5.4 Low-Frequency Capacitance Model of Coupled Lines

     The low-frequency model of a pair of lossless coupled lines comprises only
     capacitances. A pair of coupled lines, as shown in Figure 5-5(a), has four
     terminals. At very low frequencies V1 and V3 are identical as are voltages V2
     and V4. So the low-frequency model of the pair of coupled lines has just two
     terminals in addition to ground, as shown in Figure 5-5(b).

        The capacitances in Figure 5-5(b) are the shunt capacitance C1 and C2 and
     the mutual capacitance Cg. In the even mode, the voltages at terminals 1
     and 2 are the same so that Cg vanishes and the low-frequency capacitance
     model of the pair of coupled lines in the even mode comprises just the self-
     capacitances C1 and C2 (see Figure 5-5(c)). In the odd mode, the voltage
     at terminal 2 is the negative of the voltage at terminal 1. The result is that
     there is a virtual ground between the terminals. Now a better circuit model
     is that shown in Figure 5-5(d). This is where the restriction that the lines are
     of equal width is used. This assumption places the virtual ground between
     equal-value capacitances. The symmetrical case is the one of most interest.
     If asymmetrical coupled lines are to be analyzed, the analysis departs at this
     point and EM simulation is required.

        To proceed, the capacitance model must be put in the form of per unit
     length capacitances and put in terms of the elements of a capacitance matrix.

The indefinite nodal admittance matrix of the low-frequency coupled-line
model of Figure 5-5(b) is

              Y =      C1 + Cg    -Cg         = C,                  (5.28)
                         -Cg    C2 - Cg

where  is the length of the coupled lines, and C is the per unit length
capacitance matrix (see Equation (5.10)). Thus the low-frequency capacitance
model of a pair of coupled lines of length  and equal width is as shown in
Figure 5-6(a). It is found in analysis that C12 is negative.

   For symmetrical coupled lines (the strips having the same width) the per
unit length even- and odd-mode capacitances, as defined in the definition of
odd and even modes in Section 5.2, are

              Ce = C11 + C12 and Co = C11 - C12.                    (5.29)

That is, C =  C11 C12  =11      (Ce  +  Co)  1  (Ce  -  Co)  .      (5.30)

     5.4.1 Capacitance Matrix Extraction

     This section describes a general procedure for the extraction of the
     capacitance matrix of a number of coupled conductors [1]. Either
     measurements or measurement-like simulations can be used. This is done
     by evaluating one capacitance at a time for different connections of
     interconnects to each other.

        Without loss of generality, consider the three-line structure shown in
     Figure 5-7, where there are four conductors, including ground. A 3  3
     capacitance matrix is extracted from the capacitances of pairs of connected
     conductors. There are seven possible combinations, as shown on the left-
     hand side of Figure 5-8. However, because of reciprocity, Cij = Cji, there are
     only six capacitances (C11, C12, C13, C22, C23, and C33) to be determined, and
     only six sets of connections are required. The seventh set serves as a check.
     In an EM simulation, the connections are conveniently realized by holding
     the black group at one voltage (e.g., 1 V) and the white group at 0 V. The
     corresponding capacitance connections are shown on the right in the figure:
     the seven individual capacitance measurements are CA, CB, CC , CD, CE, CF ,
     and CG. Thus the elements of the capacitance matrix are

                               C11  =  C      +  C      +  C

Using the first six measurements in Figure 5-8,

      CA = C11                                                      (5.32)
      CB = C22  CD = C11 + 2C12 + C22                               (5.33)
      CC = C33  CE = C11 + 2C13 + C33 .
                CF = C22 + 2C23 + C33 
      C11 = CA
      C22 = CB  C12  = C21  =  1  (CD  -         CA  -  CB )  
      C33 = CC                 2
                                                              
                C13 = C31 = 12 (CE - CA - CC ) .
Thus            C23 = C32 = 21 (CF - CB - CC ) 

This extraction does not require the widths of the strips to be the same.

5.5 Symmetric Coupled Transmission Lines

In this section, even and odd modes are considered as defining independent

transmission lines. The development is restricted to a symmetrical pair of

coupled lines; that is, each transmission line of the pair is identical. Thus the
strips have the same self-inductance, Ls = L11 = L22, and self-capacitance,
Cs = C11 = C22, where the subscript s stands for "self." Lm = L12 = L21
and Cm = C12 = C21 are the mutual inductance and capacitance of the lines,
and the subscript m stands for "mutual." Equations (5.6)-(5.9) can thus be

written as

      dV1(x) = -LsI1(x) - LmI2(x)                                   (5.34)
        dx                                                          (5.35)
                                                                    (5.36)
      dV2(x) = -LmI1(x) - LsI2(x)                                   (5.37)
        dx

      dI1(x) = -CsV1(x) - CmV2(x)
        dx

      dI2(x) = -CmV1(x) - CsV2(x).
        dx

The even mode is defined as the mode corresponding to both conductors
being at the same potential and carrying the same currents:3

                V1 = V2 = Ve and I1 = I2 = Ie.                      (5.38)

The odd mode is defined as the mode corresponding to the conductors

being at opposite potentials relative to the reference conductor and carrying
currents of equal amplitude but of opposite sign:4

      V1 = -V2 = Vo and I1 = -I2 = Io.                              (5.39)

   The characteristics of the two possible modes of the coupled transmission
lines are now described. For the even mode, from Equations (5.34) and (5.35),

                 d [V1(x) + V2(x)] = - [Lm + Ls] [I1(x) + I2(x)] ,  (5.40)
                 dx                                                 (5.41)
which becomes

                              dVe(x) = - (Ls + Lm) Ie(x).
                                 dx

3 Here Ie = (I1 + I2)/2 and Ve = (V1 + V2)/2. The reason for the supposedly equally valid
  definition Ie = I1 + I2 not being used is that the adopted definition results in the desirable

  form of the even-mode characteristic impedance.
4 Here Io = (I1 - I2)/2 and Vo = (V1 - V2)/2.
214      STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     Similarly, using Equations (5.36) and (5.37),

         d [I1(x) + I2(x)] = - (Cs + Cm) [V1(x) + V2(x)] ,             (5.42)
         dx

     which in turn becomes

         dIe(x) = - (Cs + Cm) Ve(x).                                   (5.43)
           dx

        Defining the even-mode inductance and capacitance, Le and Ce,
     respectively, as

     Le = Ls + Lm = L11 + L12 and Ce = Cs + Cm = C11 + C12 (5.44)

     leads to the even-mode telegrapher's equations:

     dVe(x) = - LeIe(x)     (5.45)       and dIe(x) = - CeVe(x).       (5.46)
       dx                                          dx

     From these, the even-mode characteristic impedance can be found,

                            Z0e =  Le =      Ls + Lm ,                 (5.47)
                                   Ce        Cs + Cm

     and also the even-mode phase velocity,

                                   vpe =  1 .                          (5.48)
                                             LeCe

        The characteristics of the odd-mode operation of the coupled transmission
     line can be determined in a similar procedure to that used for the even
     mode. Using Equations (5.34)-(5.37), the odd-mode telegrapher's equations
     become

     dVo(x) = - (Ls - Lm) Io(x) and dIo(x) = - (Cs - Cm) Vo(x).
     dx                                             dx
                            (5.49)                                     (5.50)

     Defining Lo and Co for the odd mode such that

     Lo = Ls - Lm = L11 - L12 and Co = Cs - Cm = C11 - C12, (5.51)

     then the odd-mode characteristic impedance is

                            Z0o =  Lo =      Ls - Lm                   (5.52)
                                   Co        Cs - Cm

     and the odd-mode phase velocity is

                                   vpo =  1 .                          (5.53)
                                             LoCo

        Now for a sanity check. If the individual strips are widely separated, Lm
     and Cm will become very small and Z0e and Z0o will be almost equal. As the
     strips become closer, Lm and Cm will become larger and Z0e and Z0o will
     diverge. This is as expected.

5.5.1 Odd-Mode and Even-Mode Capacitances

The previous section used the even- and odd-mode capacitances for two
coupled microstrip lines with the strips having equal cross section so that
each strip had the same self-capacitances. In this section this restriction
is removed and the results apply to any pair of coupled lines in any
technology and of any cross section. The results enable the capacitances of
the capacitance matrix to be determined from calculations of the charges on
the lines. Repeating Equations (5.22) and (5.23),

   Q1 = C11V1 + C12V2 and Q2 = C21V1 + C22V2,                   (5.54)

the capacitance matrix is

                           C = C11 C12 C21 C22 .                (5.55)

In the even mode V1 = V2 = Ve and so the even-mode charges on strip 1 and
strip 2 are

Q1e = (C11 + C12) Ve and Q2e = (C21 + C22) Ve,                  (5.56)

respectively. Defining the even-mode charge as

                           Qe = (Q1e + Q2e) /2,                 (5.57)

then the even-mode charge becomes

   Qe = Ve(C11 + C22 + C12 + C21)/2.                            (5.58)

This leads to the even-mode per unit length capacitance,

   Ce = Qe/Ve = (C11 + C22 + C12 + C21)/2.                      (5.59)

   Similarly, in the odd mode, Vo = V1 = -V2, and the odd-mode charges on
strip 1 and strip 2 are

Q1o = (C11 - C12) Vo and Q2o = (C21 - C22) Vo,                  (5.60)

respectively. The odd-mode charge is then

Qo = (Q1o - Q2o) /2 = (C11 + C22 - C12 - C21) Vo/2.             (5.61)

The odd-mode capacitance is

   Co = Qo/Vo = (C11 + C22 - C12 - C21)/2.                      (5.62)

EXAMPLE 5.1 Parallel Line Capacitance

EM software can be used to determine the even- and odd-mode parameters of a coupled
line. This is usually done by setting the phasor voltages on the coupled line and evaluating
the phasor charges. Consider a pair of coupled microstrip lines as in Figure 5-4. The voltage
applied to the left strip is designated as V1 and the voltage applied to the right strip is V2.
The phasor charge on the strips are Q1 and Q2, respectively. The analysis is repeated, but this
time with the substrate removed, and so establishing the free-space situation. In this case the
charges are denoted by Q01 and Q02. The matrix of (computer-based) measurements is as
follows:

Case V1 (V) V2 (V) Q1 (pC/m) Q2 (pC/m) Q01 (pC/m) Q02 (pC/m)

      (k) What is the odd-mode impedance?
      (l) What is the even-mode phase velocity?
     (m) What is the odd-mode phase velocity?

      Solution:

      (a) Begin by considering the cross section of a coupled
           line shown to the right and use the basic equations
           relating the charges on the line to the voltages on
           them:

            Q1 = C11V1 + C12V2 and Q2 = C21V1 + C22V2,

           and consider two sets of voltage conditions.

     Case A: This is the odd excitation, V1 = 1 V and V2 = -1 V and the charges are

     Q1A = C11 - C12        (5.63) and                          Q2A = C21 - C22.          (5.64)
                                                                                          (5.66)
     Case B: This is the even excitation, V1 = V2 = 1 V and the charges are

     Q1B = C11 + C12        (5.65) and                          Q2B = C21 + C22.

     Adding Equations (5.63) and (5.65) results in

     Q1A + Q1B = 2C11,      thus C11 = 21 (Q1A + Q1B) = (70 + 30)/2 pF/m = 50 pF.
                                                                                                       (5.67)

     Subtracting Equation (5.63) from Equation (5.65) yields

       Q1B - Q1A = 2C12, thus C12 = 21 (Q1B - Q1A) = 12 (30 - 70) pF/m = -20 pF/m.
                                                                                                                   (5.68)

     Because of reciprocity, C21 = C12 = -20 pF/m.
     Subtracting Equation (5.64) from Equation (5.66) results in

     Q2B  - Q2A  =  2C22 ,  thus C22  =  21 (Q2B  - Q2A)  =  1  (40  +  80)  pF/m  =  60  pF/m.
                                                             2

                                                                                          (5.69)

     Thus the per unit length capacitance matrix of the coupled line is

                    C = C11 C21 = 50 -20 pF/m.                                            (5.70)
                            C12 C22                 -20 60

     (b) Even-mode capacitance, Ce:
          The even mode has V1 = V2 and the even-mode voltage is Ve = (V1 + V2)/2.
          The even-mode charge is Qe = (Q1 + Q2)/2 = (30 + 40)/2 pC/m = 35 pC/m, so

                            Ce = Qe/Ve = 35 pF/m.                                         (5.71)
COUPLED LINES AND APPLICATIONS                                                                   217

(c) Odd-mode capacitance, Co:
     The odd-mode voltage is Vo = (V1 - V2)/2 and the odd-mode charge is Qo =
     (Q1 - Q2)/2. With V1 = +1V and V2 = -1V, V0 = 1,

Qo            =  1  [70  -  (-80)]  pC/m = 75 pC/m,  thus  Co  = Q0/V0  = 75 pF/m.  (5.72)
                 2

(d) Using a similar procedure to that in (a), but now using the free-space charge calculations,
     Q01 and Q02 results in the unit capacitance matrix:

                                    C0 =   12.5 -9.69      pF/m.                    (5.73)
                                          -9.69 15.0

(e) Ce0 = 4.07 pF/m.
(f) Co0 = 23.5 pF/m.
(g) re = Ce/Ce0 = 35/4.07 = 8.6.
(h) ro = Co/Co0 = 75/23.5 = 3.2.

                                     
(i) Phase velocity, vp = 1 LC. With no dielectric, the phase velocity is c:

                                      vp = c = 1 L0C0  L0 = 1 c2C0 ,

     and the odd-mode free-space inductance is

              Lo0 = 1 c2Co0 = 1 3  108 2 23.5  10-12 H/m = 473 nH/m.              (5.74)

The free-space even-mode inductance is                                              (5.75)
         Le0 = 1 c2Ce0 = 1 3  108 2  4.07  10-12 H/m = 2.73 킜/m.

(j) Z0 = L0/C0 ; Lo = Lo0 Z0 = 473  10-9 (75  10-12)  = 79.4 .

(k) Ze = Le/Ce  Ze = 2.73  10-6 (35  10-12)  = 279 .

 (l) vpe = 1  LeCe = (2.73  10-6  35  10-12)- 12 = 1.023  108 m/s.
(m) vpo = 1   LoCo = (473  10-9  75  10-12)- 12 = 1.68  108 m/s.

Formulas for the characteristic impedance and effective permittivity of sym-
metric coupled microstrip lines, with the cross section shown in Figure 5-9,
were developed by Hammerstad and Jensen [2] based on the concept of even
and odd modes. The formulas are accurate to better than 1% for 0.1  u  10
and g > 0.01, where u is the normalized width, and g is the normalized gap:

                         u = w/h,         g = s/h.                      (5.76)

   In the following, Z0 and e refer to the characteristic impedance and
effective permittivity of an individual microstrip line with a normalized
width of u on a substrate with a relative dielectric constant of r.

     5.6.1 Even-Mode Coupled-Line Parameters

     The even-mode characteristic impedance is

                       Z0e(u, g) = Z01e(u, g)/ ee(u, g, r),          (5.77)

     where ee is the effective relative permittivity of the even mode and Z01e is
     the even-mode characteristic impedance with the dielectric replaced by free
     space:

            Z01e(u, g) =     Z0(u) ,                                 (5.78)
                          1 - Z0(u)e(u, g)/0                         (5.79)

     where  e(u, g) =             (u)                 -m(g)

     and 0 = 376.73   377  is the characteristic impedance of a TEM wave
     in a vacuum (i.e., free space). Now Z0(u) is the free-space characteristic
     impedance of an individual microstrip line and is given by Equation (3.21).
     In Equations (5.77) and (5.78), the effective permittivity of the even mode is

                    ee(u, g, r) = r + 1 + r - 1 Fe(u, g, r),         (5.80)

     5.6.2 Odd-Mode Coupled-Line Parameters

     The odd-mode characteristic impedance is

                       Z0o(u, g) = Z01o(u, g)/ eo(u, g, r),          (5.89)

     where eo is the effective relative permittivity of the odd mode and Z01o is
     the odd-mode characteristic impedance with the dielectric replaced by free-
     space:

                          Z01o(u, g) =          Z0(u) .              (5.90)

Z0(u) is the free-space characteristic impedance of an individual microstrip
line and is given by Equation (3.21). In Equations (5.89) and (5.90), the
effective permittivity of the odd mode is

       eo(u, g, r) = r + 1 + r - 1 Fo(u, g, r),                            (5.91)

and a(u), b(r), and (g) are the same as for the even mode (see Section 5.6.1).

5.6.3 System Impedance of Coupled Lines

The system impedance of a pair of coupled lines is

       Z0S = Z0eZ0o.                                                       (5.102)

This is derived in Section 5.7.1 where it is shown that there will be no odd-
mode reflections, and even-mode reflections will be small, at the ports of
a symmetrical coupled-line pair if each line of the directional coupler is
terminated in an impedance Z0S. That is, Z0S is the impedance required
for matching. Z0 is the characteristic impedance of an individual line of the
symmetrical coupled-line pair (when there is no coupling) and is only close
to Z0S when the separation, s, of the lines is large.

5.6.4 Discussion

Normalized even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances of a pair of
coupled lines are plotted in Figure 5-10 for various normalized widths u

                         (= w/h) and as a function of normalized gap width g (= s/h). This plot
                         illustrates the utility of using even- and odd-mode descriptions. In Figure 5-
                         10, the even- and odd-mode impedances are normalized to the characteristic
                         impedance of an individual line, Z0. When the lines are far apart (i.e., g is
                         large), the even- and odd-mode impedances converge to the characteristic
                         impedance of a single line. As the lines get closer, the gap narrows, and the
                         even- and odd-mode impedances diverge in opposite directions. To obtain
                         the characteristic impedances of a coupled line the characteristic impedance
                         of a single microstrip line must be found. This was given in Section 3.5.3 and
                         the key result is repeated in Figure 5-11.

                            In the even mode, more of the field is in the dielectric than with the odd
                         mode. It is therefore not surprising that the effective permittivities of the two
                         modes differ. The normalized coupled-line effective permittivities are shown
                         in Figure 5-12. The deviation of the even- and odd-mode permittivities as
                         the gap between the lines narrows is not as large as the change in the
                         characteristic impedance. Also, there is a difference in the phase velocities
                         of the two modes along the line, and this has an appreciable effect on
                         the performance of components such as filters that use coupled lines as a
                         functional component. At the first reading of the plot (Figure 5-12) it would
                         seem that there is nonmonotonic behavior at low g. This is an artifact of
                         the normalization used, and the unnormalized permittivities are indeed
                         monotonic with respect to both u and g.

                            Figure 5-13 plots, as a function of normalized separation, g, and for
                         substrate permittivities ranging from 4 to 20, the even-mode and odd-mode
                         characteristic impedances normalized to the characteristic impedance of a
                         single strip for extremes of normalized widths (u = 0.5 and u = 5). The
                         figure highlights that the split of the even- and odd-mode characteristic
                         impedances is almost solely dependent on geometry (i.e., the separation of
                         the strips) and not the permittivity of the substrate. In the figure appropriate
                         normalization is used to highlight this fact. There are four families of curves,

  EXAMPLE 5.2 Even- and Odd-Mode Parameters

     A coupled line is constructed on an alumina substrate of thickness 500 탆 and relative
     permittivity r = 10. The lines are 500 탆 wide and the gap separation is 250 탆. What
     are the even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances and effective permittivities of the
     coupled line?

     Solution:

     The odd-mode characteristic impedance, Z0o, and even-mode characteristic impedance, Z0e,
     can be found using Figures 5-10 and 5-11. Now

     u = w/h = (500 탆)/(500 탆) = 1 and g = s/h = (250 탆)/(500 탆) = 0.5.

     From Figure 5-10,

                        Z0e/Z0 = 1.21 and Z0o/Z0 = 0.76,                    (5.103)

     where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of an individual line. From Figure 5-11, and using
     the curve for r = 10,

                        e/r = 0.671, and so e = 10  0.671 = 6.71.          (5.104)

     Also from Figure 5-11,                and so                           (5.105)
                               Z0e = 126,          Z0 = 126/ 6.71 = 48.6 .  (5.106)

     Consequently, combining Equations (5.103) and (5.105),

                        Z0o = 37  and Z0e = 59 .

     The effective odd-mode and even-mode permittivities are obtained from Figure 5-12. The
     normalized even-mode effective permittivity is ee/e = 1.086 and the normalized odd-
     mode effective permittivity is eo/e = 0.868. Since e = 6.71, the final result is

                                              ee = 7.28 and eo = 5.82.

5.6.5 Summary

This section presented formulas and graphs for determining the frequency-
independent parameters of coupled lines given their dimensions. Frequency
dependence of these electrical parameters are discussed in [3, 4]. The effect
of finite metallization thickness is also discussed in [3]. Synthesis of coupled
lines, i.e. determining their physical dimensions given their desired electrical
parameters, is undertaken in the context of their use and is generally based
on approximate, but reasonably accurate, models of a pair of coupled lines.
This will be considered in Section 5.9.

5.7 Terminated Coupled Lines

A pair of coupled lines supports even and odd modes and these can be
coupled by the terminations at the end of a line. Thus at a termination,
such as that shown in Figure 5-14(a), where the termination is general and
represented by a port-based admittance matrix Y , the reflected even and odd
modes will have contributions from both incident even and odd modes:

   -  =            +  +            +  and     -  =            +  +              +  (5.107)

Ve       LeVe            Ceo Vo            Vo       LoVo              CoeVe

where Le and Lo are even- and odd-mode reflection coefficients and Coe
and Ceo describe coupling first from the odd mode to the even mode and
then from the even mode to the odd mode. The derivation of the reflection
coefficients and coupling coefficients is left for an example at the end of this
section. The summary results are

         Le = 2 + Z0oY - Z0eY - 2Z0eZ0oYD                                          (5.108)
                  2 + Z0oY + Z0eY + 2Z0eZ0oYD                                      (5.109)
                                                                                   (5.110)
         Ceo =                        2Z0eYE                          = -Coe       (5.111)

                2 + Z0oY + Z0eY + 2Z0eZ0oYD

         Lo = 1 + Z0o(y12 + y21) - Z0eZ0oYD
                  1 + Z0oY + Z0eY + Z0eZ0oYD

where Y = (y11 + y12 + y21 + y22), Y = (y11 - y12 - y21 + y22)
         YD = (y11y22 - y12y21) and YE = (y11 - y12 + y21 - y22).

Controlling the coupling can be used in filter design based on parallel
coupled lines.

5.7.1 Reflectionless Condition

In design of many coupled line sections it is important to minimize
reflections of coupled lines. One quasi-reflectionless condition is to terminate
individual lines of the coupled line in the system reference impedance

                      Z0S = Z0eZ0o. Then y11 = 1/Z0S = y22, and y12 = 0 = y21 and
                      referring to Equation (5.111), Y = Y = 2/Z0S = 2/ Z0eZ0o, YE = 0,
                      and YD = 1/Z0eZ0o and Equation (5.108) becomes

                                                                                               
                         Le = 2 + 2Z0oZ0e - 2Z0eZ0o - 2 =                         Z0oZ0e - 2 Z0eZ0o
                                                                                                         (5.112)

                      which is small and

                                                      Lo = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0.                                (5.113)
                                                                   D

                      Also note that the mode couplings Coe and Coe are both zero. So terminating
                      the individual lines of a pair of coupled lines in Z0S results in the odd-mode
                      reflection coefficient Lo being zero and the odd-mode reflection coefficient
                      Lo being small.

                         The even and odd-mode reflection coefficients can both be set to zero by

                      simultaneously setting the numerators of Equations (5.108) and (5.108) to
                      zero while maintaining symmetry, i.e. y11 = y22, and because of reciprocity
                      y12 = y21 thus ensuring that YE = 0 and coupling is zero.

EXAMPLE 5.3 Reflection at the End of a Pair of Coupled Lines

     A pair of coupled lines with even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances Z0e and Z0o
     respectively is loaded as shown in Figure 5-14(a) where the load has the two-port y-
     parameter matrix, Y . Find the even and odd-mode reflections.

     The analysis begins by writing out the expressions relating the traveling-wave and total
     voltages and currents at the termination.

     The reflected even and odd modes have contributions from incident even and odd modes:

     Now for a sanity check. If the load is symmetrical y11 = y22 and y12 = y21, then YE = 0
     and Ceo = 0 indicating that a signal is not converted from odd mode to even mode with
     reflection from a symmetrical load, as expected.

EXAMPLE 5.4 Even and Odd Mode Loads

     A pair of coupled lines is loaded as shown in Figure 5-14(a). The even-mode characteristic
     impedance is Z0e = 90  and the odd-mode characteristic impedance is Z0o = 45 .

     (a) What is the even-mode reflection coefficient?

          To simplify calculations let the forward-traveling even-mode voltage at the load

          Ve+  =    1 V,  and  there    is no     forward-traveling odd-mode voltage.                -  and         -  are

                                                                                               -  Ve          -  Vo

          the  backward-traveling          even-  and   odd-mode     voltages   and    Ie+,  Ie   and       Io   are   the

          corresponding currents. At Port 1

Equating these and multiplying by 900: 1 - 19Ve- + 29Vo- = 0                               (5.139)

Multiplying Equation (5.139) by 7 and subtracting it from Equation (5.138)

times 29:

      (29 - 7) + (145 + 133)Ve- + (203 - 203)Vo- = 0                            -  =  -0.07914  V

                                                                             Ve

Thus Le = Ve-/Ve+ = Ve-/1 = -0.07914.                                                      (5.140)

Alternatively the general formula, Equation (5.108), can be used noting that
Z0e = 90 , Z0e = 45 , y11 = 1/60, y22 = 1/100, and y12 = 0 = y21. Then
y = 0.026667 S, y = 0.026667 S, yD = 0.00016667 S:

Le = 2 + 45  0.026667 - 90  0.026667 - 2  45  90  0.00016667 = -0.07914
        2 + 45  0.026667 + 90  0.026667 + 2  45  90  0.00016667

The two evaluations of Le are in agreement.

(b) What is the effective even-mode load resistance RLe?
     RLe is the resistance that yields Le when referred to Z0e. Thus

                RLe = Z0e 1 + Le = 90 1 + (-0.07914) = 76.80                               (5.142)
                             1 - Le            1 - (-0.07914)

(c) What is the odd-mode reflection coefficient?
    Calculating this directly using Equation (5.110):

Lo =                      1 + 0 - 45  90  0.00016667                       = 0.06180 (5.143)

      1 + 45  0.026667 + 90  0.026667 + 45  90  0.00016667

(d) What is the effective odd-mode load resistance RLo?

                RLo = Z0o 1 + Lo = 45 1 + 0.06180 = 50.92                                  (5.144)
                             1 - Lo            1 - 0.06180

5.8 Directional Coupler

Coupling can be exploited to realize a new type of element called a
directional coupler. The schematic of a directional coupler is shown in Figure
5-15(a) and a microstrip realization is shown in Figure 5-15(b). The microstrip
realization is typical of most directional couplers in that it comprises two
parallel signal lines with the electric and magnetic fields of a signal on
one line inducing currents and voltages on the other. A usable directional

     coupler has a coupled line length of at least one-quarter wavelength, with
     longer lengths of line resulting in broader bandwidth operation. Directional
     couplers are used to sample a traveling wave on one line and to induce
     a usually much smaller image of the wave on another line. That is, the
     forward- and backward-traveling waves are separated. Here a prescribed
     amount of the incident power is coupled out of the system. Thus, for
     example, a 20 dB microstrip coupler is a pair of coupled microstrip lines in
     which 1/100 of the power input is coupled from one microstrip line onto the
     another.

        Referring to Figure 5-15, a coupler is specified in terms of the following
     parameters (always check the magnitude of the factors, as some papers and
     books on couplers use the inverse of the C used here):

     It is usual to quote these quantities in decibels. For example, the coupling

     factor in decibels is C|dB = 20 log C. So 20 dB coupling indicates that the

     coupling factor is 10. An ideal quarter-wave coupler has D =  (i.e., infinite

     directivity) and                        C = Z0e + Z0o .
                                                   Z0e - Z0o
                                                                                            (5.145)

     This result comes from a detailed derivation for the case when the coupled-

     line section is one-quarter wavelength long--the length when the coupling

     is maximum. The derivation is given in Section 11.4 of [5]. In decibels the

     coupling is

                                          C|dB = 20 log Z0e + Z0o Z . 0e - Z0o              (5.146)

        Typical and ideal parameters of a directional coupler are given in Table
     5-1. Since an ideal coupler does not dissipate power, the magnitude of the
     transmission coefficient is

                                             |T | = | 1 - 1/C2|.                            (5.147)

        There are many types of directional couplers, and the phases of the
     traveling waves at the ports will not necessarily coincide. The microstrip

coupler shown in Figure 5-15(b) has maximum coupling when the lines are
one-quarter wavelength long.5 At the frequency where they are one-quarter
wavelength long, the phase difference between traveling waves entering at
Port 1 and leaving at Port 2 will then be 90.

  EXAMPLE 5.5 Directional Coupler Isolation

         A lossless directional coupler has coupling C = 20 dB, transmission factor 0.8, and directivity
         20 dB. What is the isolation? Express your answer in decibels.
         Solution:

Coupling factor: C = V1+/V3-
Transmission factor: T = V2-/V1+
Directivity factor: D = V3-/V4-
Isolation factor: I = V1+/V4-

                               D = 20 dB = 10 and C = 20 dB = 10,

so the isolation is  V1+ V3- V1+

                     I = - = -  - = D  C = 10  10 = 100 = 40 dB.

5.8.1 Design Equations for a Directional Coupler

In the previous section the coupling factor was expressed in terms of the

even- and odd-mode impedances. However, design starts with the specifica-

tion of the coupling level, and from this the required physical dimensions are

derived. A one-quarter wavelength long coupler will be considered, as this

is the optimum coupling length. From Equation (5.145), the desired coupling

factor is                C = Z0e + Z0o ,
                               Z0e - Z0o
                                                                           (5.148)

where the coupling factor is an absolute voltage-referenced quantity and
usually must be derived from the coupling factor in decibels; let this be C|dB:

                         C = 10C|dB/20.                                    (5.149)

The system impedance comes from

                            2      Z0eZ0o.                                 (5.150)

                         Z0S

Z0S is introduced here because Z0 is used for the characteristic impedance
of the individual lines of the coupler; note that Z0 is not equal to Z0S.
Z0S should match the characteristic impedance of the transmission lines
connected to the coupler. From these expressions, the even- and odd-mode

impedances required are

Z0e  Z0S   C +1      (5.151)       Z0o  Z0S               C - 1,           (5.152)
           C -1                                           C +1

and the ratio of impedances is                                             (5.153)
                                      Z0e/Z0o  C + 1 .
                                                     C-1

EXAMPLE 5.6 Directional Coupler Electrical Design

     Develop the electrical design of a 15 dB directional coupler in a 50  system.

     Solution:

     The electrical design of a directional coupler comes down to  determining the       even-
                                                                   coupling factor,      C, is
     and odd-mode characteristic impedances required. Now the

     (Z0e + Z0o) / (Z0e - Z0o) and

                                    Z0e = Z0S  C + 1.
                                               C-1

     For a 15 dB directional coupler, C = 15 dB = 5.618 and, since Z0S = 50 ,

            Z0e = 50  5.618 + 1  = 59.9  and Z0o = Z0S Z0e = 50 59.9 =41.7 .22

                      5.618 - 1

     The above are the required electrical design parameters.

                5.8.2 Directional Coupler With Lumped Capacitors

                Directional couplers using only coupled transmission lines can be large at
                low frequencies, as the minimum length is approximately one-quarter of a
                wavelength. This can be a problem at RF and low microwave frequencies,
                say, below 3 GHz. The length of the line can be reduced by incorporating
                lumped elements, as shown in Figure 5-16(a). The equivalence is established
                using ABCD parameters. Figure 5-16(b) shows a hybrid directional coupler
                using a ferrite core, forming a magnetic transformer, to provide enhanced
                coupling of the coupled lines at low frequencies with a frequency range of
                1-700 MHz. At high frequencies the ferrite core is a magnetic open circuit
                and the line coupling dominates.

                5.8.3 Physical Design of a Pair of Coupled Lines

                Equations (5.151)-(5.153) are the basic design expressions, as Z0e and Z0o
                can be related to physical dimensions. When the two strips of a microstrip
                directional coupler are close, the orientation of the field lines and hence
                the characteristic impedances of the individual lines change. That is, the
                characteristic impedance of each line on its own, Z0, will differ from the
                system impedance, Z0S. For a normalized line width of u =(w/h), this effect
                is shown in Figure 5-17. Here Z0S is the geometric mean of the even- and
                odd-mode impedances.

   Microstrip coupler design proceeds as follows. The first step is to examine
the specifications and determine the substrate permittivity, r, coupling
factor, C, and the system characteristic impedance, Z0S. From C find Z0e/Z0;
the data in Tables 5-2 and 5-3 enable some of the physical parameters to
be determined, including the normalized gap coupling parameter, g, and
the normalized strip width, u. The next step is to design the dimensions
of the individual microstrip lines connecting the directional coupler using
Table 3-3. At this stage the widths and spacings of the microstrip circuit are
normalized. Using the substrate height, these are unnormalized to obtain the
actual physical dimensions. Finally, the coupler is one-quarter wavelength
long, as this was the basis for the formula relating the even- and odd-
mode impedances to the coupling factor in Equation (5.145). The even
and odd modes have different effective permittivities and the g/4 length
should apply to both the even and odd modes. Clearly both cannot be
satisfied. It is reasonable to use the average of the even- and odd-mode
permittivities to establish the coupler length. The length is not a very
sensitive parameter anyway. The connection of the individual lines to the
coupler is not specifically part of the synthesis described, but if designed
they should have the system characteristic impedance.

   A comment on this design procedure is in order. The design procedure
above yields a narrowband directional coupler. A broadband directional
coupler, and indeed any component that is desired to have a broad
bandwidth, should be designed using filter principles. Another comment
is that the design flow is one of synthesis. An alternative procedure that is
often used is to start with an approximate design and rely on optimization
tools to obtain the desired characteristics. This works in many cases, but
does lead to novel design. Having said that, the synthesis procedure does
not yield a perfect design, as parasitic and dispersive effects are not taken
into account. Optimization from the synthesized design usually requires
only a small adjustment. In practice, the uncertainties of physical structures
(e.g., variations in the effective permittivity of actual materials) require
experimental iteration as well.

EXAMPLE 5.7 Physical Design of a 10 dB Microstrip Coupler

Design a microstrip directional coupler with the following specifications:

Transmission line technology                           Microstrip  = 10 dB
Coupling coefficient                                   C           = 50 
Microstrip characteristic impedance                    Z0          = 10.0
Substrate permittivity                                 r           = 1 mm
Substrate thickness                                    h           = 5 GHz
System center frequency (midband for the coupler)      f0

The cross-sectional dimensions that must be determined are the strip width, w, and the strip
separation, s, as shown in Figure 5-18. The procedure is to first determine the coupling factor:

C = 10(C|dB /20) = 10(10/20) = 3.162.                                         (5.154)

The ratio of the even- and odd-mode impedances required to achieve the desired coupling

is derived from Equation (5.153):

Z0e/Z0o = C + 1 = 3.162 + 1 = 1.925.                                          (5.155)
               C - 1 3.162 - 1

Solution:

The problem now is to determine the physical geometry (i.e., the line widths and spacing).
The data in Table 5-3 apply here (as r = 10), enabling the normalized gap, g = s/h,
and normalized line width, u = w/h, to be determined for a specified impedance ratio,
Z0e/Z0o. The table does not contain a line for Z0e/Z0o = 1.925 and so the table must be
interpolated (e.g. using linear or bilinear interpolation as described in Appendix 1.A.12).
The line for Z0e/Z0o = 2.15 has g = 0.2, and the line for Z0e/Z0o = 1.90 has g = 0.3. So for
Z0e/Z0o = 1.925,

        g = 0.3 - 0.2  (1.925 - 2.15) + 0.2 = 0.290,                         (5.156)
                 1.9 - 2.15                                                   (5.157)

thus s = g  h = 0.290 mm.

The value of u must also be interpolated from Table 5-3 and u = 0.805 is obtained; thus

                                   w = u  h = 0.805 mm.                      (5.158)

The coupler should be one-quarter wavelength long, so the effective relative permittivity of
the even and odd modes is required. From Table 5-3, the interpolated values are

ee = 7.124 and eo = 5.686.                                                    (5.159)

These effective permittivities are different, so determination of the optimum length of the
coupler is not straightforward. The only choice is to use the average of the permittivities:

                                   e,avg = (ee + eo)/2 = 6.405.               (5.160)
                                                                              (5.161)
                                         c             3  108                (5.162)
 Thus the average wavelength is    g =      =                      = 2.37 cm
and the length of the coupler is   f e,avg 5  109 6.405

                                   L = g/4 = 5.93 mm.

Finally, the widths of the feed lines must be determined. The system impedance is 50 
and, from Table 3-3, the width, w, is found to be 0.954 mm. The final layout of the coupler

is shown in Figure 5-19. The realization of a microstrip directional coupler as a laboratory

component is shown in Figure 5-20.

            EM analysis is often used to refine this synthesized coupler. There are two main
      uncertainties in the design. One is the uncertainty in the length of the coupler (due to the
      different even- and odd-mode effective permittivities). The other uncertainty is that the
      coupled-line equations come from low-frequency analysis--EM analysis will capture the
      frequency-dependent effects. However, only minor iteration would normally be required.

      5.8.4 The Lange Coupler

      A directional coupler comprised of two parallel microstrip lines cannot
      achieve a coupling of 3 dB, which corresponds to splitting the power of a
      traveling wave into two equal components. Lange [8] introduced a coupler,
      now known as the Lange coupler, in 1969. The Lange coupler (see Figure
      5-21) has a coupling factor of around 3 dB. In this design, true quadrature
      coupling over an octave bandwidth is realized as a consequence of the
      interdigital coupling section, which also compensates for the differences of
      the even- and odd-mode phase velocities over the wide frequency range.
      Note the use of the center bond wires--this was the key invention. The
      bonding wires should look, electrically, as close as possible to a short-

circuit. This means that their lengths, ls, must be kept as short as possible:
ls  gm/4, where gm is the midband wavelength. In semiconductor
technologies, these bond wires are replaced by air bridges, and in structures
with two or more metal layers the wirebonds are replaced by vias to another
metal layer and a short connection on the second metal layer. In some
designs, six coupling fingers are used instead of the four shown in Figure 5-
21. Note that the input-to-direct-output link meanders through the structure
and this DC connection identifies the through connection.

   The physical length of the coupler is approximately one-quarter
wavelength long at the center frequency of the coupling band. As with
many distributed components, this element was invented using intuition
and empirical iterations. Since then, analytic design formulas have been
developed to enable synthesis of the electrical parameters of the coupler (see
[5]). The synthesis is based on even- and odd-mode impedances analogous to
those developed in Section 5.8 for a coupler comprised of coupled microstrip
lines. Synthesis leads to a design that is close to ideal, and subsequent
modeling in an EM simulator can be used to obtain an optimized design
accounting for frequency-dependent and parasitic effects.

5.9 Models of Parallel Coupled Lines

5.9.1 Chain Matrix Model of Coupled Lines

The chain matrix of a pair of coupled lines is the multiport version of the
two-port ABCD parameters and relates the input currents and voltages at
one end of a pair of coupled lines to the voltages and currents at the other
end. The chain matrix is derived here following the development in [9]. The
terminal characteristics of the coupled lines shown in Figure 5-22 can be
expressed in terms of the even and odd modes. For the even mode

1  (V1  +  V2)  =  cos e X0e sin e   1  (V3  +  V4)  (5.163)

     where Y0e = 1/Z0e is the even-mode characteristic admittance and Y0o =
     1/Z0o is the characteristic admittance of the odd mode. Also, e is the
     electrical length of the lines for the even mode, and o is the odd-mode
     electrical length of the lines. Grouping Equations (5.163) and (5.164),

     where  a11  =   a22  =  d11  =  d22  =  1  (c  o  s    e  + cos o)                 (5.168)

            c12 = c21 =  12 (Y0e sin e - Y0o sin o).

     Similarly the admittance equation for a pair of coupled lines is derived as

     where  y11 = y22 = y33 = y44 = - 21 (Y0e cot e + Y0o cot o)                        (5.175)

            y14 = y41 = y23 = y32 =  12 (Y0e csc e - Y0o csc o).

     5.9.2 ABCD Parameters of Coupled-Line Sections

     The chain matrix of a pair of coupled lines, Equation (5.165), can be used
     to develop the ABCD parameters of two-port coupled line networks [9].
     Several networks that are commonly used in realizing filters and other
     microwave circuits are shown in Table 5-4 with

                                  I1 = C D -I2 .                                        (5.177)

     One approach to developing the physical layout of microwave circuits from
     the electrical design equates the ABCD parameters of the coupled-line
     networks to the ABCD of the synthesized lumped-element circuit.

     where Z0e and Z0o are the modal impedances, and e and o are the even-
     and odd-mode electrical lengths.

        Developing the ABCD parameters of the capacitively loaded one-quarter
     wavelength long line in Figure 5-23(a) and equating them with the ABCD
     parameters in Equation (5.184) leads to an equivalence between the loaded
     line (Figure 5-23(b)) and the coupled line shown in Figure 5-23(c), where

             Z0e = (1/C + 2Z0) and Z0o = Z0.                          (5.185)

     5.9.4 Model Using Even- and Odd-Mode Lines

     The pair of coupled lines in Figure 5-22 can be modeled using even-
     and odd- mode transmission lines as shown in Figure 5-24(a). While the
     partitioning of the terminal voltages and currents of the coupled lines into
     even- and odd-mode components is simple to describe mathematically (e.g.,
     the odd-mode voltage Vo = 12 (V1 - V2)), there is not a simple way to
     represent the partitioning in circuit form. Instead, in a circuit simulator
     the coupling network in Figure 5-24(a) is modeled using voltage-controlled
     current sources [14]. A circuit model that is more convenient to use in
     the analysis of a coupled line networks is shown in Figure 5-24(b). The
     equivalence of this network to a coupled line is demonstrated by showing
     that the chain matrix parameters of the circuit in Figure 5-24(b) are the same
     as those in Equations (5.165)-(5.171), see Example 5.8.

        Coupled lines are an important element in many microwave circuits,
     including filters, matching networks, and biasing networks. Very often the
     circuit development leads to a particular topology that can be implemented
     using coupled-line networks. For example, the structure at the top in Figure
     5-25(a) is known as an open-circuited interdigital section. The equivalent

EXAMPLE 5.8 Chain Matrix Parameters of Coupled Lines

     Develop the chain matrix of the coupled-line model shown in Figure 5-24(b) and show that
     these are the chain matrix parameters of a coupled line.

     Solution:

     The coupled-line model is annotated with voltages and currents in Figure 5-26. Using Table
     2-1 of [15], the even- and odd-mode lines have the following ABCD parameters:

                                      VW                   cos e       2Ze sin e    
                                                                                             VY

                                         IW              2 Ye sin e        cos e             IY                      (5.187)

                                                                       2Zo sin o    
                                          VX               cos o                             VZ
                            and                    =1                                        IZ .

     While the ABCD parameters of the transformers could be used, it is more convenient to
     write down the terminal characteristics of the transformers directly. First, the transformers
     on the right-hand side are described by

                                 VY = 12 (V3 + V4) ,         IY = 21 2 [(-I3) + (-I4)]                               (5.188)
                                 VZ = 12 (V3 - V4) ,                    1
                                                             IZ   =    22  [(-I3) - (-I4)] .

     Combining Equations (5.186)-(5.188) yields

       VW             2 cos e                                                              2Z0e sin e                      
                                                   2 cos e           2Z0e sin e         - 2Z0o sin o                  V3

                                                21 2 Y0e sin e                               1                       -I4

                       22                                              21 2 cos o            22                       (5.189)
       IX  21 2 Y0o sin o                                                               - 21 2 cos o

     The development is completed by using the voltage and current relations determined by the

     transformers on the left-hand side:

                                   V1 = 21 2 (VW + VX ) ,                                                            (5.190)
                                   V2 = 21 2 (VW - VX ) ,         I1 = 2 (IW + IX )
                                                                  I2 = 2 (IW - IX ) .

     Combining Equations (5.189) and (5.190):

     which is identical to the chain matrix of the coupled transmission line, Equation (5.165).
     Thus Figure 5-24(b) is an accurate circuit model of a pair of coupled transmission lines.

                       5.9.5 Alternative Coupled-Line Model

                       The previous section developed a model of a pair of coupled lines and it
                       was shown how the model related to various coupled-line sections. While
                       ABCD parameters can be used to equate two different implementations, it is
                       useful to have a topology that can be visualized and used to guide synthesis.

                                                     and (b) its approximate

The accurate form of the coupled-line model developed in the previous
section does not often occur in network synthesis. (In synthesis, such as
when designing a filter using coupled lines, a mathematical description can
sometimes be converted into circuit form which includes transmission lines
that are coupled.) An alternative but approximate model that has the same
topology as many synthesized networks is shown in Figure 5-27(b).

   A physical pair of coupled lines is shown in Figure 5-27(a) with even-
mode characteristic impedance, Z0e, and odd-mode impedance, Z0o, with
the coupling coefficient6

                     K = Z0e - Z0o .                 (5.192)
                            Z0e + Z0o

The corresponding approximate equivalent network model of the coupled

line in Figure 5-27(a) was developed by Malherbe [16] and is shown in

Figure 5-27(b) with

Z01 =  Z0S                                   1 - K2
           1 - K2
                     (5.193)    Z02 = Z0S    K  2    (5.194)

n = 1 = Z0e + Z0o    (5.195)    Z0S = Z0eZ0o.        (5.196)
      K Z0e - Z0o

The electrical length of the Z01 and Z02 lines is the electrical length of the
coupled line. The reason this model is approximate is it assumes that the
coupled lines are symmetrical (e.g., equal width for the microstrip lines) and
uses a low-frequency capacitor-based development. Also a pair of coupled
lines has two electrical lengths, the electrical length of the even mode and

6 This is the inverse of the coupling factor, C used previously, see Equation (5.145). However
  using C introduces confusion since ABCD parameters are often used in synthesis of coupled
  line networks. Note that here K = 1/(coupling factor), that is, K = 1/C.
242  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     the electrical length of the odd mode. So the best that can be done is to take
     the electrical lengths of the Z01 and Z02 lines as the average electrical lengths
     of the even and odd modes. Never-the-less this model is commonly used
     in developing the initial design of coupled-line networks that must then be
     followed by adjustment in a microwave circuit simulator.

     5.9.6 Approximate Synthesis from the Coupled-Line Model

     The electrical design of networks of coupled lines commonly leads to the
     parameters of the coupled-line model shown in Figure 5-27(b). From these
     the physical layout can be derived. That is, given n = 1/K, Z01, and Z02, the
     coupled-line parameters Z0S, Z0e, and Z0o are found. Equations (5.193) and
     (5.194) lead to two equations for Z0S:

              Z0S,(5.197) = Z01 1 - K2                                         (5.197)
                                                                               (5.198)
              Z0S,(5.198) = Z02          K2                      .

                                         1-K                  2

     These could be different and this is a result of the model being approximate.
     If so, then the proper course forward is to use the geometric mean:

              Z0S = Z0S,(5.197)Z0S,(5.198).                                    (5.199)

     Rearranging Equation (5.195),

     1 + n = 1 + Z0e + Z0o = Z0e - Z0o + Z0e + Z0o = 2Z0e
     Z0e - Z0o                           Z0e - Z0o                  Z0e - Z0o

     1 - 2 = n - 1 = 1 - Z0e - Z0o = Z0o - Z0e + Z0e = Z0o .                   (5.200)
     n+1 n+1                        Z0e                       Z0e   Z0e

     That is,                                                                  (5.201)
                                               Z0e = n + 1 .
                                               Z0o n - 1

     Combining this with Equation (5.196),

     Z0o = Z0S                      n-1                  Z2                    (5.202)
                                    n+1  and Z0e = 0S Z . 0o

     These equations can be used in physical synthesis. For example, if Z0S is
     close to 50  and the substrate is alumina, then the ratio Z0e/Z0o can be
     used to find the physical dimensions from Table 5-3. Otherwise the formulas
     described in Section 5.6 can be used iteratively.

        The physical length of the coupled line is determined by using the
     geometric mean of the even- and odd-mode effective permittivities to

5.10 Differential and Common Modes

In working with RFICs it is convenient to use differential and common mode
definitions, rather than odd and even mode definitions, as these directly
relate to the differential circuits most commonly used in CMOS design.
There are several reasons for this and one is that the most common type
of amplifier with CMOS circuits is a differential amplifier where there are
two input signal lines and two output signal lines and the actual signal is
the differential signal which, in terms of voltage, is the difference of the two
voltages on the lines. The situation is as shown in Figure 5-28(a) where there
are two signal conductors and a ground plane (at 0 V). Here the differential
voltage is Vd = (V1 -V2). The common mode voltage is Vc = 21 (V1 +V2) which
will normally consist of a DC voltage and a usually small, and ideally zero,
common mode signal which is the non-DC part of Vc. Most CMOS circuits
are designed so that the DC component of Vd = 0. It is a quirk of history
that microwave engineering and thus EM analysis used even- and odd-mode
signals whose definitions differ by a factor of two from the definitions of
common- and differential-mode signals. This section relates the two groups
of signals and parameters for the common/differential mode group and the
even/odd mode group.

   The differential- and common-mode parameters of coupled lines can be
derived from the odd- and even-mode parameters. The difference is in the
definition of the voltage and currents in the modes as shown in Figure 5-28.
The even mode is defined with V1 = V2 = Ve and I1 = I2 = Ie, while for
the common mode V1 = V2 = Vc and I1 + I2 = Ic. Thus, in terms of the
even-mode characteristic impedance, Z0e, the common-mode characteristic
impedance is

                         Z0c = 21 Z0e.  (5.203)

The odd mode is defined with V1 = -V2 = Vo and I1 = -I2 = Io, while for
the differential mode V1 - V2 = Vd and I1 = -I2 = Id. Thus, in terms of the
odd-mode characteristic impedance, Z0o, the differential-mode characteristic
impedance is

                         Z0d = 2Z0o.    (5.204)

                      Other parameters remain unchanged. That is, the propagation constant,
                      phase and group velocities, and wavelengths are the same for common and
                      even modes, as they are for the differential and odd modes.

                         The driving and termination configurations for differential and common
                      mode signals are shown in Figure 5-29. The reflectionless (i.e. matched)
                      termination of coupled lines used in common mode is

                      as in Figure 5-29(a). The reflectionless termination of a differential line is

                                                        RL = Z0d = 2Z0o,                                (5.206)

                      as shown in Figure 5-29(b).

                 5.11 Common Impedance Coupling

                 So far coupling has been discussed in terms of the EM fields shared
                 by two transmission lines. This is not the only way coupling of signals
                 occurs. Sharing of a return path results in coupling, often called common
                 impedance coupling, as there is a circuit element common to two or more
                 transmission lines. The simplest situation is a shared impedance rather than
                 a shared transmission line return, so that the return current attributed to
                 one interconnect induces a voltage across the common impedance element.
                 This signal then appears as though it is on the victim line. The common
                 impedance could be the inductance or resistance of the ground conductor
                 in the case of microstrip lines. In general, however, common impedance
                 coupling will occur whenever the current return path is common.

                 5.12 Summary

                 Coupling from one transmission line to a nearby neighbor may often be
                 undesirable. However, the coupling can be controlled and coupled lines
                 have become an important circuit component in distributed microwave
                 circuits. One example is a directional coupler, which is little more than
                 a pair of coupled lines, and this device forms the special function of
                 separating forward- and backward-traveling waves. Another example of the
                 application of coupled lines is their use in microwave filters. Bandpass filters
                 are essentially coupled resonators. In a filter that uses coupled lines, each
                 individual line becomes a resonator and the coupling of the resonators is
                 controlled by how far they are spaced.

                    The analysis and circuit model of a pair of coupled lines is based on
                 describing the voltages and currents on the lines as the linear combination of
                 an even mode and an odd mode. Each of these modes will have forward- and
                 backward-traveling wave components. Separating the signals on a coupled-
                 line pair into even and odd modes facilitates extraction of the coupled-line
                 parameters from simulation and measurement. It also enables a model of the
                 coupled line to be developed that consists of individual lines that are coupled
                 by transformers.

                    With the differential circuits used with RFICs it is more convenient to
                 consider the signals on a pair of coupled lines as comprising common and
                 differential modes. These can be directly related to even and odd modes
                 and the difference comes down to definitions of average voltage (i.e., the
                 common- and even-mode voltages) and the definition of the difference

voltage (i.e., the differential- and odd-mode voltages). There is a similar
difference for the currents.

   The suite of microwave elements that exploit distributed effects available
to a microwave designer is surprisingly large. Coupled lines comprise a large
proportion of these elements. This chapter concludes with an example of the
broadband response of a pair of coupled microstrip lines.

  EXAMPLE 5.10 Shorted Coupled Lines

                   Design Environment Project File: RFDesign Coupled Shorted Microstrip Lines.emp

         In this example a pair of shorted coupled microstrip lines are examined using EM analysis.
        The layout of the coupled lines is shown in Figure 5-30. The box used in simulation has
         electric side and top walls. The bottom of the box (below the strips) is an electric wall and
         forms the ground plane. The ground plane is specified as gold and the finite conductivity
         of gold is used for the strips and the ground plane. The coupled lines here are arranged
         as a two-port structure. Scattering (S) parameters are used to describe the characteristics of
         microwave structures. The transmission coefficient is S21, and for a matched structure S11
         is the reflection coefficient. The coupled-line structure is symmetrical, as the widths of the
         strips are the same so that S11 = S22 and S12 = S21. Each microstrip line on its own was
         designed to have a characteristic impedance of 50 .

        The calculated two-port S parameters are plotted in Figure 5-31. The loss of 0 dB corresponds
         to an S parameter absolute value of 1. Large S21 responses are centered at 1.5 GHz, 7.5 GHz,
         and 13 GHz and are shaped as bandpass filter responses. This suggests that coupled-line
         sections could be used as the basis of microwave bandpass filters. The passband frequencies
         are related to the lengths of the lines. The effective dielectric constant for one of the microstrip
        lines is 6.5 (from Table 3-2) and so at 1.5 GHz the 1 cm line length is /8 long, at 7.5 GHz it
         is 5/8 long, and at 13 GHz it is 9/8 long. The round-trip lengths are /4, 5/4, and 9/4
         long at the respective frequencies. Thus the round-trip lengths are separated by  and so
         the addition of half-wavelength sections of lossless line has no impact on the reflection and
         transmitted response amplitudes.

6.1 Introduction

Rectangular waveguides are used to route millimeter-wave signals and high
power microwave signals. The rectangular waveguide, often called just
waveguide, shown in Figure 6-1 has metal walls forming a rectangular pipe.
Charges and currents induced in the conductive walls guide propagating
EM fields in the +z and -z directions. The rectangular waveguide has very
little loss compared to a coaxial line because the EM field is away from the
walls and there is little current in the walls, and what is there is spread out
resulting in low current density. All of the waveguide loss, as with the loss
of most transmission systems, is resistive loss so minimizing current density
minimizes loss.

   This chapter begins with Section 6.2 where symmetries and restricting

     propagation to only the 콄 direction are applied to Maxwell's equations
     to yield the rectangular wave equation. These are then used in Section
     6.3 to describe propagation between two metal planes forming what is
     called a parallel-plate waveguide, see Figure 6-2. Then the rectangular wave
     equations are applied to a rectangular waveguide in Section 6.4 to derive the
     field distribution inside a rectangular waveguide.

     6.2 The Rectangular Wave Equation

     Maxwell's equations will be put in a form that can be used in establishing

     the field descriptions in parallel-plate and rectangular waveguides. The EM

     fields in these structures vary sinusoidally with respect to both position and

     time so the first simplification of Maxwell's equations is to use phasors.

     Boundary conditions are established by the metal walls, and these walls

     match the Cartesian coordinate system. So Maxwell's equations are put in

     Cartesian coordinate form. Simplifications of the fields can be made that

     relate to the positions of the metal walls. Another simplification is made by

     assuming that there can only be propagation in the 콄 direction. When the

     wave propagates in the +z direction it is called the forward-traveling wave,

     and when it propagates in the -z direction it is called the reverse-traveling

     wave.

     The development begins with Maxwell's equations (Equations (1.1)-(1.4))

     in a source-free region ( = 0 and J = 0). A simplification comes from as-

     suming a linear, isotropic, and homogeneous medium so that  and  are

     independent of signal level and are independent of the field direction and of

     position, thus

      E = - B = - H (6.1)                      H = D =  E (6.3)
                                  t  t                         t t
      D = 0 =   E                                        B = 0 =   H.
                                        (6.2)                                  (6.4)

     Taking the curl of Equation (6.1) leads to

                                              H           ( H)
                                      E = -  = -               .          (6.5)
                                               t            t

     Applying the identity     A = (  A) - 2A to the left-hand side
     of Equation (6.5), and replacing  H with the right-hand side of Equation
     (6.3), the equation above becomes

                     -2E + (  E) = -   E = - 2  . (6.6) 2E

     Using Equation (6.2) this reduces to

                                        2E =  2  , 2(E)                     (6.7)

   Invoking the phasor form, /t is replaced by , and with propagation
only in the 콄 direction there is an assumed e(t-z) dependence of the
fields. Development is now simplified by introducing the phasor E defined

so that

                                 E = E칎-z.                            (6.14)

Now Equation (6.7) further reduces to

      2E =      2 2E      = 2t E + 2E = ()2킙 = -k2E,             (6.15)
               t E + 2

                         z

where k =  is the wavenumber (with SI units of m-1). Rearranging

Equation (6.15) yields

                            2t E = -(2 + k2)E.                        (6.16)

A similar expression can be derived for the magnetic field:             (6.17)
                                    2t H = -(2 + k2)H .

Equations (6.16) and (6.17) are called wave equations, or Helmholtz equa-
tions, for phasor fields propagating in the z direction. Equations (6.16) and
(6.17) are usually written as

          2t E = -kc2E         (6.18)               2t H = -kc2H ,  (6.19)

where the cutoff wavenumber is

                                 2  =  2  +  k2.                        (6.20)

256           STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

        Equations (6.18) and (6.19) describe the transverse fields (the fields in
     the x-y plane) between the conducting plates of the parallel-plate as
     well as within the walls of the rectangular waveguide having a e(t-z)

     dependence. The general form of the solution of these equations is a
     sinusoidal wave moving in the z direction. For propagating waves in a
     lossless medium,  = , where  is the phase constant:

                                                                                                 (6.21)
                                             =  k2 - kc2.

     If  is not real, which occurs when |kc| < |k|, then an EM wave cannot
     propagate and such modes are called evanescent modes. These are like
     fringing fields. If they are generated, say at a discontinuity, they will store
     reactive energy locally.

        Boundary conditions, resulting from the charges and current on the plates,
     further constrain the solutions. Equation (6.1) with Equation (1.125) becomes

                                                  E = 킜 .                                    (6.22)

     In rectangular coordinates, E = Exx^ +Eyy^ +Ez^z and H = Hxx^ +Hyy^ +Hz^z,
     and Equation (6.22) becomes

                Ez + Ey = -킜x,                        Ez

        The solution for kc = 0 is arrived at separately. Since kc = 0 there is no
     loss. Also propagation at DC is a solution and the phasor fields at  = 0 will
     also be the field descriptions at any frequency. At  = 0,  =  = 0 and

The only solutions to these with /x = 0 that also satisfies boundary
conditions are that Ez = 0 = Hz = Ex = Hy, and Hy and Ex are constants.

   Now that the fields are in the appropriate forms, classification of possible
solutions (i.e. modes) can be developed for the parallel-plate and rectangular
waveguides. At this stage the following simplifications have been made to
Maxwell's equations to get them into the form of Equation (6.25)):

6.3 Parallel-Plate Waveguide

This section derives the propagating EM fields for the parallel-plate
waveguide shown in Figure 6-3. The parallel-plate waveguide shown in
Figure 6-3(a) has conducting planes at the top and bottom that (as an
approximation) extend infinitely in the x direction. Electromagnetic fields
introduced between the plates, say by a sinusoidally varying voltage
generator across the plates, will be guided by the charges and currents
induced in the conductors.

   The parallel-plate waveguide structure occurs in many planar circuits,
such as between the ground and power planes of circuit boards.
Understanding the EM propagation supported by parallel-plate waveguides
enables design choices to be made that suppress unwanted propagation
modes.

6.3.1 TEM Mode

In the transverse EM (TEM) mode, all of the E and H field components are
in the plane transverse to the direction of propagation, that is, Ez = 0 = Hz.
Thus Equation (6.26) requires that Ex, Ey, Hx, and Hy cannot vary with
position in the transverse plane (i.e., with respect to x and y). Thus Ex, Ey,
Hx, and Hy must be constant between the plates. Furthermore, boundary
conditions require that Hy = 0 and Ex = 0 at the conductors. So in the TEM
parallel-plate mode, only Ey and Hx exist, and they are constant. Equation

     where the plus sign describes forward-traveling fields (propagating in
     the +z direction) and the minus sign describes backward-traveling fields

     (propagating in the -z direction). The quantity  = / is called the wave
     impedance, it is the intrinsic impedance of the medium between the parallel
     plates. This field variation is shown on the left in Figure 6-4(a). The TEM
     mode exists down to DC.

        To determine the characteristic impedance of the parallel-plate waveguide
     first calculate the voltage of the top plate with respect to the bottom plate.
     This voltage is the integral of the electric field between the plates:

                              d

                        V =-       Ey e-zdy = Eyde-z        (6.28)

                              y=0

     since Ey is a constant. The current on the top plate in the z direction
     is obtained by integrating the surface current density in the x direction.
     Assuming that the plates have a width W in the x direction then the current
     on the top plate is

                              W

                        I =-       Js  z^ dx = HxW e-z     (6.29)

                              x=0

     since Ey is a constant. In terms of voltage and current (and hence treating the
     parallel-plate waveguide as a transmission line) the characteristic impedance
     of the TEM mode is

                        Z0 = V = Eyd = d .                  (6.30)
                                I HxW W

     Here  is the intrinsic impedance of a TEM mode in the medium. Since we
     are considering a TEM mode, the wave impedance of the TEM mode is just

the intrinsic impedance, that is,                                   (6.31)

The phase velocity (= /) is just the speed of light in the medium:

6.3.2 TM Mode

The Transverse Magnetic Mode (TM) is characterized by Hz = 0. Another
restriction that will be used here in developing the field equations is that
there is no variation of the fields in the x direction. Examining Equation
(6.25) the only components of the field that could exist are Ey, Ez, and Hx.
Everywhere Ey is perpendicular, and Hy is parallel, to the electrical walls so
boundary conditions are satisfied for Ey and Hx. Ez will be parallel to the
electrical walls at the walls so boundary conditions need to be applied in
deriving Ez.

   The boundary conditions are that the E field parallel to the conducting
walls is zero. Considering Ez only, Equation (6.18) becomes

                    d2Ez            = -kc Ez.2                      (6.36)

                    dy2

The solution to Equation (6.36) is

            Ez = [E0 sin (kcy) + E1 cos (kcy)] e-z.                 (6.37)

   To find the coefficients E0 and E1 boundary conditions are applied so that
Ez is zero at y = 0 and y = d (since the E field parallel to the conductors
must be zero), that is,

Ez|y=0 = 0 = E1 and Ez|y=d = 0 = E0 sin (kcd).                      (6.38)

This requires that sin (kcd) = 0, and thus requiring that there are discrete
values of kc:

               kc = m/d m = 1, 2, 3, . . . .                        (6.39)
260  STEER MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES

     (Note that m = 0 is also a solution but requires a separate derivation, see
     the summary for this section.) Each value of kc identifies a different mode
     and m is the mode index. The mth mode is the TMm mode and m indicates
     the number of half-sinusoidal variations of the fields in the y direction. The
     TMm mode propagates if the wavelength of the signal is such that   c,
     where c is the critical wavelength of the mth mode.

        Substituting the above results and assumptions (e.g., /x = 0) in

     Equation (6.25),

     Hz = 0 Ex = 0 Hy = 0                               (6.40)

              kc dy kc

     These are the complete field descriptions of the TM parallel-plate waveguide
     modes with zero variation in the x direction. Recall that the wavenumber

            
     k =  .

        There are an infinite number of TM modes identified by the index m,
     which determines the cutoff wavenumber, kc, of the particular mode. The
     propagation constant of the mth mode, i.e. the TMm mode, is

      = kc2 - k2 = (m/d)2 - 2.                         (6.44)

     Propagation is only possible if  has an imaginary component. Thus in a

     lossless medium  =  and  = k2 - kc2. The cutoff frequency below
     which propagation is not possible is

     where  = 1/ is the velocity of a TEM mode in the medium. The cutoff

     wavelength can also be defined as

                                c =  = 2d .             (6.46)
                                       fc m

     where  is the speed of light in the medium. The wavelength of the TMm
     mode, at a particular frequency, is the guide wavelength

                                g = 2 =        ,        (6.47)

     where  is the wavelength of a TEM mode in the medium:  = /f (so
     g =  when kc = 0). The phase velocity of the modes is dependent on the
     mode index m through the cutoff frequency:

                                vp =  =        ,        (6.48)
                                          1 - (fc/f )2

     and the group velocity is

     vg = d =  1 - (fc/f )2.                            (6.49)

The phase velocity, vp, of a TM mode is greater than  while the group
velocity, vg, is slower than . The group velocity is the velocity at which
energy is transmitted and thus can never be faster than the speed of light,

The transverse electric (TE) mode is characterized by Ez = 0. Following
the same development as for the TM modes, the TEn mode fields with n
variations of the Hz are

               Ez = 0, Ey = 0, Hx = 0                 (6.53)
                                                      (6.54)
               Hz = H0 cos (kcy)e-z                   (6.55)
               Ex =  H0 sin (kcy)e-z
                                                      (6.56)
                        kc
               Hy =  H0 sin (kcy)e-z.

                       kc

The equations for kc, vp, vg, fc, c, and g of the TEn mode are the same as
for the TMm mode considered in the previous section with the replacement
of the mode index m by n, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . (Note that n = 0 is also a solution
but requires a separate derivation, see the summary for this section.) The TE
mode field variation is shown on the right in Figure 6-4.

   The wave impedance of the TE mode is

                            ZTE = k .                 (6.57)

     6.3.4 Summary

     The TEM mode (where kc = 0) is the same as the TM0 mode and the TE0
     mode. Here derivations of the TE and TM modes began with from Equation
     (6.25) and were only solutions for kc = 0. Development of the 0th order TE
     and TM modes requires derivation from Equation(6.26) but this was done
     for the TEM mode and so was not repeated for the TE0 and TM0 modes.

     6.4 Rectangular Waveguide

     A rectangular waveguide is shown in Figure 6-5(a). Rectangular waveguides
     guide EM energy between four connected electrical walls, and there is little
     current created on the walls. As a result, resistive losses are quite low, much
     lower than can be achieved using coaxial lines for example. One of the major
     uses of a rectangular waveguide is when losses must be kept to a minimum,
     so that a rectangular waveguide is used in very high-power situations such
     as radar, and at a few tens of gigahertz and above. At higher frequencies the
     loss of coaxial lines becomes very large, and it also becomes difficult to build
     small-diameter coaxial lines at 100 GHz and above. As a result, a rectangular
     waveguide is nearly always used above 100 GHz. There are many low- to
     medium-power legacy systems that use rectangular waveguides down to
     1 GHz.

        A rectangular waveguide supports many different modes, but it does not
     support the TEM mode. The modes are categorized as being either TM or TE,
     denoting whether all of the magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction
     of propagation (these are the transverse magnetic fields) or whether all of
     the electric fields are perpendicular to the direction of propagation (these are
     the transverse electric fields). Dimensions of the waveguide can be chosen so
     that only one mode can propagate for a range of frequencies. With more than
     one mode propagating, the different components of a signal would travel at
     different speeds and thus combine at a load incoherently, since the ratio of
     the energy in the modes would vary (usually) randomly.

        The TE and TM field descriptions are derived from the solution of dif-
     ferential equations--Maxwell's equations--subject to boundary conditions.
     The general solutions for rectangular systems are sinewaves and there are
     possibly many discrete solutions. The nomenclature that has developed over

the years to classify modes references the number of variations in the x di-
rection, using the index m, and the number of variations in the y direction,
using the index n. So there are TEmn and TMmn modes, and dimensions are
usually selected so that only the TE10 mode can propagate.

6.4.1 TM Modes

The development of the field descriptions for the TM modes begins with
the rectangular wave equations derived in Section 6.2. Transverse magnetic
waves have zero Hz, but nonzero Ez. The differential equation governing Ez
is, in rectangular coordinates (from Equations (6.13) and (6.16)),

                       2      2Ez 2Ez       2
                       t Ez = 2 + 2 = -kc Ez.                       (6.60)
                              x     y

Using a separation of variables procedure, this equation has the solution

Ez = [A sin(kxx) + B cos(kxx)] [C sin(kyy) + D cos(kyy)] e-z, (6.61)

where    2  +    2  =  kc2.                                         (6.62)

       kx      ky

The perfectly conducting boundary at x = 0 requires B = 0 to produce
Ez = 0 there. Similarly the ideal boundary at y = 0 requires D = 0.
Replacing AC by a new constant A, then

                       Ez = A sin(kxx) sin(kyy)e-z.                 (6.63)

The axial electric field, Ez, must also be zero at x = a and y = b. This can
only be so (except for the trivial solution A = 0) if kxa is an integral multiple
of  so that sin(kxa) = 0:

                       kxa = m, m = 1, 2, 3, . . . .                (6.64)

Similarly, for Ez to be zero at y = b, sin(kyb) = 0 and kyb must also be a
multiple of :

                             kyb = n, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .          (6.65)

So the cutoff frequency of the TM wave with m variations in x and with n
variations in y (i.e., the TMmn mode) is, from Equation (6.62),

                       kcm,n     1     m 2                   2 1/2

                       2  2 

   The remaining field components of the TMmn wave are found with Hz = 0
and Ez from Equation (6.63) and Equation (6.25)):

                    Ex = - 2kx A cos(kxx) sin(kyy)e-z               (6.67)
                              kcm,n                                 (6.68)

                    Hy = - 2 kx A cos(kxx) sin(kyy)e-z.

Figure 6-6: Electric and magnetic
field distribution for the lowest-
order TM mode, the TM11 mode.

     The spatial field variations depend on the x and y cutoff wavenumbers, kx
     and ky, which in turn depend on the mode indexes and the cross-sectional
     dimensions of the waveguide. The cutoff wavenumber, kc, is a function of
     the m and n indexes, and so kcm,n is often used for the cutoff wavenumber
     with

                                    2kcm,n = kx,m + ky,n =22    m 2 +         n 2 .                  (6.71)

        The lowest-order TM mode is the TM11 mode, with m = 1 and n = 1,
     and this has the minimum variation of the fields (of any TM mode); these are
     shown in Figure 6-6.

        In summary, a mode can propagate only at frequencies above the cutoff
     frequency. Another quantity that defines when cutoff occurs is the cutoff
     wavelength, defined as

                                                       c =  ,                                        (6.72)

     where  = 1/ is the velocity of a TEM mode in the medium (and of

     course this is not a rectangular waveguide mode). The cutoff wavelength

     is the wavelength in the medium (without the waveguide walls) at which

     cutoff  occurs.  Since            k2   is  k2  -  2,  the  attenuation  constant  of  a  given  mode

                                         c

     for frequencies below the cutoff frequency is

     The phase constant for frequencies above the cutoff frequency is

             =                      k - kcm,n = k 1 -22         fcm,n 2  ,    f > fcm,n .            (6.74)

        For a propagating mode (i.e., f > fcm,n) the wavelength of the mode,
     called the guide wavelength, is

                                                g = 2 =              ,                               (6.75)

Solving using the separation of variables technique gives

Hz = [A sin(kxx) + B cos(kxx)] [C sin(kyy) + D cos(kyy)] e-z, (6.79)

                    Hz = B cos(kxx) cos(kyy)               (6.83)
                                                           (6.84)

                                 kc

Ey is zero at x = a, that is, sin(kxa) = 0, so that kxa must be a multiple of :

                       kxa = m, m = 1, 2, 3, . . . .       (6.86)

Also, Ex is zero at y = b, that is, sin(kyb) = 0, so that kyb must be zero (so
that Ex is always zero) or that it is a multiple of . Therefore

     of the m and n indexes:

        The lowest-order TE mode is the TE10 mode (with m = 1 and n = 0) and
     this has the minimum variation of the fields; these are shown in Figure 6-7.

     6.4.3 Practical Rectangular Waveguide

     The dimensions and operating frequencies of a rectangular waveguide are
     chosen to support only one propagating mode. The operating frequency is
     between the cutoff frequency of the mode with the lowest cutoff frequency
     and the cutoff frequency of the mode with the next lowest cutoff frequency.
     Thus only one mode propagates.

        Referring to Figure 6-5, if the dimensions are chosen so that b is greater
     than a, then the lowest-order TE mode (the TE10 mode) has one variation
     of the fields in the x direction, while the lowest-order TM mode (the TM11
     mode) has one variation of the field in the x direction and one variation in
     the y direction. Thus the cutoff frequency of the TM11 mode will be higher
     than the cutoff frequency of the TE10 mode. Below the cutoff frequency the
     modes will not propagate (i.e.,  (the imaginary part of the propagation
     constant) is zero). The propagation constants of the rectangular waveguide

   Not all possible low-order modes can be supported in rectangular

The cutoff frequency of the TE10 mode is 21.07 GHz and the next lowest
cutoff mode, the TE01 mode, has a cutoff frequency of 42.15 GHz. The
mode has a cutoff frequency which is the frequency when the wavelength
(in the medium, or free-space wavelength if the guide is air-filled) is twice
the a dimension of the waveguide (see Figure 6-5). The next higher-order
mode appears when it is possible for a variation in the y direction. This
occurs at a frequency corresponding to the b dimension being one-half
wavelength in the medium. The TE11 mode and TM11 modes have the
same cutoff frequency of 47.13 GHz. In determining the operating frequency
range both the phase and group velocity variations are considered. These
are shown in Figure 6-9 for the TE10 mode, where they are normalized to c
as the waveguide is air-filled. The group velocity, vg, varies substantially,
especially near the cutoff frequency of the mode. As a result, the lower
operating frequency of the mode is chosen to be substantially above the
cutoff frequency. The upper limit of the operating frequency is chosen to be
about 5% below the cutoff frequency of the second propagating mode. This

                         is because small discontinuities can launch the higher-order mode. Thus the
                         operating frequency of a Ka-band waveguide is 26.5 GHz-40 GHz, providing
                         a margin of 5.4 GHz at the low end, and 2.2 GHz margin at the high end. So
                         approximately one-half octave of bandwidth is supported by a rectangular
                         waveguide if the wide dimension is twice the height of the waveguide.
                         Since a rectangular waveguide is useful over a relatively narrow frequency
                         range, standard dimensions have been developed, as listed in Table 6-2.
                         A waveguide is referred to by its waveguide standard number (its WR
                         designation), however, the old letter designations of bands are commonly
                         used.

                            At times it is necessary to have a rectangular waveguide that can be used
                         over more than one-half octave of bandwidth. This is achieved by reducing
                         the height, b, of the waveguide, producing what is called a reduced-height
                         waveguide. By reducing b to one-quarter of a, an octave of bandwidth can be
                         obtained [2-4].

                     6.4.4 Rectangular Waveguide Components

                         Rectangular waveguide components require considerable machining, but
                         the equivalents of many of the components that are available in microstrip
                         can be realized. Invariably the lowest-order TE mode is used. This is the TE10
                         mode, with the field configuration shown in Figure 6-7. The characteristic of
                         this mode is that the E-field is transverse to the direction of propagation.
                         Many components have particular orientations to the planes of the E and
                         H fields. Consider the rectangular waveguide bends shown in Figure 6-10.
                         The bend in Figure 6-10(a) is called an H-plane bend, or H-bend, as the axis
                         of the waveguide (which is in the direction of propagation) always remains
                         parallel to the H field. With the E-plane bend, or E-bend, in Figure 6-10(b),
                         the axis of the waveguide remains parallel to the E field. The flat sections at
                         the end of the waveguide sections are called flanges. The pins in the flanges
                         are alignment pins that insert into holes in the opposite flange.

                            In building circuits using rectangular waveguides, it is frequently
                         necessary to rotate and twist the waveguide so that sections can be joined.
                         Bends enable this, but twists (as shown in Figure 6-11) are also used.

Waveguide tees are used to split and combine signals. There are both E-plane
and H-plane versions, as there were for bends (see Figure 6-12).

   There is a wide variety of waveguide components. The components are
developed from EM field considerations and not derived from current and
voltage circuits. For example, a termination in a rectangular waveguide is
realized using a resistive wedge of material as shown in Figure 6-13(a). This
provides a termination with a lower reactive component than would be
obtained with a lumped resistor placed at the end of the line. The matched
load absorbs all of the power in the traveling wave incident on it. The
functional component is a lossy material, often shaped as a wedge or tall
pyramid, that absorbs power over a distance corresponding, perhaps, to
one-half wavelength or longer. So while the characteristic impedance of a
wave in the rectangular waveguide varies with frequency, the termination is
always matched to this impedance. A high-power waveguide matched load
is shown in Figure 6-13(b). This component uses the structure illustrated
in Figure 6-13(a) and has fins for the dissipation of heat. A waveguide

     attenuator is realized by introducing resistive material, as shown in Figure
     6-13(c). This introduces a section of line with a high attenuation coefficient.
     By controlling the depth of the resistive vane, as shown in Figure 6-13(d), a
     variable attenuator is obtained.

        Discontinuities in the waveguide introduce inductive, capacitive, and
     resonant elements. Several discontinuities that are used to realize these
     elements are shown in Figure 6-14. These illustrate most clearly the use of
     E and H field disturbances to realize capacitive and inductive components.
     An E-plane discontinuity (Figure 6-14(a)) is modeled approximately by a
     frequency-dependent capacitor. H-plane discontinuities (Figure 6-14(b and
     c)) resemble inductors, as does the circular iris of Figure 6-14(d). The resonant
     waveguide iris of Figure 6-14(e) disturbs the E and H fields and is modeled
     by a parallel LC resonant circuit near the frequency of resonance. Posts in the
     waveguide are used as reactive elements (Figure 6-14(f)) and to mount active
     devices (Figure 6-14(g)). The equivalent circuits of waveguide discontinuities
     are modeled by capacitive elements if the E field is interrupted and by
     inductive elements if the H field (or current) is disturbed. Many papers (e.g.,
     [5-8]) have been devoted to analytic field solutions that lead to equivalent
     lumped element representations of waveguide discontinuities that can then
     be used in synthesis.

        A rectangular waveguide circulator is shown in Figure 6-15. A circulator
     uses a special property of magnetized ferrites that provides a preferred
     direction of EM propagation.

        It is sometimes necessary to interface between waveguide series, and one
     component to do this is the tapered waveguide section shown in Figure 6-
     16(a). Alternatively the one-quarter wavelength long impedance transformer

shown in Figure 6-16(b) could be used. This section can be shorter than the
tapered waveguide section, which, however, has higher bandwidth.

   Other components commonly encountered are the waveguide switch (see
Figure 6-16(c)), the coaxial-to-waveguide adaptor (see Figure 6-17), and the
waveguide horn antenna (see Figure 6-16(d)).

   Distributed directional couplers are realized by two coupled transmission
lines. A rectangular waveguide directional coupler is shown in Figure 6-18.

                         Here the two transmission lines, the rectangular waveguides, are coupled by
                         slots in the common wall of the guides. In Figure 6-18(b) the EM wave from
                         the bottom waveguide leaks into the top waveguide through the coupling
                         slots. A quick check on phasing indicates that the coupled wave in the
                         reverse direction is canceled. Meanwhile, in the forward-traveling direction
                         there is constructive interference of the coupled EM wave.

typically moves a reactive element along the waveguide. One example is
the movable short circuit shown in Figure 6-19(b). Another variable element
used in tuning is the waveguide slide tuner, shown in Figure 6-19(c). Here
a slot is cut in the wide wall of the waveguide and a metal probe is
inserted. The slot is in a region where the currents in the waveguide wall
are minimum, so little discontinuity is introduced. The probe introduces a
reactive discontinuity, and the reactance can be varied by changing the depth
of penetration of the probe using the knob seen on top. The probe can move
up-and-down along the slot to further increase the impedance range that can
be presented.

   Hybrids in waveguides (Figure 6-20) do not look anything like their
microstrip equivalents.

          6.5 Summary

          Rectangular waveguides guide EM fields in a rectangular pipe. Parallel
          plate waveguides are unintentional but are approximated by the planar
          conductors found in printed circuit boards. Rectangular wave equations
          describe propagation in these structures and are derived from Maxwell's
          equations by applying multiple simplifications such as using phasors,
          restricting propagation to just one direction, and applying symmetries.
          Important concepts that flow from the rectangular wave equations are
          that rectangular and parallel-plate waveguides support multiple modes,
          i.e. variations of the EM field, with all but the TEM mode having a finite
          cut-off frequency below which a particular mode cannot propagate. The
WAVEGUIDES                                                                                  275

rectangular waveguide does not support a TEM mode, a mode with no
variations of the field between boundaries, so the rectangular waveguide
cannot support a propagating mode below the lowest cut-off frequency. A
mode with more variations of the field will have a higher cut-off frequency.
A separate physical result is that if two modes can propagate the EM energy
will be equally partitioned between them. Thus if two or more modes
can propagate the information will become garbled since different modes
travel at different speeds. This is observed in practice so for example, with
rectangular waveguide the useful frequency range of operation is between
the cut-off frequency of the mode with the simplest field variation, and hence
the lowest cut-off frequency, and the cut-off frequency of the next higher-
order mode.

MICROWAVE AND RF DESIGN: TRANSMISSION LINES                Third Edition

Microwave and RF Design: Transmission Lines builds on the concepts of forward- and backward-traveling
waves. Many examples are included of advanced techniques for analyzing and designing transmission line
networks with microstrip lines primarily used in design examples. Coupled-lines are an important functional
element in microwave circuits, and circuit equivalents of coupled lines are introduced as fundamental
building blocks in design. The text and examples introduce the often hidden design requirements of
mitigating parasitic effects and eliminating unwanted modes of operation. This book is suitable as both an
undergraduate and graduate textbook, as well as a career-long reference book.
