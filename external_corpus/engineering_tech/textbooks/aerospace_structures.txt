               engineering students. The text begins with a discussion

                         of the aerodynamic and inertia loads acting on aircraft

                         in symmetric flight. A linear theory for the statics and

                         dynamic response of thin-walled straight bars with

                         closed and open cross-sections is presented. Isotropic

                         and fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials

                         including temperature effects are modeled with

                         Hooke's law. Methods of analyses are by differential

                         equations, Castigliano's theorems, the direct stiffness

                         method, the finite element method, and Lagrange's

                         equations. There are numerous examples for the

                         response of axial bars, beams, coplanar trusses,

                         coplanar frames, and coplanar curved bars. Failure

                         initiation by the von Mises yield criterion, buckling, wing

                         divergence, fracture, and by Puck's criterion for FRP

                         composites are presented in the examples.

Introduction

About this book
In this textbook analytical methods are developed for the response and failure of the primary structural compo-
nents of aircraft. Newton's laws of motion, Hooke s law, and the first law of thermodynamics are the basis to
model the thermoelastic response of thin-walled, straight bars and coplanar curved bars. Analytical methods
include energy principles to develop Castigliano's theorems and to develop the cross-sectional material law for
transverse shear and torsion. Stiffened shells typical of aircraft structures are analyzed with the thin-walled bar
theory. Externally prescribed loads are due to accelerated flight and the thermal environment. Velocity-load fac-
tor (V-n) diagrams for maneuvers and gusts are described to evaluate flight loads.

          Initiation of failure is predicted by one of the following criteria: von Mises yield criterion for ductile
metals; the critical load to cause buckling (failure by excessive displacements); fracture criteria for the critical
stress to cause crack propagation; and Puck's criterion for the brittle failure modes in fiber-reinforced polymer
composites (FRP).

          The subject of structural stability of discrete conservative systems introduces the methods of stability
analysis, classification of bifurcation buckling problems, the concept of imperfection sensitivity, and snap-
through at a limit point. Static instability of an elastic column from pre-buckling equilibrium, buckling, and
through initial post-buckling is presented in detail. Buckling of flat rectangular plates subject to compression and
shear is presented in a qualitative way using the classic charts from the National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics (NACA). The analysis for the static instability of a wing in steady incompressible flow, or divergence, is
part of the discussion of aeroelastic phenomena.
 Results from linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) are introduced to illustrate the relation between crack

    size and the stress to cause crack propagation. Airplane damage-tolerant design is based on LEFM such that
    subcritical length cracks do not grow to critical length between inspection intervals.

 The incentive to study optimal design is illustrated by the example of an aluminum wing spar. The objective
    is to achieve minimum weight by a search for two design variables. Constraints on yielding, buckling, and
    fracture are evaluated with the thin-walled bar theory.

 The analyses are developed for closed and open section bars made from fiber-reinforced polymer compos-
    ites. The cross-sectional compliance matrix for bars with a closed cross-sectional contour and an open cross-
    sectional contour include shear-extension coupling. The first ply failure envelope for a graphite epoxy circu-
    lar tube subject to an axial force and torque is determined by Puck's intralaminar criterion. Interlaminar fail-
    ure, or delamination, is modeled with fracture mechanics, and the method is illustrated by analyses of
    standard fracture test specimens.

 Numerical methods for static analysis begin with the direct stiffness method, which originated to model skel-
    etal structures consisting of bars connected by joints. Applications include coplanar trusses, beams, and co-
    planar frames. The finite element method is developed from the integral formulation of the ordinary
    differential equations of an axial bar and a beam.

 Analyses for the linear elastic, dynamic response of axial bars, coplanar trusses, beams, and coplanar frames
    are presented using the finite element method and the mode-separation method. Hamilton's principle and
    Lagrange's equations are developed for discrete mechanical systems.

 Numerous examples to illustrate the application of the structural analysis are presented in each chapter us-
    ing either U.S. customary units. or SI units.

Audience
This text is evolved from lecture notes by the author for junior and senior students in the aerospace engineering
curriculum at Virginia Tech. The subjects covered in the book presume some knowledge of statics, dynamics of
rigid bodies, mechanics of deformable bodies, and mechanical vibrations. Several practice exercises in the text
require programming, and typically the students use Mathematica1 or MATLAB 2 software to complete them.
Examples in the text were programmed in Mathematica.

A first semester sequence for junior students includes chapters 1 through 6. Note that chapter 3 on thin-wall bar
theory may be too mathematical for some students, but can be used as a reference for the applications of the
theory provided in chapter 4. The important topic of work and energy is covered in chapter 5, and chapter 6 is
devoted to the application of Castigliano's theorems to trusses, beams, and frames.

A second semester sequence for junior students includes topics selected by the instructor from chapter 7 on
curved bars, and chapters 10 through 16. The in fluence of imperfection sensitivity on the buckling load of
discrete systems is presented in chapter 10, followed by buckling of columns and plates in chapter 11. Article
11.2 is optional. Analysis for wing divergence is presented in the introduction to aeroelasticity in chapter 12.
The methods of linear elastic fracture mechanics to predict critical loads for crack propagation is discussed in
chapter 13. Design of a landing strut, and the optimal design of a spar subject to constraints on yielding,
buckling and frac-ture are presented in chapter 14. Chapters 15 and 16 detail the direct stiffness method for
trusses, beams and frames.

Topics appropriate for senior students are in chapters 8, 9, 17, and 18, and initial post-buckling in article 11.2.
The response of closed and open section bars fabricated from a fiber-reinforced polymer composite (FRP) is
presented in chapter 8, and failure initiation of FRP bars is presented in chapter 9. The finite element method
applied to the extension and bending of bars is presented in chapter 17, which includes transverse shear
deformations. The topic of adaptive mesh refinement in article 17.2.4 is optional. Articles 18.1 to 18.4 cover the
dynamic response of lumped mass models, eigenvalue problems, and Lagrange's equations. The remainder of
chapter 18 utilizes the finite element method for the dynamic response of beams, trusses, and frames.

CHAPTER 1  Function of flight vehicle
           structural members

The purpose of this chapter is to present a brief description of aircraft structural members and their function.

     A structure may be defined as any assemblage of materials that is intended to sustain loads. It is important to
recognize that structures are made from materials, and that the history of structures follows the development of
materials and the development of tools to fabricate the materials. Ashby (1992) details a systematic approach to
material selection in mechanical design, and the manufacturing processes required produce the functional shape
of a design. The evolution of the airframe, for example, is tied closely to the introduction of materials and cost-
effective means for their fabrication. Early aircraft were constructed of wire-braced wood frames with fabric cov-
ers. Currently, advanced composite materials are very attractive for weight-sensitive structures, like aircraft,
because of their high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios. There is an interesting and rich history of
the evolution of aircraft structures, but for the sake of brevity it is not presented here. Instead, the interested
reader is referred to the textbook by Curtis (1997). Curtis details the history of fixed-wing aircraft structures
from 1903 to modern aircraft.

     In this text analytical methods are developed for the response and failure of the primary structural compo-
nents of aircraft. The primary structure of a flight vehicle consists of the components that are necessary to sustain
design ultimate flight and ground loads. Failure of the primary structure causes catastrophic collapse and loss of
control. For aircraft the primary structure consists of the wings, fuselage, tail, and landing gear. Forms of con-
struction are space trusses/frames, monocoque and semimonocoque.

1.1 Space truss/frame

A truss structure fuselage is often used in lightweight aircraft. See figure 1.1. It consists of wood or steel tubes
with a fabric covering providing aerodynamic shape. Members in a space truss are subject to axial forces, and
members of a space frame are subject to axial forces, shear forces, and bending moments. The fabric covering
does not add much to the overall stiffness of the structure.

1.2 Monocoque and semimonocoque constructions

Most flight vehicle structures are thin shells with the cover skin providing the aerodynamic shape. Monocoque
refers to a shell without supporting stiffening members, whose origin is from the twentieth-century Greek word
"mono" meaning alone, plus the French "coque" meaning shell. See figure 1.2 The wall of a monocoque struc-
ture has to be strong enough to resist bending and compressive and torsional loads without buckling. The chal-
lenge in monocoque design is maintaining strength within allowable weight limits. Another difficulty with
monocoque structure is how to design it to accommodate concentrated loads such as engine mountings and wing-
fuselage interface, which may require the incorporation of formers (frames) and bulkheads. For large cross-sec-
tional dimensions the skin of a monocoque structure must be relatively thick. A more efficient type of construc-

tion is one which contains stiffening members that permit a thinner skin. Also, stiffening members can be used to

diffuse concentrated loads into the skin. A stiffened thin-walled shell is called semimonocoque. A semimono-
coque body structure and wing structure are shown in figure 1.3. Both the body structure figure 1.3(a) and the
wing structure in figure 1.3(b) have longitudinal stiffening members and transverse stiffening members support-
ing thin skins.

Fig. 1.3 (a) Semimonocoque body structure. (b) Semimonocoque wing structure.

     Longitudinal members are called longitudinals, stringers, or stiffeners. Longerons are longitudinal members
having a large cross section. Longitudinal members act with the skin to resist applied bending and axial loads.
Transverse members in a body structure are known as frames, rings, and if they cover most of the cross section
they are called bulkheads. Pressure bulkheads cover the entire cross section. Frame members maintain cross-sec-
tional shape and are used to distribute concentrated loads to the skin.

      In a wing the longitudinal member is called a spar, and it consists of the spar web and spar cap. The spar cap
act with the skin to resists axial and bending loads applied to the wing. The skin and the spar web develop shear-
ing stresses to resist torsion and transverse shear due to bending. Transverse members in a wing are called ribs,
and they act to maintain the airfoil shape. Ribs act with the skin and longitudinals in resisting circumferential
loads due to pressurization.

     Longitudinal and transverse members also function to divide the skin into smaller panels to increase the
buckling strength. (See Example 11.5 on page 354.)

     Additional components of a wing are shown in figure 1.4. The internal wing structure consists of spars, ribs,
and stringers. The external wing structure is the skin. Ribs are also used in ailerons, elevators (flaps), fins, and
stabilizers. In a fixed-wing aircraft, the spar is the main structural member connected to the fuselage at its root
and running spanwise to the tip of the wing. It bends in transmitting the lift due to flight loads acting on the wing.
The flight loads acting on a wing not only cause bending, but a significant amount of torsion/ twisting of the wing
as well. The skin and shear webs form closed cells in a wing, and torsion is resisted by shear stresses developed
in the wall of these cells.

      A semimonocoque fuselage structure for a transport aircraft is shown in figure 1.5. The skin is stiffened by
longitudinal stringers, spaced six to ten inches apart, which function to increase the buckling strength of the skin
and resist fuselage bending loads. Transverse frames maintain the shape of the fuselage and are typically spaced
twenty inches apart (Young, 2011).

1.3 Rocket structure

A full-scale rocket consists of a launch vehicle and payload. There are four major systems in a full-scale rocket:
the structural system, the payload system, the guidance system, and the propulsion system. The structural system
includes the cylindrical body, the fairings, and any control fins. The payload is the entire spacecraft such as a sat-
ellite, experiment, or whatever else is being lifted into space. When a spacecraft is to be launched by an expend-
able booster, a booster adapter, or a launch-vehicle adapter, structurally links the spacecraft to the launch vehicle.
The payload and its structure is protected by a fairing. Also, refer to the configuration of the Atlas I launch vehi-
cle shown in figure 18.1 on page 534. Atlas I consists of an expendable booster and an expendable second stage.

     The cylindrical body of the launch vehicle, or frame, has a thin skin to reduce weight. Engine thrust is the
dominate load that causes compression in the rocket parts. The buckling resistance of the thin skins is increased
under compression loading by a grid of internal stiffening members attached to the skins similar to those shown
in figure 1.3(a). The buckling loads for axially compressed cylindrical shells in experiments are significantly less
than the buckling load determined from an analysis of the perfect structure. Imperfection in the shell geometry is
main the reason for the discrepancy between theory and experiment Refer to the discussion at the end of article
10.2.1 on page 298. The buckling knockdown factor (KDF) has been introduced to reduce the buckling load pre-
dicted by the analysis of the prefect structure to aid in the structural design (Hilburger, 2018).

CHAPTER 2  Aircraft loads

Consider an airplane moving through calm air. Particles of air affected by the airplane are accelerated and the
reaction of the accelerated particles is felt over the surfaces of the airplane as a distribution of pressures. The
pressure distribution acting on the surfaces of the airplane can be resolved into the total lift and drag forces. In
addition to the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag, there are so-called inertia loads resulting from the accelera-
tion of the airplane. Other loading conditions such as landing loads, ground-handling loads, horizontal and verti-
cal tail loads, and monocoque body loads are discussed in detail by Lomax (1996).

      Load analysis is important in aircraft design, and a design cannot proceed without information on loads. The
aircraft loads analysis presented in this chapter is used in preliminary design, which is defined in the next section.
In this chapter we define load factors, discuss the aerodynamic data required for structural analysis, develop the
basic maneuver V-n diagram, and discuss gust load factors used in design.

2.1 Aircraft design process

Phases of the aircraft design may be divided into a concept formulation, a concept design, a preliminary design,
and a detail design. Concept formulation is where the basic requirements for new aircraft are developed. Require-
ments are developed by a combination of market and customer surveys, and statistical analyses. Concept design
begins with the basic requirements and sizes the aircraft. Only the most simple analysis methods and historical
data are used. In preliminary design the sized conceptual baseline aircraft is further developed. Increased level of
analysis is used to define the aerodynamics, performance, weight, propulsion, acoustic and cost parameters of the
design. Detailed design is where the various parts of the aircraft are designed for fabrication. Part and assembly
drawings are developed for manufacturing.

2.2 Inertia loads

The maximum load on any part of the airplane structure occurs when it accelerates. In preliminary design, inertia
force calculations are usually based on rigid body dynamics of the airplane. Once these loads are determined they

are imposed on the airplane, and the structural design proceeds by assuming the airplane is flexible (i.e., a
deformable body). Determining inertia loads for a deformable body is more complex, and may be warranted later
in the structural design process.

2.2.1 Coordinate systems and Newton's laws of motion

The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system OXYZ is fixed to the Earth, origin at point O, and it is assumed that
this is an inertial system. That is, Newton's laws of motion are valid in the Earth axis system. The unit base vec-
tors in the OXYZ system are denoted by (I^, J^, K^ ) . The right-handed Cartesian coordinate system Gxyz is fixed in
the body of the aircraft, with its origin at the center of gravity, which is labeled G. The unit base vectors in the
Gxyz system are denoted by (^i, ^j, k^ ) . Consider planar motion of the aircraft - that is, symmetrical maneuvers of
the aircraft, and where the aircraft is symmetrical about its vertical fore and aft plane. Body axis Gx is directed
forward, axis Gy is directed toward the starboard wing, and body axis Gz is in the normal direction. For symmet-
rical maneuvers there is no roll or yaw of the airplane, so symmetrical maneuvers imply ^j = J^ for all time t. Let

RG denote the position vector of the center of gravity G with respect to fixed point O. The flight path is a plane
curve in the X-Z plane with the arc-length along the curve denoted by s. The unit tangent vector to the flight path
at s is denoted by ^t , the unit normal vector at s by n^ , and the angle between the flight path and the unit tangent
vector, or the x-axis, by . Note that ^t = ^i . Angle  represents the clockwise rotation of the aircraft in pitch. See
figure 2.1.

2.2.2 Principle of D'Alembert

D'Alembert in 1743 proposed a principle that would reduce a problem in dynamics to an equivalent one in statics
by introducing so-called inertial forces. The inertial force acting at the airplane's center of gravity is defined as
-maG , and the inertial moment about the center of gravity is defined as -Iy^j . These inertial forces are drawn on
the free body diagram of the airplane in addition to all the applied forces. D'Alembert's principle states that the
applied forces together with the inertial forces form a system in equilibrium. Thus we write Newton's second law
as

             F  +  (  -mvG^t  -  m  v2       n^  )  =  0  MG + (-Iy^j) = 0 .            (2.7)

                                      G

The free body diagram is modified accordingly as shown in figure 2.3. In the free body diagram the inertial
forces and moment are indicated by dashed lines. From the free body diagram we proceed as in statics to write
the conditions of (dynamic) equilibrium.

     The curvature of the flight path  can change sign. As shown in figure 2.4, the curvature is positive for a
pull-up maneuver from a dive, and the curvature is negative for a push-down maneuver from a climb. Conse-
quently, the inertia force normal to the flight path is directed toward the convex side of the path.

2.2.3 Relative velocity and acceleration
Often it is necessary to determine the inertial forces at locations within the airplane not coincident with the center
of gravity. For these computations we need the relative velocity and acceleration formulas from rigid body
dynamics. Consider two points A and G fixed in the body. The position of point A relative to G is taken as xA / G^i ,
as shown in figure 2.5.

                                                                  ^

                                                                G

                                                                   O

                            Fig. 2.5 Relative position of two points fixed in a rigid body.

The position vectors of points A and G are related by

                                                      RA = RG + xA / Gi .^                                                            (2.8)

The velocity vectors of points A and G are then

                                                                 d           ^
                                               vA = vG + (xA / Gt) .                                                                  (2.9)
                                                                 dt

Since  vector       ^   is  embedded  in  the  rigid  body  for  all  time,  its  rate  of  change  is  determined  from  its  cross
               xA / Gi

product with the vector of the time rate of change of pitch rotation. That is,

                                          ddt(xA / G^t) =  ^j  xA / G^t = xA / G n^ .                                         (2.10)

Hence,

                                                     vA = vG + xA / G n^ .                                                     (2.11)
The time rate of change of this velocity expression (2.11) relates the acceleration of A relative to G by

           aA = aG + ddt[xA / G n^ ] = aA + xA / Gn^ +  ddt[xA / Gn^ ] = aG + xA / Gn^ +  [ ^j  xA / Gn^ ] .                  (2.12)
Perform the vector cross product in eq. (2.12) to find

                                          aA = aG + xA / Gn^ -  2xA / G^t .                                                    (2.13)

2.2.4 Uniform linear and angular accelerations

In some inertial load problems it is reasonable to assume that the acceleration of a particle and/or the angular
acceleration of a rigid body are constant over a time interval. Let s denote the distance of a particle along a
straight line, v its speed along the line, and a its constant acceleration. Then, we have the following formulas

             v = at + v0     s  =     1   at2  +  v0t  +  s0           2a(s - s0)  =  v2  -  v2   ,   (2.14)

                                      2                                                        0

where s = s0 and v = v0 at time t = 0 . Similarly if the angular acceleration  is constant over some time
interval, then

              = t +  0     = 1--t2 +  0t + 0                           2( - 0) =  2 -  02 ,           (2.15)

where  =  0 and  = 0 at time t = 0 .

2.3 Load factors

It is convenient to combine the inertial forces and gravity forces in the analysis of aircraft structural components.
Consider an airplane in general plane motion as depicted in figure 2.6.

                                           L                              - W---- aG

Let the total applied force on the airplane excluding weight be noted by  F . The total applied force, in general,

may include other effects than those shown in the sketch above (e.g., wheel reactions on landing.) Then dynamic

equilibrium is written as

directions is K^ = sin(-^t) + cos(-n^ ) . Similarly, we define the projections of the resultant

where the load factors in the tangent and normal directions are defined by

                                vG                                          vG2

Also, eq. (2.20) shows that the load factors can be determined from

                        nx = (F)x / W nz = (F)n / W .                                                            (2.22)

Note that the load factor is a dimensionless number, and it can be negative, zero, or positive. The free body dia-
gram for dynamic equilibrium of the airplane employing load factors is shown in figure 2.8.

2.4.1 Airplane design requirements

  1. All parts of the airplane are designed so they are not stressed beyond the yield point at the limit load
      factor.

  2. The airplane structure must carry the ultimate loads for at least 3 seconds without collapsing, even
      though the members may acquire permanent deformation.

2.4.2 Regulations

Limit load factors are specified by regulations, which depend on the type of aircraft (e.g., transport, aerobatic,
etc.). Criteria for civil aerospace vehicles in the United States.

2.4.4 Basic maneuver V-n diagram

This is predicated on pilot-controlled, symmetrical maneuvers in flight through calm air (i.e., no gust). Assump-
tions made for analytical purposes are that the pitching acceleration is assumed zero or negligible, the airspeed is
constant during the maneuver, and there is no rolling or yawing of the aircraft, although rolling or yawing
maneuvers may be considered in design as well. For no pitching acceleration the pitch rate  is constant with
respect to time. Use the chain rule to write the pitch rate as

               =        d      =  dds          =  vG .                                                         (2.23)

Hence, in a steady state maneuver vG is constant with respect to time. The load factors (2.21) for a steady state
maneuver are

             nx = sin                             vG2

though the airplane does have a lateral acceleration in the turn. (Refer to practice exercise 2.) In general, the
steady state symmetrical maneuvers will produce the maximum design wing loads. See figure 2.9.

2.4.5 Aerodynamic data

When a two-dimensional airfoil is subject to a relative wind there is a net pressure distribution over the airfoil
that depends on the angle of attack, which is denoted by . The angle of attack is the angle between the relative
wind and the chord of the airfoil.The chord is the width of the airfoil and its length is denoted by c. The resultant
action of the pressure distribution is a force R and no moment at the center of pressure, which is labeled C.P. in
figure 2.10(a). The center of pressure location varies with the angle of attack. The resultant action of the pressure
distribution is a force and a moment at any other location. The standard reference point for aerodynamic data is
the aerodynamic center, which is labeled A.C. in figure 2.10(b). The aerodynamic center is the point where the
pitching moment is independent of the angle of attack. For most subsonic wing sections the A.C. is around 25
percent of the chord.The net force of the pressure distribution is resolved at the aerodynamic center into a lift
force perpendicular to the relative wind and a drag force parallel to the relative wind and the pitching moment.

The lift increases as the angle of attack increases. At some point, however, the flow can no longer stay attached to
the upper surface and detaches. This results in a decrease in lift, which is called aerodynamic stall as shown in
figure 2.10(c). The sharpness of the decrease in lift is dependent on the type of airfoil.

     Airplanes are three-dimensional vehicles with three-dimensional aerodynamic surfaces, so the aerodynamic
loads are spread over these surfaces. This distribution in the spanwise direction of the wing results in a force and
moment at the root of the wing. The spanwise distribution of the airload is a function of the wing planform shape,
the airfoil sections, and the geometric twist. The basic aerodynamic reference for three-dimensional wings is the

mean aerodynamic chord (MAC). The thickness, chord length, and angle of attack of the MAC airfoil section is
used as a reference for all aerodynamic data. For a rectangular wing planform, the MAC is equal to the wing
chord, and for a trapezoidal planform of the semiwing the MAC is equal to the chord at the centroid of the trape-
zoid.

Methods of data acquisition. Basic methods to calculate aerodynamic data for aircraft design and analysis are
preliminary design estimates, wind tunnel testing, numerical fluid analysis, and aircraft flight test. The wind tun-
nel test is the major source for aerodynamic data in the preliminary design phase, and it involves construction of
a scale model of the aircraft. The model is instrumented with pressure and force transducers. Data required for
the structural analysis are the lift, drag, and pitching moment curves for the complete airplane with the horizontal
tail removed through the range of angles of attack from the negative stalling angle to the positive angle. Data for
the combination of the wing and fuselage, or the wing, fuselage, and nacelles, are more difficult to calculate
accurately from the published data, because of the uncertain effects of the aerodynamic interference of the vari-
ous components.

     The lift force L is normal to the relative velocity (flight path), the drag force D is parallel to the relative
velocity, and the pitching moment M0.25 is nose-up positive at the mean aerodynamic chord as shown in figure
2.11(a). The angle  is measured from the flight path to the x-axis and is equal to the difference between to the
angle of attack  and the angle of wing incidence i.

The lift force, drag force, and pitching moment for the tail-off are expressed in terms of the dynamic pressure q,

     The aerodynamic actions L, D, and M0.25 at the mean aerodynamic chord are statically equivalent to the
aerodynamic actions fn , fx , and My at the center of gravity. The lift and drag forces are resolved into compo-
nents normal fn and parallel fx to the flight path by

                                  fn = L cos  + D sin  , and fx = L sin  - D cos  .                          (2.27)
The moment at the center of gravity is determined from figure 2.11(b):

Substitute the moment at the center of gravity (2.28) into eq. (2.31) to get

Introduce aerodynamic coefficients Cn , Cx and Ct by the relations

                      fn = CnqS , fx = CxqS , and Lt = CtqS .                                                (2.33)

Substituting fn and fx from the definitions (2.33) into eq. (2.27) determines the coefficients Cn and Cx as

                      Cn = CL cos  + CD sin  , and Cx = CL sin  - CD cos  .                                  (2.34)

The balancing tail force coefficient Ct is to be determined from the equations of dynamic equilibrium. From the
relations (2.33) and (2.34), the equilibrium equations (2.29) and (2.30) are written as

                      nxW = (Cx + Ct sin )qS + Teng , and                                                    (2.35)

Let nzW = CNqS , where the airplane normal coefficient is denoted by CN . From eq. (2.36) the normal coeffi-
cient is

                                                    CN = Cn + Ct cos  .                                       (2.37)
In terms of the aerodynamic relations introduced, the moment about the center of gravity (2.32) is

                       CM0.25qSc + xC / GCnqS - zC / GCxqS + zeTeng - xT / GCtqS cos  = 0 .                   (2.38)
Rearrange eq. (2.38) to

                           (CM0.25c + xC / GCn - zC / GCx - xT / GCt cos )qS + zeTeng = 0 .                   (2.39)
Consider the case of power-off so that Teng = 0 , and solve for Ct cos  to get

                          Ct cos  = (c / xT / G)CM0.25 + (xC / G / xT / G)Cn - (zC / G / xT / G)Cx .          (2.40)

If the term on the right side containing longitudinal coefficient Cx is assumed small with respect to the other
terms and neglected, then the resulting expression for coefficient Ct is consistent with the traditional equation for
the balancing tail load (Lomax, p. 9). Substitute Ct cos  from eq. (2.40) into eq. (2.37) to get the expression for
the normal coefficient determined from the aerodynamic coefficients with the tail off:

                          CN = (c / xT / G)CM0.25 + (xC / G / xT / G)Cn - (zC / G / xT / G)Cx .               (2.41)

The total normal force is denoted by Lz . From eq. (2.30) Lz = fn + Lt cos  = nzW , and nzW = CNqS . Hence,

2.5 Design gust load factors

Turbulent conditions of varying intensity occur in air through which an airplane flies. For example, atmospheric
phenomena that create turbulence are thermals (convection), mountain waves (terrain effects), wind shears, and
jet streams. Assume steady level flight from still air, n = 1, into an ideal sharp-edged gust as shown in figure 2.16.

U  V usually                     U  O(50 ft./s)                                            V  O(300 ft./s)

                           Fig. 2.16 Steady level fight into a sharp-edged gust.

The change in the angle of attack due to the idealized sharp-edged gust is depicted in figure 2.17.

                                  U
                                                  = atanU / V  U / V

The lift curve slope between stall points is m = (dCN) / (d) . Therefore, the change in the aerodynamic coeffi-
cient is

                                                 CN = m() ,                                                  (2.47)

and the change in lift is

                                  Lift  =    1     V  2  S  m  (      )  =  1                                (2.48)
                                             --                             --VSmU .

Now the change in the load factor due to the gust is

                                          Lift                    (m) / 2                                    (2.49)

2.5.2 Gust load factor
For steady level flight, the gust load factor is

                                                           n = 1 + ----m------/--2-- KgUV .                    (2.52)

Note that a lightly loaded airplane is more susceptible than when heavily loaded. This is because the increment in
lift is independent of the weight. A heavily loaded airplane has more inertia with which to smooth out gusts than
a lightly loaded airplane, all other things being equal.

2.5.3 NACA discrete gust conditions

Discrete gusts refer to sudden changes, or alleviated sharp-edged gusts, as opposed to continuous turbulence air-
craft gust analysis. In continuous turbulence gusts are represented as a stationary Gaussian random process lead-

ing to specification of a power spectral density (Hoblit, 1988). For civil transport airplanes 0-20,000 ft., three
discrete gusts are specified:

1. Rough air gust: U = 66 ft/s at V = VB a speed related to the stall speed.
2. High speed gust: U = 50 ft/s at cruise speed VC .
3. Dive speed gust: U = 25 ft/s at dive speed VD .

     The gust V-n diagram is shown in figure 2.20, and it is almost symmetrical with n = 1 line since gusts are as
likely to act down as up.

                                          U = 50 ft/s                        U = 25 ft/s

2.5.4 Design V-n diagram
The extreme load factors of both maneuver and gust diagrams must be met. Superimpose the two and take the
outer boundaries as shown in figure 2.21. Generally, large airplanes are designed primarily by gust load factors.
Small military and aerobatic airplanes are designed by maneuver load factors.

Problem statement: Determine the design V-n diagram at sea level using the NACA formulas for gust loads.

    First, draw the maneuver V-n diagram. The stall boundary is given by

                                                                   s.l. / 2 2

The density of air at sea level is

The maneuver V-n diagram is shown in figure 2.23.

     Second, draw the gust V-n diagram using NACA formulas. Find the value of the gust alleviation factor as
given in eq. (2.50). The airplane mass ratio is

                      W/S                                        100 lb./ft2

Hence, the gust alleviation factor is Kg = 0.85 . The change in the load factor due to the gust is

                       n gust  =  ----m------/--2-- KgUV  =  0.002378(4.37) / 2                                                                            (k)

For gust (1) U = 66 ft/s at V = VB . To find the airplane speed VB on the stall boundary we set the load factor

     b) Calculate the axial load N and bending moment M in the strut, assuming the strut is vertical.

     c) Determine the shortening of the strut when the vertical velocity of the aircraft is zero.

5. An airplane has a total weight of 40,000 lb. and total rolling moment of inertia about the C.G. of 1,000,000
lb.-s2-in. Each wing-tip store weighs 2,000 lb. In steady level flight, each wing's resultant lift is Lw = 21, 000
lb. (The tail carries stabilizing a negative lift of 2,000 lb.) In a sudden evasive roll maneuver from steady level
flight, each aileron introduces a lift increment La = 3, 000 lb. Assuming the airplane to be rigid and, neglect-
ing wing weight, calculate the total root bending moment for each wing (i.e., MA and MB ). Neglect the moment
of inertia of each wing-tip store about its own C.G.

1. A nautical mile is based on the circumference of the planet Earth. If you were to cut the Earth in half at the equator, you could pick up one
of the halves and look at the equator as a circle. You could divide that circle into 360 degrees. You could then divide a degree into 60 minutes.
A minute of arc on the planet Earth is 1 nautical mile. This unit of measurement is used by all nations for air and sea travel. A nautical mile is
1,852 meters, or 1.852 kilometers. In the English measurement system, a nautical mile is 1.1508 miles, or 6,076 feet. [http://www.howstuff-

For steady level flight at sea level the fuselage bending moment at the C.G. was recorded by test equipment to
be 600,000 N m. Calculate the maximum value of this bending moment for the given flight envelope, or V-n dia-
gram. For this purpose it may be assumed that the aerodynamic loadings on the fuselage structure itself can be
neglected; i.e., the only loads on the fuselage aft of the C.G. are those due to tail lift and the inertia of the fuse-
lage.

CHAPTER 3        Elements of a thin-walled
                 bar theory

Essential aspects of a linear elastic theory for straight, uniform, thin-walled bars is presented. It is assumed that
the material is homogeneous and isotropic. Bars with an open cross section are presented first, followed by bars
with a closed cross section. The thin-walled bar theory presented in this chapter allows for free warping of the
cross section out of its plane under torsion and transverse shear. Constrained warping theory is not discussed, but
it is presented in texts by Gjelsvik (1981), Oden and Ripperger (1981), Vasiliev (1993), and Vasiliev and Moro-
zov (2013). Bars fabricated by laminating fibrous composite materials are discussed in article 8.1.

3.1 Open cross section

A bar with an open cross section is shown in figure 3.1(a). There are two branches in the cross section. A vertical
straight branch of length a with wall thickness t, and a semicircular branch of radius a with wall thickness t.

                        The geometry of the bar's cross section is defined by the locus of points along the

          gap               center line of the wall, which is called the contour, and the thickness t of the wall.
overlap                 t The contour consists of piece-wise continuous lines or curves in the plane of the

                            cross section whose subdivisions are called branches. Points between branches

    t                   occur at junctions or sharp corners. Let the arc-length along the contour be

                        denoted by s, and the thickness can be a function of s. That is t = t(s) > 0 , as

    junction.           ture (e.g., 0 < t  a for the section shown in figure 3.1(a)). At junctions between

                        branches overlaps and gaps of cross-sectional areas can occur as shown in figure

3.2, but its effect on the geometrical properties of the section are small under the thin-walled assumption. A step

change in thickness along a contour is accommodated by defining a junction at the location of the step.

     The bar is referenced to two, right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems labeled (X,Y,Z) and (x,y,z). The pos-
itive directions of the Z-axis and the z-axis are out of the plane of the cross section shown in the figure with Z = z,

where z  [0, L] and L is the axial length of the bar. The cross section shown figure 3.1(a) is called a positive z-
face since the normal to the cross section points outward (positive z-direction) from the material contained
behind the cross section. The origin of the (X,Y) system in the cross section is taken at the center of the semicir-
cular branch for convenience, and is labeled point O. The (x,y) system is parallel to the (X,Y) system, and the ori-
gin of the (x,y) system is at the centroid, which is labeled point C. The shear center in the cross section is labeled
as point S.C.

      The internal resultants acting on the cross section of the bar are N, Vx, Vy, Mx, My, and Mz , and these
resultants are functions of the axial coordinate z. Refer to figure 3.1(b). The axial normal force is labeled N, and
is defined positive in tension acting at the centroid. Note that N is not shown in figure 3.1(b). The axial displace-
ment corresponding to N is denoted by w(z) . The transverse shear forces Vx and Vy are defined positive in posi-
tive x- and y-directions on a positive z-face, respectively, and act at the shear center. The displacements
corresponding to Vx and Vy are denoted by u(z) and v(z) , respectively. The bending moment Mx(z) and its cor-

responding rotation x(z) are referenced to the centroid, and are defined positive in the positive x-direction by
the right-hand screw rule. (Put your right thumb along the positive x-axis and your fingers curl in the direction of
the positive moment and corresponding rotation.) The bending moment My(z) and its corresponding rotation

y(z) are referenced to the centroid and are defined positive in the negative y-direction by the right-hand screw
rule. Note that positive bending moments cause tension of the axial fibers in the first quadrant of the x-y coordi-
nate system. The torque is denoted by Mz(z) , and its corresponding rotation z(z) are defined at the shear center
and are positive counterclockwise on the positive z-face.

Centroid C. The centroid decouples the extension and bending responses of the bar in the material law. Refer to
eq. (3.80) on page 47. The procedure to locate the centroid is presented in example 3.1 on page 47 for an open
cross-sectional contour, and in part (a) of example 3.4 on page 71 for a closed cross-sectional contour.

Shear center S.C. The shear center is a point in the cross section through which the plane of the loading must
pass for the bar to bend and not twist in torsion. That is, the resultant of the shear forces in the cross section must
act through the shear center to prevent torsion. Using energy methods in article 5.5.3 it is shown that the shear
center decouples the transverse shear and torsion responses of the bar in the material law. Refer to eq. (5.76) on
page 144. The procedure to locate the shear center is presented in example 3.3 on page 54 for an open cross-sec-
tional contour, and in part (c) of example 3.4 on page 71 for a closed cross-sectional contour.

3.2 Contour geometry

The contour in the cross section is defined in parametric form by its coordinates x(s) and y(s) where s denotes the
arc-length of the contour as shown in figure 3.3(a). The position vector from point C to a point s on the contour is

                                                 r(s) = x(s)^i + y(s)^j ,                                        (3.1)

where the Cartesian unit vectors are denoted ^i, ^j, k^ along the positive x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively. The
Cartesian coordinates are a right-handed system, or ^i  ^j = k^ , and the arc-length s is taken positive counter-
clockwise along the contour. The differential arc-length on the contour is given by

      ds2 = dr  dr = dx2 + dy2,                           which implies                   dx 2 dy 2             (3.2)
                                                                                            ----- + ----- = 1 .

Unit vectors tangent and normal to the contour are denoted by ^t(s) and n^ (s) , respectively. Let the angle between
the positive x-direction and the unit normal n^ be denoted by (s) . From the differential geometry along the con-
tour shown in figure 3.3, the trigonometric functions of the angle (s) are given by

                                             dx                             dy

The derivatives of the unit tangent and normal vectors along the contour are obtained by differentiating eq. (3.4)
and eq. (3.5) with respect to arc-length s. The results are expressed as

tions the direction cosines between the two Cartesian and contour unit vectors are listed in table 3.1.

     The position vector r(s) is also expressed as a function of the tangential coordinate rt(s) and normal coor-
dinate rn(s) by

             r(s)  =     ^  +     ^            +     rt(  s  )^t(  s  )  +  rn(  s   )n^ (  s  )  ,        (3.7)

where the coordinates of the shear center with respect to the centroid are denoted by xsc and ysc . Equating the
two expressions (3.1) and (3.7) for the position vector and using the direction cosine table 3.1, the following rela-
tions between the contour coordinates result:

             rt(s) = - [x(s) - xsc] sin (s) + [y(s) - ysc] cos (s)

                                                                                                                                       (3.8)

             rn(s) = [x(s) - xsc] cos (s) + [y(s) - ysc] sin (s)

       x(s) - xsc = - rt(s) sin (s) + rn(s) cos (s)          y(s) - ysc = rt(s) cos (s) + rn(s) sin (s) .  (3.9)

Replace the trigonometric functions in eq. (3.8) by derivatives of the contour coordinates using eq. (3.3). Then
expand eq. (3.8) and write it as

             rt = rtc - xscdxds - yscdyds            rn = rnc - xscdyds + yscdxds ,                        (3.10)

where

             rtc = x(s)dxds + y(s)dyds                    rnc = x(s)dyds - y(s)dxds .                      (3.11)

In eq. (3.11), the tangent and normal coordinates to a generic point on the contour relative to the centroid are
denoted by rtc(s) and rnc(s) , respectively. The relationship expressed by eq. (3.10) is shown in figure 3.3(b).

     The derivative of the position vector with respect to the arc length coordinate s is the unit tangent vector in
eq. (3.4). Take the derivative of r(s) with respect to s using eq. (3.7) to get

3.3 Displacements

Consider a material point in the wall of the cross section located by coordinates (s,), where  denotes the thick-

ness coordinate. Coordinate  = 0 on the contour and -t / 2    t / 2 . Denote the position vector R to point (s,)
relative to the shear center by

                                         R(s, ) = rt^t + (rn + )n^ .                                    (3.14)

     It is assumed that the cross section displaces, and then undergoes an infinitesimal rotation as a rigid
disk. Let usc(z) denote the displacement vector of the shear center of the cross section, and let u(s, z, ) denote

the displacement vector of the particle at point (s,z,). The position vector R in the cross section is displaced and
rotated in the rigid disk to R(*) . Since R(*) is embedded in the rigid disk, the magnitudes of vector R(*) and vec-
tor R are the same; i.e., R(*)  R(*) = R  R . As shown in figure 3.4 the displacement u(s, z, ) related to dis-

placement usc(z) and the change in direction of vector R by

direction of R is denoted as dR and is determined by the vector cross product (Goldstein, p.128):  (3.16)
                                                 R(*) - R = dR =   R .                            (3.17)

Substitute eq. (3.16) for R(*) - R in eq. (3.15) to get

                                               u(s, z, ) = usc(z) +   R .

     The vectors uSC(z) , u(s, z, ) , and (z) are written in the Cartesian basis or contour coordinate basis as
follows:

                        usc(z) = u(z)^i + v(z)^j + wsc(z)k^                                        (3.18)
             u(s, z, ) = us(s, z, )^t + uz(s, z, )k^ + u(s, z, )n^ ,

                        (z) = x(z)^i - y(z)^j + z(z)k^

where wsc(z) is the axial displacement of the shear center. The components of the displacement vector u(s, z, )

in terms of the displacement vector usc(z) of the shear center and the contribution from the rotation is given by
the following scalar products:

             us(s, z, ) = u(s, z, )  ^t = usc(z)  ^t +   (rt^t + (rn + )n^ )  ^t

             uz(s, z, ) = u(s, z, )  k^ = usc(z)  k^ +   (rt^t + (rn + )n^ )  k^ .             (3.19)

             u(s, z, ) = u(s, z, )  n^ = usc(z)  n^ +   (rt^t + (rn + )n^ )  n^

Performing the scalar products in eq. (3.19) with the aid of (3.9) and (3.18) and table 3.1, we find that the dis-
placement components of a particle in the cross section with respect to the shear center are

             us(s, z, ) = - u(z) sin (s) + v(z) cos (s) + [rn(s) + ]z(z) ,                         (3.20)

    uz(s, z, ) = wsc(z) + [y(s) - ysc]x(z) + [x(s) - xsc]y(z) + [x(z) sin (s) + y(z) cos (s)] , (3.21)

             u(s, z, ) = u(z) cos (s) + v(z) sin (s)-rt(s)z(z) .                                   (3.22)

    Let uc(z) denote the displacement of the centroid, with the component form given by

             uc(z) = uc(z)^i + vc(z)^j + w(z)k^ .                                                  (3.23)

where uc(z) and vc(z) denote the x-direction and y-direction displacements of the centroid. From figure 3.5 the
displacement of the shear center relative to the displacement of the centroid is

                                               *                                                   (3.24)

Consider three mutually perpendicular, infinitesimal line elements dS , dz, and d in the undeformed body, where
the arc-length of the line element parallel to the contour is related to the arc-length of the contour by
dS = (1 +  / Rs)ds . Let ss denote the normal strain for line element dS, zz the normal strain for dz, and 
the normal strain for line element d. For infinitesimal deformations, these normal strains are related to displace-
ments us, uz, and u by

Let  zs denote the engineering shear strain between line elements dS and dz,  s the engineering shear strain

formable in its own plane. Substitute the axial displacement from eq. (3.26) into the axial normal strain-

Substitute the displacements from eqs. (3.20), (3.22), and (3.26) into the last two shear strain-displacement equa-
tions to find

In previous expressions for the shear strains new quantities x and y are introduced. These new quantities rep-
resent shear strains averaged over the cross section of the bar and are defined by

resultants acting at the contour of length ds.

     Consider the work done on a cross section at a fixed value of z by the stresses acting through incremental
displacements. The incremental displacement corresponding to zz is uz 2, incremental displacement corre-

sponding to zs is us , and the incremental displacement corresponding to z is u . Let Wz denote the
incremental work, which is given by the integral

                                                            t/2                                 (3.33)

               Wz =   (zzuz + zsus + zu)(1 +  / Rs)d ds .
                                                       c -t / 2

The incremental displacements are determined from eqs. (3.20), (3.22), and (3.26), and are

uz(s, z, ) = w(z) + y(s)x(z) + x(s)y(z) + [x(z) sin (s) + y(z) cos (s)]

      us(s, z, ) = - u(z) sin (s) + v(z) cos (s) + [rn(s) + ]z(z)                           ,   (3.34)

                      u(s, z, ) = u(z) cos (s) + v(z) sin (s)-rt(s)z(z)

where u(z) , v(z) , and w(z) denote the incremental displacements of the cross section, x(z) , y(z) ,

and z(z) denote the incremental rotations of the cross section. Substitute the incremental displacements from
eq. (3.34) into the expression (3.33) for the incremental work, followed by integration through the thickness of

   vanishes at prescribed values of uz . That is, uz + uz is a new displacement function. Function uz is interpreted as a
   change in displacement at fixed values of independent coordinates s, z, and , where the independent variables identify a
    material point. In differential calculus duz is the infinitesimal change in the displacement function with respect to changes
    in the independent variables without changing the function itself.

The integration through the thickness leads to the definition of stress resultants acting at the contour. The normal
stress resultant is denoted by nz , shear flow resultant by q, transverse stress resultant by qz , bending moment

resultant by mz , and twisting moment resultant by mzs . These stress resultants are given by the following inte-

3.6 External loads and equilibrium of an element of the bar

The prescribed external traction components acting on the bar are denoted by functions pn(s, z) , ps(s, z) and
pz(s, z) , which are defined per unit area of the middle surface where  = 0 . The dimensional units of these
traction components are F/L2. See figure 3.8. At a typical cross section these tractions are resolved into distrib-
uted line loads fx , fy and fz having dimensional units F/L. The line loads are determined from the following vec-
tor relation:

                    f(z) = fx^i + fy^j + fzk^ =  (pnn^ + ps^t + pzk^ )ds .                                           (3.41)

At a typical cross section these traction components result in an external torque per unit axial length with respect

to the centroid denoted by mz C , with dimensional units (F-L/)L. The external moment per unit axial length with
respect to centroid is determined from the following vector cross product relation:

                              mC =  [(xsc^i + ysc^j) + (rnn^ + rt^t)]  [pnn^ + ps^t + pzk^ ]ds .                    (3.43)
                                          c

Perform the cross products to find the moment per unit axial length about the centroid from the prescribed trac-
tion to get

                                  mC = mx^i - my^j + [xscfy(z) - yscfx(z) + mz(z)]k^ ,                               (3.44)

where

mx =  y(s)pz(s, z)ds                   my =  x(s)pz(s, z)ds  mz =  [rn(s)ps(s, z) - rt(s)pn(s, z)]ds ,               (3.45)
           c                                      c                     c

      Equation (3.38) is applicable at each end of the bar where z = 0 and z = L. Hence, [N, w] , [Vx, u] , [Vy, v] ,

[Mx, x] , [My, y] , and [Mz, z] are corresponding variables. We can prescribe a "force" variable or its corre-
sponding "displacement" variable as external "loads" acting on the end cross sections, but not both the "force"
and the "displacement" simultaneously.

3.6.1 Differential equilibrium equations

Let the internal forces acting on the cross section at z be denoted by the vector F(z) , and let the internal

moments acting on the cross section resolved at the centroid be denoted by the vector M(z) . These vectors of
internal actions are

                                               F(z) = Vx^i + Vy^j + Nk^ , and                                        (3.46)

3.7 Hooke's law

For a linear elastic, isotropic material, there are two independent material constants: the modulus of elasticity E
and Poisson's ratio . (Refer to eq. (A.146) in the appendix.) Hooke's law for the normal strains is

             ss  1 / E - / E - / E ss

             zz = - / E 1 / E - / E zz ,           (3.62)

                 - / E - / E 1 / E 

where ss denotes the normal stress acting on the s-face, and where  denotes the normal stress on the -face
acting on an infinitesimal element ds-by-dz-by-d. The thickness normal stress  is assumed to be very small
with respect to the axial normal stress zz , and hence is neglected in Hooke's law. From the kinematic assump-
tion, eq. (3.29), the normal strain  = 0 . Setting  =  = 0 in the third row of eq. (3.62), leads to
ss + zz = 0 , which is a very unlikely result. Thus, we neglect this third equation in Hooke's law. Furthermore,
in most thin-walled beam theories (e.g., see Gjelsvik, 1981, p. 16), the normal stress ss is assumed to be small
with respect to the axial normal stress zz and is neglected in Hooke's law. Setting ss =  = 0 leads to

                 zz = Ezz .                        (3.63)

Consequently, the first row of matrix eq. (3.62) leads to ss = -zz / E . However, the kinematic assumption,
eq. (3.29), resulted in ss = 0 . If we set ss = 0 in the first row of eq. (3.62), solve it for ss , followed by sub-
stitution into the second row of eq. (3.62), we get

                 zz     E               
                     =  --------------          .  (3.64)

It is recognized that Hooke's law in the elasticity sense of eq. (3.62) is violated under the assumptions of the thin-
walled beam theory under consideration. In the following developments of the theory, eq. (3.63) is assumed as
the material law governing the axial normal stress and axial normal strain, which is a common assumption in
classical beam theory.

3.7.1 Effect of thermal expansion

Consider structures subject not only to external forces, but also subject to heating. Aerospace examples include
high-speed flight vehicles and orbiting space structures. Aerothermal loads consisting of pressure, skin friction or
shearing stresses, and aerodynamic heating, are exerted on the external surfaces of high-speed flight vehicles.
Conduction and radiant heat transfer result in significant thermally induced forces acting on orbiting space struc-
tures. These aerospace examples are discussed in detail by Thornton (1996), who provides an historical account,
and methods of analysis, of thermal structures for aerospace applications.

     It is assumed that a change in temperature (thermal state) causes a change in deformation and stress
(mechanical state) in the structure, but a change in deformation does not cause a change in temperature. For
example, under adiabatic conditions strain can cause a change in temperature. However, in many structural appli-
cations the change in temperature under adiabatic straining is negligible and can be ignored (Fung, 1965, p. 390).
Thornton (1996, p.51) defines the change in thermal energy state causing a change in mechanical state, but not
the reverse, as one-way thermal-mechanical coupling. Thus, heat conduction and thermoelasticty separate into
two separate problems. In this text it is assumed that the heat conduction problem has been solved so that the

temperature distribution in the structure is known. The thermoelastic problem is to determine the mechanical
state in an elastic structure for the specified temperature distribution and the specified external loads.

For a uniaxial stress state the generalized Hooke's law including temperature is

                      zz = (zz + T) / E      or      zz = Ezz - T ,                                                     (3.65)

where  = E , and  is the coefficient of thermal expansion. The change in temperature is denoted by
T = T - T0 , and T0 is the spatially uniform temperature in the reference state. The reference state is stress free
when the external loads acting on the bar are removed and the spatially uniform temperature T = T0 . Assume a
linear distribution of the change in temperature in the thickness, which we write as

                          T(s, z, ) = T(s, z) + DT(s, z) ,                                                              (3.66)

                      T(s, z) = T(s, z, 0) and DT(s, z) = ---------- .

3.7.2 Material law for extension and bending

Substitute the expression (3.30) for the axial strain, and substitute eq. (3.66) for the change in temperature, into
Hooke's law (3.65) to get the following expression for normal stress.

       zz = E dw + y(s)dx + x(s)dy - T(s, z) + E dx sin (s) + dy cos (s) - DT(s, z) .                                   (3.68)
       dz             dz  dz                     dz         dz

In the thin-wall bar theory we neglect the distribution of the normal stress and normal strain across the
thickness of the wall. Therefore, the normal strain and stress is assumed uniform in the thickness coordinate,
and are given by

                          zz = dw + y(s)dx + x(s)dy , and                                                               (3.69)
                                  dz         dz      dz

                          zz = E dw + y(s)dx + x(s)dy - T(s, z) .                                                       (3.70)
                              dz         dz      dz

In other words, the local bending of the wall represented by the bending moment resultant mzz in (3.36) is
neglected with respect to the membrane stiffness of the wall represented by the normal stress resultant nz. In
addition, for a thin, curved wall we neglect the term  / Rs in the factor (1 +  / Rs) appearing in the integrand of
eq. (3.36)3. The definition of the normal stress resultant reduces to

                                                                                         t/2                            (3.71)

                              nz =  zzd .
                                                                                         -t / 2

Substitute eq. (3.70) for the normal stress into the normal stress resultant (3.71) to get

3. Note that  / Rs  t / (2Rs) . A contour that is a straight line has 1 / Rs = 0 . A thin, curved wall is one in which
   Rs > 10t . Hence, 0  t / (2Rs) < 0.05 for most practical contour geometries.

     The constitutive equation for the axial normal force N is obtained by substituting eq. (3.72) for the normal
stress resultant in the expression (3.39). The result is

                     N = EAdw + EQxdx + EQydy - NT ,                                 (3.73)

where A denotes the cross-sectional area, Qx the first area moment about the x-axis, Qy the first area moment
about the y-axis, and NT(z) the thermal axial force. These geometrical measures of the cross section are given by
the formulas

The first area moments Qx and Qy are equal to zero because the origin of the x-y coordinate system is located at
the centroid. The thermal axial force is given by the expression

                             NT(z) = T(s, z)t(s)ds .                                 (3.75)

     The constitutive equations for the bending moments Mx and My are obtained by substituting eq. (3.72) for

where Ixx, Iyy, and Ixy denote the second area moments of the cross section with respect to the centroidal x-y

The thermal bending moments in eq. (3.76) are given by the expressions

             MxT(z) =  T(s, z)y(s)t(s)ds       MyT(z) =  T(s, z)x(s)t(s)ds .         (3.78)

Since the origin of the x-y system is taken at the centroid of the cross section, the first area moments are zero by
the definition of the centroid. For Qx = Qy = 0 , eqs. (3.73) and (3.76) reduce to

    The contour coordinates with respect the centroid are determined from eqs. (a), (b) and (f). The results are

3.8 Shear flow due to the transverse shear forces

The shear flow q is defined in eq. (3.37) as the definite integral of the shear stress component tangent to the con-
tour zs across the thickness of the wall. In this article the shear flow is determined from axial equilibrium.4 A
free body diagram for axial equilibrium of a differential element with area s-by-z of the middle surface is
shown in figure 3.10. It is assumed that there is no prescribed surface traction acting on the middle surface of the

Fig. 3.10 Free body diagram for axial equilibrium of a differential element of the middle surface

wall in the axial direction. Refer to figure 3.8(a) on page 41. For prescribed traction component pz(s, z) = 0 , it
follows from eq. (3.42) that the axial force per unit length fz = 0 , and from eqs. (3.45) that the bending
moments per unit axial length mx = my = 0 .

Summation of the forces in the z-direction yields

[nz(s*, z + z) - nz(s*, z)]s + [q(s + s, z*) - q(s, z*)]z = 0 .                                         (3.85)

Division by sz followed by taking the limit as s  0 and z  0 yields the partial differential equation

The normal stress resultant nz is given by eq. (3.72) and it is based on the kinematic assumption for the displace-
ments made in article 3.3, infinitesimal deformation, and Hooke's law. The expression for the normal stress
resultant is written as nz = t(s)[Ezz - T] . Substitute eq. (3.82) for the normal strain to get

                      N + NT (Mx + MxT)            (My + MyT)

Take the partial derivative of the normal stress resultant (3.87) with respect to z. In the process of taking the
derivative we eliminate the derivative of the axial force using equilibrium eq. (3.53), and we eliminate the deriv-
ative of the bending moments using equilibrium eqs. (3.55), and (3.57). The final result for the derivative of the
normal stress resultant with respect to z is

   (3.31). This alternative derivation is not used in the theory of thin-walled bars under consideration.

3.8.1 Open cross-sectional contour

From eq. (3.97) the shear flow at the contour origin is q(0, z) = q0(z) . For most open cross sections, there is a
longitudinal edge of the bar that is free of external tractions. If the contour origin is taken at the location of the
free longitudinal edge, then q(0, z) = q0(z) = 0 .The shear flow for an open cross section with the contour ori-

From eq. (k) of example 3.1 x2() = - 0.482906a + a cos  and y2() = 0.36218a + a sin  . Evaluating the
integrals in the first area moments for branch 2 we get

Thus, the first area moments of the cross-sectional area consisting of branch 1 and a segment of branch 2 are

Note that at  =  / 2 both Qx2 = Qy2 = 0 , since the origin of the x-y system is at centroid of the cross sec-
tion(i.e., the first area moments of the entire cross-sectional area about the centroidal coordinate system vanish).

     The first area moment Qx given in eq. (3.93) for the cross-sectional area consisting of branch 1 plus a seg-
ment of branch 2 is computed as

          Qx2 = (- 0.56891 + 0.36218 - cos )a2t - (1.19732)((- 0.241453 - 0.482906 + sin )a2t) .
Combining terms we get

The first area moment Qy given in eq. (3.93) for the cross-sectional area consisting of branch 1 plus a segment of

3.8.2 Location of the shear center for an open cross section

The shear flow given by eq. (3.98) is determined by transverse shear forces Vx and Vy, and is independent of the
torque Mz. For transverse bending the shear flow q is the dominate term in the expression (3.40) for the torque.
Hence, the contribution of the twisting moment resultant mzs and the transverse stress resultant qz are neglected
in eq. (3.40) with respect to the shear flow.5 The torque with respect to the shear center resulting from the shear
flow is then

Expanding eq. (3.99), we get

   article 3.9.

The contribution of the shear forces acting at the shear center to the torque in eq. (3.100) must vanish by the def-
inition of the shear center. Thus,

Equation (3.101) can only be satisfied if

                             rn(s)Qy(s)ds = 0            rn(s)Qx(s)ds = 0 .                               (3.102)

     To locate the shear center relative to the centroid, substitute the expression for the normal coordinate rn(s)
from eq. (3.10) into the preceding geometric properties of the shear center to get

              rn(s)Qy(s)ds =  rnc(s)Qy(s)ds - xsc Qy(s)dydsds + ysc Qy(s)dxdsds = 0 , and                 (3.103)

With the aid of eqs. (3.93), (3.84), (3.81), and (3.77), integrate by parts the following terms in eqs. (3.103) and
(3.104) to find

Substitute the results from eq. (3.105) into eqs. (3.103) and (3.104), and then solve for the coordinates of the
shear center relative to the centroid as

                      xsc = ---k--- rnc(s)Qx(s)ds                   k                                     (3.106)

Note that normal coordinate rnc(s) is computed from the second of eq. (3.11) once the contour coordinates with
respect to the centroid are established.

The Cartesian coordinates of the contour for each branch are given by eqs. (j) and (k) in example 3.1, which are
repeated below:

The results for the coordinates normal to the contour are

The preceding integrals were evaluated in Mathematica to get

Method 2. The shear flow distributions were determined in example 3.2 on page 51 with the results given by eq.
(f) for branch 1 and by eq. (m) for branch 2. These shear flows are illustrated in the left-hand sketch in figure
3.12. It is convenient to determine the resultant of the shear flow distribution at point O first. As shown in figure
3.12 the components of the resultant force are FX and FY , and the torque is Mz0 . Under transverse bending the

contributions of the transverse shear resultant qz and twisting moment resultant mzs are negligible with respect
to the shear flow q in the expressions for the shear forces and the torque6 in eq. (3.40). Hence, the force compo-
nents and the torque are given by the following integrals of the shear flow over the contour.

The line of action of the shear flow in branch 1 is parallel to the Y-direction and so does not contribute to the force
component FX in eq. (b). From example 3.2 substitute eq. (d) for q1 and eq. (h) for q2 into eq. (b) above, then

perform the integrations, to find FX = Vx and FY = Vy . It is expected that the force components would be
equal to their respective transverse shear components, since the shear flows were determined from equilibrium
conditions with respect to the transverse shear forces in article 3.8. Only the shear flow in branch 2 contributes to
the torque about point O, since the line of action of the shear flow in branch 1 passes through point O. The
moment arm to the differential force q2ad in branch 2 about point O is simply the radius a. From example 3.2

substitute eq. (h) for q2 in the expression for the torque in eq. (b) above, and perform the integration to get

     Now add and subtract the shear forces Vx and Vy at the shear center (S.C.) in order to preserve force equiva-
lence as is shown in figure 3.12. The upward force Vy at point O and the downward force Vy at S.C. form a clock-
wise couple XscVy and no net vertical force. Similarly, force Vx at point O and the equal and opposite force Vx at
the S.C. form a counterclockwise couple YscVx and no net horizontal force. The total counterclockwise torque in
the cross section must vanish by the definition of the S.C.; i.e., Mz0 - XscVy + YscVx = 0 . Substitute eq.(c) for
Mz0 in the total torque to get

                 (- 0.128587a + Ysc)Vx + (1.15459a - Xsc)Vy = 0                  (Vx, Vy) .                      (d)

Therefore, the location of the shear center relative to point O is given by

                                       Xsc = 1.15459a       Ysc = 0.128587a .                                    (e)

The coordinates of the shear center relative to the centroid are given by xsc = Xsc - Xc and ysc = Ysc - Yc ,

    as discussed in article 3.9.

where the coordinates of the centroid relative to point O is given by eq. (i) in example 3.1 on page 47. Thus,

xsc = 1.15459a - 0.48290a = 0.67169a  ysc = 0.128587a - (-0.36218a) = 0.490767a ,                               (f)

which is the same result obtained in eq. (a) by method 1.

3.8.3 Notes concerning the shear center

 The resultant of the shear flow distribution over the contour is a force with components Vx and Vy acting
    through the shear center such that there is no torque acting at the shear center. If the cross section is subject to
    a torque, this torque cannot be balanced by the shear flow which, according to eq. (3.98), is uniquely deter-
    mined by the shear forces Vx and Vy.

 The location of the shear center in the cross section is determined by the pattern of the shear flow distribution
    and not on the magnitude of the transverse shear forces.

 Transverse shear forces Vx and Vy act in the plane of loading to equilibrate the externally applied lateral load
    intensities fx(z) and fy(z) . (Refer to equilibrium equations (3.54) and (3.56).) Thus, the line of action of the
    external lateral loads must pass through the shear center to bend the bar without twisting it in torsion.

 The shear center is located on an axis of symmetry of the cross section if there is one. If there are two axes of
    symmetry in the cross section the shear center and the centroid lie on the intersection of the symmetry axes.

 For an open cross section with straight branches and one junction the shear center is at the junction, since the
    torque from the shear flows at the junction vanishes. See figure 3.13.

3.9 Torsion of an open section with a straight contour

Although we have located the shear center for the open cross-sectional contour, a material law for the torque act-
ing at the shear center remains to be determined. Torsion of an open section bar is an important problem in engi-
neering, but it is not a simple problem in elasticity. Saint-Venant (1855) guided by the solution of the bar with a
circular cross section, made a brilliant guess and showed that an exact solution to a well-defined problem can be
obtained. Here, we consider a simplified approach following the presentation given by Vasiliev (1993).

     Consider a prismatic bar with a rectangular cross section subject to equal and opposite torques acting on the
end cross sections at z = 0 and z = L. The lateral surfaces of the bar are traction free so fx = fy = 0 in eq. (3.31)
and mz(z) = 0 in eq. (3.44) on page 41 for 0  z  L . Equilibrium equations (3.53) to (3.57) are identically sat-
isfied when N = Vx = Vy = Mx = My = 0 for 0  z  L , and torsional equilibrium (3.58) is satisfied for a

torque Mz independent of axial coordinate z. Also, there is no change in temperature from the reference state
T = 0 . For a Hookean material the twist per unit length dz / dz is proportional to the torque, and so it is also a
constant with respect to the z-coordinate.

     The contour of a rectangular cross section is a straight horizontal line of length b as shown in figure 3.14.
The angle  = 90 in figure 3.3 for all values of s, and the geometric relations given by eqs. (3.3) to (3.6) and
(3.8) specialize to

    x = -s   y=0  ^t = -^i       n^ = ^j              rt = s     rn = 0     d / ds = 1 / Rs = 0 .

The cross-sectional coordinates are (s, ) with s  [-b / 2, b / 2] and   [-t / 2, t / 2] , and the origin is the
location of the centroid and also of the shear center.

             Fig. 3.14 A bar with rectangular cross section subject to uniform torsion

Displacements and strains. Saint-Venant assumed that as the bar twists the cross section is displaced normal to
the s- plane (i.e., it warps) but its projection on the s- plane rotates as a rigid body. To prevent rigid body dis-
placement, the displacement components of the centroid are set equal to zero. Then, the in-plane displacements
given by eqs. (3.20) and (3.22) reduce to

                                  u(s, z, ) = -sz(z)  us(s, z, ) = z(z) .                          (3.107)
The out-of-plane displacement given by eq. (3.26) is

                  uz(s, z, ) = -sy(z) + [x(z)] .                                                   (3.108)

However, this out-of-plane displacement is changed to account for the warping of the cross section in uniform
torsion. It is assumed that the rotation about the x-axis, or the negative s-axis, is independent of the z-coor-
dinate but is an unknown function of the s-coordinate. Consequently, the out-of-plane displacement in eq.
(3.108) is changed to

                       uz(s, z, ) = x(s) - sy(z) .                                                 (3.109)

     The only non-zero strains determined from the displacements (3.107) and (3.109) are shear strains  zs and
 z , From the strain-displacement relations given by eq. (3.28) these shear strain-displacement relations are

                          dz dx                        z = x - sdz dz .                              (3.110)

Stress resultants and equilibrium The stress resultants associated with these non-zero shear strains (3.110) are
determined from Hooke's law, and the definition of stress resultants q, mzs , and qz in eq. (3.37). The expressions

Furthermore, the longitudinal edges at s = 켦 / 2

The twisting moment resultant msz and the

transverse shear resultant qz are related by moment equilibrium about the s-axis for a differential element ds by

The longitudinal edges at s = 켦 / 2 are free of tractions, which additionally means the twisting moment msz

     The distribution of the twisting moment resultant mzs over the length of the contour for b/t = 20 is shown in
figure 3.16. As shown in the plot the distribution of mzs is symmetric with respect to the contour coordinate,
attains a uniform magnitude over the majority of the contour, and decreases rapidly to zero near the boundaries of
the contour where s = 켦 / 2 . The distribution of the transverse shear resultant qz over the contour is shown in
figure 3.17. The distribution of qz is antisymmetric with respect to the contour coordinate, it is essentially equal
to zero over the majority of the contour, and its maximum magnitude occurs in the narrow boundaries of the con-
tour at s = 켦 / 2 .

3.9.1 Torsion of built-up open sections

For large values of the ratio of b/t, the analysis of thin-walled rectangular section of article 3.9 results in the fol-
lowing formulas given by eqs (3.121), (3.123), and (3.125):

                                      d z        bt3                      d z                                             (3.128)

The maximum magnitude of the shear stress zs occurs at  = 켾 / 2 . Then from the previous equations for
large values of the ratio of b/t this maximum shear stress can be expressed as

                                                        3Mz                                                               (3.129)

          Fig. 3.19 Some thin-walled open sections and their torsion constants

ing the torsional response of these bars with complex, open cross-sectional shapes is facilitated by an analogy to
the response of an initially flat membrane supported on its edges over an opening, where the edges of the opening
are in the same shape as the cross section. The membrane is stretched under a uniform tension, and then subject
to an internal pressure to cause the membrane to deflect. The deflected shape of this pressurized membrane is
analogous to the torsion problem in that level contours on the surface of the deflected membrane coincide with
the lines of action of the shear stresses, and that the slope of the membrane normal to the level contour is propor-
tional to the magnitude to the shear stress. Also, the volume between the x-y plane and the deflected surface of

the membrane is proportional to the total torque carried by the section. The following text excerpted from Oden
and Ripperger (1981, p. 46) summarizes this analogy.

    This analogy was first discovered by Ludwig Prandtl in 1903 and is known as Prandtl's membrane analogy.
    Prandtl took full advantage of the analogy and devised clever experiments with membranes. By measuring
    the volumes under membranes formed by a soap film subject to a known pressure, he was able to evaluate
    torsional constants. By obtaining the contour lines of the membranes he determined stress distributions.

Torsional constants and the maximum shearing stress can be found for complex cross sections by using the
results for the thin-walled rectangular section. The membrane analogy shows that the torsional load carrying
capacity of the complex open section is nearly the same as the narrow rectangular section, because the volumes
under the membranes are nearly the same if we neglect the small error introduced at the corners or junctions. In
this way, the membrane analogy implies that the complex open cross section has about the same torsional load
carrying capacity as a thin-walled rectangular section with a length equal to the total arc length of the contour of
the complex section.

     Since each branch of the open section is equivalent to a narrow rectangular section with the same developed
length and thickness, we can sum the torques carried by each branch in the following way

                                                             d z                    d z

Note that the twist per unit length is the same for all branches in the open section, because the cross section is
assumed to be rigid in its own plane. The use of eq. (3.131) for several open sections is shown in figure 3.19.
Starting from eq. (3.129), the maximum shear stress in the ith branch of the section is given by

              3Mzi 3GJi dz 3G  1 3  Mz Mzti
              (zs ) = ----------- = ----------- ------- = -------- --biti ------ = --------- .  (3.132)

                                ii

That is, the maximum shear stress in the ith branch of the open section is the total torque divided by the torsion
constant for the entire section times the thickness of the ith branch. Note that the largest shear stress magnitude in
a built-up open section occurs in the thickest branch.

3.10 Inclusion of stringers in the analysis of the cross section

A stringer is a longitudinal flange element connecting thin skins or webs in aerospace structures, and the cross-
sectional area of the flange is denoted by Af . Over the cross-sectional area of the flange it is assumed that

 the longitudinal normal stress zz is uniformly distributed, and
 the shear stresses zs = z = 0 .
That is, the stringer is a longitudinal bar element that does not resist shear. It is modeled as a point on the contour

with coordinates [xf(sf), yf(sf)] relative to the centroid, where the contour coordinate of the stringer is denoted
by sf . Thus, the stringer is mathematically represented as a point on the contour having the attribute of area. See
figure 3.20.

     The area and first area moments given by eq. (3.74) are modified to account for the cross section with string-
ers as

Note that first area moments about the centroid are required to satisfy Qx = Qy = 0 . The second area moments
about the centroid in eq. (3.77) are modified to

Equation (3.141) is valid for every choice of the shear actions (Vx + VxT) and (Vy + VyT) . Then to satisfy eq.
(3.141), the coefficients of the shear actions must vanish, which leads to

                          Qy(sf(+)) - Qy(sf(-)) - Afxf = 0                               Qx(sf(+)) - Qx(sf(-)) - Afyf = 0 .                                                                  (3.142)

                                                                                          f                        f                                         f                   f

After substituting the relations (3.143) into eq. (3.142) we get

                          Qy(sf(+)) - Qy(sf(-)) - Afxf = 0                               Qx(sf(+)) - Qx(sf(-)) - Afyf = 0 .                                                                  (3.144)

Consider a single-cell, closed cross-sectional contour as shown in figure 3.21. The shear flow acting tangent to
the contour is given by eq. (3.97) on page 51, where we assume the shear flow from the prescribed change in
temperature vanishes. (Refer to the discussion in the paragraph preceding eq. (3.97).) Then the shear flow is
given by

equivalence with respect to the shear center given by eq. (3.40) on page 40 reduces to

(It is assumed that the transverse shear resultant qz and the twisting moment resultant mzs are small with respect

to the shear flow, and therefore are neglected in eq. (3.40).) The shear flow formula (3.145) is the sum of the open

section shear flow, eq. (3.98), plus a shear flow q0 that is the spatially uniform around the contour. If (3.145) is

substituted for the shear flow in the two expressions for the shear forces in (3.146), it can be shown7 that we get

identities Vx = Vx and Vy = Vy . That is, the shear flow (3.145) is statically equivalent to the shear forces Vx

and Vy. independent of q0. If we substitute the shear flow (3.145) into the expression for the torque in eq. (3.146),

then the shear flow q0 can be determined from the torque acting at the shear center. However, the location of the

shear center is not known.

     Since the location of the centroid is determined before the location of the shear center, consider the torque

from the shear flow resolved at the centroid. That is MzC =  rnc(s)q(s)ds . The coordinate normal to the con-

We have used all the conditions of static equivalence to determine the shear flow. with respect to the centroid.
Thus, it is a statically indeterminate problem to find the expression for shear flow relative to the shear center, as
well as the location of the shear center in the cross section. The additional relation we need is a constitutive rela-

tion between the twist per unit length dz / dz and the shear flow q.

Hooke's law relates the shear strain to the shear stress by  zs = zs / G , where G is the shear modulus of the
material. In torsion of a closed cross-sectional contour the shear stress is assumed uniform through the thickness
of the wall. Hence, the shear stress is determined by the shear flow divided by the thickness of the wall, or
zs = q / t . Substitute  zs = q / (Gt) into the equation for the twist per unit length to get.

force Vy at S.C. form a clockwise couple xscVy and no net vertical force. Similarly, rightward force Vx at point C
and the leftward force Vx at the S.C. form a counterclockwise couple yscVx and no net horizontal force. The total
counterclockwise torque in the cross section is Mzc - xscVy + yscVx . Formulating these couples leave forces Vx

At the shear center the twist per unit length depends on the torque resolved at the shear center and not on the

A uniform bar of length L with a closed, cross-sectional contour is stiffened by four axial stringers. The configu-
ration and the associated nomenclature is shown in figure 3.24(a), where the X-axis is an axis of symmetry. The
areas of the stringer flanges are denoted by Af1 and Af2, and the wall thickness t is uniform along the entire con-
tour. As shown in figure 3.24(b), the contour is divided into four branches. Branch 1 is a semicircle segment of
radius a between the lower stringer Af1 and the upper stringer Af1 of length a, branch 2 is the horizontal segment
between upper stringer Af1 and upper stringer Af2 of length b, branch 3 is the vertical segment between the upper
stringer Af2 and the lower stringer Af2 of length 2a, and branch 4 is the horizontal segment between lower stringer
Af2 and lower stringer Af1 of length b. Dimensional data are

    The area A of the cross section is given by

                                                                4 (si)max

Since the cross section is symmetric about the X-axis, the centroid is located on this axis of symmetry. To locate
the centroid we only need to compute the first area moment about the Y-axis. The first area moment QY is given
by

                               4 (si)max

      QY =   Xi(si)tdsi + X1(0)Af1 + X2(0)Af1 + X3(0)Af2 + X4(0)Af2 = 11.7884 in.3 . (b)
                             i=1 0

The centroid coordinate is Xc = QY / A = 3.52367 in. , and by symmetry Yc = 0 . The Cartesian coordinates x
and y with origin at the centroid are related to coordinates X and Y by

              xi(si) = Xi(si) - Xc and yi(si) = Yi(si) - Yc = Yi(si) , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 .  (c)

From eq. (3.77) the second area moment about the x- and y-axes are given by

                            4 (si)max

     Ixx =   yi2(si)tdsi + y12(0)Af1 + y22(0)Af1 + y32(0)Af2 + y42(0)Af2 = 101.619 in.4 , and (d)
                          i=1 0

                                4 (si)max

       Iyy =   xi2(si)tdsi + x12(0)Af1 + x22(0)Af1 + x32(0)Af2 + x42(0)Af2 = 62.8491 in.4 . (e)
                             i=1 0

The product area moment Ixy = 0 since the x-axis is an axis of symmetry of the cross-sectional area.

Solution to part (b). The first area moments about the x-axis for segments of each branch including stringers
are

As a check on the computation we evaluate Qx4(7) to find Qx4(7) = -2.210-16  0 . The value of Qx4(7)
equals the first area moment about the x-axis through the centroid of the entire cross section, which vanishes by
the definition of the centroid. The first area moments about the y-axis for segments of each branch including
stringers are

                                                           0

We evaluate Qy4(7) to find Qy4(7) = -1.610-15  0 , which is as expected for a correct computation of the
first area moment functions Qyi(si) , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 . From eq. (3.11) on page 34, the results for the normal coor-
dinate functions with respect to the centroid for each branch are

rnc1 = 6 + 3.347633 sin (s1 / 6)     rnc2 = 6                  rnc3 = 3.52367 = Xc               rnc4 = 6 .  (m)

The area enclosed by the contour is

                                                                            4 (si)max

                                                                         i=1 0

Since the product area moment Ixy = 0 , eq. (3.81) gives nx = 0 , ny = 0 , and k = 1 . Moreover, from eq.

(3.93) we find Qx(s) = Qx(s) and Qy(s) = Qy(s) . Thus, the expressions for the shear flow distribution func-
tions Fxc(s) and Fyc(s) in eq. (3.151) simplify. For each branch the shear flow distribution functions are given
by

This result for ysc is expected since the shear center lies on an axis of symmetry, and the x-axis is the axis of
symmetry for the cross section. From eq. (3.164) the shear flow distribution functions with respect to the shear
center are Fxi(si) = Fxci(si) .

     We record below for later use the remaining shear flow distribution functions with respect to the shear center,
which are determined from eq. (3.164).

CHAPTER 4  Some aspects of the
           structural analysis

The thin-wall bar theory presented in chapter 3 accounts for the deformations due to extension, bending, trans-
verse shear, and torsion/twist. The inclusion of transverse shear strains is usually referred to as a Timoshenko bar
theory. A summary of some of the equations from the theory is presented in article 4.1

     The von Mises criterion for yielding of a ductile metal under a combined stress state is reviewed in article
4.2. The permissible limits of the loads that prevent permanent deformation of the bar are determined by imple-
menting the yield criterion.

     In article 4.3 we present examples to determine the axial displacement, axial normal strain, and axial normal
stress, which include the following topics:

 shear force and bending moment diagrams for distributed loads acting on a wing and a ship,
 the composite area technique to compute properties of plane areas,
 for a bar with a zee cross section, we determine the neutral axis of the cross section for the section subject to

    bending, the normal stress distribution, and the displacements due to pure bending and transverse bending.

     In article 4.4 the shear stresses are determined for several examples, including:

 an open cross-sectional contour and a closed cross-sectional contour subject to a transverse shear force and a
    torque,

 comparison of an open section and equivalent closed section subject to torsion,
 resultant of a uniform shear flow and Bredt's formula,
 torsion of cross sections composed of two and three cells, and
 transverse bending of a bar with a two-cell cross section.

4.1 Review of the thin-wall bar theory

A straight bar is referenced to the Cartesian coordinate system x-y-z, with the z-axis coinciding with the longitu-
dinal axis of the bar. In the x-y plane the cross section is described by the contour and the thickness of the wall
normal to the contour. The contour is a piece-wise continuous curve in the x-y plane whose subdivisions are
called branches, and the tangent to the contour is continuous within a branch. The origin of the x-y system in the
cross section is at the centroid, which is the point labeled C in figure 4.1. In the bar theory the dependent vari-
ables acting at the centroid the cross section of the bar are [w(z), N(z)] , [x(z), Mx(z)] , and [y(z), My(z)] .
The axial displacement of the centroid is denoted by w and its corresponding axial force is denoted by N, the
rotation of the cross section about the x-axis is denoted by x and its corresponding bending moment is denoted
by Mx , and the rotation about the negative y-axis is denoted by y and its corresponding bending moment is
denoted by My . The shear center of the cross section is labeled S.C. in figure 4.1, and the dependent variables
acting at the shear center are [u(z), Vx(z)] , [v(z), Vy(z)] , and [z(z), Mz(z)] . The x-direction displacement of
the shear center is denoted by u and its corresponding force by Vx , the y-direction displacement of the shear
center is denoted by v and its corresponding force by Vy , and the twist of the cross section is denoted by z and
its associated torque by Mz .

4.1.1 Extension and bending

Hooke's law for extension and bending of the bar is defined relative to the centroid. From eq. (3.80) on page 47
the compliance form of Hooke's law is

             dw / dz  1                     1/A 0  0                    N + NT

Geometric properties of the cross section are its area A, its first area moments Qx and Qy , and its second area

78                                                                                 Aerospace Structures
                                                                                   Review of the thin-wall bar theory

moments Ixx, Iyy, and Ixy . In eq. (4.1) the modulus of elasticity of the material is denoted by E. The locus of
points on the contour is expressed parametrically by the equations x(s) and y(s) , where the arc-length of the
contrary is denoted by s. Let t(s) denote the thickness of the contour. See Fig. 4.1. The area and first area
moments are given by

A =  t(s)ds Qx = y(s)t(s)ds = 0 Qy = x(s)t(s)ds = 0 . (4.2)
                      c                  c                               c

First area moments Qx and Qy vanish since origin of the x-y-axes is located at the centroid of the cross section.
Hence, the definition of the centroid allows decoupling of the extension and bending responses of the bar. That is,
the axial strain dw / dz is independent of the bending moments Mx and My , and bending rotation gradients
dx / dz , and dy / dz are independent of axial force N . The second area moments are given by,

Ixx =  y2(s)t(s)ds Iyy =  x2(s)t(s)ds Ixy =  x(s)y(s)t(s)ds . (4.3)

The dimensionless parameters are defined by

The thermal loads NT , MxT , and MyT appearing in eq. (4.1) are from the prescribed change in temperature from
the reference state. Refer to eqs. (3.75), and (3.78) on page 46.

4.1.2 Shear stresses in open and closed sections

The location of the shear center and the equation for the shear stress depend on whether the cross-sectional con-
tour is open or closed.

Open cross-sectional contour The coordinates of the shear center with respect to the centroid for an open
cross-sectional contour are given by

             xsc = ---k--- rnc(s)Qx(s)ds                      k
             Ixx                                     ysc = ----- rnc(s)Qy(s)ds .
                                                          Iyy                                                  (4.8)

             c                                               c

In eq. (4.8) the functions denoted by Qx(s) and Qy(s) are called distribution functions. The equations for the
distribution functions are

             s                                            s

             Qx(s) =  [y(s)t(s)]ds Qy(s) =  [x(s)t(s)]ds . (4.9)

             0                                            0

In eq. (4.8) the coordinate normal to the contour with respect to the centroid is denoted by rnc(s) . Coordinate
rnc(s) is shown in figure 3.3(b) on page 33, which is given by

                   rnc(s) = x(s)dyds - y(s)dxds .                                                          (4.10)

Also shown in figure 3.3(b) is the coordinate normal to the contour with respect to the shear center which is
denoted by rn(s) . It is given by

                   rn(s) = rnc(s) - xscdyds + yscdxds .                                                    (4.11)

The shear stress zs for an open cross-sectional contour consists of the sum of two terms, and it is given by

                q(s, z) Mz(z)                        -t / 2    t / 2 .
             zs = --------------- + 2-------------                                                         (4.12)
                   t(s)       J

where the shear flow is denoted by q(s, z) , the torsion constant by J, and the thickness coordinate by . The
shear flow for an open section is related to the distribution functions and the shear forces by

                         k                           k
             q(s, z) = - ----- Q(s)Vx(z) - ----- Qx(s)Vy(z) .                                              (4.13)
                         Iyy                         Ixx

The first term on the right-hand side of eq. (4.12) is the shear stress component that varies with the contour coor-
dinate s, but it is independent of the thickness coordinate . The second term on the right-hand side of eq. (4.12)
is a linear function of the thickness coordinate , but it is independent of the contour coordinate s in a branch of
the cross section where the torsion constant is spatially uniform. The torsion constant is derived in article 3.9 on
page 57 and in article 3.9.1. For thin-wall bars it is given by

80                                                                                Aerospace Structures

Closed cross-sectional contour. We begin with the shear flow given by eq. (3.145) on page 67, which is
repeated below as eq. (4.15).

                                                            k                       k
                         q(s, z) = q0(z) - ----- VxQy(s) - ----- VyQx(s) .                                                       (4.15)
                                                            Iyy                     Ixx

The shear flow q0(z) is spatially uniform around the contour, and it is determined from

                                          Mzc = 컍nc(s)q(s)ds ,                                                                  (4.16)

where the torque with respect to the centroid is denoted by Mzc . Substitute eq. (4.15) for the shear flow into eq.

(4.16) and solve for q0(z) . The shear flow with respect to the centroid is expressed as

                                    Mzc(z)                                                                                       (4.17)
                      qC(s, z) = ---------------- - Fxc(s)Vx(z) - Fyc(s)Vy(z) ,

                                      2Ac

where Ac is the area enclosed by the contour, and functions Fxc(s) and Fyc(s) account for the distribution of
the shear flow due to the transverse shear forces. It is tacitly implied that the torque Mzc and shear forces Vx and
Vy are resolved at the centroid in the derivation of the shear flow given by eq. (4.17). Then the area enclosed by
the contour is given by

                             Ac = 1-2- rnc(s)ds .                                                                               (4.18)

The shear flow distribution functions relative to the centroid appearing in eq. (4.17) are defined by

k                     1                                                                  k                       1

The twist per unit longitudinal length due to torsion for a closed cell is derived in article 3.11.1 on page 68. It is
an important equation and is given by

where the shear modulus of the material is denoted by G. From figure 3.23 on page 69, the torque at the shear
center is related to the torque at the centroid and the shear forces acting at the shear center by

                                          Mz = Mzc - xscVy + yscVx .                                                             (4.21)

ment means the coefficients of the shear forces in eq. (4.22) must vanish. Hence, the location of the shear center
with respect to the centroid is

The shear stress for a closed cross-sectional contour is given by zs = q(s, z) / t(s) . Note that the shear stress is
uniform through the thickness of the wall but is a function of the contour coordinate.

Hooke's law for transverse shear and torsion is defined relative to the shear center. From eq. (5.76) on page 144

The shear flow functions defined relative to the shear center result in a decoupling of the transverse shear and tor-

sional responses of the bar as shown in eq. (4.27). That is, the shear strains are independent of the torque, and the

twist per unit length is independent of the shear forces. For an open section the torsion constant is given by eq.

(4.14) and for a single-cell, closed section GJ is given by eq. (4.24).

4.2 Yield criteria

From "Airplane design requirements" on page 14: All parts of the airplane are                      yield zz
designed so they are not stressed beyond the yield point at the limit load fac-
tor. That is, there shall be no permanent deformation of the structure on

removal of the loads. We first consider yielding of the material in uniaxial ten-

sion, and then discuss yield criteria for combined stress states.

     The yield point, or yield strength, of a material is determined from mate-                              EE
rial characterization tests performed on standard specimens under simple
loading situations as specified by the American Society of Testing Methods                         11
(ASTM). The standard governing the tensile test of ductile metals is ASTM                                                   zz

                                                                                                   0 0.002       yield

of an aluminum alloy is depicted in figure 4.3. There is an initial linear elastic

region whose slope is the modulus of elasticity E. Following the linear portion, the slope of the stress-strain curve

continuously decreases until a relative maximum engineering stress occurs deep into the response regime where

plastic deformation is dominant. For such material behavior we define an offset yield stress. A straight line is

drawn parallel to the linear elastic portion of the stress-strain curve starting from a strain zz = 0.2 = 0.002 on

the strain axis. The stress at the intersection of this straight line with the stress-strain curve is defined to be the

yield strength yield of the material. Note that the strain of 0.002, or 0.2 percent (percent strain is defined as

100zz ), is plastic strain, since unloading the specimen from the point (yield, yield) on the stress strain-curve

would follow the straight dashed line in figure 4.3 and the strain of 0.002 would not be recovered. However, a
permanent strain of 0.2 percent is not considered detrimental for most structural components, and the 0.2 percent
offset yield strength has the advantage of being a precisely defined quantity. The offset yield stress is generally
the most satisfactory means of defining the yielding event for engineering materials. Metals usually break in ten-

sion by the shear stresses acting on planes at 45 with respect to the tension axis.

     Aircraft structural components modeled as thin-walled bars are not only subject to tension, but also com-
pression, bending, and torsion, or a combination of these. Consequently, the material is subject to a combined
state of stress. For straight bars with thin-walled cross sections, the dominant stress components are shown in fig-
ure 4.2. These stress components acting on the cross section are directly related to the axial normal force, bend-
ing moments, transverse shear forces, and the torque as detailed in article 4.1.

     The maximum shear stress criterion and the von Mises criterion were developed to predict yielding for com-
bined stress states in ductile metals (Dowling, 1993). We use von Mises criterion since it compares favorably to
test results (Dowling, p. 252) and it is easy to program. The von Mises criterion is based on the shear stress acting
on octahedral planes, and it is alternatively called the octahedral shear stress yield criterion. The formula for the
von Mises effective stress in thin-walled bar theory is

             Mises =                        2    +  3  z2s  .  (4.31)

                                              z

If Mises < yield , then there is no yielding of a ductile metal under a combined stress state, where yield is deter-
mined in the uniaxial tension test. At the initiation of yielding Mises = yield .

     Criteria for failure initiation in modes other than yielding are also formulated in terms of stresses. Examples
of stressed-based criteria for failure initiation in fiber-reinforced polymer composites are presented in chapter 9,
and the criteria for the initiation crack propagation are presented in chapter 13.

4.3 Structural analyses for extension and flexure

4.3.1 Bending moment diagrams

To determine the axial normal stress distribution in bars subject to lateral loading, we have to first find the distri-
bution of the bending moment. Analyses are presented for a cantilever wing and barge in still water. Airplanes
and ships can be regarded as vehicles moving in different mediums, the air or water. In this regard, the study of
buoyancy distribution acting on ship structures is instructive in determining the distribution of the bending
moment in the hull.

Example 4.1  Cantilever wing with tip tank

Consider the cantilever wing with tip tank as shown in figure 4.4. Given the weight of the tip tank and its con-
tents W, the distance e of the weight W from the wing tip, the wing span L, and the value of the distributed load
intensity fr at the wing root, determine the shear force and bending moment along the span.

The shear force equals zero at z / L = 0.315 , which corresponds to z = 45.3557 in. . At z = 45.3557 in. the
bending moment exhibits a horizontal slope. Thus, the bending moment is a relative maximum at

Solution to part (a). Vertical equilibrium of the entire barge requires that the buoyant upthrust equals 40 kN, so
that fb = 2 KN/m . The total distributed load intensity is the difference between fb and the magnitude of the
downward acting applied loading intensity. The point force of 10 kN acting at z = 10 m is shown schematically in
the fy(z) -diagram as a downward pointing arrow. Actually, fy  - as z  10 m , because a point force is a
finite load acting over zero length. Point forces are idealizations to actual loads and introduce discontinuities in
the mathematical descriptions of some of the dependent variables.

     A semigraphical method is used to sketch the shear force and bending moment diagrams. In this approach
we first sketch the distributive load fy(z) (F/L), then the shear force Vy(z) , and finally the bending moment
Mx(z) . The differential equilibrium equations governing the shear force and the bending moment are eqs. (3.54)
and (3.55) on page 43. These equations are repeated in eq. (a) below.

The prescribed external moment intensity mx = 0 (F-L/L) in this example. From eq. (a) we note that the slope
of shear diagram at z is the negative of the distributed load intensity at z, and that the slope of the moment dia-
gram at z is the shear force at z. Integrate eq (a) with respect to z from z = z1 to z = z2 to get

Equation (b) is interpreted in a graphical sense to mean that the difference in the shear force between z2 and z1 is
the negative of the area under the distributed loading diagram from z1 to z2, and the difference in the bending

moment between z2 and z1 is the area under the shear force diagram from z1 to z2. These are not geometrical
areas. The area between the fy(z) curve and the z-axis has units of force, and may be positive, zero, or negative.

by the water pressure is small and can be neglected. As the infinitesimal distance   0 , the distributed loading
acting at each end vanishes. In the limit we get the equilibrium conditions

Vy(0) = 0             Mx(0) = 0 , and Vy(20) = 0                                Mx(20) = 0 .                  (c)

From eq. (c) the shear force diagram begins at zero, and the slope       Fig. 4.9 Jump        V y ( 10 - )    10kN
dVy / dz at z = 0 is equal to 1 kN/m. The slope is constant between      in the shear                          V y ( 10 + )
0 < z < 5m , thus Vy(z) is a straight line in this range of z. The dif-  force.

ference in the shear force between z = 5 m and z = 0 is equal to the                                        

negative of the area under the fy(z) curve, which is 5 kN. Thus

Vy(5) = 5 kN since Vy(0) = 0. At z = 5+ m the loading intensity jumps to +2 kN/m. The slope of the shear force

jumps from 1 kN/m to -2 kN/m at z = 5m, but the shear force is itself continuous. The difference Vy(10) - Vy(5)

is equal to the negative of the area between the fy(z) -curve and the z-axis between z = 5 m and z = 10 m. Thus

Vy(10) - Vy(5) = -10 kN, so Vy(10) = -5 kN. Note the shear force is zero at z = 7.5 m. At z = 10 m the point force

of 10 kN acts. As shown in figure 4.9, vertical equilibrium at z = 10 m yields at jump in the shear force Vy(10+) -

Vy(10-) = 10 kN, so that Vy(10+) = 5 kN. The slope of the shear at z = 10 m is +2 kN/m, and remains constant

until z = 15 m. The difference Vy(15) - Vy(10+) = -10 kN, so that Vy(15) = -5 kN. Finally, the slope changes to

+1 kN/m at z = 15+ m and remains constant in the range 15 < z < 20. The difference Vy(20) - Vy(15) = 5 kN, so

that Vy(20) = 0. The shear force equal to zero at z = 20 m is expected from the result in eq. (c). The shear force

diagram is drawn below the loading intensity diagram in figure 4.10.

     From eq. (c) the bending moment at z = 0 equals zero, and its slope z = 0 is equal to zero since the shear

force is zero at z = 0. The slope dMx / dz of the moment diagram increases linearly from zero at z = 0 to the 5 kN,

which is the value of the shear force at z = 5 m. The difference Mx(5) - Mx(0) is equal to the area under shear dia-
gram from z = 0 to z = 5 m. Hence, Mx(5) - Mx(0) = 12.5 kNm, and Mx(5) = 12.5 kNm since Mx(0) = 0. From z =
5 to z = 7.5 the slope of the moment decreases from 5 kN to zero. At z = 7.5, Mx is a local maximum with a mag-
nitude of 18.75 kNm. The slope of Mx(z) for 7.5 < z < 10 is negative, decreasing linearly from zero to -5 kN. The
difference Mx(10) - Mx(7.5) = -6.25 kNm, so that Mx(10) = 12.50 kNm. The slope of Mx(z) at z = 10 m jumps
from a -5 kN to +5 kN as shown in figure 4.10, but the moment itself is continuous. That is, the bending moment
exhibits a cusp at z = 10 m. The bending moment diagram in the range 10 < z < 20 is completed in a manner sim-
ilar to the description of its construction in the range 0 < z < 10. In this example the shear force diagram is anti-

Solution part (b). Let us assume an open cross section of the barge is as shown in figure 4.11. The thickness of
the three branches is 5 mm, and the section is symmetric about the y-axis so the product area moment Ixy = 0 .

From (4.4) the cross-sectional coefficients nx = ny = 0 , k = 1 , and y = y . At z = 7.5 m the shear force is
equal to zero and the bending moment has a maximum value of 18.75 kNm. Hence, the shear stress zs = 0 and
the axial normal stress (4.6) is given by

4.3.2 Buoyancy force distribution on ships

The simple uniform buoyancy distribution acting on the barge in example 4.2 is an exception to the buoyancy
distributions found in practice. It is true that equilibrium requires the total buoyant upthrust to equal the weight of
the ship and its contents. However, the distribution of the buoyancy and weight along the length of the ship is not
necessarily the same. The difference in the magnitudes of the buoyancy and weight distribution intensities is the
applied load intensity fy(z) . In ship design three conditions are recognized to compute fy(z) for the same ship.
These conditions are called

 the still water condition,

 the sagging condition, and

 the hogging condition.

     A more detailed account of these conditions on the longitudinal bending of the ship is given by Muckle
(1967) and Zubaly (1996), and here we only summarize the basic ideas.

A ship in still water is shown in figure 4.12, and a section A-A between z and z + dz is also shown.

z                                                                                           Section A-A

Archimedes's principle asserts that the buoyant upthrust is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Let A(z)
denote the submerged cross section at z, and let  denote the specific weight (force per volume) of the fluid. The
differential buoyancy force dFb acting on the ship over a differential length dz is

                                  dFb = A(z)dz .                                                          (4.32)

Consequently, the buoyant upthrust per unit ship length, which we designate fb , is equal to A(z); i.e.,

                                                                                                                                  z

requires the area under these curves to have the same magnitude. If the submerged cross section is uniform in z,
as is the case for the barge in example 4.2, the distribution of the buoyancy per unit length fb is a constant.

     At sea a ship is subject to waves, and this alters the buoyancy distribution. For longitudinal bending of the
ship two extreme static conditions are assumed: sagging and hogging. In each condition, the length of the wave is
assumed to be the length of the ship. This is an "accepted" assumption for the worst buoyancy distribution caus-
ing the most severe bending of the ship.

     The sagging condition is shown in figure 4.14(a). The wave crests are at the bow and stern, and the wave
trough is amidships. A schematic of the buoyancy per unit length is shown below the ship in figure 4.14(a). The
immersed cross section is the largest at or near the wave crests, and is least near the trough. The intensity of the
buoyancy distribution reflects this. In this condition the deck sags and is in compression while the bottom is in
tension. The worst location to concentrate the cargo in the ship is amidships, as this will result in the largest
bending moment.

     The hogging condition is depicted in figure 4.14(b). Here the wave troughs are at bow and stern, and the
crest is amidships. The immersed cross section is greatest near amidships and is least near bow and stern. The
distribution of the buoyancy per unit length fb , shown in figure 4.14(b), reflects this situation. In hogging the
deck is in tension and the bottom is in compression. The worst possible locations to concentrate cargo is fore and
aft, as this will produce the greatest bending moment in the ship.

4.3.3 Properties of plane areas

First and second area moments of the cross-sectional area need to be determined before evaluating eq. (4.6) for
the normal stress. Analytical procedures were used in Example 3.1 on page 47 to compute first and second area
moments for a thin-walled bar. Frequently, the composite area technique in conjunction with the parallel axis the-
orem are used to determine these geometric properties.

Parallel axis theorem. Consider two parallel axes systems in the cross section. The origin of the Cartesian axes
x and y coincide with the centroid of the cross-sectional area, which is labeled C in figure 4.15. The second Car-
tesian system X and Y has its origin at an arbitrary point O, the X -axis is parallel to the x-axis, and the Y -axis is
parallel to the y-axis. The location of the centroid in the X and X system is denoted by coordinate values
(Xc, Yc) . Usually the X and Y system is selected as something convenient to start with, and the first and second
area moments with respect to the X and Y system are computed or looked up in tables. Then the (Xc, Yc) coor-
dinates of the centroid are computed and the parallel axis theorem is used to find the second area moments in the
x and y system.

                         y                              For a thin-walled bar the area element is dA = t(s)ds , in
                                                        which s denotes the arc-length along the contour c, and t(s)
       Y                                                denotes the thickness of the wall. In general, the thickness
                                                        may vary smoothly with arc-length, but its magnitude must

                                                        cross section. An abrupt change in thickness is modeled by a
       t(s)                                             step change in thickness at a junction. The area of the cross

The relationship between the two parallel coordinate systems is determined from the location of a generic point s
on the contour in each system. This relationship is

                                      X(s) = XC + x(s)  Y(s) = YC + y(s) .                 (4.36)
If eq. (4.36) is substituted into eq. (4.35), we get

                            QX = YCA + Qx               QY = XCA + Qy .                    (4.37)

where

                            Qx = y(s)t(s)ds             Qy = x(s)t(s)ds .                  (4.38)

Since the origin of the x and y system is at the centroid, the first moments Qx and Qy are zero by definition. Set-
ting Qx = 0 and Qy = 0 in eq. (4.37), we can solve to find the location of the centroid as

      In the X and Y coordinate system the second area moments are defined by

                                  IXX =  Y2tds        IYY =  X2tds                 IXY = XYtds .                      (4.40)

Second area moments are often called moments of inertia in analogy to moments of inertia of mass elements
used in rigid body dynamics. The fact that eq. (4.40) is second moments of area elements and not mass elements
should be kept in mind even if the terminology "moments of inertia" is used in the context of beam bending. Now

substitute eq. (4.36) for the X and Y coordinates into eq. (4.40) to get

          IXX  =  Y2   A  +  2YCQx   +  Ixx       IYY = XC2 A + 2XCQy + Iyy        IXY = XCYCA + XCQx + YCQy + Ixy ,  (4.41)

                    C

where the second area moments with respect to the centroid are given by

                                     Ixx =  y2tds     Iyy =  x2tds                 Ixy = xytds .                      (4.42)
                                                c                c                            c

Since the origin of the x and y coordinates is at the centroid Qx = Qy = 0 , and eq. (4.41) reduces to

                             IXX  =  Y2   A  +  Ixx   IYY  =       X2   A  +  Iyy  IXY = XCYC A + Ixy .               (4.43)

Equation (4.41) is the generalized parallel axis theorem, but in problem solving we usually use eq. (4.39) to
locate the centroid and then the parallel axis theorem reduces to the use of eq. (4.43). Note that eq. (4.42) shows
that Ixx and Iyy for real areas are always positive in value with dimensional units of L4. The product area

moment Ixy can be positive, zero, or negative in value. The product area moment Ixy is zero if either the x -axis
or y-axis is an axis of symmetry of the cross section.

Radii of gyration. Define radii of gyration by

                                                  rxx = Ixx / A            ryy = Iyy / A .                            (4.44)

The radii of gyration (4.44) have dimensional units of length. However, the radii of gyration do not locate a phys-

ically significant point in the cross section. For example, rXX  Yc + rxx , where rXX it the radius of gyration with

respect to the X -axis. (Using the parallel axis theorem, the relation between the radius of gyration about the X -

axis  to  the  x-axis  is    r2   =  Y2   +  r2   .)

Composite area technique. The composite area technique for computing the centroid and second area
moments is a method applicable to cross-sectional areas that can be subdivided into simple geometric shapes
whose properties are known. An entire area A is subdivided into N sub-areas Ai , i = 1, 2, ..., N as shown in fig-
ure 4.16(a). Known properties of the i-th sub-area are its centroid denoted by Ci , and Ai, (Ixx)i, (Iyy)i, (Ixy)i .
Sub-area coordinate axes are denoted by (xi, yt) with origin at Ci . Reference axes are denoted by (X, Y) with
origin at point O. The xi-axis is parallel to the X-axis, and the yi-axis is parallel to the Y-axis. Coordinates (Xi, Yi)
in the reference system locate the centroid Ci of the i-th sub-area.

The coordinates (XC, YC) of the centroid C for the entire area shown in figure 4.16(b) are computed from the
last two expressions in eq. (4.45). The origin of the parallel coordinate system x-y is located at the centroid C as
shown in figure 4.16(b). The parallel axis theorem (4.43) is used to find the second area moments about centroi-
dal system x-y after the second area moments in the reference system are determined from eq. (4.46).

     For branches that can be represented by a thin-walled rectangular area, we can obtain simple formulas for
the second area moments. Consider a thin rectangular area, where 0 < t  b . The contour is a straight line
inclined at a angle  as is shown in figure 4.17. The contour coordinate is denoted by s, and the area element is
dA = tds . The x and y coordinates of the point s on the contour are given by x = s cos and y = s sin .

                                                                         y

     The second area moments are computed for the reference coordinate system (X, Y) using table 4.2 shown
below. Note that for the local coordinate systems originating at the centroid in each branch we can identify the
angle  in eq. (4.47) as 1 = 0 , 2 = 90 , and 3 = 0 . These values of the angle  in each branch are used
to compute the local second area moments in each rectangular branch via eq. (4.47).

For the case of a vanishing axial normal force N, and neglecting temperature effects, the axial normal stress (4.6)
reduces to

Example 4.4  Normal stress distribution in a cantilever beam subject to pure bending.

The cantilever beam shown in figure 4.19 is subject to a bending moment M at its tip. The cross section is the
thin-walled zee shown in figure 4.18. The second area moments about the centroidal axes are given by eqs. (c) to
(e) in example 4.3. Determine the neutral axis in the cross section and the distribution of the bending normal
stress.

Solution. First, note that the components of the prescribed bending moment are Mx = -M and My = 0 . Thus,
the cantilever beam is subject to loading in the y-z plane. The equation of the neutral axis is yNA = -( tan )xNA ,

We need to determine the distribution functions Qxi(si) and Qyi(si) , i = 1, 2, 3 , beginning with the contour

origin from the general expression in eq. (4.9). The contour origin is in branch 1 where s1 = 0 at its intersection
with the traction-free longitudinal edge. As we move along the contour each branch is cut at a generic value of its
contour coordinate. The area of the contour preceding the cut determines the range of integration for the distribu-
tion function as shown in figure 4.23. Using the parametric equations in table 4.3 the results for branch one are

This result means the contribution of the displacement due to transverse shear deformation is negligible with
respect to the component due to bending for beams that are long with respect to their cross-sectional dimensions.

To neglect the influence of transverse shear means we can set shear strains x = 0 and y = 0 . Setting the
shear strains equal to zero in Hooke's law for transverse shear in (4.27) means the shear forces equal zero. How-
ever, the shear forces are necessary for beam equilibrium. Hence, we omit Hooke's law for transverse shear in a
theory where the shear strains are assumed equal to zero. The beam theory neglecting transverse shear strains is
called the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.

4.4 Structural analyses for transverse shear and torsion

The shear stress zs is directly proportional to the transverse shear force components Vx and Vy, and the torque

Mz for a straight bar and for infinitesimal deformations of a Hookean material. Procedures to calculate zs are
different for an open contour and for a closed contour. The stress analysis for an open cross-sectional contour is
presented in example 4.7, and the stress analysis for a closed cross-sectional contour is presented in example 4.8.

Example 4.7  Shear stress analysis for an open cross-sectional contour

The open contour shown in figure 4.24 consists of a semicircular branch of radius a. For simplicity the origin of
the X-Y system is at the center of the semicircle which is labeled point O in figure 4.24. The X-axis is an axis of
symmetry, and the centroid C and shear center S.C. lie on this axis. To find the shear center we take the shear
force Vx = 0 . The shear force Vy and the torque Mz act at the shear center. If Mz = 0 , then the shear force Vy

causes a displacement v in bending of the bar, and z = 0 . If Vy = 0 , then the torque Mz causes a rotation z

twisting the bar, and v = 0 at the shear center.

by

                                 The shear flow is plotted normal to the contour in figure 4.25, and it apparent in the

The result of the integration given by eq. (l) verifies that the shear flow results in no torque at the shear center.

Solution to part (d). The shear stress zs is the sum of the shear stresses from the transverse shear force Vy and
from the torque Mz , and is given by eq. (4.12) on page 80. For this example we find

zs = q / t + 2(Mz / J) = 2(Vy / A) cos  + 2(Mz / J)                                   - / 2     / 2            - t / 2    t / 2 . (m)

From eq. (4.14) the torsion constant J = (bt3) / 3 = (at3) / 3 . The shear stress (m) is a maximum at  = 0,
where the shear flow is maximum. At  = 0 the maximum shear stress is determined from

A closed contour in the shape of the letter D is shown in figure 4.27. The                                         a  y
origin of the X-Y system is taken at the center of the semicircular branch.                                                  x
The cross section is symmetric about the X-axis, so the centroid and shear                                   Y
center lie on the X-axis. To locate the shear center we take shear force                                     O          S.C.
Vx = 0 , and note that the shear force Vy  0 and torque Mz  0 act at the
shear center.                                                                                                      X

Solution to part (a). The cross section is composed of two branches.
Branch 1 is the semicircular contour, and branch 2 is the vertical web con-
necting the ends of branch 1. The parametric equations of the contour for each branch are

                           [X1(), Y1()] = a[ cos (), sin ()] - / 2     / 2 . (a)

Note that the contour coordinate s in branch 2 is defined in the negative y-direction. We compute the area A, the
first area moment about the Y-axis QY , and the location of the centroid as follows:

The function Fyc(s) is given by eq. (4.19). For this symmetric section the product area moment Ixy = 0 , and

     A check on the shear flows is to compute the resultant for Fy and the resultant moment about the shear cen-
ter Cz . Resolving the shear flows in the positive y-direction in each branch we compute the integrals

                                                  /2                      2a

                                     Fy =  q1 cosad -  q2ds = Vy .
                                                  - / 2

Thus, the resultant Fy is equal to the shear force. Note that q2 is positive in the negative y-direction. To compute
the moment Cz we need the normal coordinate to the contour with respect to the shear center. From eq. (4.11) on
page 80 the normal coordinates for each branch are determined by

                             dy1                                                          d y2

The resultant moment is

                                                 /2                 2a

The moment of the shear flows about the shear center equal the torque Mz . The shear flows in eqs. (u) and (v) are
statically equivalent to the shear force Vy and the torque Mz resolved at the shear center.

Solution to part (e). The shear flows are plotted normal to the contour in figure 4.28. The shear flow from the
torque is spatially uniform and equal to Mz / (2Ac) . The shear stress is equal to the shear flow divided by the
thickness of the branch. From figure 4.28 it is apparent that the maximum magnitude of the shear stress occurs
either at  = 0 in the semicircular contour or at s = a in the vertical contour. These shear stress components
are

Example 4.9      Torsional response of an open section and an equivalent closed section

A thin-walled circular tube with contour radius a and wall thickness t is subject to a torque Mz . The wall of a
second identical tube is cut parallel to its longitudinal axis along its entire length to make the cross section of this
second tube an open circular arc. See figure 4.29. Assume the saw kerf is very small. Compare the unit twist and
maximum shear stress in the closed section to the open section.

     For the open section the developed length b of the contour is essentially 2a , since the saw kerf is assumed
to be very small. By the membrane analogy discussed in article 3.9.1 on page 63, the torsional response is the
same as the thin-walled rectangular section of length b and thickness t. The maximum shear stress is given by eq.
(3.129) on page 63, and the torsion constant is given in eq. (3.128). For b = 2a , we have

Since the ratio of the radius to thickness is greater than ten for a thin-walled section, the above results show that
the shear stress (c) and unit twist (d) of the open circular section are much larger than for the closed section if
both sections are subject to the same torque.

     Hence, if a bar is to resist torsional loading, a closed section is preferable to an equivalent open section bar.
That is, the unit twist is smaller for the closed section bar (it is stiffer), and the maximum shear stress is smaller,
than for the equivalent open section bar subject to the same torque.

                                    A constant shear flow in a closed contour is statically equivalent to a

                                    torque, and this torque is the same for any point in the plane about which

Y                                   moments are computed. The fact that the torque is a "free vector" is

O            X                      used in Bredt's formula can add as a negative quantity if the torque pro-
                                    duced by the constant shear flow is clockwise over a segment of the branch.
Fig. 4.32 Constant shear flow       About point O in this figure, the torque produced by the shear flow from
on a closed contour of              point B to A in the right half of the contour is counterclockwise, and the
arbitrary shape.

                                    torque produced by the shear flow from A to B in the left half is clockwise.

Hence, the total torque is the sum of these two torques with due respect to the sign. This summation shows that

the total torque is proportional to the area enclosed by the contour.

flows are different from branch to branch. Consider a cross section consisting of two cells with a horizontal axis

A simple rule to determine the axial equilibrium of the junction is to observe that the shear flow into the junction
must equal the shear flow out of the junction. At the junction of branches 2 and 3 this rule results in q3 = q2 . At

the junction of branches 3, 1-2, and 1 the rule gives q1 - 2 + q3 - q1 = 0 , but q3 = q2 , which leads us to the
same relation given by eq. (a). We started with four unknown shear flows q1, q2, q3, and q1-2. Axial equilibrium at
the three junctions results in two relations between the four shear flows. Two shear flows remain unknown, say q1
and q2, at this point in the analysis.

     The remaining equation of static equivalence is to equate the torque due to the shear flows to Mz. The con-
stant shear flows in each branch are shown in figure 4.37(a), and the resultants of these shear flows are deter-
mined by the analysis presented in article 4.4.1. As shown in figure 4.37(b) the resultant of the shear flow q1 in
branch 1 is a vertical upward force of magnitude 2aq1 , the resultant of the shear flow q2 in branches 2 and 3 is
a vertical downward force of magnitude 2aq2 , and the resultant of the shear flow in the common branch is a
downward force of magnitude 2a(q1 - q2) . The locations of the lines of action of the force resultants with
respect to the common branch are also shown in figure 4.37(b). The vertical force F shown in figure 4.37(c) is
determined from the branch forces by equilibrium. The result is

                      F = 2aq1 - 2aq2 - 2a(q1 - q2) = 0 .                                             (b)

Take the moment of the branch forces in figure 4.37(b) about the common web to determine the torque Mz shown
in figure 4.37(c). The result for static equivalence of the torque is

     We have used all the conditions of static equivalence, but the two shear flows q1 and q2 remain unknown. An
additional equation relating the shear flows is based on the assumed rigidity of the cross section in its own plane.
In torsion, this rigid cross section condition implies the unit twist of each cell is the same. The unit twist for a sin-

This unit twist formula was derived on the basis that a counterclockwise shear flow tends to produce a counter-
clockwise unit twist. Apply this equation to cell 1 to get

                                d z             1            ----a-- q1 + --2---a--- (q1 - q2) .                                (c)

For cell 2, the unit twist is

Note that the contribution of the common branch shear flow is negative in the unit twist formula for cell 2. Rela-
tive to an observer in cell 2, a positive value for the shear flow q1-2 tends to produce a clockwise unit twist, and
hence is negative by the convention that counterclockwise is positive. Since the unit twist of each cell is the same,
we equate eqs. (c) and (d) to get

Example 4.11 Torsion of a closed section with three cells; circuit shear flow

Consider the cross section composed of three cells shown in figure 4.38(a). All branches have the same thickness
t and shear modulus G. It is convenient to define circuit shear flows in each cell. Circuit shear flows are assumed
to be positive counterclockwise in each cell and are equal to the actual shear flows in the exterior branches of the
cell, if there are any exterior branches. However, the shear flow in a common branch between cells is the differ-
ence between the circuit shear flows sharing the common branch. At the junction of the three branches shown in
figure 4.38(b) the shear flow into the junction is q1 - q2 , and this equals the shear flow out of the junction, which
is (q1 - q3) + (q3 - q2) . The method of defining circuit shear flows automatically satisfies axial equilibrium at
the junction.

For an applied torque Mz , determine

 shear flows q1, q2, and q3,
 the torsion constant J, and

 magnitude of the torque at the initiation of yielding.

Since the cross section is assumed to be rigid in its own plane, the unit twist of each cell must be the same. This
kinematic condition can be written between cells 1 and 2 as

The unit twist of the section can be determined by substituting the shear flows (k) into any one of the eqs. (d), (e),

The shear flows in the common branches are

       {(q1 - q2), (q1 - q3), (q3 - q2)} = {-0.0083, 0.0182, -0.0265}(Mz / a2) .                                   (n)

The magnitude of the largest shear flow is in the exterior branches of cell 2, which is also the location of the max-
imum shear stress. The maximum shear stress is

                            (zs)max = q2 / t = 0.13245Mz / (a2t) .                                                 (o)

According to von Mises criterion (4.31) yield initiates at 3(zs)max = yield , so the magnitude of the torque at
the initiation of yielding is

                              Mz max = 4.359(a2tyield) .                                                           (p)

     If all the common branches were removed to make the section shown in figure 4.38(a) a single-cell, square
section 2a by 2a, then from eq. (3.161) on page 70 the torsion constant is

                                            4Ac2 4(4a2)2               3

For this example, subdividing the single-cell section into three cells shown in figure 4.38(a) increases the tor-

sional stiffness (m) by only 1.32 percent with respect to the single-cell section, while the weight of the three-cell

section increases by 37.5 percent with respect to the weight of the single-cell section. However, a multicell sec-

tion may be required for improved damage tolerance; i.e., if we modeled damage as a longitudinal fracture, or

cut, of an exterior branch, then the loss of torsional stiffness of the single-cell would be substantial since it

becomes an open section. Damage to an exterior branch of a multicell section on the other hand results in less of

a reduction in torsional load carrying capability since some closed cells remain intact to carry the torsional

load.

isosceles triangle with equal exterior webs of length c and the common web of length 2a. Take a = 5 in., b = 12
in., and c = 13 in. The thickness of the exterior webs t = 0.040 in., and the thickness of the common web is t/2.
The contour is composed of four branches. Branch 1 is the semicircular web with the contour coordinate denoted
by s1, branch 2 is the upper exterior straight web of cell 2 with contour coordinate s2, branch 3 is the lower exte-
rior straight web of cell 2 with contour coordinate s3, and branch 4 is the vertical common web between cells
with the contour coordinate denoted by s1-2. The Cartesian coordinate system X-Y has its origin at point O, the
center of the semicircular web. The X-axis is the axis of symmetry. The Cartesian coordinates of each branch as a
function of the contour coordinate are listed in table 4.5.

k = 1 . The distribution function defined in eq. (4.9) simplifies to Qx(s) = Qx(s) since y(s) = y(s) . Hence,
the shear flow equation in the i-th branch reduces to the form

Note: If eqs. (k) and (l) are substituted into the third junction condition of eq. (h), then we obtain the identity
q01 = q01 . Hence, the shear flows from the axial equilibrium conditions contain two unknowns q01 and q02 .

q02 is obtained. The shear force acting at the shear center implies the twist per unit axial length of the cross sec-
tion vanishes. This condition leads to two equations governing the shear flows in each cell. For a uniform shear
modulus the twist per unit length is

With the shear flows known we compute the torque about the centroid due to the shear flows by

where rnci(si) is the normal coordinate to the contour with respect to the centroid in the i-th branch. From eq.
(4.10) the normal coordinates are determined from

                               rnci = xi(si)dyi - yi(si)dxi . (ab)

The results for the normal coordinates are

rnc1 = a - Xc sin (s1 / a)     rnc2 = a(b + Xc) / c     rnc3 = a(b + Xc) / c     rnc1-2 = Xc .                      (ac)

Substitute eqs. (w) to (z) for the shear flows into eq. (y), followed by substitution of eq. (ac) for the normal coor-
dinates. Numerical evaluation of the integrals after the substitutions leads to the expression for the torque in the
form

                                            Mzc = (2.50157 in.)Vy .                                                 (ad)

The resultant force and torque at the centroid are shown in figure 4.41(a). We also added and subtracted the shear
force at the shear center in figure 4.41(a), which does not change the static state. The upward shear force at the
centroid and the downward shear force at the shear center form a clockwise couple whose moment is xscVy . In

figure 4.41(b) we resolved the torque Mz = (2.50157 in.)Vy - xscVy and shear force at the shear center. Since
the torque at the shear center is equal to zero in this case, we can solve for the shear center location relative to the
centroid to get

                                               xsc = 2.50157 in.                                                    (ae)

on page 34 the normal coordinates are related by

Substitute the shear flows from eqs. (w) to (z) into eq. (af), followed by the substitution of the coordinates normal
to the contour in eqs. (ah) and (ai). After these substitutions we perform the integrations indicated in eq. (af) to
find the result for torque at the shear center as

Hence, the numerical result for the torque at the shear center with respect to finite precision arithmetic is equal to
zero1.

CHAPTER 5  Work and energy
           methods

In article 5.1 and article 5.2 Hooke's law is presented in terms of generalized forces and their corresponding gen-
eralized displacements acting on a body. Refer to eqs. (5.6) and (5.10). Corollaries to Hooke's law are the princi-

ple of superposition and the reciprocal theorem of Maxwell. Articles 5.3 to 5.6 develop expressions for the
energy stored due to elastic deformation of a thin-walled bar. Castigliano's energy theorems are presented in arti-
cles 5.7 and 5.8.

5.1 Hooke's law and its corollaries

Consider a body, or structure, supported so that rigid body motion is impossible. If it subject to a force, say by
hanging a weight on it, then by Newton's law of action-reaction the body must resist the force by producing an
equal and opposite force. The manner by which the body produces this reactive force is by deforming. That is,
the body changes shape under the action of a mechanical force and it is the change in shape that enables it to sup-
ply the reactive force. If the force is removed and the body returns to its original shape, then the body is elastic.

     Consider the action of force Q1 at point 1 on the body, and the action   Q2, q2        Q1, q1
of force Q2 at point 2 on the body shown in figure 5.1. Let the forces be           2  1
fixed in direction and in point of application. Let the displacements at
points 1 and 2 be denoted by q1 and q2 , respectively, being measured with    Fig. 5.1 Static equilibrium of
respect to a rectangular Cartesian reference frame. Define the displace-      a body under external forces.
ments q1 and q2 at the points of application to be in the direction of the
forces Q1 and Q2 , respectively. Displacements qi and forces Qi ,
i = 1, 2 , are said to correspond; they are defined at the same point and in
the same direction.

     For a linear elastic body Hooke's law governs the response (Robert Hooke, 1635-1703). If only force Q1 is
applied, Hooke's law is

Article 5.1

             q1 = c11Q1 for Q2 = 0 . (5.1)
             q2 = c21Q1                            for Q2 = 0

If force only force Q2 is applied, Hooke's law is

             q1 = c12Q2 for Q1 = 0 . (5.2)
             q2 = c22Q2                            for Q1 = 0

The coefficients c11, c12, c21, and c22 are called flexibility influence coefficients, and they depend on the points
of application and the direction of the corresponding forces and displacements, and the size, shape, and the mate-
rial of the body.

     Note that the application of the force Q1 results in a displacement at point 2, and force Q2 results in a dis-
placement at point 1. Under mechanical load Hooke recognized that the material from which the body is made
deforms internally throughout its extent. We now know the scale of deformation is to the level of the distortion of
interatomic bonds constituting the material. At the atomic scale the material is not continuous. However, for
length scales greater than that of interatomic distances the atomic structure of the body is ignored and the body is
idealized as a continuum. Points within the body are identified with the material particles, and continuity is
defined in the mathematical sense. Neighboring points remain neighbors under any loading condition.

     If both forces Q1 and Q2 act on the body, a questions that arises: Is Hooke's law given by eq. (5.3) below?

                                                    q1 = c11Q1 + c12Q2 . (5.3)
                                                    q2 = c21Q1 + c22Q2

From the hypothesis that the body returns to its original shape after the forces are removed it is proved that eq.
(5.3) for two loads is the correct form of Hooke's law. The proof is given by Fung (1965, p. 3). Also, coefficients
c11 and c21 are independent of force Q2, and coefficients c12 and c22 are independent of force Q1. This proof
leads to the principle of superposition.

             Principle of superposition
             For a linear elastic body the effects caused by two or more loads are the sum of the
             loads applied separately.

              The deformations are small, and
              the order of loading is unimportant.

5.1.1 Work of the external loads
Multiplying the first of eq. (5.3) by Q1 , the second equation by Q2 , and adding, we obtain

             Q1q1 + Q2q2 = c11Q12 + c12Q1Q2 + c21Q2Q1 + c22Q22 .                                   (5.4)

The quantity above is independent of the order in which the loads are applied. Hence, it has a definite meaning
for each order of the application of loads Q1 and Q2.

     Consider the special case of proportional loading, where the ratio                                          Q1 / Q2 = constant
Q2/Q1 is kept constant and the loading increases very slowly from zero
to the final value (i.e., quasi-static loading). In this case, the corre-                           Q1
sponding displacements also increase proportionally and slowly.                                                                 Q2
Force-displacement plots at points 1 and 2 are shown in figure 5.2 for
this special case of proportional loading. It should be clear that the                                  0 q1                   0 q2

work done by the force Q1 is exactly --Q1q1 , and that of Q2 is                                         plots for proportional loading

     Hence, we conclude from eq. (5.4) that the total work done, W, by the set of forces is independent of the
order in which the forces are applied.

5.1.2 Maxwell's reciprocal theorem

Now consider the two different sequences in the application of forces Q1 and Q2. First, apply Q1 slowly with

Q2 = 0 . At the final value of Q1 , the displacement of point 1 is c11Q1 and the displacement of point 2 is

c21Q1 . The work done is  1   c  11  Q  2  .  With  Q1  held fixed, apply               Q2    slowly until  Q2  attains its final value. The
                          --            1
                          2

additional displacement at point 1 is c12Q2 and the additional displacement at point 2 is c22Q2 . The additional

work done is Q1c12Q2 + 1--c22Q22 . When the forces are applied in the order Q1, Q2 , the total work done, as
                              2

shown in figure 5.3, is

             In other words, the displacement at point i due to a unit load at another point j is
             equal to the displacement at j due to a unit load at i, provided that the displace-

Q'3 and Q'4 are functions of the force P . Take the partial derivative

Let q'3 denote the displacement corresponding to force Q'3 , and let q'4 denote the displacement corresponding

                         W                                           W                       Q'3 Q'4

For small displacements, q'3 + q'4 = aq , where q is the small                   3

Thus, in Hooke's law if qi is a rotation, then corresponding "force" Qi is a moment.

     We can consider a concentrated couple as the limiting case of two equal and opposite forces acting in a
plane at the surface of the body that approach each other, but maintain a constant moment; i.e.,

                                                          Limit(aP) = Q

In this limiting process P   . Then, the angle of rotation q is interpreted as the rotation of an infinitesimal line
element in the plane of the couple.

5.2.1 Generalized forces and displacements

Define Qi as the magnitude of the generalized force acting at point i on the body, and let qi denote the corre-
sponding generalized displacement at point i, where i = 1, 2, ..., n . The product of Qiqi has dimensional units
of work, or F-L. If Qi is a force, then qi is the corresponding displacement. If Qi is the moment of a concen-
trated couple with dimensional unit F-L, then qi is the corresponding rotation in radians of the infinitesimal line
element in the plane of the couple at the point of its application. By defining generalized forces and moments, we
can extend Hooke's law in eq. (5.6) to include moments and rotations as well as forces and displacements. In eq.
(5.6), the flexibility influence coefficients can have different dimensional units. For example, if q1 is a displace-
ment of point 1 on the body and Q2 is a moment of a couple acting point 2, then the dimensional unit of flexibil-
ity influence coefficient c12 is F-1 . Since the generalized displacement q2 corresponding to Q2 is a rotation in
radians and the generalized force Q1 acting at point 1 is a force corresponding to q1 , then the dimensional unit
of flexibility influence coefficient c21 is also F-1 . Also, the dimensional unit of c11 is LF-1 , and c22 is F-1L-1 .

5.2.2 Stiffness influence coefficients

Assume that the displacement-force system given by eq. (5.6) can be inverted so that the forces may be expressed
in terms of the displacements as

                          n                        i = 1, 2, ..., n ,  (5.10)

              Qi = kijqj
                       j=1

where constants kij are called stiffness influence coefficients. In matrix notation, we write the displacement-
force form of Hooke's law, eq. (5.6), as

                                          {q} = [c]             {Q}

and the force-displacement form, eq. (5.10), as

                                          {Q} = [k] {q}

Matrix [c] is called the flexibility matrix and [k] is called the stiffness matrix. Both matrices are square of order
n  n . In matrix algebra the stiffness matrix is the inverse of the flexibility matrix, or

                                                 [k] = [c]-1 .         (5.13)

The inverse matrix has the property that

             [c]-1[c] = [c][c]-1 = [I] ,                               (5.14)

where [I] is the n  n identity matrix (i.e., the identity matrix is a square matrix with all diagonal elements equal
to unity and all off-diagonal elements equal to zero).

     Maxwell's theorem in article 5.1.2 states that the flexibility matrix is symmetric. In matrix algebra symmetry
is written as

                                                                                Strain energy density functions

                                         [c]T = [c] ,                           (5.15)

where the superscript T means matrix transpose (i.e., the matrix obtained by interchanging its rows with its col-
umns). Since the flexibility matrix is symmetric, the stiffness matrix is also symmetric. That is,

                                         [k]T = [k] .                           (5.16)

Proof. By definition

                                         [c]-1[c] = [I] .                       (5.17)

Take the transpose of eq. (5.17) to get

                                         ([c]-1[c])T = [I]T .                   (5.18)

Use the fact that the transpose of the product of two matrices is equal to the product of the transpose of the sec-
ond matrix times the transpose of the first matrix, and that the transpose of the identity matrix is equal to itself.
Hence, eq. (5.18) is equal to

                                                    [c]T([c]-1)T = [I] .        (5.19)
By symmetry of the flexibility matrix eq. (5.19) is equal to

                                                     [c]([c]-1)T = [I] .        (5.20)
Pre-multiply eq. (5.20) by the inverse of the flexibility matrix to get

                                         [c]-1[c]([c]-1)T = [c]-1[I] = [c]-1 .  (5.21)
Employ the relation in eq. (5.14) and write eq. (5.21) as

                                         ([c]-1)T = [c]-1 .                     (5.22)

Again, by definition [c]-1  [k] . Thus,

                                         [k]T = [k] .                           (5.23)

     Similarly in the generalized force and generalized displacement form of eq. (5.12), the stiffness influence
coefficients, kij , also can have different dimensional units.

5.3 Strain energy density functions

External loads imposed on a body cause it to deform. The energy stored in an elastic body due to deformation is
called the strain energy, and the strain energy per unit volume is called the strain energy density. For the thin wall
bar theory discussed in article 3.4 on page 37, deformation is quantified by values of the axial normal strain zz ,
and shear strains  zs and  z . The three remaining strains ss =  =  s = 0 . In this article expressions for
the strain energy density functions in terms of the non-zero strains are developed.

tion of motion is

     Consider the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system of continuous matter not interchanging matter
with its surroundings. Then the first law is (Malvern, 1969, p. 229)

                                                             E                                                          (5.26)

where Pinput is the power input of the external loads, Qinput is the rate of heat input, and E is the total energy of
the system. Assume the process is adiabatic so Qinput = 0. The energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and inter-
nal energy. For the closed system consisting of the axial bar element shown in figure 5.7, Pinput is the time rate of
work of the normal stresses acting on the element. Expressions for Pinput and the time rate of change of energy
are

assume it is permissible to interchange the order of differentiation of the second term on the left-hand side and
write it as

and note that the terms involving the acceleration cancel. We are left with

For the response of an elastic body under an adiabatic conditions, it is assumed that the internal energy density is
a function of the strain (Allen and Haisler, 1985, pp. 101,102). For U0 = U0(zz) , and that the strain at point z is
a function of time t, we use the change rule to write

                                                     U0 U0 zz                                        (5.31)
                                                     --------- = --------- --------- .
                                                      t zz t 
Substitute eq. (5.31) into the first law (5.30) to get

                                  U0  zz
                                zz - --------- --------- = 0 .                                       (5.32)
                               zz  t 

Since the time rate of strain is, in general, not zero, it is concluded from (5.32) that

                                          U0                                                         (5.33)
                                  zz = --------- .

                                          zz

Thus, the derivative of the internal energy density function U0(zz) with respect normal strain equals the corre-
sponding normal stress under the assumption of adiabatic deformation for an elastic material.

     In elasticity a function having the property illustrated by eq. (5.33) is called the strain energy density. Thus,
the internal energy density function is identified as the strain energy density. It is shown in continuum mechanics
texts, e.g. Fung (1965, p. 348), that the strain energy density is identified with the internal energy in an adiabatic
process and the free energy for an isothermal process. For a thermoelastic stress-strain law that is not associated
with an adiabatic or isothermal process, it is assumed that a strain energy function exists. That is, an elastic
material is defined by postulating that a scalar function exists such that its derivative with respect to a
strain component determines the corresponding stress component. Consequently, the postulate of a strain
energy function leads to the material law relating the stresses to the strains. Equation (A.110) in the appendix
augments eq. (5.33) to include a three-dimensional state of stress and strain.

     From eq. (3.65) on page 45 Hooke's law for the axial stress and strain is zz = Ezz - T , where E is the

modulus of elasticity,  = E , and  is the coefficient of thermal expansion. Substitute the expression for stress
zz from Hooke's law into the left-hand side of eq. (5.33) and then integrate the result with respect to the strain
zz to get

The strain energy density is zero in the unstrained state, since it will be the change in strain energy that is impor-
tant in subsequent applications. A graphical representation of the strain energy density is obtained in the plot of
Hooke's law as shown in figure 5.8. It is interpreted as the "area" between Hooke's law and the strain axis. From
the graph the "area" is

                                       Simplification of eq. (5.35) reduces it to eq. (5.34). The "area" represents
                                       the work done per unit volume of the stress acting through the strain. The
                                       static analog to eq. (5.30) is zzzz = U0 , where the incremental work

                                       per unit volume W0 = zzzz . The work done during the deformation is

                  z                    z

                  W0 = zzzz = U0 = U0(zz) - U0(0) = U0(zz) .                                                               (5.36)

                  0                    0

That is, the work done per unit volume is equal to the strain-energy-density function, and W0 only depends on the
final state of strain and not the strain history.1

     Strain energy density functions for a Hookean material subject to a three-dimensional state of strain, includ-
ing thermal strains, are given by eq. (A.140) in the appendix. The three-dimensional strain energy density func-
tion reduces to eq. (5.34) for uniaxial strain if the Poisson effect is neglected.

5.3.2 Complementary energy density in uniaxial normal stress

Equation (5.33) is transformed to a conjugate form by introducing a new function U0*(zz) called the comple-

Hooke's law relates the shear stress to the shear strain by zs = G zs , where G is the shear modulus of the mate-
rial. Substituting Hooke's law into eq. (5.42) followed by integration, we get the expressions for the strain energy

5.4 Strain energy for extension and bending of a thin-walled bar

Assuming that the axial normal strain is uniform through the thickness of the wall, we obtain from eq. (3.30) on
page 38 that the axial normal strain is related to the axial displacement w(z) , and bending rotations x(z) and
y(z) , by

                          zz = dw + y(s)dx + x(s)dy .                                                                                                          (5.45)

Substitute eq. (5.45) for the normal strain into the strain energy density (5.34) to get

The thermal actions appearing in eq. (5.47) are given by eqs. (3.75) and (3.78) on page 46.

     Assuming that the axial normal stress is uniform through the thickness of the wall, then the axial normal
stress is given by eq. (3.83) on page 47. Substitute eq. (3.83) for the normal stress into the expression (5.41) for
the complementary strain energy density to get

mentary strain energy per unit axial length is defined by U* =  U0*(zz)t(s)ds . Substitute eq. (5.48) for the

5.5 Strain energy for shear and torsion of a thin-walled bar

Consider the strain energy densities due to shear (5.44). Integrate these strain energy densities over the cross-sec-
tional area to get the strain energies per unit axial length.That is,

                                    t/2                                                      t/2

                   U = 1-2-  G( z2s +  z2 )d ds                                     *1   2  G       1    (  z2s  +  z2 )d  ds .                                        (5.52)
                               c -t / 2                                           U = --            ---

                                                                                          c -t / 2

If we substituted the shear strains  zs and  z from eq. (3.31) on page 38 into the strain energy per unit length
and performed the integration over the cross section we would get the strain energy function per unit length in the
form

                                                           U = U x, y, dz .                                                                                            (5.53)
                                                                               dz

Partial derivatives of U with respect to the transverse shears and twist per unit length determine the material law
for the transverse shear forces and torque. That is,

                                          U                        U                               U                                                                   (5.54)
                                  Vx = ---------           Vy = ---------                Mz = ---------------- .

                                                                                                  dz 

     The shear stresses enter the definitions of the shear flow q, twisting moment resultant mzs, and the transverse
stress resultant qz, given by eq. (3.37) on page 40. For a thin, curved wall we neglect the term  / Rs in the factor
(1 +  / Rs) appearing in the integrand of eq. (3.37). It follows that the shear stresses consistent with stress result-
ant definitions are

                   zs(s, z, )        q(s, z) 12                       m z s ( s,  z)     z(s, z) = qz(s, z) / t(s) .

Substitute eq. (5.55) for the stresses in complementary energy per unit length (5.52), followed by integration
through the thickness to get

5.5.1 Open cross-sectional contour

The shear flow in the first integral on the right-hand side of (5.56) is given by eq. (3.98) on page 51. It is repeated
below.

                                                           k                              k

Note that the shear flow is directly related to the shear forces and is independent of the torque. To account for the
torque, evaluate the second integral on the right-hand side of eq. (5.56) for torsion of the open section with the
straight contour presented in article 3.9 on page 57. From eq. (3.119) on page 60 these stress resultants are

Substituting the stress resultants mzs and qz from eq. (5.58) into the second integral in the complementary strain
energy (5.56), followed by evaluating the integral, we find

flow q. Consequently, in the complementary strain energy per unit axial length (5.56) the second integral on the

The torsion constant J for a single-cell cross section is given by eq. (3.160) on page 70. Influence coefficients
cxz = cyz = 0 , since the shear flow distribution functions Fx(s) and Fy(s) are defined with respect to the shear
center. (Refer to eq. (3.151) and eq. (3.164).)

5.5.3 Material law for transverse shear and torsion

The relation between the strain energy densities in shear is analogous to the one for normal stress and strain
(5.37). This relation is

From eq. (3.40) on page 40 recognize that the coefficient of shear x is the shear force Vx, the coefficient of
shear y is the shear force Vy, and the coefficient of the twist per unit length is the torque Mz. Hence, the integral
I is given by

                   t / 2                                                                              (5.71)

The relation between the shear strain energies per unit axial length in eq. (5.68) becomes

                U*[Vx, Vy, Mz] = - U x, y, dz + Vxx + Vyy + Mzdz .                                    (5.72)

Take the partial derivative of (5.72) with respect to the shear force Vx as follows:

                U*  U x          x  U  x
                --------- = - --------- --------- + x + Vx--------- = Vx - --------- --------- + x .
                Vx  x Vx         Vx  x  Vx

The term Vx - U / x = 0 in eq. (5.73) since it is the elastic material law for the shear force given by eq.
(5.54). Consequently, eq. (5.73) leads to the material law for shear x

                                                         U*                                           (5.74)

                                                          Vx
Following steps similar to those used in eqs. (5.72) to (5.74) leads to the additional material laws

                    U*           U* dz
                    --------- = y and --------- = .                                                   (5.75)

     Substitute the complementary strain energy from either eq. (5.61) or (5.64) into eqs. (5.74) and (5.75) to
obtain the material law governing the transverse shears and the twist per unit length. Since the expressions for the
complementary strain energy per unit axial length with respect to the shear center are the same for the open con-
tour (5.61) and the closed contour (5.64), the material law in both cases is

                    x cxx cxy 0 Vx
                    y = cxy cyy 0

5.6 Total strain energy expressions for a thin-walled bar

The total strain energy is obtained from strain energy per unit axial length by integration with respect to axial
coordinate z, 0  z  L , where L is the length of the bar. The total strain energy is written as

                                              U = U + U ,                                                                                                                             (5.80)

where the strain energy obtained from axial normal strain zz is denoted by U , and the strain energy obtained
from shear strains  zs and  z is denoted by U . From eqs. (5.47) and (5.79) these strain energies are

5.7 Castigliano's first theorem

The work function can be written in terms of the generalized displacements and stiffness influence coefficients
by substituting n = 2 in eq. (5.10), then substituting the result for the generalized forces into the work eq. (5.5).
The result is

             W =  1-- (k11q12 + 2k12q1q2 + k22q22) .                                                     (5.86)
                     2

Take the partial derivative of the work function with respect to q1 and q2 to get

             W                         W
             -------- = k11q1 + k12q2  -------- = k12q1 + k22q2 .
             q1                        q2

Comparing these results for the partial derivatives of W to the eq. (5.10) for n = 2, we find

                     W                         W                                                         (5.87)
             Q1 = --------             Q2 = -------- .

                     q1                        q2

That is, the partial derivative of the work function with respect to a displacement equals the corresponding force.
Equation (5.87) yields the stiffness law, and it is the conjugate to eq. (5.8) that yields the compliance law.

     For adiabatic deformation of a Hookean material the first law of thermodynamics shows that the work done
per unit volume is equal to the strain energy density. Refer to eq. (5.36) on page 138. For the body composed of a
Hookean material, we take the work done by the external loads equal to the strain energy of the entire body. Then
W = U in eq. (5.87), which leads to Castigliano's first theorem in terms of generalized displacements and forces
as follows:

             Castigliano's first theorem
                  If the strain energy of an elastic structure is expressed in terms of the independent

             generalized displacement components qi , i = 1, 2, ..., n , in the direction of the pre-
             scribed generalized point forces Q1, Q2, ...Qn , then the first partial derivative of the
             strain energy with respect to the displacement qi is equal to the corresponding force

                      x(z) = dudz + y(z)  y(z) = dvdz + x(z) .

The procedure in the application of the first theorem to structural analysis is to assume functions for the dis-
placement components u(z), v(z), and w(z) and rotations x(z), y(z), and z(z) that satisfy the three condi-
tions below.

1. The displacement and rotations must be continuous functions of the coordinate z, so that their derivatives with
    respect to the coordinate, or strains, exist and are integrable over the domain of the bar.

2. The displacement and rotations must satisfy any prescribed conditions at the boundaries z = 0 and z = L.

3. The displacement and rotation functions are selected such that they equate to the generalized displacements
    qi , i = 1, 2, ..., n , at their defined points of application.

     Displacement and rotation functions that satisfy continuity conditions and prescribed displacement bound-
ary conditions are said to be kinematically admissible. Kinematically admissible displacements lead to a com-
patible deformation. Compatibility of a deformable body means the displacements are continuous and single-
valued (i.e., no gaps or overlaps of material result in the deformed state). Castigliano's first theorem is a condi-
tion of equilibrium consistent with the assumed kinematically admissible displacements.

Example 5.1  Response of cantilever beam by Castigliano's first theorem

The cantilever beam shown in figure 5.11 is subject to a vertical displacement q1 and a clockwise ration q2 at its
tip, and a uniform thermal moment MxT along its length. The cross section is symmetric with respect to the y-z
plane.

                                          y, v                                1

Assume a kinematically admissible displacement and bending rotation as

                      v(z) = q1(z / L)  x(z) = q2(z / L)                0zL.                                 (a)

Continuous and differentiable functions for the generalized displacements are ensured by employing polynomial

functions in coordinate z. Also, assumptions (a) satisfy the prescribed end conditions v(0) = 0 and x(0) = 0 .
Therefore, assumptions (a) satisfy the conditions of kinematic admissibility. The strain energy reduces to a func-
tion generalized displacements q1 and q2. For this example the expression for the strain energy from (5.81) and
(5.82) is

                                       L

The strain energy expression in eq. (b) is called a functional because its value is determined by the functions
x(z) and y(z) . Assumption (a) results in a strain energy function given by eq. (e) where the generalized dis-
placements q1 and q2 are the independent variables. The generalized forces Q1 and Q2 corresponding to q1
and q2 , respectively, are determined by Castigliano's first theorem. That is,

5.8 Castigliano's second theorem

The generalized displacements from Hooke's law in eq. (5.3) are substituted into the work eq. (5.5) to express the
work function as

Comparing these results for the partial derivatives of W to the two equations (5.3), we find

If the work function is written in terms of the forces and flexibility influence coefficients, then partial derivatives
of the work with respect to a force equals the corresponding displacement. The work done on a Hookean body is
equal to the change in energy stored due to elastic deformation. We use the complementary strain energy U* in

this case to represent the change in energy since U* = 0 in the reference state. Hence, set W = U* , and we
arrive at Castigliano's second theorem in terms of generalized displacements and forces, which is as follows:

Castigliano's second theorem
     If an elastic structure is mounted such that rigid body displacements are impossible

and certain generalized point forces Q1, Q2, ..., Qn act on the structure, in addition to
distributed loads and thermal strains, the displacement component qi , i = 1, 2, ..., n
of the point of application of force Qi in the direction of Qi is determined by the equa-
tion

The procedure in the application of the second theorem to the analysis of thin-walled bars is to assume functions
in the axial coordinate z for the bar resultants Vx, Vy, N, Mx, My, and Mz , that satisfy the three conditions below.

1. The bar resultants must be represented by functions of the Cartesian coordinates that satisfy the differential
    equations of equilibrium of article 3.6.1 on page 41 for 0 < z < L .

2. The functions for the bar resultants must satisfy their prescribed values on the boundaries at z = 0 and z = L.

3. The functions for the bar resultants must contain the generalized forces Qi , i = 1, 2, ..., n , as parameters.

     Functions for the bar resultants that satisfy the differential equations of equilibrium and prescribed force
boundary conditions are said to be statically admissible. Castigliano's second theorem is the condition of
compatibility for the statically admissible bar resultants. Compatibility of a deformable body means the dis-
placements are continuous and single-valued (i.e., no gaps or overlaps of material result in the deformed state).
Castigliano's second theorem is useful in determining displacements of a structure.

6.1 Coplanar trusses

6.1.1 Castigliano's first theorem

Consider a truss idealized as an assemblage of uniform bars connected by smooth ball-and-socket joints in three-

dimensional trusses, or by smooth hinge joints in a coplanar truss. External forces are assumed to act only at the

joints. The line connecting the joints at the end of each bar is assumed to coincide with the reference axis of the

bar. Hence, the axial force and strain in each bar is uniform along its length, and the bar is either in tension or

compression.

     A coplanar truss consisting of fifteen bars and eight joints is shown in figure 6.1. Each joint in a coplanar
truss has two degrees of freedom, one horizontal displacement and the one vertical displacement. Hence, there
are sixteen displacement degrees of freedom for this truss. At joint i, i = 1, 2,..., 8, the horizontal displacement is

denoted by q2i - 1 and the vertical displacement is denoted by q2i . The positive directions for the displacements
and corresponding forces in the fifteen bar truss are shown in figure 6.1. The original coordinates of the joints
and the sixteen displacements completely define the configuration of the truss in the deformed state.

     A typical bar in a truss connecting joints labeled i and j is shown in figure 6.2(a). The location of the bar in a
X-Y coordinate system is established by the coordinates of joint i (Xi, Yi) and those of joint j (Xj,Yj). The angle of

truss and axial displacements are related by q2i - 1 = qi cos  and q2i = qi sin  as shown in figure 6.3. Likewise

at joint j q2j - 1 = qj cos  and q2j = qj sin  . These relations can be solved for the axial displacement in terms
of the truss displacements to get

                         qi = q2i - 1 cos  + q2i sin   qj = q2j - 1 cos  + q2j sin  .                             (6.5)

The elongation of the truss bar i-j in terms of the joint displacements is

                         i - j = qj - qi = (q2j - 1 - q2i - 1) cos  + (q2j - q2i) sin  .                          (6.6)

The elongation (6.6) is the sum of the projections of the relative displacements onto the reference axis of the
undeformed bar which is depicted in figure 6.4.

(EA / L)m , its elongation by m, and denote the thermal force by NTm . The temperature change is uniform in
each bar, but can be different from bar to bar. The relation between bar index m and the joints i and j of the bar are
defined by assignment. For example in figure 6.1, the bar identified by m = 2 may be selected as the bar connect-
ing joint 1 to joint 4, so its elongation (6.6) is

                                      2 = 1 - 4 = (q7 - q1) cos 2 + (q8 - q2) sin 2 .

The sine and cosine of angle 2 are determined from eq. (6.1). The strain energy of the assemblage is simply the
sum of the strain energies in each bar, where (6.3) is the energy for one bar. Hence, the total strain energy is

Example 6.1  Three-bar coplanar truss

The coplanar truss shown in figure 6.5 consists of three bars (m = 1, 2, 3) and four joints 1, 2, 3, 4. Beginning
joint i and end joint j for each bar are listed in the figure. Joints 2, 3, and 4 are fixed so their displacements equal
zero, and joint 1 is movable. The change in the thermal force in each bar is equal to zero. The spring stiffness of

the bars are denoted by (EA / L)m . Determine the 2 x 2 stiffness matrix using Castigliano's first theorem.

Solution. The elongation of each bar as determined from eq. (6.6) is

Example 6.2  Three-bar truss with lack of fit

Consider the same three bar-truss of example 6.1, but now assume that bar 1 was too short and had to be

stretched an amount 1 in order to connect it to joint 1. This is a case of lack of fit, and lack of fit is common in
the fabrication of structures. That is, before the external loads are applied (Q1 = Q2 = 0 ), the truss bars experi-
ence initial forces due to the lack of fit of bar 1. Determine the initial forces in the bars using Castigliano's first
theorem.

Solution. Lack of fit can be included in the energy analysis by modifying the specified thermal force term in the
strain energy (6.7). For uniform material properties and uniform change in temperature, the thermal force in a
truss bar is NT = EAT . (Refer to eq. (3.75) on page 46.) The factor T = 0 is the initial strain due to the
temperature change. Note 0 is dimensionless. Now interpret 0 as the initial strain specified due to lack of fit.

The initial strain due to the specified displacement  required to connect a bar to a joint is 0 =  / L . Let

NT  N = EA( / L) . The strain energy is modified to

                                             3      1EA 2

The specified initial strain is only for bar 1, so

     A specific case: 1 = 30 , 2 = 45 , 3 = 60 , and EA is the same for each bar. Take L1 = L , so that
L2 = L / 2 , and L3 = L / ( 3) . The solution for the displacements from eq. (b) are q1 = 1.4581 and
q2 = -1 . The elongations are 1 = 0.7631 , 2 = 0.3241 , and 3 = -0.1371 , and the bar forces from
eq. (f) are

The truss shown in figure 6.6 consists of three bars labeled 1-2, 1-3, and 2-3. Joint 1 is a fixed pin, and pin joint 3
is free to move vertically but not horizontally. A downward applied force of a 84,000 N acts at joint 2. The cross-

sectional areas of bars are A1 - 2 = 900mm2 , A1 - 3 = 300mm2 , and A2 - 3 = 1, 200mm2 . Each bar has a mod-
ulus of elasticity E = 70,000 N/mm2. The degree of freedom numbering is shown the figure. Determine displace-
ments q3 and q4 by Castigliano's second theorem

A note on static determinacy: Let m = the number of unknown bar forces, r = the number of support reactions,
and let j = the number of joints. There are two independent equilibrium equations per joint. For a statically deter-
minate truss, the number of unknown forces is equal to number of independent equilibrium equations (i.e., 2j = m

+ r). For the truss in this example j = 3, m = 3, and r = 3. So it is statically determinate. For the truss in example
6.1, j = 3, m = 3, and r = 6, and 6 < 3 + 6. So the truss in example 6.1 is statically indeterminate.

Solution. Free body diagrams of joints 2 and 3 are shown figure 6.7. The diagrams are drawn assuming each bar
is in tension, so the reaction of the bar force acting on a joint is an arrow aligned with the bar and pointing away
from the joint. The objective is to determine each bar force in terms of external forces Q3 and Q4. Note that Q3 =
0 and Q4 = -84,000 N, but we will wait to substitute these numerical values after the derivatives are evaluated in

     The only contribution to the complementary strain energy in (5.84) on page 145 is the axial normal force N,
which is spatially uniform along the length of the bar. Also, there is no change in temperature from the reference
state. Hence, the complementary strain energy for the truss is

Example 6.4     Cross-sectional properties of a thin-walled tube

             y                 The cross section is a thin-walled tube with a circular contour of radius a and wall

          a               Solution. The x- and y- axes are axes of symmetry in the cross section, so the cen-
                    x troid and shear center coincide with the center of the circular contour. The paramet-

                          area moments are

The free body diagram of the tube in the x-z plane is shown in figure 6.11. Generalized forces Q1, Q3, and Q5 are
introduced at the free end to facilitate computing the corresponding displacements via Castigliano's theorem, and
they are set equal to zero at the end of the procedure (i.e., they are fictitious actions).

Example 6.6  Wing spar subject to a distributed spanwise air load

A light airplane experiences a total lift L = 12,000 lb. in a certain symmetric maneuver. Thus, the lift acting on
each wing is L/2. Assume the airload is distributed elliptically over the wing, so that the airload intensity fL per
unit span is given as

                                  2L             z 2           0  z  zmax ,

                                  zmax           zmax

where z is the spanwise coordinate, z = 0 at the root, and z = zmax at the tip of the wing. See figure 6.12 (a). The

spar of the wing is a uniform, longitudinal, thin-walled beam with a closed section stiffened by four longitudinal
stringers as shown in figure 6.12 (b). This cross-section is the same one shown in figure 3.24 and analyzed in
example 3.4 on page 71. Assume the spar is clamped at the root and free at the tip (i.e., a cantilever spar). At the
tip of the spar we will use Castigliano's second theorem to find the vertical displacement of the shear center
denoted by q2, and to find the torsional rotation of the cross section denoted by q6. To use the theorem, we intro-
duce a fictitious force Q2 corresponding to displacement q2, and a fictitious torque Q6 corresponding to rotation
q6. A typical cross section of the spar with the locations of the centroid (XC), the shear center (XSC), and the line
of action of the airload (XL) with respect to the vertical web are shown in the left-hand sketch of figure 6.13. The
right-hand sketch in figure 6.13 illustrates that the airload is statically equivalent to the external line load inten-

the transverse shear force Vy is given by eq. (3.54) on page 43. Substitute the expression for the airload to get the
shear force as

        Vy =          - ----2---L------       z 2       dz       L--   acos----z----- - ----z-----       z 2       + c1 .

Note that the integration is facilitated by the substitution z / zmax = cos  , and using trigonometric identities.
The constant of integration c1 is determined by the boundary condition Vy(zmaz) = Q2 . Hence c1 = Q2 , and
the final result for the shear force is

                          Vy = L--               acos----z----- - ----z-----       z 2       + Q2 .                        (b)
                                                                              1 - ---------

The shear force at the root for Q2 = 0 is Vy(0) Q2 = 0 = L / 2 .

     The bending moment Mx is determined by eq. (3.55) on page 43. Substitute the result for the shear force Vy
into eq. (3.55) to find

                      Mx =                 L--   acos----z----- - ----z-----       z 2

                                                                                   zmax
                                                                                                     

Again, the integration for Mx is facilitated by the substitution z / zmax = cos  , and using trigonometric identities
to get

The constant of integration c2 is determined by the boundary condition Mx(zmaz) = 0 . Hence c2 = -zmaxQ2 ,
and the final result for the bending moment is

From eq. (3.61) on page 43, and that mz = efL , we can express the torque Mz as

                                                        dMz

The constant of integration c3 is determined from the boundary condition Mz(zmax) = Q6 , which yields

The torque at the root of the spar for Q6 = 0 is Mz(0) Q6 = 0 = eL / 2 .We have determined the statically admissi-

nal force Q2, and external torque Q6.

Note that the torque is independent of force Q2, so that Mz / Q2 = 0 . Let q2 = q2m + q2v , where q2m is the
portion of the displacement due to bending moment Mx and q2v is the portion due to transverse shear force Vy.

The bending moment Mx and transverse shear force Vy are independent of the external torque Q6. Hence,

                                                q(s, 0) = Mz(0) / (2Ac) - Fy(s)Vy(0) .                                        (r)

The torque results in a spatially uniform component to the shear flow around the contour equal to

                                                qt = Mz(0) / (2Ac) = 76.9188 lb/in. .                                         (s)

tions Fyi(si) are given by eqs. (ab) to (ae) in part c of example 3.4. The shear stress distribution along the con-

                                           zsi(si, 0) = [qi(si, 0)] / t              i = 1, 2, 3, 4 .                         (u)

(Refer to figure 3.24 on page 71.) From eq. (4.31) the von Mises effective stress is

The von Mises effective stress normalized by the yield strength is plotted with respect to the contour coordinate
for zmax = 60 inches in figure 6.14. As shown in the figure the maximum normalized effective stress is 0.383 at s
= 4.696 inches in branch 1. In terms of an angular measurement in the semi-circular branch 1, we note the loca-

tion as s1 / a = (4.696 / 6)(180 / ) = 44.8 . For the other values of zmax, the maximum value of the von
Mises stress also occurs in branch 1 but at different angular locations. Discontinuities in the von Mises stress
with respect to the contour coordinate are a result of the jumps in the shear flow across the stringers. (Refer to eq.
(3.135) on p. 65 ).

Note that as the length of the spar increases the percentage of the vertical displacement at the tip due to trans-
verse shear decreases and the von Mises effective stress increases. At zmax = 300 in. the von Mises stress exceeds
the yield strength of the material indicating failure by material yielding.

6.3 Coplanar Frames

Frames are also skeletal structures composed of slender bars that can transmit axial, bending, and transverse
shear loads. The bars act as beams with a superimposed axial load. Joints in a frame are usually assumed rigid,
which means that the rotation of all bars connected to the joint are the same. Moments can be transferred through
a rigid joint, but not a hinge joint, nor ball-and-socket joint. A frame structure may also contain some hinge
joints.

Example 6.7         A frame of two tubular bars

The tubular post shown in figure 6.15 supports a load of 250 N at        rigid joint              3000 mm
the free end. The diameter of the cross-sectional contour is 100

mm and the wall thickness is 3 mm. The material is steel with

modulus of elasticity of 206,000 N/mm2 and a Poisson's ratio of

0.3. Each bar of the frame has the same uniform geometric cross       6000 mm            250 N

ture. A horizontal force Q is introduced at the free end so that the horizontal displacement can be computed from

the theorem. Also, let P = 250 N. The complementary strain energy is determined from eqs. (5.84) and (5.85).

Since there is no change in temperature nor torsion, the complementary strain energy is

which is 6----4---.-8---9---8---1---3---2- 100 = 99.957161 % of the total displacement. As a general rule the deflections of
            64.925946

frames composed of slender bars is dominated by bending, and the contributions due to axial stretching
and transverse shear deformations to the deflections can be neglected.

6.4 Castigliano's second theorem and statically indeterminate
structures

A statically indeterminate structure is one in which the number of unknown forces exceeds the number of inde-
pendent equations of static equilibrium. The excess forces are called redundants. By removing supports and/or
members in a statically indeterminate structure equal to the number of redundants, a stable statically base struc-
ture can be obtained. To determine the redundants, we can imposed displacement compatibility using Cas-
tigliano's second theorem. A stable statically determinate base structure is capable of resisting the external loads.
Removing a support reaction or a member in statically determinate structure renders it unstable - it is not capable
of resisting external loads and it is classified as moving mechanical system (i.e., either a mechanism or linkage).

     Consider a coplanar truss which consists of straight bars connected by smooth hinge joints with the external
loads applied only to the joints. As discussed in example 6.3 on page 158, a truss is statically determinate if
m = 2j - r and statically indeterminate if m > 2j - r , where m denotes the number of bars or members, j the
number of joints, and r denotes the number of reaction forces at the supports. Even statically determinate trusses
can be unstable if the members are not arranged properly. Statical determinacy is a necessary condition for stabil-
ity, not a sufficient condition. Each truss must be examined individually to determine stability. For the truss
shown in part (a) of figure 6.17, m = 9, r = 4, and j = 6, so it is statically indeterminate. If the upper left support is
removed and replaced with a horizontal force Q, then a statically determinate base structure results as shown in
part (b) of figure 6.17. The force Q is the redundant and it is treated as an external load on the base structure.
Equilibrium of the base structure determines the internal bar forces in terms of external forces P and Q. The solu-
tion to the truss in part (a) is effected by imposing the displacement corresponding to force Q to vanish via Cas-
tigliano's second theorem (i.e., q = U* / Q = 0 ). This displacement compatibility condition determines the
redundant Q.

Example 6.8     Statically indeterminate truss

Consider the truss shown in part (a) of figure 6.18. The horizontal bars and the vertical bars have a length denoted

by L, and each bar has the same elastic modulus E and same cross-sectional area A. For this truss m = 6, r = 3,

and j = 4. So the truss is statically indeterminate. Note that this truss is statically determinate externally, but is

statically indeterminate internally. Determine the bar forces in terms of the external applied load P.

The relative inward displacement between joints 2 and joint 4 is given by the sum u1 + u2 . For equal and oppo-
site forces we set F1 = F2 = Q , and then the relative inward displacement reduces to

     Geometric compatibility of the statically indeterminate, six-bar truss requires the relative inward displace-
ment between joints 2 and 4 equals the negative of the elongation of bar 2-4. In other words, the sum
1 / 2 + 24 = 0 . Hence,

                                                                     ^*     U * 24          U*

From eq. (h) we determine the redundant as

                                                Q = ------4----+---------2------ P = -0.56066P .                                               (i)
                                                          4(1 + 2)

Finally, the bar forces are

             N1 - 2 = 0.396447P                                N1 - 3 = 0.853553P               N1 - 4 = 0.396447P

             N2 - 3 = 0.396447P N2 - 4 = -0.56066P N3 - 4 = -0.603553P . (j)

     The condition that U* / Q = 0 is interpreted as the relative displacement between the faces of an imagi-
nary cut in bar 2-4 is equal to zero.

     If the solution of the truss in example 6.8 was undertaken using Castigliano's first theorem, it would lead to
five simultaneous linear equations for the unknown joint displacements q3, q4, q5, q6, and,q8 in terms of the
applied load P. (Refer to "Coplanar trusses" on page 153 for the displacement numbering convention.) After
solving for these simultaneous equations for the joints displacements, the elongations of each bar, i - j , would

be computed from eq. (6.6) on page 155. Lastly, the bar forces are determined from Ni - j = (EA / L)i - ji - j .
Using Castigliano's second theorem for this singly redundant truss, we only had to solve one equation for the
unknown redundant Q. The number of simultaneous equations to be solved in a statically indeterminate structure
by Castigliano's second theorem is equal to the number of redundants.

external loading are symmetric about the vertical line of action of the 5,000 lb. force. The support reactions of the
truss removed from its supports at A and C are shown in figure 6.20(a). Consideration of the free body diagrams
of members AD, AB, and BD in figure 6.20(b) leads to the conclusion that this structure is statically indetermi-
nate internally. The redundant Q is taken as the axial force in member AB. If Q is known, then the forces and
moments in the other members are determined by equilibrium. Neglecting the energy due to transverse shear in
member ADC, the complementary strain energy is

Note that the complementary strain energy in members AD and AB are multiplied by two to account for the

6.4.1 Function of a Turnbuckle

A turnbuckle is a metal coupling device consisting of an oblong piece, or barrel, internally threaded at both ends
into which the corresponding sections of two threaded rods are screwed in order to form a unit that can be
adjusted for tension or length. A right-hand thread is used at one end and a left-hand thread at the other end. The
device either lengthens or shortens when the barrel is rotated. Each full turn of the barrel causes it to travel a dis-
tance p along each screw, where p is the pitch of the threads. Tightening the turnbuckle by one turn causes the
rods to be drawn closer together by a distance 2p. That is, one turn to tighten causes the device to shorten by 2p.

For n turns the shortening distance is 2np, where n need not be an integer. Turnbuckles are widely used in air-
craft. Biplanes may use turnbuckles to adjust the tension on structural wires bracing their wings as discussed in
example 6.10 below. Turnbuckles are also widely used with flexible cables in flight control systems.

Example 6.10 Rigging biplane landing and flying wires

An acrobatic biplane has a maximum gross weight of 1,700 lbs. and a wing span of 25 feet. The cross sections of
the lower and upper wings are thin, so the wing structure is strengthened by external bracing. As shown in figure
6.21 the bracing consists of landing and flying wires connecting the fuselage to the wings at the interplane strut.
Turnbuckles inserted in the landing and flying wires are used to pre-tension the wires by changing their length.

                          landing wires

     We will model the structural unit consisting of the lower wing, upper wing, interplane strut, landing wires,
and flying wires as shown in figure 6.22 (a). The left-hand wings are modeled as a pin-jointed truss. Bars 1-2 and
3-4 represent the spars in the lower wing and upper wing, respectively, and are of length L = 10 ft. The spars are
made of Sitka spruce with a Young's modulus parallel to the grain of 1.5106 lb./in.2, and a cross-sectional area
of 1.25 in.2. Bar 1-3 represents the landing wire, bar 2-4 the flying wire, and the wires are made of stainless steel
with a modulus of 30106 lb./in.2 Each wire has a diameter of 0.125 in. Bar 1-4 is the interplane strut of length

h equal to 4.3 ft., and it is assumed to be very stiff. The wings are specified to have a dihedral angle  = 4 .

     Determine the number of turns in the flying wire turnbuckle nF , and the number of turns in the landing wire
turnbuckle nL , such that the flying wire tension is 400 lb., and the dihedral is maintained at four degrees. The
pitch of the turnbuckle threads is p = 1 in. / (10 turns) .

Solution. The structural model of the left-hand wing and bracing shown in figure 6.22 (a) consists of five truss
bars. The turnbuckle displacements are determined from the horizontal position of the wing. Free body diagrams
of joints 1 and 4 are shown in figure 6.22 (b). A vertical external force Q2 is introduced at joint 1 so that its corre-
sponding displacement q2 can be determined in the application of Castigliano's theorem. Displacement q2 is

specified from the wing's required dihedral. That is q2 = L sin  , and after its determination external force Q2 is
set to zero.

     From eq. (5.84) on page 145 the complementary energy for a homogenous truss bar subject to a uniform
change in temperature is

                      U*  =   L                 (  N  +  NT  )2  .                                         (a)

To account for the displacements of the turnbuckles in Castigliano's second theorem we modify the axial temper-

Let the thermal strain T be replaced by the initial strain induced by the turnbuckle displacement T = 2np
divided by the length of the bar containing the turnbuckle. That is, T  T / L . Then the complementary
strain energy in eq. (a) that includes the displacement caused by the turnbuckle is

Now eliminate the bar force N1 - 4 between the four equilibrium equations to get the three equations

The force N2 - 4 in the flying wire is taken as the redundant. Solve the remaining bar forces from eq. (j) in terms
of the redundant and force Q2 to get

N1 - 2 = - N2 - 4 + Q2 /                      N1 - 3 = N2 - 4 - Q2 /     N3 - 4 = -N2 - 4 .                          (k)

find the energy in the form U*[N2 - 4, Q2] with turnbuckle displacements L and F appearing in U* as param-

Set q2 = L sin  in eq. (l) and solve for the landing wire turnbuckle displacement, followed by solving eq. (m)

Set N2 - 4 = 400 lb. to obtain the numerical results for the turnbuckle displacements and their number of turns
as

The landing wire turnbuckle decreases the length between joints 1 and 3, and the flying wire turnbuckle increases
the length between joints 2 and 4. The bar forces are

5. The plane truss shown in figure 6.26 represents a single bay of a wing spar truss. For all bars: E = 75 GPa
and  = 23.010-6 / 캜 . The cross-sectional areas of the bars are: 2580 mm2 for the horizontal bars, 387 mm2
for the vertical bars, and 2690 mm2 for the diagonal bars. The upper horizontal bar is heated to 250캜 above the
zero stress temperature, and all other bars remain at the zero stress temperature. Two 45 kN lift forces act at joints
1 and 2.

     d) the stresses in MPa in each bar.

6. The truss shown in figure 6.27 consists of five bars: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-4, and 3-4. Each bar has the same cross-
sectional area A and same modulus of elasticity E. The lengths of bars 1-2, 1-4, and 3-4 are the same, and are
denoted by L. A horizontal force of magnitude P is applied to joint 1. Use Castigliano's second theorem to deter-
mine the horizontal displacement q5 of joint 3.

7. A simply supported, uniform beam of length L is subjected to a moment Q1 at its left end as shown in figure

6.28. The material is homogeneous and linear elastic, the cross section is symmetric (Ixy = 0 ), and there are no
thermal strains. The bending stiffness is EI. Use Castigliano's second theorem to determine the rotation at (a) the
left end, and (b) the right end. Neglect energy due to transverse shear deformation.

accelerating. However, under the self-straining caused by the temperature change, it is statically indeterminate
internally.

13. The aerodynamic advantages of high aspect-ratio (AR) wings are well-known--long span reduces lift-
induced drag and narrow chord promotes laminar flow to reduce skin-friction drag. However, a long wing span
significantly increases the structural loads at the wing root requiring heaver components to safely transmit the
loading to the fuselage. The truss-braced wing (TWB) is a method to reduce the load at the wing root. (It is the
subject of research in AOE at Virginia Tech under a NASA program to achieve significant fuel savings for 737
type airplanes (Warwick, 2011)). A simplified model of TWB in this exercise is a single truss bar supporting a
wing spar.

     A wing spar is clamped at its root and supported by a truss bar that is pinned to the support at one end and
pinned to the spar at the other end. Refer to figure 6.34. The spar is subjected to a span-wise distributed air load
fy(z) approximated by

                                  3L  z 2      0  -z-  1 .                                            (a)

where the lift on the wing is denoted by L and the wing span is denoted by b. The pin connection of the truss bar
to the spar is at the span-wise distance s  b from the root, where the range of nondimensional parameter s is
0<s1.

     The assemblage is statically indeterminate, and the statically determinate base structure is obtained by
removing the lower pin support of the truss bar and replacing it by the redundant force Q which is also the tensile
force in the truss bar. Refer to the right-hand sketch in figure 6.34. The condition of compatibility is the displace-
ment corresponding to the redundant is equal to zero. Enforce compatibility by Castigliano's second theorem

CHAPTER 7  Arches, rings and
           fuselage frames

A common structural component in aerospace structures is a curved bar. For example, fuselage frames are often
composed of slender curved elements and thin rings. The Winkler1 theory for the linear elastic response of co-
planar curved bars within their plane is presented in article 7.1. (Also refer to Langhaar, 1962). The Winkler the-
ory models both thick and thin curved bars. A curved bar is generally considered thin if the ratio of the radius of
curvature to its the in-plane thickness is greater than ten. Ratios less than ten are considered thick bars. It is
assumed that there is no out-of-plane bending and torsion of the bar in article 7.1. Consistent with this limitation
and assumption is an idealization employed in aircraft structural analyses that a ring frame is coplanar structure
supporting loads in its plane and not supporting loads normal to its plane. Out-of plane bending and torsion of
planar, thin curved bars is reviewed in the article by Chidamparam and Leissa (1993).

7.1 Coplanar curved bars

The reference axis of the bar is defined as a uniformly continuous plane curve within a closed interval. It is
assumed that the cross sections of the bar are symmetric with respect to the plane of the reference axis, and that
the locus of points along the centroids of each cross section coincide with the reference axis. Only deformations
of the bar in the plane of symmetry are considered.

     The Cartesian coordinates of the reference axis with origin at point O are denoted by y0(s) and z0(s) in the
plane of symmetry, where s denotes the curvilinear coordinate of the reference axis. Geometry of the curved bar
in its plane of symmetry is shown in figure. 7.1. The position vector of the reference axis with respect to the ori-

gin O is r(s) = y0(s)j^0 + z0(s)k^0 , where j^0 and k^0 are fixed unit vectors along the positive y0 and z0 directions,
respectively. The unit tangent vector to the reference axis at point s is

             Fig. 7.1 Geometry of a coplanar curved bar defined in its plane of symmetry.

The Cartesian coordinates in a cross section are denoted by x and y with origin at the centroid labeled C as is
shown in section A-A of figure. 7.1. Let (s) denote the angle from the fixed unit vector k^0 to the unit tangent
vector ^t(s) , and let ^j(s) denote the unit vector normal to reference axis at s. The positive y-coordinate is directed
along the unit normal ^j(s) . From the triangular insert in figure. 7.1 we see that the differential Cartesian coordi-
nates along the reference axis are related to the angle  by dy0 = (-sin )ds and dz0 = ( cos )ds . Thus, the
unit tangent vector ^t(s) and the unit normal vector ^j(s) to the reference axis at s are given by

                     ^t(s) = -sin (s)j^0 + cos (s)k^0          j(^s) = cos (s)j^0 + sin (s)k^0 .                  (7.2)

From the previous equation we obtain the derivatives of the unit tangent vector and unit normal vector with
respect to arc-length as

                                   d^t -^j             d^j ^t                     1 d

where R(s) denotes the radius of curvature of the reference axis at s. A curve parallel to the reference axis is

O be denoted by R , where R(s, y) = r(s) + y^j(s) . Then, the differential of this position vector along the paral-
lel curve is dR = dS^t , where dS is the differential arc-length along the parallel curve. The differential arc-
length of the parallel curve is related to the corresponding differential arc length of the reference axis by

7.1.1 Displacements and strain

Consider the displacement of a particle located by R(S, y) on the parallel curve to the position located by dis-
placement vector R*(S*, y) with respect to origin O on the parallel curve in the deformed bar. Let S* denote the
arc-length along the parallel curve in the deformed bar, where the y-coordinate remains unchanged in the defor-
mation. That is, it is assumed the cross section remains rigid in its own plane. We write the position of the par-

ticle in the deformed bar with respect to its position in the undeformed bar as R* = R + u , where the
displacement vector is defined by

                                                 u(S, y) = us(S, y)^t(s) + uy(S, y)^j(s) .                                                   (7.5)

The differential of R*(S*, y) along the parallel curve in the deformed bar is given by

                   *           ^d ^                                          ^ d^                 y  -1

The last result is written as

     The differential arc-length along the parallel curve in the deformed bar is determined by
(dS*)2 = dR*  dR* , and the unit tangent vector to the parallel curve in the deformed bar is t^* = (dR*) / (dS*) .

The stretch ratio  is defined by dS* = dS , and with regard to eq. (7.8)  = (1 + )2 + 2 . Consider the
binomial series 1 +  = 1 +  / 2 - 2 / 8  ... . For  = 2 + 2 + 2 , the binomial series for the stretch ratio
is  = 1 +  + 2 / 2 + ... . Since the engineering strain is defined by  - 1 =  + 2 / 2 + ... , we see that to the
lowest degree in the series expansion of the engineering strain that  is interpreted as the normal strain of a par-
allel curve for infinitesimal deformation. To interpret the physical meaning of  a graph of eq. (7.8) is shown in
figure. 7.2(a). Let  denote the angle between the unit tangent vector ^t of the parallel curve in the undeformed
bar and the unit tangent vector t^* of the parallel curve in the deformed bar. From the geometry of the triangle in

     Fig. 7.2 (a) Differential line element of a parallel curve in the deformed bar. (b) Relationship of
     the displacement of a particle on a parallel curve to the displacement of the corresponding
     particle on the reference axis.

The relationship between the displacement vector of the parallel curve to the displacement vector of the
reference axis is based on the assumptions that plane cross sections normal to the reference axis remain
normal to the reference axis in the deformed bar and that the cross section remains rigid in its own plane.
These assumptions, which are the basis of classical beam theory, are depicted in figure. 7.2(b). Thus,

                                               u(S, y) = uC(s) + y(j^* - ^j) ,                                                                                 (7.11)
where the displacement vector of the reference axis is defined by

                                            uC(s) = w(s)^t(s) + v(s)^j(s) .                                                                                    (7.12)

Substitute eq. (7.5) for u(S, y) in eq. (7.11), followed by substitutions of eq. (7.10) and (7.12) into eq. (7.11) to
find

                                          us = w(s) + y(s)                                      uy = v(s) .                                                    (7.13)

Although the displacements (7.13) are linear in the thickness coordinate y, note that the strain (7.16) is nonlinear
in y.

7.1.2 Normal stress, stress resultants, and strain energy

The material of the bar is assumed to linear elastic, isotropic, and homogeneous. Then, the normal stress  acting
on the cross section is related to the normal strain  via Hooke's law. As was discussed in article 3.7 we take
 = E , where E is the modulus of elasticity of the material. The result for the normal stress is written as

                                                                               2
                                          E  dw dw d v  wdR 
                          = ------------v + R------ + y ------ - R 2 + ---------  .                          (7.17)
                                       R + y          ds  ds ds  R ds 

The normal force N and bending moment M about the centroidal x-axis of the cross section are related to the nor-
mal stress by

                                                      (N, M) = (1, y)dA ,                                    (7.18)
                                                                         A

where A denotes the cross-sectional area of the bar. Substitute Hooke's law for the normal stress (7.17) into eq.
(7.18) to get the relation between the resultants and the displacements. In this substitution process the following
integrals over the cross section occur:

                          dA              A                 ydA                     y2dA

in which Y is the dimensionless parameter of Winkler's curved bar theory. Equivalence of the three integrals
(7.19) with respect to parameter Y can be demonstrated by dividing the denominator into the numerator of the

integrand in the first two integrals and noting  ydA = 0 , since y is measured from the centroid. Langhaar
                                                                               A

(1962) states that the third expression in eq. (7.19) is the most convenient for the evaluation of the parameter Y if
numerical integration is required. If R  y , then the third expression in eq. (7.19) approximates Y as

                                 Y  Yappx = I / (AR2)     where                   I = y2dA .                 (7.20)

Substitution of eq. (7.23) into the expression for the normal stress (7.17), yields the stress in terms of resultants
as

                =         N    +    1  +  ----------y----------  M           or   = ---1----RN + M + ------y------M---- .      (7.24)

Note the normal stress at the centroid (y = 0) in pure bending (N = 0) is  = M / (RA) . That is, the centroidal
axis does not coincide with the neutral axis of the cross section for the curved bar. The neutral axis of the curved
bar is located radially inward from the centroidal axis, i.e., y = -RY / (1 + Y) . For pure bending of a straight bar
the  = 0 at the centroid, so the centroidal axis and neutral axis coincide.

The complementary strain energy is given by

                                                     * 1 2                                                                     (7.25)

Example 7.1     Pure bending of a circular bar with a rectangular cross section.

The reference axis is a segment of a circle of radius a. Thus, the radius of curvature is uniform with respect to the

arc-length along the reference axis, and R = a . The cross section is a solid rectangle of height h and width b.
The bar is subject to equal and opposite moments M at each end, and no other loads. See figure. 7.3. Equilibrium
is satisfied by the fact that the bending moment in the bar at each cross section is equal to the applied moment M,
and that the circumferential force N vanishes at each cross section. The normal stress distribution through the
thickness at a typical cross section is determined from eq. (7.24).

7.2 Strain-displacement and Hooke's law for thin curved bars

It was demonstrated in example 7.1 and example 7.2 that some equations of straight bar theory are applicable to
the analysis of curved bars if the radius of curvature to the thickness in the plane of curvature is greater than ten.
If the ratio of the minimum radius of curvature to the in-plane thickness is greater than ten, then the bar is identi-
fied as a thin curved bar. Ratios less than ten are considered thick curved bars. For example, thin curved bar
formulas are applicable to fuselage ring-frames. Fittings, machine parts, crane hooks, and chain links are exam-
ples where thick curved bar theory is required. Thin curved bar formulas for strain, stress, stress resultants, and
complementary strain energy are as follows:

Example 7.3  Circular arch

Consider a thin curved bar that forms a circular arch as shown in figure. 7.7. It is supported by smooth pins at
each end. The distance L between the end supports remains fixed as the arch is subject to a downward force P at
midspan. The area of the cross section is denoted by A, the radius of the circular arc passing through the centroid

of each cross section by a, and its semi-opening angle by  . The arch is statically indeterminate and the horizon-
tal reaction force Q is the redundant. The overall free body diagram of the arch is shown in figure. 7.7.

Solution to part (a). The arch is symmetric about the vertical axis through the center, so only the left-half sec-
tion is analyzed. The free body diagram shown in figure. 7.8 cuts the arch at angle  measured counterclockwise
from the vertical axis, and 0     . The internal actions on the cut face are the circumferential normal force N,
transverse shear force V, and the bending moment M. The cut face is a negative  -face with a positive normal
force causing circumferential extension, a positive shear force is defined radially inward, and a positive bending
moment causes tension on the radially outboard circumference.

In the previous integral, integration is performed over the left-hand portion of the arch, and the total complemen-
tary energy stored in the arch is accounted for by the factor of two multiplying the integral. Since the displace-
ment in the direction of the horizontal redundant force Q is zero, Castigliano's second theorem gives

0 = (U* ) / (Q) . Thus,

Note that this ratio is independent of the radius a. The distance L between the supports is fixed at one meter, and
L = 2a sin . Hence, the radius of the arch is a function of the semi-opening angle  given by

                                                              a = (1m) / (2 sin) .                                                                                                             (i)

Example 7.4  Thin ring subject to diametric tension

A uniform, thin ring of radius a is subject to equal and opposite tension forces labeled P as shown in the left
sketch in figure. 7.10. This configuration is symmetric about the horizontal diameter AB and the vertical diame-
ter. Determine the bending moment distribution in the upper right-hand quarter segment of the ring where the
angle  has the range 0     / 2 . Include only bending deformations in Castigliano's second theorem to deter-
mine the redundant actions.

Solution. The right-hand sketch in figure. 7.10 shows the free body diagrams obtained by sectioning the ring
across diameter AB. Action-reaction pairs of the internal circumferential normal forces, internal transverse shear
forces, and internal bending moments are labeled in the free body diagrams. The upper and lower free body dia-
grams are mirror images of one another, which implies that the transverse shear forces VA in the upper and lower
free body diagrams should be drawn in the same direction at the cut at A. But this mirror image argument is in
contradiction with the action-reaction pairing. So to resolve this contradiction means that the transverse shear
force VA = 0 . A similar argument implies that the transverse shear force at cut B must vanish (i.e., VB = 0 ).

     From symmetry about the vertical diameter the circumferential normal forces NA and NB are equal and the
bending moments MA and MB are equal. Vertical force equilibrium yields NA = NB = P / 2 . Thus, the only
redundant is the bending moment MA . A free body diagram of the section from point A to the cut at  is shown
in figure. 7.11.

Moment equilibrium about the cut at  determines the bending moment as

                        M = MA + a(1 - cos )(P / 2) .                                                (a)

Example 7.5  Funicular arch

Consider a uniform, pinned-pinned arch subject to uniformly distributed load of intensity p0 that is directed ver-
tically downward as shown in figure. 7.14. For example p0 could represent the weight per unit length of the arch.
We determine the form or shape of the arch such that each cross section is in pure compression (i.e., there is no
bending). This condition of pure compression under a uniform lateral load can be achieved with a curved bar, but
not with a straight bar or beam. A beam carries a uniform lateral load by bending. Tailoring the shape of the arch
for pure compression to the uniformly distributed loading defines the funicular arch. All of the parallel fibers in a
cross section are under the same compressive stress, which means all of the material in the cross section is uti-
lized in resisting the load.

                                                                  p0

For the bending moment and shear force to vanish for all values of s the equilibrium equations (7.35) to (7.40)
reduce to the following:

                                   1 dN                                  N

Eliminating the tangential force between the last two equations leads to the following differential equation for the
radius of curvature:

                                              d

7.4 Loads on fuselage frames

The skins, or webs, in semimonocoque construction are thin and cannot withstand large concentrated loads.
Instead, stiffeners are located into the design of the structure where the concentrated loads are applied. The con-
centrated load acting on the stiffener diffuses the load to the attached skins or webs. For example, a fuselage
structure has closely spaced frames or bulkheads that resist loads in the transverse planes, while the fuselage
shell resist loads in the fore-and-aft direction. Typically, frames react to point loads from the wing spar attach-

plane loading. In the following analyses, we quantitatively determine how loads applied to frames are transferred
to the attached skin, followed by the determination of the internal actions in the frame. Additional examples of
loads acting on fuselage frames and wing ribs are given in Bruhn (1973), Curtis (1997), and Megson (1999).

As shown in figure. 7.17(c) the shear flows acting on the cross section of the fuselage immediately fore and aft of

     Assume the geometry of the fuselage shell is the same fore and aft of the frame. Substitute eq. (7.43) for the
shear flows in the skin fore and aft of the frame into eq. (7.42) to find the shear flow exerted on the skin by the
frame as

     The expression (7.45) for the interface shear flow in this example reduces to q = -Fy(s)Py . The contour
coordinate s is related to the polar angle  by s = a , where the radius of the circular contour a = 50 in. , and
0   < 2 radians. The contour distribution function Fy(s) , or Fy() , is given by eq. (7.46), which is a evalu-
ated by computing the first area moment with respect to the x-axis of a portion of the skin-stringer fuselage from
 = - / 2 to a value in the range - / 2 <  < 3 / 2 . The expression for the first area moment Qx() is facili-
tated by accumulating the first area moments in each of the six segments of the contour.

      Beginning at  = - / 2 , and proceeding counterclockwise around the contour, the first area moments of
the skin-stringer structure with respect to the x-axis are denoted by Qxi() , i = 1, 2, ..., 6 . The first area
moments are calculated as follows:

the x-axis passes through the centroid.

     The expression for the shear flow distribution function from eq. (7.46) is written as

Example 7.7  Bending moment in the frame of example 7.6

We use symmetry of the frame about the y-axis and draw a free body diagram of the right half of the frame as
shown in figure. 7.22. Consequently, the frame has three vertical cuts: cut a is at the bottom of the frame, cut b at
the top, and cut c at the center of the floor beam. The action of the left half of the frame on the right half is repre-
sented by three forces Na, Nb, and Nc, and by three moments Ma, Mb, and Mc at the location of the three cuts as
shown in figure. 7.22. Shear forces at cuts a, b, and c vanish by symmetry conditions similar to what was dis-
cussed in example 7.4. These six unknown actions at the cuts are related by the three independent equations of
equilibrium for the overall free body diagram in figure. 7.22. Hence, this is a statically indeterminate structure.
The redundants are determined from conditions of compatibility imposed via Castigliano's second theorem. The
solution process is divided into six steps:

1. Overall frame equilibrium

2. Solutions to the differential equilibrium equations for the frame

3. Bending moments in segments 1, 2, and 3 of the frame

Force equilibrium of the right half frame segment in the negative x-direction requires

The resultant force Rx = 0 as determined from the interface shear flows given in example 7.6. Hence, force
equilibrium in the x-direction reduces to

                                                Na + Nb + Nc = 0 .                                          (b)

Force equilibrium of the right half frame segment in the y-direction requires

Substituting the interface shear flows from example 7.6 we find the force Ry = Py / 2 . So force equilibrium in
the y-direction is identically satisfied. Torsional equilibrium about the origin yields

                        Mz + Mb + Mc - Ma + aNb - (a / 2)Nc - aNa - (L / 4)(Py / 2) = 0 ,                   (d)

Each interface shear flow has the functional form

                             qi() = Ai + B cos                      i = 1, 2, 3 ,                                       (g)

Substitute eq. (g) for the shear flow in eq. (f), then the resulting differential equation is solved for N() to get

                             N() = c1 cos  + c2 sin  - (aB / 2) cos  .                                                  (i)

Equilibrium equations (7.35) and (7.40) determine the shear force and bending moment as

                                                         dN

                                                         d

It is convenient to determine the three constants c1, c2, and c3 in terms of the forces and moment at the point
 =  by the following conditions

                             N() = N                     V() = V             M() = M .                                  (k)

The point  on the contour is either the initial point or final point of the contour segment. The statically admis-
sible solution for the normal force, shear force, and bending is

       N (  ;  )             cos ( - )                          -sin ( - )         0 Nq(;)

Solution to part 3. Bending moments in segments 1, 2, and 3 of the frame

     The range for the solution interval in frame segment 1 is - / 2    - / 6 , and we let   - / 2 ,
N  Na , V  0 , and M  Ma in eq. (i). The numerical result for the bending moment in segment 1 is

     M1() = 50Na(1 + sin ) + Ma - 16, 487.8-2509.25 + 12, 363.1 cos  + 6, 273.1 cos - 12, 546.3 sin  .        (n)

     The range for the solution interval in frame segment 3 is  / 6     / 2 , and we let    / 2 , N  Nb ,
V  0 , and M  Mb in eq. (i). The numerical result for the bending moment in segment 3 is

     M3() = 50Nb(1 - sin ) + Mb + 16, 487.8 - 2, 509.25 - 12, 363.1 cos  + 6, 273.13 cos - 12, 546.3 sin  . (o)

      The range for the solution interval in frame segment 2 is - / 6     / 6 , and we let    / 6 ,
N  N2a , V  V2a , and M  M2a in eq. (i). At the junction of segment 2 and 3 where  =  / 6 , we
impose continuity conditions

The result of imposing the previous continuity conditions is to express N2a, V2a, M2a in terms of Nb and Mb.
The numerical results for the bending moments in segments 2 is

     M2() = 50Nb(1 - sin ) + Mb + 17, 144.7 - 3, 763.88 - 12, 990.4 cos  + 6, 273.13 cos - 11, 459.7 sin  . (q)

Solution to part 4. Floor beam equilibrium
The internal shear force in the floor beam is denoted by V4 and the bending moment by M4. Equilibrium of the

The axial force Nc is uniform in the beam.

Solution to part 5. Equilibrium at the junction of the floor beam and frame.
A free body diagram of the junction of the frame and the floor beam is shown in figure. 7.23. Force equilibrium

Equation (t) leads to Na + Nb + Nc = 0 , which is satisfied by the solution for Nc from the tangential equilibrium
equation. Torsional equilibrium at the junction yields

                               M2(- / 6) - M1(- / 6) + (Mc + PyL / 8) = 0 .                                 (u)

Numerical evaluation of the torsional equilibrium equation gives

                               23, 039.4 - Ma + Mb + Mc-25Na + 75Nb = 0 ,                                   (v)

which is solved for Mc to get

                               Mc = - 23, 039.4 + Ma - Mb + 25.Na - 75.Nb .                                 (w)

The overall torsional equilibrium equation (d) is identically satisfied for the results determined for Nc and Mc
from equilibrium at the junction. At this point in the solution process all static equilibrium equations are satisfied,
and the expressions for the bending moments in the frame are

M1() = 50.Na(1 + sin ) + Ma - 16, 487.8-2, 509.25 + 12, 363.1 cos  + 6, 273.13 cos  - 12, 546.3 sin  , (x)

M2() = 50.(1 - sin )Nb + Mb + 17, 144.7 + (-12, 990.4 + 6, 273.13) cos  - 11, 459.7 sin  , and              (y)

M3() = 50(1 - sin )Nb + Mb + 16, 487.8 - 2, 509.25 + (-12, 363.1 + 6, 273.13) cos  - 12, 546.3 sin  .       (z)

The bending moment in the floor beam is

                      M4(x) = - 23, 039.41 + Ma - Mb + 25Na - 75Nb + 6x2 .                                  (aa)

The unknown parameters Na, Ma, Nb, and Mb in this statically admissible solution, eqs. (x) to (aa), are the redun-
dants.

Solution to part 6. Compatibility conditions
To determine the redundants we impose compatibility by using Castigliano's second theorem. Neglect the com-
plementary strain energies due to the tangential force N and the shear force V, which implies that complementary
strain energy in bending is the main contributor to the deflections of the frame. Assume for simplicity that the
flexural stiffness EI of the frame and the floor beam are the same. Symmetry about the vertical axis of the frame

After substituting eqs. (x) to (aa) into eq. (ab) we find

b) The structural stiffness of the arch is defined by K = P/. For a straight beam having the same flexural
     stiffness as the arch, spanning the distance L between the supports, and subject to force P at midspan,
     the structural stiffness is Kb = P / b = (48EI) / L3 . Plot the ratio of the arch stiffness to the beam
     stiffness K / Kb as a function of the rise-to-span ratio given by eq. (h). Use the numerical data given in

of the frame is also shown in the sketch below. The action of the left half on the right half of the frame are repre-

sented by normal forces Na and Nb, and bending moments Ma and Mb. The shear forces Va and Vb acting on the

cross sections at A and B vanish because of symmetry. There are four unknown actions at A and B but only three

independent equilibrium equations for the right half of the frame. Hence, the half frame is singly redundant.

a) Determine the redundant in terms of parameters a and P from the compatibility equation obtained by
     application of Castigliano's second theorem. Include only the bending moments in the complementary
     strain energy, and assume the flexural stiffness EI is uniform in the frame.

b) List the values of Na, Nb, Ma, and Mb in terms of parameters a and P.

8.1 Fibrous composites

A composite material consists of two or more constituents that are chemically distinct on a macroscopic scale
and have a recognizable interface between them. An important class of composites for aerospace applications are
fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRP). Fiber-reinforced polymer composites consist of continuous and
aligned fibers embedded in a polymer matrix. Continuous glass fibers are 3-20 탆 in diameter, with most about
12 탆. The diameter of carbon and graphite fibers is about 8 탆. Fibers are inherently much stiffer and stronger
than the same material in bulk form. The polymer matrix supports, protects, and transfers stresses to the fibers.
Typically the matrix is of considerably lower density, stiffness, and strength than the fibers. Polymers are subdi-
vided into thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermoset polymers, such as epoxies, become cross-linked during fab-
rication and do not soften on reheating. Thermoplastic polymers, such as PEEK, soften on heating and can be
reshaped with heat and pressure. Usually fibers are bundled in tows, which can consist of 3,000 to 30,000 fibers.

     The unidirectional lamina is the basic form of a continuous fiber composite (i.e., one with all fibers in the
same direction as shown in figure. 8.1). It can be fabricated from pre-impregnated tape (filament tows pre-
impregnated with epoxy), filament winding, pultrusion, or resin transfer molding (RTM). The thickness of lam-
ina, denoted by tply, in a laminate is typically about 0.127 mm (0.005 in.). Laminates are fabricated by stacking

unidirectional lamina at different fiber orientations followed by curing. Curing is a drying process of the matrix
material to form a bond between the fibers and between the lamina.

     The advantage of polymer-composites aerospace structures are many: They weigh less
than equivalent-strength aluminum, do not corrode or fatigue, require less maintenance, and
reduce the need for drilled holes and parts. Composite parts generally cost more than equiva-
lent metal parts, but that premium is decreasing. And the cost premium is offset by operating
savings in fuel and maintenance (Canaday, 2015).

8.1.1 Material law in principal directions

Fiber-reinforced composites are usually treated as a linear elastic material with orthotropic material properties in
the material principal directions (i.e directions parallel and perpendicular to the fibers). In a right-handed Carte-
sian system denoted by x1-x2-x3, let the x1-axis be parallel to the fibers, the x2-axis be transverse to the fibers, and
the x3-axis be parallel to the thickness of the lamina. (Also, refer to discussion with respect to eq. (A.131) in the
appendix.) In the discussion of the material law, it is convenient to use a contracted notation for strain compo-
nents and the corresponding stress components. The contracted notation defines the 6-by-1 engineering strain
vector in principal material directions as

                                                                       T

where the normal strains are denoted by 11, 22, and 33, and the shear strains are denoted by 23, 31, and 12.
The corresponding 6-by-1 stress vector in principal material directions is

                                                                          T

The nine independent engineering constants are described as follows:
 Moduli of elasticity in the fiber direction, transverse direction, and thickness direction are denoted by E1, E2,

    and E3, respectively.
 The principal Poisson's ratios are 21, 31, and 32.
 Shear moduli in the 2-3 plane, 3-1 plane, and 1-2 plane are denoted by G23, G31, and G12, respectively.

The three minor Poisson's ratios, 12, 13, and 23 , are determined from symmetry of the compliance matrix.
Material characterization tests are conducted to measure the nine independent engineering constants. However,
the most accurate measurements are made for the in-plane properties E1, E2, 21, and G12.

8.1.2 Compliance matrix in bar coordinate directions
Consider the thin-walled bar, or beam, analysis presented in article 3.2 to article 3.5. Instead of a the wall com-
posed of a homogeneous, linear elastic material as in article 3.7, we now take the wall to be composed of a
fibrous composite material. The fibers are parallel and contained in thin layers, or lamina, that are normal to the
thickness coordinate direction  of the wall. Within a lamina the bar contour coordinate direction s, and longitu-
dinal direction z, are not, in general, aligned with the material principal coordinate directions x1 and x2. Define a
positive angle  by the counterclockwise rotation from the positive z-axis to the positive x1-axis as shown in fig-
ure. 8.3.

     To determine the off-axis compliance material law we pre-multiply the on-axis material law (8.3) by matrix
 T1 , followed by substituting of eq. (8.14) for the on-axis stresses on the right-hand side of eq. (8.3). Use the

                        T

fact that T1 = T2 from eq. (8.15). Denote the 6X6 off-axis compliance matrix by C and we find that

                                        T

 C = T1 C T1 . The form of the off-axis material law is

8.1.3 Plane stress

Since composites used in many structural applications are thin plates or thin shells, the assumption of a plane
stress state as used plate and shell theory is also made for a composite plate. In figure. 8.2 the in-plane stress
components are 11, 22, and 12. Thus, the following stress components are assumed negligible with respect to
the in-plane stress components and set equal to zero in eq. (8.3):

                             33 = 31 = 13 = 32 = 23 = 0 .                                                                                                                    (8.24)

Hence, the compliance form of the orthotropic material law for a unidirectional lamina subject to plane stress is

Composite materials are identified by the name of the fiber followed by the name of the matrix. For example,
AS4/3501-6 denotes the carbon fiber AS4 and the epoxy matrix 3501-6. The data in table 8.2 is taken from Hera-
kovich (1998, p.14), and it lists typical properties for AS4/3501-6 and T300/5208 carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy

Example 8.1        Transformed reduced stiffness matrix for an off-axis ply

Determine the transformed reduced stiffness matrix of T300/5208 carbon/epoxy for a 30-degree off-axis lamina
in U.S. customary units.

Solution. From table 8.2 E1 = 19.2 Msi , E2 = 1.56 Msi , 21 = 0.24 , and G12 = 0.82 Msi . The minor
Poisson's ratio is 12 = 0.24[(1.56 Msi) / (19.2 Msi)] = 0.0195 . The reduced stiffness matrix is computed
from eq. (8.30) and eq. (8.31); i.e.,

                   19.3 0.376 0

                   Q = 0.376 1.57 0 Msi .                                                                                              (a)

The transformed reduced stiffness matrix is given by Q = T1 Q T1 , the reduced stiffness by eq.
(8.27), and the transform matrix T1 by eq. (8.28). The matrix product is

                   1 / 4 3 / 4 - 3 / 2 19.3 0.376 0 1 / 4 3 / 4 3 / 4

                   Q = 3 / 4 1 / 4 3 / 2 0.376 1.57 0 3 / 4 1 / 4 - 3 / 4 ,                                                            (b)

8.1.5 Laminated wall
Laminates are made by stacking the unidirectional lamina, also called plies, at different fiber orientations. The
plies are usually bound together by the same matrix material that is used within the lamina. Laminates are desig-
nated by the ply angle stacking sequence. A 45 - 45 0 90 stacking sequence denotes a 4-ply laminate with plies

at 45, - 45, 0, and 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal z-axis. A 45 - 45 0 90 2 stacking sequence denotes
an 8-ply laminate with plies at 45, - 45, 0, 90, 45,- 45, 0, and 90 degrees. A 45 - 45 0 90 S stacking sequence
denotes an 8-ply symmetric laminate with plies at 45, - 45, 0, 90, 90, 0, - 45, and 45 degrees. The assumptions of
lamination theory are

 The laminate consists of perfectly bonded layers or lamina.
 Each layer is a homogeneous material with known effective properties.
 Each layer is in a state of plane stress.
 Individual layers can be isotropic or orthotropic.

232                                                                          Aerospace Structures

     Consistent with thin-walled bar theory in chapter 3, we assume that the strains zz , ss , and  zs are spa-
tially uniform through the thickness of the wall. That is, there is no local bending of the laminated wall. The
laminate can stretch and shear in-plane as membrane. For a laminate of Np-plies, the material law for the k-th ply,
where k = 1, 2, ..., Np , is obtained from eq. (8.30) as

                             (k)                           (k)     k = 1, 2, ..., Np .    (8.32)

     Even though the strains are uniform through the thickness of the wall, note that the stresses are piecewise
constant through the thickness of the wall since the transformed reduced stiffness matrix changes from ply to ply.
Let the origin of the thickness coordinate  be at the midplane of the laminate, such that -t / 2    t / 2 , where t
denotes the total thickness of the laminated wall. The stress resultant ns , the axial stress resultant nz , and the
shear flow q are defined by integrals through the thickness of the wall of the corresponding stresses; i.e.,

where  = k at the bottom of the k-th ply, and  = k + 1 at the top of the k-th ply. Denote the thickness of the
k-th ply by tk such that k + 1 - k = tk . Substitute for the stresses from Hooke's law (8.32) into eq. (8.33) to get

Stiffness elements A11 and A22 correspond to in-plane extensional stiffnesses in the s- and z-directions, respec-
tively. Element A66 corresponds to a shear stiffness in the s-z plane, stiffnesses A21 = A12 are Poisson's type
terms, and stiffnesses A61 = A16 and A62 = A26 couple in-plane shear and extension. The in-plane stiffness
matrix depends on the content of the layers in the laminate, and is independent of the stacking sequence of the
layers through the thickness of the laminate.

Example 8.2  In-plane stiffness matrix for a laminate with two plies

Consider a two-ply  - laminate with plies of equal thickness t/2.
(a) Determine the [A] matrix
(b) Evaluate the [A] matrix for T300/5208 with  = 30 and t / 2 = 0.005 in.

Solution to part (a). The transformed reduced stiffnesses are given by eq. (8.31) in which m = cos and
n = sin  . Note that stiffnesses Q11 , Q22 , Q66 , and Q21 are even functions of the ply angle  , and stiffnesses
Q61 and Q62 are odd functions of  . Thus,

Solution to part (b). From the T300/5208 example on page 231 Q11(30) = 2.843 Msi ,
Q22(30) = 11.7 Msi , Q66(30) = 3.975 Msi , and Q21(30) = 3.531 Msi . Thus,

8.1.6 Balanced and specially orthotropic laminates

A laminate consisting of off-axis plies with positive fiber angles i and off-axis plies with negative fiber angles
-i , i = 1, 2, 3, ..., imax , with each i -ply and -i -ply having the same thickness and material properties, is
called a balanced laminate. For example, a stacking sequence [30/-30]2S is a balanced laminate consisting of
eight plies if each 30 -ply and -30 -ply have the same thickness and material properties. For a balanced lami-

234                                                                                 Aerospace Structures
                                      Composite thin-walled bar with a closed cross-sectional contour

nate the in-plane stiffness coefficients A16 = A61 = 0 , and A26 = A62 = 0 as example 8.2 illustrates. The in-
plane material law for a balanced laminate reduces to the form

                      ns              A11 A12 0            ss
                                                           zz .
                      nz = A21 A22 0                                                             (8.37)

                      q               0 0 A66  zs

In eq. (8.37) resultants ns and nz are independent of the shear strain  zs , and the shear flow q is independent of
the normal strains ss and zz. That is, there is no coupling between in-plane extension and shear. Laminates
whose material law is given by (8.37) are also said to be specially orthotropic. Laminates consisting of only 0
and 90 plies are specially orthotropic laminates, since the product mn = cos sin = 0 in the last two rows

of (8.31) results in Q16 = Q26 = 0 for these laminates. Hence, a [0/90] laminate has coupling stiffnesses
A16 = A26 = 0 as can be recognized from eq. (8.36). Another example of a specially orthotropic laminate is a
stacking sequence [45/0/90]S .

8.2.1 Anisotropic Hooke's law for the cross section

Set ns = 0 in eq. (8.35), and solve for the normal strain ss to eliminate it in the material law. We write the
resulting material law in several forms to be used in subsequent developments:

                      nz = Bzz + bq                      q = Bs sz + Bzzz , and         (8.44)

                                      zz = ---(nz - bq)       sz = ---(aq - bnz) .

                                              B                      B
The coefficients in the previous equations are

                         B = A22 - A12A21 / A11 - bBz ,                                 (8.46)

                      Bs = A66 - A61A16 / A11            Bz = A62 - A12A61 / A11 , and  (8.47)

                            1                                b = Bz / Bs .              (8.48)
                      a = ---- (A22 - A12A21 / A11)

                            Bs

The stiffness parameters b and Bz represent the shear-extension coupling of the laminated wall, since they are
directly related to stiffnesses A61 and A62 by eqs. (8.47) and (8.48). In a specially orthotropic laminate
A61 = A62 = 0 , so b = Bz = 0 . There is no material coupling between shear and extension in a specially
orthotropic laminate.

     The second assumption is traditional for the beam theory and states that the axial strain is a linear function of
coordinates x and y. From eq. (3.30) on page 38 the axial normal strain along the contour ( = 0) is

                         zz = dw + y(s)dx + x(s)dy .                                    (8.49)

where w(z) is the axial displacement of the cross section, x(z) is the rotation of the cross section about the x-
axis, and y(z) is the rotation of the cross section about the negative y-axis. Refer to figure. 8.5. Substitute eq.
(8.49) for the strain in the first equation of (8.44) to get the normal stress resultant as

                         nz = Bdw + y(s)dx + x(s)dy + bq .                              (8.50)

Substitute the previous expression for the normal stress resultant into the definition of the bar resultant N in eq.

In eq. (8.52) the modulus-weighted extensional stiffness of the cross section of the beam is denoted by S , the

and Y(s) are the Cartesian coordinates of the contour with respect to an arbitrary origin at point O (see Fig. 3.1
on page 31). The coordinates (Xc, Yc) of the modulus-weighted centroid are determined from

Since Sx = Sy = 0 , eq. (8.51) is written as

8.2.2 Expressions for the shear flow and normal stress resultant
Substitute the normal stress resultant from eq. (8.61) into the equilibrium differential equation (8.42), to get

Recall that the stiffness parameter b and the shear flow q are independent of coordinate z. Derivatives of N , Mx ,
and My with respect to z are determined from eqs. (8.54) and (8.60) as

                      dN dN                    dMx dMx                                   dMy dMy                        (8.64)

Derivatives of the bar resultants are given by equilibrium equations (8.38) and (8.39). Thus,

                      dN                       dMx                                       dMy                            (8.65)
                      ------ = 0               --------- = Vy                            --------- = Vx .

The derivative of the shear flow with respect to the contour coordinate reduces to

                                    dq                    k                           k

Now we integrate the previous result with respect to the contour coordinate from s = 0 to s = s and write the result
as

                                                              k                              k

where

                      q0 = q(0)                        s                                                 s              (8.68)

                                       Sx(s) = By(s)ds                                   Sy(s) = Bx(s)ds .

Substitute eq. (8.62) for x(s) and y(s) into eq. (8.68) to get

                      Sx(s) = Sx(s) - nySy(s)                    Sy(s) = Sy(s) - nxSx(s) ,                              (8.69)

where the modulus-weighted first moments of a segment of the cross-sectional area from s = 0 to s = s are defined
by

                                      s                                          s                                      (8.70)

                      Sx(s) = B(s)y(s)ds                         Sy(s) = B(s)x(s)ds .

                                      0                                          0

Note that Sx(s) and Sy(s) evaluated at the end point of the closed contour vanish, which is consistent with eq.
(8.53). The shear flow at the contour origin q0 is determined by torque equivalence of the shear flow with respect
to the modulus-weighted centroid. That is,

8.2.3 Complementary work and energy

Consider a free bending and torsion state of the bar as shown in figure. 8.4 where the displacements, strains, and
forces satisfy the compatibility conditions, Hooke's law, and the equilibrium conditions. In this state, the actual
displacements of the modulus-weighted centroid are uc(z), vc(z), and w(z) , and the corresponding forces are

240                                                                                                Aerospace Structures
                                                            Composite thin-walled bar with a closed cross-sectional contour

Vx(z), Vy(z), and N(z) , respectively. The actual rotations of a cross section with respect to the modulus-
weighted centroid are x(z), y(z), and z(z) , and the corresponding moments are Mx(z), My(z), and Mzc(z) ,
respectively. Now consider infinitesimal increments in the forces and moments denoted by
Vx, Vy, N, Mx, My, and MzC from the equilibrium state. For an element of the bar of length z, the com-
plementary work is given by

                     U*z = [Vxuc + Vyvc + Nw + Mxx + Myy + MzCz] z + z ,                                                                (8.81)

                                                                                                                                     z

where U* denotes the increment in the complementary work per unit axial length. Divide eq. (8.81) by z, and
let z  0 , to get in the limit

                        U* = ddz[Vxuc + Vyvc + Nw + Mxx + Myy + MzCz] .                                                                 (8.82)

Statically admissible incremental actions requires that they satisfy the equilibrium differential equations (8.38)
and (8.39): i.e.,

             ddzVx = ddzVy = ddzN = ddzMzc = 0                    ddzMx = Vy      ddzMy = Vx .                                          (8.83)
Imposing equilibrium (8.83) reduces eq. (8.82) to

                     *                         dw            d x             d y   d z
                  U = xcVx + ycVy +   N +   Mx +   My +   MzC ,                                                                         (8.84)

where shear strains averaged over the cross section of the bar relative to the centroid are defined by

                                          xc = duc + y      yc = dvc + x .                                                              (8.85)

An elastic material is defined by the existence of a complementary strain energy function per unit axial length

                  *                                                                   *
with the form U (Mx, My, N, Vx, Vy, MzC) . Then, the total increment in function U is

                        * U* U* U* U* U* U*
                  U = --------- Mx + --------- My + ---------N + ---------Vx + ---------Vy + ------------ MzC ,                         (8.86)

Identify the complementary work (8.84) with the complementary energy (8.86) to get the important properties of
complementary strain energy function. That is,

     Now consider the complementary work for the free bending and torsion state of an element of the wall s-
by-z as shown in Fig. 8.5. On the contour ( = 0) the axial displacement uz(s, z) corresponds to the stress

resultant nz and tangential displacement us(s, z) corresponds to the shear flow q. Let Uo* denote the increment
in the complementary work per unit area for increments in the stress resultants nz and q acting on the element
s-by-z of Fig. 8.5. Then, the complementary work is

                        *                                         z + z           s + s

Divide eq. (8.88) by sz , and let s  0 and z  0 , to get in the limit

                        Uo* = z[(nz)uz + (q)us] + s[(q)uz] ,                                       (8.89)

which expands to

Statically admissible increments in the stress resultants nz and q requires that they satisfy equilibrium equa-
tions (8.42) and (8.43), which are

                        z(nz) + s(q) = 0                          (q) = 0 .                        (8.91)
                                                                 z

From the strain-displacement relations (3.27) and (3.28) on page 37 we identify the axial normal strain zz and
the shear strain  sz as

                        zz = uz                         sz = uz + us .                             (8.92)
                               z                               s z

Substitute eqs. (8.91) and (8.92) into eq. (8.90) to get the increment in the complementary work per unit area as

                              Uo* = zznz +  szq .                                                  (8.93)

For an elastic material we identify Uo* with the increment in the complementary strain energy function per unit
area, which is a function of the stress resultants, or Uo*(nz, q) , with the properties

                                Uo*                               Uo*                              (8.94)
                        zz = ---------                     sz = --------- .

Now substitute Hooke's law (8.45) for the normal strain zz and for the shear strain  sz in the previous equation
to get

                        Uo* 1                             Uo* 1                                    (8.95)

The complementary strain energy function per unit area consistent with these properties (8.95) is

                        U*    =   1      (        n2   -  2bnzq  +  aq2  )  .                      (8.96)

The increment in the complementary energy per unit axial length U is defined U = Uo ds . Hence,

                          *1  2 캛1    (  n2           -  2bnzq  +  aq2  )ds      .                (8.97)

Equations (8.74) and (8.77) relate the shear flow and normal stress resultant to the bar forces N, Vx, and Vy and

the moments Mx, My, and Mz . Imposing the properties of the complementary strain energy for the bar given by
(8.87) to the expression (8.97) for the complementary strain energy, we get the following relations:

Example 8.3  Graphite-epoxy circular tube

Nixon (1987) conducted experiments on thin-walled tubes fabricated from T300/5208 graphite/epoxy. The test
specimens had a mean radius R = 20.32 mm, a wall thickness t = 1.016 mm, and were composed of two unidrec-
tional layers with angles 1 = -20 and 2 = 70 . The thickness of both layers is the same, and the properties
of the material are E1 = 146.7 GPa (21.3 ksi), E2 = 11.0 GPa (1.6 ksi), G12 = 6.41 GPa (0.93 ksi), principal Pois-
son's ration 21 = 0.38 and the minor Poisson's ratio 12 = 0.0285 . The twist per unit length dz / dz was

measured in the experiment for an applied axial force N and an applied torque Mz . Determine this relationship
from the composite bar theory.

Solution. The in-plane stiffness matrix is determined from A = Q( ) -- + Q( ) -- , where the formulastt

                                                                   12                 22

for the elements of transformed reduced stiffness matrix are listed in eq. (8.35). The result is

                      A11 A12 A16  67.8649 17.4628 15.6839

                      A21 A22 A26 = 17.4628 67.8649 -15.6839 MN/m .                                         (a)

                      A61 A62 A66  15.6839 -15.6839 19.6701

From eqs. (8.47) and (8.48) the stiffness parameters of the composite bar theory are

Bs = 16.0454 MN/m     Bz = -19.7196 MN/m             b = -1.22899  B = 39.1363 MN/m               a = 3.9495 . (b)

Note that the stiffness parameters are spatially uniform over the entire contour. Cartesian coordinates relative to
the center of the circular contour are x = R cos and y = R sin , 0   < 2 . From eq. (8.52) the axial stiff-
ness is S = 4.99669 MN , and the modulus-weighted first moments (8.70) are

                               2                                        2

Sx = 캛(s)y(s)ds = B  y()Rd = 0 Sy = 캛(s)x(s)ds = B  x()Rd = 0 . (c)
                               0                                        0

As a consequence of eq. (c) the modulus-weighted centroid coincides with the center of the circular contour. The
modulus-weighed second moments are computed from eq. (8.57), and the results are

                      Dxx = Dyy = BR3 = 1, 031.57 N-m2             Dxy = 0 .                                (d)

Thus, from eq. (8.59) and eq. (8.62) we find nx = ny = 0 , k = 1 , x = x , and y = y . The combined first
moment functions in eq. (8.69) are computed from the first moment functions in eq. (8.70). The results are

                               Sx() = BR2(1 - cos )  Sy() = BR2 sin  .                                      (e)

Note that Sx(0) = Sy(0) = Sx(2) = Sy(2) = 0 . The shear flow distribution functions Fxc and Fyc are com-
puted from eq. (8.75). Functions x, y,  , which couple shear and torsion to the normal stress resultant (8.77),
are computed from eqs. (8.78) to (8.80). In this example, the results for these functions are

                      sin          -cos

     The twist per unit length, or unit twist, for the circular tube is equal to c63N + c66Mz . The unit twist evalu-
ates as

The axial stiffness is

In this example the modulus-weighted centroid coincides with the geometric centroid of the cross section. The
Cartesian coordinates of the contour with respect to the modulus-weighted centroid are determined from
x(s) = X(s) - Xc and y(s) = Y(s) - Yc . The modulus-weighted second moments computed from eq. (8.57) are

The values of the parameters listed in eq. (8.59) are nx = ny = 0 and k = 1 . Hence, from eq. (8.62) we find

x(s) = x(s) and y(s) = y(s) . Also, from eq. (8.69) Sx(s) = Sx(s) and Sy(s) = Sy(s) . The modulus-
weighted distribution functions Sx(s) and Sy(s) with respect to a segment of the cross-sectional area are defined
in eq. (8.70), and the results for these functions are listed in table 8.6.

The procedure to determine Sx(s) and Sy(s) is the same procedure used to determine the first area moments
Qx(s) and Qy(s) for a cross section with a wall made of an isotropic material. See example 3.4 on page 71. For
the composite wall Sx(s) is analogous to Qx(s) of the isotropic wall, and Sy(s) is analogous to Qy(s) . Note

that Sx(0) = 0 in branch 1, and that Sx[2(bx + by)] = 0 in branch 4, which are necessary conditions for the

first moment about the centroidal x-axis. Similarly, Sy(0) = 0 in branch 1, and Sy[2(bx + by)] = 0 in branch 4,
which are necessary conditions for the first moment about the centroidal y-axis.

     The coordinates normal to the contour for each branch with respect to the centroid given by eq. (3.10) on
page 34, and the area enclosed by the contour, are as follows:

    rnc1 = rnc3 = by / 2 = 6.8 mm , rnc2 = rnc4 = bx / 2 = 12.1 mm , and Ac = bxby = 329.12 mm2 . (e)

The numerical evaluation of the shear flow distribution functions in eq. (8.75) can now be computed with the

pling is illustrated in the following numerical examples.

8.3 Open cross-sectional contour

For an open cross-sectional contour the shear flow is obtained from eq. (8.67) on page 239. The shear flow at the
contour origin q0 = 0 if the origin is located at intersection with a longitudinal free edge. (Refer to the discus-
sion in article 3.8.1 on page 51.) The equation for the shear flow for the FRP composite bar is

                                               k        k
             q(s) = - Sx(s)--------Vy - Sy(s)--------Vx .                   (8.113)
                                               Dxx      Dyy

The notes concerning the shear center in article 3.8.3 on page 57 apply as well to a bar made of an FRP compos-
ite. In particular from these notes, the resultant of the shear flow distribution over the contour is a force with com-
ponents Vx and Vy acting through the shear center such that there is no torque acting at the shear center. If the
cross section is subject to a torque, this torque cannot be balanced by the shear flow, which, according to eq.
(8.113), is uniquely determined by the shear forces Vx and Vy. Part (b) of example 8.5 on page 263 shows how to
find the shear center for an open section starting with eq. (8.113). After locating the shear center for the open
cross-sectional contour, a material law for the torque acting at the shear center remains to be determined. This
material law for torsion is developed in the next section.

8.4 Uniform torsion of an FRP bar with a rectangular cross section

We consider the uniform torsion of a prismatic bar with a rectangular cross section composed of a linear elastic,
anisotropic material. Cartesian coordinates of the bar are denoted by s - z -  , where the coordinate z is parallel
to the longitudinal axis of the bar. The origin of the coordinates s and  is at the center of the cross section;
-b / 2  s  b / 2 where the width of the cross section is denoted by b, and -t / 2    t / 2 where the thickness
by t. See figure. 8.11.

                                                    z

             torsion.

     The only applied load is a torque Mz about the z-axis, and the rotation about the z-axis corresponding to the
torque is denoted by z . The torque and rotation are positive counterclockwise as shown in figure. 8.11. The
shear stress components acting on the cross section are denoted by zs and z , and the torque is related to the
shear stresses by the following integral over the cross section:

             b/2 t/2

             Mz =   (zs - sz)dds .                                          (8.114)
                        -b / 2 -t / 2

The lateral surfaces of the bar are not subject any loads or tractions. Hence, the stress components must satisfy
the following conditions at the boundaries of the cross section:

             s = z =  = 0 , for -b / 2  s  b / 2 at  = 켾 / 2 .             (8.115)

252                                                                      Aerospace Structures
                                                      Uniform torsion of an FRP bar with a rectangular cross section

                      ss = sz = s = 0 , at s = 켦 / 2 for -t / 2    t / 2 .                 (8.116)

Under uniform torsion all stress components and their corresponding strains are independent of the axial
coordinate z. The exact elasticity formulation for the anisotropic bar is given in the monograph by Lekhnitskii
(1981). We seek an approximate solution based on the following assumptions:

 Stress components ss , s , and  are equal to zero in the domain of the cross section.

 The cross section is rigid in its own plane.

     The procedure to develop the material law is as follows: (a) determine the displacements of the bar using the
strain-displacement relations and the anisotropic form of Hooke's law, (b) satisfy the differential equation of
equilibrium using a separable form of the stress function, (c) use static equivalence to determine the resultants of
the axial normal stress, and (d) impose the principle of complementary virtual work to find the unknown part of
the stress function. The final result for the material law in torsion is given by eqs. (8.193) and (8.194) on
page 263.

8.4.1 Displacements

The non-zero stress components are the axial normal stress zz , and the shear stresses zs and z . To effect the
rigidity assumption consider Hooke's law (8.16) for the strain components ss ,  , and  s . Write these mate-
rial laws as

where Ess is the modulus of elasticity for tension/compression along the s-axis, E is the modulus along the -
axis, and Gs is the shear modulus in the plane of the cross section. These moduli are related to the compliance
coefficients by Ess = (C11)-1 , E = (C33)-1 , and Gs = (C55)-1 . Invoke the rigidity of the cross section by

The differential equation for axial equilibrium is

                                                         =0                                               (8.148)

The axial normal stress zz does not contribute to eq. (8.148) since it is independent of coordinate z. Equation
(8.148) is identically satisfied by the introduction of the stress function (s, ) where the stress components are
related to the stress function by

                                                                                                          (8.149)

For shear stress z to satisfy the boundary conditions (8.115) at  = 켾 / 2 the stress function  / s = 0 .

256                                                                                        Aerospace Structures

For shear stress sz to satisfy the boundary conditions (8.116) at s = 켦 / 2 the stress function  /  = 0 .
That is the stress function is a constant on the boundaries, and for convenience we take  = 0 on the boundaries
of the rectangular domain.

Substitute eq. (8.149) for the shear stresses in the expression (8.114) for the torque to get

                                      b / 2 t / 2     
                               Mz =                    - ------ - s ------ d .                                           (8.150)

Integrate eq. (8.150) by parts with respect to s and  to get

                      b/2      t/2 t/2                     t/2                           b/2             t/2

    Mz =
                      - t / 2 +                                                                                          (8.151)

Since the stress function is equal to zero on the boundaries we find that the torque is given by integral of the
stress function over the cross-sectional area:

                                 Mz = 2           b / 2 t / 2  dds .                                                     (8.152)

                                                -b / 2 -t / 2

We make an additional assumption for the stress function that

                               (s, ) = 1(s)[(t / 2)2 - 2] ,                                                              (8.153)

which satisfies the boundary condition that (s, 켾 / 2) = 0 . Function 1(s) must satisfy the boundary condi-
tion 1(켦 / 2) = 0 . The shear stresses for this assumption are given by

                               sz = 21(s)            z  =      d1         [  (  t  /  2  )2  -  2  ]  .                  (8.154)

                                                               ds

Substitute the stress function (8.153) into the torque (8.152) to get

                                                     b/2                                                                 (8.155)

Substitute eq. (8.157) for the axial normal stress into the equations for the axial force and bending moments
given by eq. (8.156). In the process of computing the resultants, integrals that are explicit in coordinates s and 
are performed. Integrals of the stress function also appear in this process and from eq. (8.155), and we use the
fact that

We limit consideration to a symmetric laminate in which the stacking sequence of the plies is symmetric about
the midplane. Symmetry leads to coefficients

Therefore, the resultants acting on the cross section of the bar are N = Vs = V = Ms = M = 0 and an
applied torque Mz  0 .

8.4.4 Principle of complementary virtual work

Consider uniform torsion state of the bar as shown in figure. 8.11 where the displacements, strains, and forces
satisfy the compatibility conditions, Hooke's law, and the equilibrium conditions. In this state, the actual dis-
placements are uz, u, and us given by eqs. (8.145), (8.146), and (8.147), respectively. The actual non-zero
strains are zz,  z, and  sz and the corresponding stresses are zz, z, and sz , respectively. The only cross-
sectional resultant is the torque Mz and its corresponding rotation is z . Now consider infinitesimal increments
in the stresses denoted by zz, z, and sz that satisfy equilibrium. For a bar of length L, 0  z  L , the
increment in the internal complementary work is given by

L b / 2 t / 2                                                                b/2 t/2

Note that the strains and stresses are independent of the axial coordinate z. The increment in the external comple-
mentary work is

From eqs. (8.145) to (8.147), and with displacement coefficients A = C = 0 , the displacements at the end cross
sections are as follows:

                                          At z = 0 , uz = w(s, ) , u = 0 , and us = 0 .                                                  (8.171)

Substitute the displacements at z = 0 and z = L into the increment in the external work (8.170) to get

Integrals of the increments in the stresses are identified as increments in the resultants Ms , V , and Mz .
Then, we find

                                                                                      L2B     dz

Since the bending moment Ms is prescribed then Ms = 0 . Similarly, shear force V is prescribed, so
V = 0 . The final expression for the increment in the external work is

                                                                        dz                                                               (8.175)

Equate the increment in the external work (8.175) to the increment in internal work (8.169), followed by division
by L, to get the principle of complementary work as

                           dz                             b / 2 t / 2

     The strain-stress relations are given by Hooke's law in eqs. (8.119) to (8.121). In Hooke's law for the strains
zz and  sz we substitute eq. (8.123) for the axial normal stress. After the process of eliminating the axial normal
stress, we get the strain relations as

that the boundary term vanishes since 1(켦 / 2) = 0 . (1 is specified at s = 켦 / 2 .) After integration by

Example 8.5  Transverse bending and torsion of a composite channel section

The cross section of the bar shown in figure. 8.15(a) is composed of a lower horizontal flange with length
b1 = 16 mm , an upper horizontal flange with length b3 = 16 mm . The flanges are joined by a vertical web
with length b2 = 32 mm . The lower flange is denoted by branch 1, the web by branch 2, and the upper flange by
branch 3. Each branch is fabricated from T300/5208 graphite/epoxy with material properties listed in Table 8.2
on page 231, and the dimensional units used in this example are Newtons and millimeters. The laminate in each
branch consists of eight plies with a specially orthotropic, symmetric stacking sequence of [45/-45/0/90]S .
The thickness of each branch t = 1.016 mm . As shown in figure. 8.15(b), the cross section is symmetric about
the X-axis both in geometry and material properties. The axial stiffness per unit length B is given in eq. (8.46),

the torsional stiffness per unit length Bs is given in eq. (8.47), and they are the same in each branch. For a spe-

To locate the modulus-weighted centroid on the X-axis, we first have to determine the modulus-weighted area S

Solution to part (b). To establish the material law for shear and torsion we start with the shear flow given by eq.
(8.113). For the channel section the product moment Dxy = 0 , which means coefficients nx = ny = 0 and
k = 1 in eqs. (8.59) and (8.69). At the contour origin where s1 = 0 the shear flow must equal zero since the
longitudinal edge is free of traction. Equation (8.113) for each branch reduces to

Also note that Sy1(0) = 0 and Sy3(16) = 0 . The resultant of the shear flow distribution is a horizontal force
denoted by FX , a vertical force FY , and a torque at the shear center Mz . The resultant forces are

Equation (n) yields the expected result that the horizontal force equals the shear force Vx , and the vertical force
equals the shear force Vy . We cannot compute the torque until the location of the shear center is known. The

coordinates of the shear center (xsc, ysc) are determined by letting Ixx  Dxx , Iyy  Dyy , Qx(s)  Sx(s) , and

Qy(s)  Sy(s) in eq. (3.106) on page 54. The transformation of eq. (3.106) to the composite laminate is

The coordinate normal to the contour with respect to the centroid is denoted by rnc(s) . It is depicted in figure.
3.3(b) on page 33, and the expression to compute it is given in eq. (3.11) on page 34. For the channel section the

Equation (t) shows that the torque due to the shear flows equals zero at the shear center. Hence, the resultant of
the shear flow distribution is a force with its line of action passing through the shear center having components
Vx and Vy .

     The material law for transverse shear relates the shear strains x and y to the shear forces Vx and Vy . For
the bar made of an homogeneous, isotropic material this material law is discussed in article 5.5.3 on page 143.
Referring to eq. (5.76) the form of the material law is the same for the composite material. That is,

                                        x = cxx cxy Vx , (u)

                                        y           cyx cyy Vy

where the flexibility influence coefficients cxx, cxy, cyx, and cyy are determined from the complementary strain
energy per unit axial length U* . For the open section U* is obtained from eq. (8.97) on page 242, and it is

                                        U*        1       1       q  2  ds

The shear strains x and y are determined from derivatives of the complementary strain energy per unit axial
length with respect to the shear forces. For the channel section in this example we get the following results:

     In general, external loads cause the bar to resist a torque. For an open cross-sectional contour the shear flows
cannot provide this resistance to torsion. A separate analysis for the linear elastic response to uniform torsion of a
symmetrically laminated bar was developed in article 8.4. The result of this development is the material law
(8.193) that equates the torque to torsional stiffness DT times the twist per unit length. The torsional stiffness is
given by eq. (8.194). To compute DT we evaluate the following laminate properties:

 the transverse shear compliance (8.183) a44 = 242.73610-6 mm2/N ,

 the torsional compliance (8.184) a66 = 200.44610-6 mm2/N ,

 the bending stiffness (8.161) D22 = 1, 130.94 N-mm ,

 the dimensionless shear-extension coefficient in bending (8.162) 26 = -0.0459727 , and

 the solution parameter (8.190)  = 2.82838 mm-1 .
The function g(킶 / 2) appearing in the equation for DT depends on the length of the branch. For the channel
section the values of this function are

The torsional stiffness of the channel is equal to the sum of the torsional stiffnesses of each of its branches. That
is,

             DT = DT1 + DT2 + DT3 = 107, 581. N-mm2 .                                                                            (aa)

CHAPTER 9  Failure initiation in FRP
           composites

9.1 Strength of a composite ply

The strength of a laminated composite wall is assessed on a ply-by-ply basis. The main failure modes of unidi-
rectional plies of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are

          matrix compression failure,
          matrix tension failure,
         fiber compression failure,
         fiber tension failure,
         delamination.
The fiber modes and the matrix modes are intralaminar failure modes, meaning these failures occur within a ply.
Intralaminar modes include fractures of the fiber and/or matrix, and fiber kinking or buckling in compression.
Delamination is an interlaminar failure mode, and it refers to the formation of an interfacial crack, or a debond-
ing, occurring between adjacent lamina with different fiber orientations. Delamination has been modeled with the
concepts of fracture mechanics, where the displacements are discontinuous across the interfacial crack faces. An
initial delamination crack is postulated and fracture mechanics principles are used to determine if the crack will
propagate in a self-similar manner. Analysis of delamination by fracture mechanics is presented in article 13.7 on
page 392.

      Simple tests are conducted on unidirectional plies of FRP composites to determine its intralaminar failure
strengths. There are five independent strengths of a unidirectional ply. Denote XT as the longitudinal tensile
strength along the fiber direction, XC the longitudinal compression strength along the fiber direction, YT the trans-
verse tensile strength perpendicular to the fibers, YC the transverse compression strength perpendicular to the
fibers, and SL the longitudinal shear strength in the x1-x2 plane. Typical values of the five basic strengths of
selected composite materials are listed in table 9.1.

     Failure criteria for unidirectional FRP composites based on general states of stress 11, 22, and 12 are
reviewed in Tsai (1992, Section 8) and in Herakovich (1998, Section 9.3). Several of these criteria are in the form
of dimensionless quadratic equations in the stress components with the five basic strengths appearing as parame-
ters. The reader is referred to these references and the other references cited therein to see the details of these cri-
teria. In the next subsection we review a recent criterion based on observed damage states.

9.1.1 Puck's failure criterion

Intralaminar criteria for failure initiation have recently been assessed for FRP composites in the World-Wide
Failure Exercise (WWFE) as summarized by Soden, et al. (2004). Nineteen theoretical approaches for predicting
the deformation and failure response of FRP composite laminates were compared to test results. At the conclu-
sion of the WWFE five leading theories were selected to create recommendations and guidelines for designers.
The theory proposed by Puck, et al. (2002) was cited as one of the five producing the highest number of accurate
predictions and capturing more general features of the experimental results. Puck's methodology assumes brittle
fracture of polymer matrix composites, and distinguishes between fiber failure and inter-fiber failure (IFF) by
separate criteria. Inter-fiber failure refers to cracks running parallel to the fibers through the thickness of a ply,
with the plane of crack determined by three matrix-mode criteria denoted by A, B, and C.

     With respect to the material principal directions x1-x2-x3, the fracture plane is parallel to the x1-axis as shown
in figure. 9.1. Coordinates with respect to the fracture plane are denoted by x1-xn-xt with the xn-axis normal to the
plane. The xn-axis is located by a counterclockwise rotation through the angle  about the x1-axis. The relation
between coordinate directions shown in figure. 9.1 is given by the direction cosines of the angle :

                             x1  10   0 x1      x1             x1

                             x2 = 0 cos -sin xn , or x2 =  xn ,                                 (9.1)

where  is the direction cosine matrix. The transformation from the stress components in the material princi-

pal directions to the stress components in the x1-xn-xt axis system is given eq. (A.96) in the appendix. With due
regard to the notation in this article this matrix transformation is

     Puck's criteria are expressed in terms of a dimensionless failure index denoted by FI for either a matrix
mode FIM or a fiber mode FIF. The range of the failure indices are 0  FI < 1 for no failure, and FI = 1 at fail-
ure initiation.

Matrix mode A. In the uniaxial transverse tension test and the in-plane shear test, the plane of fracture is nor-
mal to the x2-direction so  = 0. From eq. (9.3) the stresses on the fracture plane are nn = 22, nt = 23, and n1
= 21. In the transverse tension test 22 = YT at failure, and all other stresses in the xi-system vanish. For the in-
plane shear test all stresses in the xi-system vanish except that 21 = SL at failure. The proposed criterion includ-
ing these test results is quadratic and of the form

Matrix modes B and C. These modes are defined for a compressive normal stress, nn < 0, acting on the frac-
ture plane. The motivation of Puck's criterion for modes B and C is the Coulomb-Mohr (C-M) criterion (Dowl-
ing, 1993, pp. 255-261) for failure of brittle materials. In the C-M criterion a compressive normal stress resists
fracture caused by the shear stresses nt and n1. The C-M criterion can be considered to be a shear stress crite-
rion in which the limiting shear stress increases for larger amounts of compression. Consider the case where  n1
= 0, so on the fracture plane nn < 0 and nt  0 . Then the C-M criterion can be written in the form

 nt + 탇n = ST , where  is a friction coefficient and ST is the shear strength transverse to the fibers in the

fracture plane. The friction effect, 탇n , can be used to increase the strength or to decrease the applied shear
stress in a C-M criterion. Puck and Schrmann (1998) proposed the following criterion

     Citing better agreement with experimental results, the denominators of the shear stresses in eq. (9.20) are
expanded and the quadratic terms in the normal stress nn are neglected with respect to the linear terms in nn, so
the criterion reduces to

In the Cartesian coordinates with axes nn, nt, and n1 the surface given by eq. (9.25) is an elliptic paraboloid.
Note that the failure surface does not intersect the negative nn-axis according to the hypothesis that a compres-
sive normal stress impedes a shear fracture (i.e., the shear resistance to fracture means the contour lines in the
failure surface increase with increasing compression). In the shear stress plane nt -n1 where nn is equal to ze-
ro, the cross section of the ellipsoid is an ellipse shown in figure. 9.2. Substitute the relations given by eq. (9.6)

9.1.2 Matrix failure criteria for a plane stress state

The assumption of plane stress is that out-of-plane stresses 33, 23, and 31 are negligible in comparison to the
in-plane stress components 22 and 21. Hence, the out-of-plane stresses can be neglected in the stress transfor-
mation equations (9.3). The stress transformation equations reduce to

nn = 22 cos2                              nt = -22 sin  cos                      n1 = 21 cos  .         (9.36)

In mode A  = 0, and stresses nn = 22, nt = 0, and n1 = 21. For nt = 0 the locus of failure initiation is

                                                                             p(+)       p(+)

The angle of the fracture plane is determined when index FIM is a maximum value with respect to . Substitute
sin2  = 1 - cos2  in (9.38) to express index FIM as a function of cos2  . Then the necessary condition for a
maximum can be written as

One solution of eq. (9.39) is  = 0, which is the mode B fracture where the fracture plane is normal to the x2-di-
rection.

Transverse shear strength. The shear strength transverse to the fibers in the fracture plane ST cannot be deter-
mined from simple tests. Instead ST is derived from the uniaxial transverse compression test in which 22 = -YC
at failure and all other stresses in the xi-system vanish. In eq. (9.45) set FIM = 1, 21 = 0, and 22 = -YC to evalu-
ate the transverse shear strength ST at the pure transverse compression condition. The result is

To find the transition values of stresses 21 and 22 between modes B and C, solve the eq. (9.40) for 21 and
substitute this result for 21 in eq. (9.45) with FIM = 1. The results are

             a unidirectional ply.

      In multidirectional laminates the intralaminar failure predictions are made by the analysis of strains and/or
stresses in each lamina, with failure criteria evaluated in each lamina. A failure initiated in one lamina predicts
the onset of damage, or first ply failure (FPF), that is usually not the ultimate failure of the laminate. It is insuffi-
cient to predict ultimate failure with the failure initiation criteria alone if the composite structure can accumulate
damage before ultimate failure.

9.2 Stresses in the principal material directions

The stresses in the k-th ply, k = 1, 2, ..., Np , of the laminated wall are required to assess the strength of the ply.
Starting from eq. (8.27) on page 229 we have for the k-th ply

The axial normal strain zz and the shear strain  sz are determined from the material law, eq. (8.45) on page 237;
i.e.,

The normal strain ss is determined from the assumption ns = 0 in eq. (8.35) on page 233, which yields

                                 ss = - (A12 / A11)zz - (A16 / A11) zs .                               (9.59)

With the strains zz ,  zs , and ss determined from eq. (9.58) and eq. (9.59), the stresses in the material principal
directions in the k-th ply are obtained from eq. (9.57)

Example 9.1 First ply failure envelope for the circular tube in example 8.3

The graphite-epoxy tube is subject to a prescribed axial force N and torque Mz at its free end, and no other exter-
nal loads. Thus, the only internal actions at each cross section are an axial force N and a torque Mz. The shear
flow q from eq. (8.74), and the normal stress resultant n from eq. (8.77), at each cross section reduce to

                                 q = Mz / (2Ac)     nz = (B / S)N .                                      (a)

From eq. (f) in example 8.3 on page 245 the function () = 0 , 0   < 2 , so the torque does not contribute
to the expression for the normal stress resultant. From example 8.3 we have the following data:

      S = 4.99669 MN b = -1.22899            B = 39.1363 MN/m       a = 3.9495     Ac = 0.00129717 m2 .
Consider proportional loading and take

                                 q / nz = tan  = [S / (2AcB)](Mz / N) .                                  (b)

For N =  cos , the torque Mz = (2AcB / S) sin = (0.02032 m) sin . A radial ray that runs from the ori-
gin to the point of failure initiation in the plane of the axial force and torque is shown in figure. 9.6. Use Puck's
criterion, eqs. (9.51) to (9.53), to determine which of the two unidrectional layers with angles 1 = -20 and
2 = 70 fail first. That is, we find the minimum value of  > 0 for specified values of  , 0    2 to assess
first ply failure. The strengths of T300/5208 graphite/epoxy are listed in table 9.4.

which is solved to find  = 92, 811.4 N .

     In the -20 -ply stresses 22 < 0 , and 21 < 0 , which means the matrix failure index is evaluated in quad-
rant III of the stress plane shown in figure. 9.5. To determine if the failure index is evaluated in the mode B or
mode C sub-domain of quadrant III, we calculate the slope of the line representing the stress ratio 21 / 22 and
compare it to the slope of the line dividing the mode B and mode C sub-domains. Let m denote the slope of the
line determined by the stress ratio, and let mb / c denote the slope of the line dividing sub-domains in quadrant III.

Refer to figure. 9.5 to see that the stress coordinates 21 = -SL  1  +                 2p (-)  and  22  =  -ST      define a point on the

line subdividing mode B and mode C. The strength data is listed in table 9.4. Numerical evaluation of the slopes

yields

             -807.041                                             (-SL 1 + 2pn(-t))

Since mb / c < m <  , the matrix failure index is evaluated in the mode B sub-domain of quadrant III. Set the
failure index in mode B (9.52) equal to one to get the quadratic equation

                                       (- 7.6522710-7 + 7.1951210-11) = 1 . (m)
The positive root of eq. (m) is  = 123, 329. N .

     In the 70 -ply the matrix stresses 22 < 0 and 21 > 0 , so the matrix failure index is computed in quadrant
II of the stress plane. To determine if the failure is a mode B or mode C, we again determine the slopes m and
mb / c in quadrant II. The numerical results for the slopes are

             807.041                                              (SL 1 + 2pn(-t))

Since mb / c < m < 0 , the failure index is compute for mode C in quadrant II. Set the failure index in mode C
(9.53) equal to one to get

                                                      6.999410-6 = 1 . (o)

CHAPTER 10  Structural stability of
            discrete conservative
            systems

Structures subject to compression fail in differently than those subject to tension. For some ductile metals that are
short and thick, compression failure is associated with a shear mechanism with a fracture plane inclined with
respect to the axis of the compressive load. Other ductile metals may not fracture in compression but crush dur-
ing plastic deformation. Long and thin compression members fail by buckling in which the member responds by
displacing sideways with respect to the direction of the compressive load. Buckling is characterized by

 failure due to excessive displacements (loss of structural stiffness), and/or
 loss of stability of an equilibrium configuration

      Stability of equilibrium means that the response of the structure due to a small disturbance from its equilib-
rium configuration remains small; the smaller the disturbance the smaller the resulting magnitude of the displace-
ment in the response. If a small disturbance causes large displacement, perhaps even theoretically infinite, then
the equilibrium state is unstable. Practical structures in engineering are stable at no load. Now consider increas-
ing the load slowly. We are interested in the value of the load, called the critical load, at which buckling occurs.
That is, we are interested when a sequence of stable equilibrium states as a function of the load, one state for each
value of the load, ceases to be stable.

     In this chapter structural stability phenomena, concepts, and methods are presented by analyzing discrete
systems composed of rigid bars and springs. Stability of discrete systems are also presented by Simitses (1976),
and in a monograph by Huseyin (1975). The latter author presents a general non-linear theory of elastic stability
of discrete systems. Continuum analyses for the buckling of columns and plates are discussed in the next chapter.

10.1 Model A: stable symmetric bifurcation buckling

This model is shown in figure 10.1 and it has one coordinate , - <  <  , to describe the configuration of the
model under the deadweight load P. (An external load independent of its corresponding displacement.) The
model consists of a rigid rod of length L, connected by smooth hinge to a rigid base. The rod can rotate about the
hinge, but it is restrained by a linear elastic torsional spring of stiffness K (dimensional units of F-L/ radian). The
restoring moment of the spring acting on the bar is zero at  = 0. Neglect the weight of the rod with respect to the

10.1.1 Equilibrium method

This method is also known as the classical method or bifurcation method. Consider equilibrium states under the
static, downward load P which are characterized by the angle  being independent of time t. Hence, the inertia
term in eq. (10.1) vanishes and we have

                               PL sin  - K = 0           <.                                           (10.2)

One solution to eq. (10.2) is

                               p1:  = 0 for any P .                                                   (10.3)

Equilibrium path (10.3) is called the trivial equilibrium configuration. The equilibrium method is characterized
by the question

     What are the values of the load for which the perfect system admits non-trivial equilibrium configurations?
(Ziegler, 1968)

A second solution of eq. (10.2) is

                               p2: P = K--- ----------                                                (10.4)

Recall from the calculus using l'Hpital's rule that the limit of the indeterminate form  / ( sin) as   0 is
one. The two equilibrium paths are plotted in the load-deflection diagram shown in figure 10.2. Equilibrium path
p2 is called the secondary path and we note it is symmetric about  = 0. For P < K / L there is only one equilib-
rium position:  = 0 on the primary path p1. For P > K / L there are three equilibrium positions:  = 0 on
path p1, and two on the secondary path p2.

     The two equilibrium paths intersect at (,P) = (0,K/L). This intersection of the two paths is called a bifurca-
tion point, and represents the equilibrium state or position common to two separate equilibrium paths. At no load
the rod is vertical and this corresponds to the origin in the load-deflection diagram. As the load P is slowly
increased from zero the rod remains vertical ( = 0), and at P = K/L adjacent equilibrium states exists on the sec-
ondary path.

The existence of adjacent equilibrium states in the vicinity of the                     P             P

angle  becomes large as the load is increased from K/L on the sec-

The solution of the second order differential equation (10.15) for 2 > 0 is

in which constants A1 and A2 are determined by initial conditions for (0) and  (0) . The solution given by

eq. (10.17) is a harmonic oscillation about the equilibrium configuration and  is interpreted as the natural fre-
quency in radians per second. Initial conditions (0) and  (0) are considered to be very small to simulate an
arbitrary infinitesimal disturbance. The smaller the initial disturbance, the smaller the maximum amplitude of the
oscillation in  . Thus, 2 > 0 is a condition for a stable equilibrium configuration with respect to infinitesimal
disturbances.

For arbitrary initial conditions, the term with the positive exponent in the dominates the solution. This corre-

sponds to large values of the  no matter how small the initial disturbance. Hence, 2 < 0 is a condition of
unstable equilibrium configuration with respect to infinitesimal disturbances. The kinetic method for model A
leads to the following criterion.

                            Dynamic criterion for stability of an equilibrium state

                            The equilibrium state is stable if         2 > 0

                            The equilibrium state is critical if       2 = 0

                            The equilibrium state is unstable if 2 < 0

On the primary equilibrium path p1 given by eq. (10.3), we have from eq. (10.16) that

Differential equation of motion (10.20) is nonlinear. Since coefficient K / (6I0) > 0 , its solution is a nonlinear
oscillation about the bifurcation point for small initial disturbances (Simitses, 1976). Hence, equilibrium at the
bifurcation point is stable. The stability of the equilibrium states for model A are shown in figure 10.5.

10.1.3 Energy method

Theorem. A conservative mechanical system is in a configuration of stable equilibrium if, and only if, the value
of the potential energy is a relative minimum, otherwise it is unstable.

     This method is characterized by the question:

     What is the value of the load for which the potential energy of the system in the equilibrium position ceases
to be positive definite? (Ziegler, 1968)

Aerospace Structures                                                                                          293

     First we have to determine if model A is a conservative mechanical system. The incremental work of the
external load and the rotational spring acting on the bar shown in figure 10.6 are given by

              dWext = P( + d) - P = Pd                        dWint = -[K( + d) - K] = -(K)d .                           (10.21)

                                                 d

The incremental external work is dWext = PL sin d . Since the load P is independent of angle  for dead-
weight loading, we can integrate incremental work expression to get Wext = - PL cos  + C . The constant C is
determined if we define Wext = 0 when  = 0. The external work function is

                                                Wext = PL(1 - cos ) .                                                    (10.24)

Note that the work of P is independent of path. For example, the value of Wext is the same if the bar first rotated

to 2 and then rotated back to . The expression for the incremental work of the spring acting on the bar is inte-

grated with respect to  to get  Wint  =  -  1   K2  +  C'  .  The  constant  C'  is determined if we define  Wint  =  0  at   =
                                            --

0. Hence,

                                                Wint = -K2 / 2 .                                                         (10.25)

Since the work done by the external load and the spring force are independent of the process of how the final
value of  is achieved, they are conservative forces. The potential energy is defined as the negative of the work
function. The negative sign means that the work done by the spring force against the rotation increases the poten-
tial energy while the work done by the force P with the rotation decreases the potential energy. Let U denote the

potential energy of the spring and let  denote the potential energy of the external load. Then

                                        U = 1--K2           = -PL(1 - cos) .                                             (10.26)
                                               2

The total potential energy is denoted by V, where

                       V() = U() + () = 1--K2 - PL(1 - cos ) .                                                           (10.27)
                                                      2

     Second, we must determine the equilibrium positions and if these correspond to a relative minimum of V. A
necessary condition for a relative minimum is that V is stationary with respect to , and this leads to equilibrium.

For infinitesimal changes in h  0 from the equilibrium position, the lowest degree term in h dominates the

Hence, V4(0) > 0 , and the bifurcation point (0, P) = (0, K / L) is stable.

equilibrium about the fixed pin is

The equilibrium equation (10.38) solved numerically and the equilibrium paths in the load-deflection plane are
shown as dashed lines in figure 10.9. There are two equilibrium paths: the first one begins from the unloaded
state (P = 0,  = 0), and a second complementary path that is not connected to the first path. As the load P
increases from zero along the first path, the angle  increases slowly until P is in the vicinity of Pcr = K / L .

Equilibrium positions on the first path are stable (V > 0 ).

     Note the following characteristics.

 The deflection for the path beginning from the unloaded state is always the same sign as 0 .
 If 0 is small, the equilibrium path of the imperfect system approaches that of the perfect model as the de-

    flection becomes large.
 There is no intersection of two equilibrium paths.
 Even if 0  0 there are three equilibrium states for P > Pcr .
 There is a minimum load on the complementary path that divides unstable and stable equilibrium states.

Equilibrium equation (10.39) is plotted in figure 10.11. The response of model A with the initial angle is similar
to the response of model A subject to the eccentric load in figure 10.9

Discussion. Eccentricity in load and the initial slope of the bar are examples of imperfections. The structural
systems are imperfect. Small imperfections of model A do not change the fact that there are large displacements
when P = Pcr of the perfect system. Model A is classified as stable symmetric bifurcation. The secondary
equilibrium path p2 of the perfect system in figure 10.2 is symmetric about  = 0 and it is stable.

     Real structures exhibiting stable symmetric bifurcation are,

10.2 Model B: unstable symmetric bifurcation

This model consists of a coplanar arrangement of two rigid bars of length L and a linear elastic spring of stiffness
K. The bars are horizontal in the initial position and connect to a center hinge, with the opposite ends of each bar
supported on roller support. The vertical spring connects to the center hinge and is not stretched when the bars
are in the horizontal position. A horizontal load P acts at each roller support to subject the model to compression.

     The deflected configuration of the model is symmetric with respect to the vertical line through the spring,
and each bar rotates through an angle  with respect to the original horizontal position. The deflection of the
spring is L sin , and the load P is independent of the corresponding displacement () . The potential energy is

The potential energy is a relative maximum at the bifurcation point, so the bifurcation point is unstable. Model B
exhibits unstable symmetric bifurcation.

The potential energy is stationary at equilibrium, or ------ = 0 . Hence, the equilibrium equation is

Equation (10.50) is written in the equivalent form as

                                   ( sin  - sin 0) cos  - (P / Pcr) sin  = 0 ,                          (10.51)

where the critical load of the perfect system is Pcr = KL / 2 . One solution to eq. (10.51) is the unloaded state at
(, P) = (0, 0) . Other solutions are plotted as dashed lines in the load-deflection plane of figure 10.15. Equi-
librium states along the path beginning at the unloaded state are stable until a relative maximum on the path is
encountered at (m, Pm) , which is indicated by the filled circles in figure 10.15. There are no stable adjacent
equilibrium states if the load P increases from Pm or if  is increases from m . Any small increase in load or
rotation from the relative maximum results in a dynamic motion of the system that may lead to catastrophic col-
lapse.

0 = 0.1 rad , the value of m = 0.482 rad , or 27.6 , which is a large rotation at the maximum load.

Discussion. All real structures are imperfect. For columns and plates these imperfections if small did not signif-
icantly reduce the actual buckling load from the critical load Pcr obtained in the analysis of the perfect structure.
However, the buckling loads for axially compressed cylindrical shells in experiments are significantly less than
the critical load determined from the perfect analysis (small displacements and slopes). Refer to Brush and Alm-

Aerospace Structures                                                                               301

roth (1975). Even for small imperfections in axially compressed shells the maximum load Pm is much lower
than Pcr . The axially compressed cylindrical shell is sensitive to imperfections.

     Is is concluded then, that the value of Pcr may not be meaningful in practice. It depends on the nonlinear
behavior of the equilibrium paths.
 Model B is imperfection sensitive.
 Model A is imperfection insensitive.

     The question of whether a structure is imperfection sensitive is answered completely by the stability or insta-
bility of the bifurcation point or by the initial, nonlinear post-buckling path.

10.3 Model C: asymmetric bifurcation

Model C is a coplanar arrangement of two rigid bars of length L and a linear elastic spring with stiffness K. In the

initial configuration the bars are horizontal and the spring is at a 45 angle with respect to the bars. The bars and
the spring are connected to a smooth central pin. The opposite end of the left bar is pinned to a fixed point, and
the opposite end of the spring is connected to a fixed pin at distance L below the fixed end of the left bar. The
opposite end of the right bar is pinned to a roller support free to move horizontally. A compressive force P acts at
the roller support and under its action the bars can rotated through an angle  with respect to the original horizon-
tal position..

the critical load of the perfect system. The equilibrium path beginning at the unloaded state for 0 < 0 in figure

stable adjacent equilibrium states if P is increased from Pm or if  decreases from the maximum load point.

10.4 Discussion of models A, B, and C

We have considered three one-degree-of-freedom models (one coordinate is sufficient to describe the equilibrium
configuration). The equilibrium paths were plotted on the (, P) plane. For the perfect system  = 0 for any P is
an equilibrium state (trivial equilibrium). Two equilibrium paths of the perfect system cross at the bifurcation
point (, P) = (0, Pcr) . There are three basic bifurcation points: stable symmetric, unstable symmetric, and
asymmetric. The unstable symmetric and asymmetric cases are imperfection sensitive. A maximum load Pm
below Pcr is possible when the system has imperfections. This theory was originally developed in the PhD dis-
sertation by Koiter (1945 in Dutch, English translation 1970).

10.5 Model D: snap-through instability

Model D is a coplanar arrangement of two rigid bars and a linear elastic spring in the shape of an arch as shown
in figure 10.22. Each bar has the same length L, and the bars connect to a central pin. The bars are at angle  with
respect to a horizontal line passing through the supported ends of the bars. The left end of the left bar is pin-con-
nected to a fixed support. The right end of the right bar is pin-connected to a roller support restrained to move
horizontally by a linear elastic spring with stiffness K. The model is subject to a downward, deadweight load P
acting at the central pin.

                                                                               P,

     The total potential energy is V = K(s)2 / 2 - P , where s is the change in length of the spring and  is
the downward displacement corresponding to the load P. The change in length of the spring and the downward
displacement are

                                s = 2L( cos  - cos )   = L( sin  - sin) .                                         (10.62)
Hence, the total potential energy is

                                 V() = 2KL2( cos  - cos )2 - PL( sin  - sin ) .                                   (10.63)
The total potential energy is stationary at equilibrium, which yields the equilibrium equation

                                    4KL2( cos  - cos )(-sin ) + PL cos  = 0 .                                     (10.64)
Solve eq. (10.64) for load P to get

                                      P = 4KL( cos - cos) tan .                                                   (10.65)

Note that the range of  in eq. (10.65) is - / 2 <  <  / 2 for finite values of the load P. On a plot of the load P

   dP                                    ( cos - cos )                    ( cos3  - cos )

Therefore horizontal slopes occur at

Substitute cos  = cos1/3  into eq. (10.65) and use trigonometric identities to find the load at the horizontal
slope to be

For  = 45 the range of  is -0.2929L <  < 1.707L when  is in the interval  / 2 >  > - / 2 . From figure
10.24 the stability of the equilibrium path is determined as

   V2 > 0, stable, -0.293 <  / L < 0.253 & 1.16 <  / L < 1.1707 ,                           (10.71)

                      V2 = 0, critical  / L = 0.253 &  / L = 1.16 , and                     (10.72)

                      V2 < 0, unstable, 0.253 <  / L < 1.16 .                               (10.73)

The stability of the equilibrium path is depicted in figure 10.25. As the load P is increased from  = 0 a maxi-

mum load Pm is encountered. If the load is increased further the system snaps-through. The maximum point is
called a limit point. This is a different kind of instability from the perfect systems of models A, B, and C. In
models A, B, and C  = 0 was an equilibrium state of the perfect system. Model D is said to have pre-buckling
"deformations." That is   0 before buckling. Snap-through is a dynamic event, and the system can settle to an
inverted, stable equilibrium state. If the load is decreased from the inverted state to the lower limit point the sys-
tem can snap back to a shape resembling the original configuration.

10.6 Model E: a two-degree-of freedom system

Models A to D are single-degree-of-freedom systems. Only one coordinate  determines the position of the sys-
tem. Consider a two-degree-of-freedom system consisting of rigid bar restrained by two rotational springs with
stiffnesses K1 and K2, and subject to a vertical, deadweight load P as shown in figure 10.26. This model is known
as Augusti's column. See Bazant and Cedolin (1991). The position of the bar is referenced to a right-handed Car-
tesian coordinate system x-y-z, with corresponding unit vectors ^i, ^j, k^ . The initial position of the bar is vertical
coinciding with the z-axis shown in figure 10.26(a), and in the deflected position it is located by two angles 1
and 2 shown in figure 10.26(b) The projection of the bar into the x-z plane is at angle 1 with respect to the z-
axis. The projection of the bar in the y-z plane is at angle 2 with respect to the z-axis.

     The angle between the bar and the z-axis is denoted by  . The Cartesian coordinates at the end of the bar in
its deflected position in shown in figure 10.26 (c) are (L sin 1, L sin 2, L cos ) . By the Pythagorean theorem the
square of the length of the bar in the deflected position is given by

where V is called the first variation with terms linear in h1 and h2, and 2V is called the second variation with
terms quadratic in h1 and h2, etc. The change in potential energy about the equilibrium state is
V = V(1, 2) - V(10, 20) . Thus,

                                      V = V + 2V + 3V + 4V + ... .                                                               (10.81)

is  V  =  0  for every h1 and h2, but both not equal to zero. Thus, "coefficients"                                                  V (1, 0)           =  0  and   V (0, 1)  =  0 . The

     The second variation 2V is a quadratic form in variables h1 and h2. Examples of quadratic forms and their
descriptions are listed in Table 10.1.

The second variation (10.88) is positive definite for 0  P < K1 / L . At the critical load the second variation is

                                        2V      =   1   [  0    h2   +  (  K2  -  K1    )h22  ]  .  (10.91)

The second variation at the critical load is said to be positive semidefinite. It is zero for all non-zero values of h1
and h2 = 0, but is positive for all non-zero values of h2 and h1 = 0. The second variation ceases to be positive def-
inite at the critical state. The stability of equilibrium path p1 is determined from eq. (10.88) as follows:

2V p1 > 0, stable, 0  P < K1 / L             2V p1 = 0, critical, P = K1 / L                        2V p1 < 0, unstable, P > K1 / L . (10.92)

The stability of the bifurcation point (1, 2, P) = (0, 0, K1 / L) is not determined from the second variation of
the potential energy.

     At the critical load 2 = 0 . This suggests we seek a solution to equilibrium equations (10.85) and (10.86)
with 10  0 and 20 = 0 . Equation (10.86) is identically satisfied, and eq. (10.85) reduces to

                                           K 1  10  -  L P (  10     -  3      /  6)    =  0.       (10.93)

Solve eq. (10.93) for P to get

The equilibrium path described by eq. (10.94) is shown in figure 10.28. The load increases in the initial post-
buckling response indicating the bifurcation point is stable.

     Consider the case where K1 = K2 = K . The critical points P1 and P2 coincide on the path p1 and simulta-
neous buckling modes (h1, h2) = (1, 0) and (h1, h2) = (0, 1) interact at (1, 2, P) = (0, 0, K / L) . In this

case both V = 0 and 2V = 0 at the bifurcation point, and we have to consider the next non-zero term in the
expansion of the change in potential energy (10.81). To evaluate the third variation at the bifurcation point, the
third partial derivatives of the total potential energy evaluated a the bifurcation point are

CHAPTER 11  Buckling of columns and
            plates

If buckling occurs before the elastic limit of the material, which is roughly the yield strength of the material, then
it is called elastic buckling. If buckling occurs beyond the elastic limit, it is called inelastic buckling, or plastic
buckling if the material exhibits plasticity during buckling (mainly metals). Many thin-walled structural compo-
nents buckle in compression below the elastic limit. Therefore, buckling determines the limit state in compres-
sion rather than material yielding. In fact, about 50 percent of an airplane structure is designed based on buckling
constraints.

11.1 Perfect columns

Consider a perfectly straight, uniform column of length L with cross-sectional area A subject to a centric end load
P as shown in figure. 11.1. (The column is drawn horizontally for convenience.) The column is long relative to its
largest cross-sectional dimension, and the column consists of a homogeneous, linear elastic material whose mod-
ulus of elasticity is denoted by E. Buckling analyses are inherently nonlinear. As the previous structural models
discussed in chapter 10 demonstrate, nonlinear analysis results in more than one equilibrium state for a specified
load, whereas in linear analysis there is only one equilibrium state for a specified load. A geometrically nonlinear
analysis of a column is developed in this article in which the axial strain-displacement relation is nonlinear and
equilibrium is taken on the displaced structure.

Kinematics. Consider a differential element dz-by-dy in the initial, undeformed column, where dz is along the
centroidal axis and dy is perpendicular to the centroidal axis as shown in figure. 11.2. In the z-y coordinate sys-
tem, the material point at coordinates (z,0) displaces to coordinates (z*, y*) in the deformed bar, where (z*,y*) is
referenced to the same z-y system. These coordinates are related by

                               z* = z + w(z) y* = 0 + v(z) ,                                                                         (11.1)

where w(z) is the displacement parallel to the z-axis and v(z) is the displacement parallel to the y-axis. The
material points along length dz map to the differential length ds* along the centroidal axis in the deformed bar.
By the Pythagorean theorem (ds*)2 = (dz*)2 + (dy*)2 . The differential lengths in the deformed bar are

                               dz* = 1 + d----w-- dz and dy* = d----v- dz .                                                          (11.2)

Define the stretch ratio  by  = ds* / dz . Consequently, the stretch ratio is related to the derivatives of the dis-

                  y, v                                                                        (z*, y*)  x dy

The clockwise rotation angle of element ds* with respect to the z-direction is denoted by x(z) . Trigonometric

Using the chain rule of differentiation and the definition of the stretch ratio these trigonometric functions can be
written as

               sin x  =  -----d---y---*-- --d----z--  =  1    -----d---v-  ,  and  similarly  cos x  =  1   1  +  d----w--  .        (11.5)

We impose the hypothesis of classical theory that cross sections normal to the centroidal axis in the undeformed
bar remain rigid and normal to the centroidal axis in the deformed bar. Thus, the differential line element dy in
the undeformed bar does not change length in the deformed bar and remains normal to the centroidal axis in the

deformed bar. That is, line element dy also rotates clockwise through angle x . The stretch ratio (11.3) is
expanded in a binomial series to get

The force F acting on the cross section of the deformed bar is resolved in two sets of orthogonal components.
Components H and Sy act in horizontal direction and the vertical direction, respectively. Components N and Vy
act tangent and normal to the centroidal axis, respectively. Let  denote the angle between the vertical and the
line of action of force F. From figure. 11.3(b) H = F sin  and Sy = F cos  . Components N and Vy are given
by

N = F sin ( - x) = (F sin ) cos x - (F cos ) sin x = H cos x - Sy sin x , and                                                                       (11.8)

Equilibrium in the horizontal direction requires dH = 0 and equilibrium in the vertical direction requires
dSy = 0 . Thus, the horizontal component H and the vertical component Sy are spatially uniform along the
length of the bar. Since the applied compressive force P is also horizontal then H = -P . The bending moment is
denoted by Mx . Moment equilibrium about the right end of the element in figure. 11.3(a) leads to

11.1.2 Buckling

To assess buckling of a slightly defected column, we introduce a small, dimensionless parameter  such that all
dependent variables equal there pre-buckling equilibrium expressions as   0 . The displacements and rotation
are expressed as

              w(z) = w0(z) + w1(z)             v(z) = v1(z)                    x(z) = 1(z) .         (11.15)

The trigonometric functions of the rotation angle are

                 sin x = 1(z) + O(3)                       cos x = 1 + O(2) .                        (11.16)

In the following developments terms of 2 and higher degrees are neglected. The vertical shear force
Sy = Sy1 . The axial strain (11.7) expansion is

                                            dw0 dw1                                                  (11.17)
                                    zz = --------- + --------- .

                                             dz dz

The first expression in (11.8) is written as N + P cos x + Sy sin x = 0 , where N = EAzz . The expansion for
this equation containing the force N is

                                                                                         Perfect columns

                                dz                      dz

To satisfy the last equation for each value of   0 , the coefficients of 0 and 1 must vanish, which leads to

                                   dw0 -P               dw1                              (11.19)
                                   --------- = -------  --------- = 0 .
                                    dz EA                dz

On the pre-buckling equilibrium path the stretch ratio  = 1 - P / (EA) .

     The expansion of the equilibrium equation for bending (11.12) combined with the moment from Hooke's
law (11.13) is

                                   2

                                dz       dz             EA

Therefore, the significant result from eq. (11.20) is

                                   2
                                d 1 dv1  P

                                dz       dz             EA

The first expression in eq. (11.5) relating the rotation, the stretch ratio, and the displacement v(z) is written as

                                                                        dv               (11.22)
                                             [1 - P / (EA)] sin x + ----- = 0 .

                                                                        dz
The expansion of eq. (11.22) becomes

                                      dz  EA

Therefore,

                                      dv1  P                                             (11.24)

                                      dz  EA

Solve eq. (11.24) for 1(z) and substitute the result into eq. (11.21) to get

Now differentiate eq. (11.25) with respect to z and note that ---------- = 0 consistent with the equilibrium equation

Example 11.1 Critical load for clamped-free boundary conditions in figure. 11.4(B)

Consider the clamped-free boundary conditions denoted as (B). Determine the critical load Pcr for which the
perfect column admits a non-trivial equilibrium state.

Solution. The bending moment and vertical shear force (11.28) vanish at z = L. The four boundary conditions in
this case are

v1(0) = 0             v1(0) = 0             EIv1(L) = 0               [v1 + K2v1]z = L = 0 ,                 (a)

where the primes denote derivatives with respect to z. Taking derivatives of eq. (11.29) we have

                                        v1 = A1 sin (Kz) + A2 cos (Kz) + A3z + A4
                                        v1 = A1K cos (Kz) - A2K sin (Kz) + A3
                                        v1 = - A1K2 sin (Kz) - A2K2 cos (Kz)
                                        v1 = - A1K3 cos (Kz) + A2K3 sin (Kz) . (b)
Substitute these solutions into the four boundary conditions to get

A non-trivial solution for A1 to A4 requires the determinate of coefficients to vanish:

                                         0     1                01

After expanding this determinate we get

                                            -K5 cos (KL) = 0 ,                                               (e)

which is called the characteristic equation. The solution K = 0 of the characteristic equation leads to the triv-
ial solution for v(z) . Non-trivial solutions to the characteristic equation occur for cos(KL) = 0 , whose positive
roots are

                      KnL = (2n - 1)( / 2)        n = 1, 2, 3, ... .                                         (f)

     For the discrete values of KnL in eq. (f) to satisfy the equation in the fourth row of matrix eq. (c) requires
A3 = 0 . Setting A3 = 0 in the equation in the second row of matrix eq. (c) requires A1 = 0 . The equation of
the first row of matrix eq. (c) yields A2 = -A4 . Note that the equation obtained from the third row of matrix eq.

11.2 Initial post-buckling of the pinned-pinned column

The objective in this analysis is to seek an approximation for the displacement and load about the bifurcation
point so that the early post-buckling behavior can be estimated. That is, does the load increase or decrease from
its value at the bifurcation point on the post-buckling equilibrium path? The theory was originally due to Koiter
using total potential energy (1945, in Dutch, English translation in 1970). Later Budiansky and Hutchinson
(1964) and Budiansky (1966) employed the principal of virtual work to get results equivalent to Koiter's static
post-buckling analysis. In this article the nonlinear equilibrium equations are used to develop the initial post-
buckling behavior.

The overall free body diagram of the column in a deflected                                z                            P
configuration is shown in figure. 11.7. The shortening of the FBD of Fig. 11.7 P

distance between support points is denoted by  , where             deflected

The relation of the force N to load P is obtained from eq. (11.8) with H = -P as

                                     EAzz + P cos  = 0                                                        (11.32)

In eq. (11.32) force N was replaced by Hooke's law (11.13), and we dropped the subscript x on the rotation x

introduced in article 11.1 for convenience in the following developments. The strain zz is related to the deriva-
tives of the displacements by the nonlinear relation (11.7). Substitute Hooke's law (11.13) for the bending
moment into eq. (11.12) to get the differential equation for bending as

                                    2                              0<z<L,                                     (11.33)

11.2.2 The perturbation expansion.
From the expressions in eq. (11.30) the differential equation governing buckling in terms of the rotation is

     Consider the rotation and displacement in the differential equation (11.33) to be a function the dimensionless
parameter  as well as independent variable z (i.e., (z, ) and v(z, ) ). An approximate solution to the nonlin-
ear differential equation (11.33) and kinematic equation (11.34) is to be determined by perturbation expansions
of the dependent variables in the parameter  for very small values of  . To effect the procedure, the displace-
ments and rotation are expanded in a series in  as

                       w(z) = w0(z) + w1(z) + 2w2(z) + 3w3(z) + ...                                           (11.40)
                             v(z) = v1(z) + 2v2(z) + 3v3(z) + ... .
                               = 1(z) + 22(z) + 33(z) + ...

Functions w0(z) , 1(z) , and v1(z) are given by eqs. (11.14), (11.38), and (11.39), respectively. The remaining
functions in the expansion (11.40) are to be determined. The expansion of the sine and cosine functions are

        sin x    =  sin [1(z) + 22(z) + 33(z) + ...]   =  1          +  22  +  33     -  x31      +  O(4)

        cos  = cos (1(z) + 22(z) + 33(z) + ...) = 1 - 1--21(z) - 31(z)2(z) + O(4)

11.2.3 Relations between the expansion functions for the rotations and lateral displacement
With respect to the discussion in article 11.1.3 we take  = 1 , so the expansion of the first equation in (11.34) is

                       dv1 2           dv2 3              dv3 1 3                  4

The previous series converges to zero for each sufficiently small value of   0 requires that the coefficient of
each power of  must vanish. Hence,

                       dv1 = -1        dv2 = -2           dv3                   13

From the differential equation (11.36) at buckling we have                                                                            (11.51)

The last step is to impose the orthogonality conditions on the expansion functions, which are

For the series (11.55) to converge to zero for each sufficiently small value of  , the coefficient of each power of
 must vanish. The coefficient of  is the differential equation for buckling, eqs. (11.36) and (11.38). The coef-
ficients of 2 and 3 lead to differential equations

The non-homogeneous terms in eq. (11.56) depend on previous solutions of the expansion functions. That is,

              F2 = -aPcr1                               F3 = - aPcr2 - bPcr1 + 1--Pcr13 .                   (11.58)

Let kcr = Pcr / (EI) . The general solution to differential equation (11.56) consists of a complementary function
c1k cos (kcrz) + c2k sin (kcrz) that satisfies the homogeneous equation plus a particular solution denoted by k*(z)
that satisfies the non-homogeneous equation. Then, the general solution is

                                   k(z) = c1k cos (kcrz) + c2k sin (kcrz) + k*(z) .                         (11.59)

Consider conditions required to solve the boundary value problem presented by eqs. (11.56) and (11.57). Multi-
ply eq. (11.56) by 1(z) and integrate the result from z = 0 to z = L. The result is

Integrate the first term on the left-hand side of eq. (11.60) by parts twice to get

                                                                      L         2                L

Boundary conditions (11.37) and (11.57) result in the terms on the left-hand side of eq. (11.61) evaluated at the
end points of the interval equal to zero. Also, the integrand on the left-hand side vanishes since rotation 1 satis-

fies eq. (11.36). We are left with the condition for the solution of the boundary value problem for k that

                                                 0

For k = 2 condition (11.62) is

                                L                    L

                                0                    0

The only way to satisfy the condition in eq. (11.63) is to take the post-buckling coefficient a = 0 . The solution
for 2 that satisfies the boundary conditions (11.57) is 2(z) = c12 cos (kcrz) . The orthogonality condition
(11.50) determines c12 = 0 . Thus, 2(z) = 0 . From eq. (11.43) and boundary condition (11.35) we find
v2(z) = 0 for 0  z  L . For k = 3, condition (11.62) is

                                L             L

                                 F31dz =  - bPcr1 + 1-6-Pcr13 1dz = 0 .                               (11.64)

Equation (11.64) determines post-buckling coefficient b, and it is the same as given in eq. (11.52).

Use the trigonometric identity cos3 x = (3 / 4) cos x + (1 / 4) cos (3x) to find

The solution to differential equation (11.66) is

                      3(z) = c13 cos (kcrz) + c23 sin (kcrz) + ----1---- cos 3--------z .             (11.67)
                                                                      192  L 

Boundary conditions (11.57) lead to coefficient c23 = 0 . Coefficient c13 is determined from the orthogonality
condition (11.50)

                                           L            -c13L

                                           0

Therefore c13 = 0 and the solution for function 3(z) is

                                       3(z) = ----1---- cos 3--------z .                              (11.69)

11.2.6 Solutions for the axial displacement functions

Substitute expansions of the strain from eq. (11.71), the load P from eq. (11.54), and the cosine function from eq.
(11.41), into eq. (11.32) to find the expansion of the axial equilibrium as

     0 dw0                                   dw1                   2 dw2                                                 2    12                        3

For eq. (11.72) to converge to zero for each sufficiently small value of  ,the coefficient of each power of  must
vanish. Thus, we get to expressions for the derivatives of the expansion functions of displacement w(z) as

                      dw0 -Pcr                    dw1 -aPcr                  dw2 - 2bPcr + (2Pcr - EA)12

Since a = 0 and w1(0) = 0 , the displacement function w1(z) = 0 for 0  z  L . The expression for the
derivative of displacement function w2(z) is integrated with respect to z, and we set w2(0) = 0 to find

                                                  w2(z)  =  -  z   +         7Pcr          -  L       sin 2--------z  .                                    (11.74)

Example 11.2 Numerical results for the initial post-buckling of the pinned-pinned column

Consider the column with a solid, rectangular cross section of height h and width b, where h < b. The radius of
gyration is r = I / A = h / 12 . The strain at the bifurcation point is obtained from eq. (11.76) for   0 is
-Pcr / (EA) , and take this strain equal to -0.0006 . Since Pcr = (2EI) / L2 , we have

                      Pcr 2EI 1  2  h 2
                      ------- = ----------- ------- = ----- -- = 0.0006 .                                            (a)

Hence, the span-to-thickness ratio L / h = 37.

     The restriction on the magnitude of the expansion parameter  in the initial post-buckling analysis is based
on the strain at the elastic limit of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, which is about 0.0068 . Let zz denote the strain of a
line element parallel to the centroidal axis. It is the sum of the strain of centroidal axis zz plus the strain due to
bending. That is,

                           zz = zz + yd----- ,                                                                       (b)
                                                              dz

where (-h) / 2  y  h / 2 and d / dz is the curvature of the centroidal axis. The magnitude of the maximum
compressive strain in post-buckling occurs at midspan, z = L / 2 , and y = -h / 2 . That is,

                      zz   =                    zz  -  h     d-----            .                                     (c)
                                                       --

The expansion for the curvature at midspan is determined from eqs. (11.75), (11.38) and (11.69). The result is

d                     = -- sin ----z-  - --------- sin 3--------z 3                     =        +             3  .  (d)

Substitute h = 0.270L and Pcr = 0.0006EA in the expansions for the strains. The numerical evaluations of the
strain in eq. (11.76) and the strain from bending are

zz = - 0.0006 - 0.0000752                       -h--d----- = - 0.0424264 - 0.0006621933 .                            (e)

The axial strain on the concave side of the bar at midspan is set equal to the elastic limit strain of -0.0068 . Thus,

                       zz = - 0.0006 - 0.042464 - 0.0000752 - 0.0006629133 = -0.0068 .
The real root of the previous polynomial is the maximum value of parameter  , which is

                                                max = 0.14605 .                                                      (f)

For post-buckling coefficients a = 0 and b = 1 / 8 , we get P / Pcr = 1.0027 at  = max from eq. (11.54).
There is a very small increase in the load during post-buckling. The lateral displacement of the column is deter-
mined from eqs. (11.75), (11.39), and (11.70), and it is a maximum at midspan. Evaluation of the maximum dis-

     The axial displacement of the column is determined from eqs. (11.75) and (11.74). The shortening of dis-

The shortening at buckling is cr =   = 0 = L(0.0006) , and the normalized shortening is defined by

     The pre-buckling equilibrium path is determined from eq. (11.14) where  = -w0(L) = (PL) / (EA) , or
P = (EA / L) . Divide by the critical load to get P / Pcr = (EA / Pcr )( / L) . From eq. (a) the factor
EA / Pcr = 1 / 0.0006 . Thus, P / Pcr =  / (0.0006L) =  / cr on the pre-buckling equilibrium path.

      The load-deflection response is shown in figure. 11.9(a), and the load-shortening response is shown in fig-
ure. 11.9(b). The post-buckling behavior of the column is stable symmetric bifurcation, which is the same
behavior as model A in article 10.1 on page 289. The load does not decrease in post-buckling. However, the
increase in load is very small in post-buckling. From a practical point of view, the column is considered neutral in

post-buckling.The structural stiffness is defined as dP / d . For post-buckling the structural stiffness is com-
puted as

     dP      =  dP d           =    Pcr                     1                                              =        Pcr                          =        E A ( 0.0006 )                =  EA

The structural stiffness in pre-buckling is (EA) / L . The ratio of the post-buckling stiffness to the pre-buckling
stiffness is 0.0003, which indicates the dramatic loss of structural stiffness due to buckling.

     From eq. (11.54) the perturbation expansion of the load in initial post-buckling is P / Pcr = 1 + a + b2 .
The post-buckling coefficients a = 0 and b < 0 correspond to unstable symmetric bifurcation behavior illus-
trated by model B in article 10.2 on page 298. Post-buckling coefficient a  0 corresponds to asymmetric bifur-
cation behavior illustrated by model C in article 10.3 on page 302.

11.3 In-plane buckling of trusses

When a truss has all of its joints pinned, then there will be no interaction between the bending deflections of indi-
vidual members. Hence the buckling load of the truss will be the load at which the weakest compression member
buckles as an Euler column (case A in figure. 11.6). However, when a truss is rigidly jointed, as in a frame, there
will be interaction between bending deflections of neighboring members through rotation of the common joint. A
rigid-jointed truss is stiffer than a pin-jointed truss, and therefore its buckling load is increased relative to the pin-
jointed truss.

Example 11.3 Buckling of a two-bar truss

A symmetric truss consisting of two identical bars of length L are connected together by a hinge joint at the cen-
ter of the truss. The opposite end of each bar connects to a separate hinge joint at a fixed support. Both supports
are at a distance H below central joint. The central joint is subject to downward load Q whose corresponding dis-
placement is denoted by q.

     We consider a linear analysis and a nonlinear analysis for the stability of the truss, where Hooke's law gov-
erns the material behavior in both analyses. The material of the bars is 7075-T6 aluminum alloy with a modulus
of elasticity E = 71, 000 N/mm2 and yield strength of yield = 469 MPa . The remaining numerical data are

                              its length, which means that the displacements are linear in coordinate z. Linear

increased from zero on the nonlinear path (i) a limit point load of 9.038 kN at a displacement of 11.5 mm is
encountered. As discussed in article 10.5 a dynamic snap-through motion occurs at the limit load that eventually
(with damping) settles to a displacement of 58.65 mm. The linear response path (j) is the straight line in figure.

The term k2L2 / 2 = P / Pcr where the critical load of the perfect structure is Pcr = (2EI) / L2 . It is conve-
nient to measure the deflection of the imperfect column under load with respect to its original unloaded state.
That is, let  define the additional displacement at midspan by  = v(L / 2) - v0(L / 2) . Hence,

for a non-zero value of the imperfection amplitude, the displacement gets very large as the axial force approaches
the buckling load of the perfect column. Also, the imperfect column deflects in the direction of imperfection

     The buckling behavior of a long, straight column subject to centric axial compression (the perfect column) is
classified as stable symmetric bifurcation. As such it is imperfection insensitive. Refer to the discussions in arti-
cle 10.1.5 on page 297 and article 10.2.1 on page 300. Even for a well manufactured column whose geometric
imperfections are small, and with the load eccentricity small, the displacements become excessive as the axial

compressive force P approaches the critical load Pcr of the perfect column. Hence, the critical load determined
from the analysis of the perfect column is meaningful in practice.

11.4.1 Southwell plot

Rearrange eq. (11.88) as follows: c(1 - P / Pcr) = (P / Pcr)a1 , then c - (P / Pcr)c = (P / Pcr)a1 . Divide the
last by P to get

We plot c / P versus c from eq. (11.89) in figure. 11.15, which is called the Southwell plot (Southwell, 1932).1
The Southwell plot is very useful for determining Pcr from test data in the elastic range. As P  Pcr , P < Pcr , 
becomes large and the data (( / P) vs.  ) tends to plot on a straight line. Extrapolating this straight line back to
toward the ordinate axis ( / P ) one can estimate a1 and Pcr. It is more difficult to determine Pcr by the load-
deflection curve obtained in experiments as illustrated in figure. 11.16.

11.5 Column design curve

Consider the pinned-pinned uniform column whose critical load is given by Pcr = 2(EI / L2) . Let A denote the
cross-sectional area of the column. At the onset of buckling the critical stress is defined as

                             cr = Pcr / A = (2EI) / (AL2) .                                                            (11.90)

The second area moment is I = r2A , where r denotes the minimum radius of
gyration of the cross section. For the rectangular section shown in figure. 11.17, Fig.11.17. h

Imin = (bh3) / 12 and A = bh , so that r = h / 12 , where 0 < h < b . Thus,                         b

the critical stress becomes

                             cr   =                 2     E              .                                             (11.91)

and L / r is called the slenderness ratio. The slenderness ratio is the column length divided by a cross-sectional
dimension significant to bending.

For any set of boundary conditions define the effective length KL by the formula

                             Pcr  =                 2    EI              .                                             (11.92)

The definition of effective length uses case A boundary conditions as a reference. The concept of effective length
accounts for boundary conditions other than simple support, or pinned-pinned end conditions.

     The column curve is a plot of the critical stress versus the effective slenderness ratio (i.e., cr versus KL / r ).

11.5.1 Inelastic buckling

The column curve equation, eq. (11.93), is valid up to the proportional limit of the material, denoted by p . The
proportional limit is defined as the stress where the compressive stress-strain curve of the material deviates from
a straight line. If the stress at the onset of buckling is greater than the proportional limit, then the column is said
to be of intermediate length, and the Euler formula, eq. (11.93), cannot be used. The proportional limit is difficult
to measure from test data because its definition is based on the deviation from linearity. In particular, the com-
pressive stress-strain curves for aluminum alloys typically used in aircraft construction do not exhibit a very pro-
nounced linear range. For aluminum alloys a material law developed by Ramberg and Osgood (1943) is often

used to describe the nonlinear compressive stress-strain curve. The Ramberg-Osgood equation is a three-parame-
ter fit to the compressive stress-strain curves of aluminum alloys. From the experimental compressive stress-
strain curve the slope near the origin is the modulus of elasticity E. The stress where the secant line drawn from
the origin with slope 0.85 E intersects the stress-strain curve is denoted 0.85 .The stress where a second secant
line drawn from the origin with slope 0.7E intersects the stress-strain curve is denoted by 0.7 . These data are
depicted in figure. 11.19. Note that the compressive normal strain corresponding to the stress 0.7 is usually

     From the Ramberg-Osgood equation, eq. (11.94), the local slope of the compressive stress-strain curve is
determined as a function of the stress. This slope of the compressive stress-strain curve is called the tangent mod-

            d
ulus (i.e., ------ = Et where Et is the tangent modulus). Differentiate eq. (11.94) to get

                                       0.7

Thus, the tangent modulus is

     For intermediate length columns it has been demonstrated by extensive testing that the critical stress is rea-
sonably well predicted using the Euler curve, eq. (11.93), with the modulus of elasticity replaced by the tangent
modulus. This inelastic buckling analysis is called the tangent modulus theory. That is,

                                            cr  =    2    Et             .                                   (11.99)

Now substitute eq. (11.98) for the tangent modulus in the latter equation, noting that  = cr , to get

11.6 Bending of thin plates

Recall that bars and beams are structural elements characterized by having two orthogonal dimensions, say the
thickness and width, that are small compared to the third orthogonal dimension, the length. Thin plates, both flat
and curved, are common structural elements in flight vehicle structures, and they are characterized by one dimen-
sion being small, say the thickness, with respect to the other two orthogonal dimensions, say the width and
length. A thin, rectangular, flat plate shown in figure. 11.22 is referenced to Cartesian axes x, y, and z, where the
x-direction is parallel to the length, the y-direction is parallel to the width, and the z-axis is parallel to the thick-
ness of the plate. We denote the length of the plate by a, the width by b, and the thickness by t, and 0  x  a ,
0  y  b , and -t / 2  z  t / 2 . The plane with z = 0 is the midsurface, or reference surface, of the plate.

     A beam resists the transverse loads, or lateral loads, primarily by the longitudinal normal stress x, and the
so-called lateral stresses y, z, yx, and yz are assumed to be negligible. Transverse loads, acting in the z-direc-
tion applied to the plate are primarily resisted by the in-plane stress components x, y, and xy. Transverse shear
stresses xz and yz are necessary for force equilibrium in the z-direction under transverse loads, but are smaller
in magnitude with respect to the in-plane stresses. In plate theory, the transverse normal stress z is very small

     primary stresses in plate theory

with respect to the in-plane normal stresses and, hence, is neglected. Bending of thin plates is discussed in many
texts on plate theory; for example, see Ugural and Fenster (2003). Only some elements of the plate bending the-
ory are discussed here. The assumptions of the linear theory for thin plates are as follows:

1. The deflection of the midsurface is small with respect to the thickness of the plate, and the slope of the
    deflected midsurface is much less than unity.

2. Straight lines normal to the midsurface in the undeformed plate remain straight and normal to the midsurface
    in the deformed plate, and do not change length.

3. The normal stress component z is negligible with respect to the in-plane normal stresses and is neglected in
    Hooke's law.

     Now consider the deformation, or strains, caused by the normal stresses. Hooke's law for the normal stresses
and strains in a three-dimensional state of stress is

                                               1                               (11.102)

                                              E

where E is the modulus of elasticity and  is Poisson's ratio. From assumption 3 the thickness normal stress z
is assumed negligible and is set to zero in Hooke's law. From assumption 2 the thickness normal strain z = 0 ,

because the line element normal to the midsurface does not change length. Since the normal stress z is also
assumed to vanish, the third of eq. (11.102) leads to a contradiction. Hence, the third equation of Hooke's law is
neglected. The material law for the in-plane normal strains and stresses for thin plates is

                                               1                               (11.103)

neutral axis of the beam deforms into an arc of a circle with radius  , and the normal strain in the x-direction is
x = z /  . Note that we assumed that the x-axis coincided with the neutral axis in the undeformed beam. Hence,
longitudinal line elements above the neutral axis, z > 0, are stretched, and line elements below the neutral axis, z
< 0, are compressed. In the case of a beam, the normal stress in the y-direction, y , is also very small and is
neglected with respect to the longitudinal normal stress x . That is, the beam resists the applied bending moment
by the longitudinal normal stress x . Since y = 0 , we get from Hooke's law, eq. (11.103), that

Hence, the longitudinal normal stress is the modulus of elasticity times the longitudinal normal strain, and the
normal strain in the y-direction is just Poisson's ratio times the longitudinal normal strain. The form of the last
expression for y in eq. (11.104) shows that the line elements in the cross section parallel to the y-axis before
deformation also bend into circular arcs. The line element parallel to the y-direction at z = 0 in the undeformed

                                         
beam has a radius of curvature of -- in the deformed beam. This transverse curvature is called anticlastic curva-

                                         
ture, and is illustrated in figure. 11.23.

     Now consider pure bending of a plate under the same moment M, where now the dimension b is much larger
than thickness t. In this case experiments show that the transverse line elements remain straight over the central
section of the plate, so that the anticlastic curvature is suppressed. In this central section of the plate the trans-
verse normal stress y is non-zero. However, the transverse normal stress must vanish at the free edges at y = 0
and y = b, so that anticlastic curvature develops only in narrow zones near the free edges to adjust to vanishing of

the normal stress y at the free edges. In the central portion of the plate, the associated normal strain is zero. The
suppression of anticlastic curvature is characterized by the vanishing of the normal strain y. Hence from Hooke's
law, eq. (11.103), for y = 0 we get

Since the denominator in the expression for x is positive but less than unity, the plate is stiffer than the beam
owing to the presence of the non-zero transverse normal stress y to help in resisting the applied moment. Com-

pare eqs. (11.104) and (11.105) for the normal stress x. The quantity E / (1 - 2) is an effective modulus of the

plate in linear theory is that of pure compression in the x-y plane with no out-of-plane deflection of the midsur-
face. That is, in the pre-buckling equilibrium state the plate remains flat. The normal stress x in the plate is spa-
tially uniform, and we write it as x = - , where  = Px / (bt) is the applied compressive stress.

     At a critical value of the compressive force Pxcr the plate will buckle, or deflect out of the flat pre-buckling
equilibrium state. To determine this critical force we have to consider a slightly deflected equilibrium configura-
tion of the plate, similar to the analysis of the perfect column presented in article 11.1. Refer to Brush and Alm-
roth (1975) for the details of this adjacent equilibrium analysis for the critical force.

     Instead of a detailed adjacent equilibrium analysis of the plate, we can make a comparison to the critical
force determined for the pinned-pinned column in figure. 11.6. The configuration of the plate comparable to the
pinned-pinned column has simply supported, or hinged, edges at x = 0 and x = a , and has free edges at

y = 0 and y = b . The compressively loaded plate for these boundary conditions is called a wide column. The
critical force for the pinned-pinned column is

than the column. Also set L = a for the plate. The formula for the second area moment of a rectangular cross

cient exhibit cusps, or discontinuous slopes, at selected values of the plate aspect ratio. The cusps correspond to
changes in the half wave length of the buckle pattern along the x-direction. In particular, for the plate with simple
support on all four edges, case C in figure. 11.26 on page 350, note that kc = 4 for integer aspect ratios.

11.7.1 Simply supported rectangular plate

Consider a plate simply supported on all four edges and subject to uniform compressive on edges x = 0 and x = a.
In the pre-buckling equilibrium configuration the plate remains flat, w0(x, y) = 0 , with a spatially uniform com-
pressive stress equal to the applied compressive stress  . From the method of adjacent equilibrium, the out-of-
plane displacement of the plate at the onset of buckling is

                     w1(x, y) = A1 sin m---------x- sin n--------y- ,                (11.112)
                                           a   b

where m and n are positive integers and A1 is an arbitrary amplitude. Integer m corresponds to the number of half
waves in the x-direction and integer n corresponds to the number of half waves in the y-direction. Thus, specific
values of integers m and n in eq. (11.112) characterize a buckling mode, and for each buckling mode there is a
corresponding buckling stress. Equation (11.110) is the formula for the compressive stress at buckling, with the
compressive buckling coefficient given by

                        m            n2  (---a----/---b---)-  2
                       ---------

The critical stress is the lowest buckling stress, which occurs for a certain choice of m and n. Since kc is directly
proportional to powers of integer n, the minimum value of kc occurs for n = 1. Then minimum values of kc are
related to a/b and integer m by

                                          m (a / b) 2                                (11.114)

These critical values of the compression buckling coefficient are plotted as case C in figure. 11.26 on page 350.
The buckling modes for three integer values of the aspect ratio are depicted in figure. 11.27. There is one half
wave across the width (n = 1) and the number of half waves across the length, m, increases with increasing aspect
ratio. For integer values of the aspect ratio the critical value of the compressive buckling coefficient kcr = 4 , and
it follows that the critical compressive stress is

From eq. (11.112) the length of a half wave in the x-direction is a / m , and the length of a half wave in the y-

direction is the plate width b for n = 1. These half wave lengths are the same when a / m = b , or a / b = m .
That is, the half wave lengths in the x- and y-directions are the same for integer values of the aspect ratio. Hence,
for integer values of the plate aspect ratio the buckling mode consists of a sequence of square buckles.

Example 11.4 Critical load for simply supported rectangular plate in compression

Let a = 20 in., b = 10 in., t = 0.10 in., E = 10106 lb./in.2 , and  = 0.3 . From eq. (11.110) the critical com-
pressive stress

                cr = kc(903.81 lb./in.2) .                                             (a)

From eq. (11.114) the compression buckling coefficient is

                                                   m 22
                kc = --- + --- .                                                       (b)
                                                    2 m

For m = 1, 2, 3, kc = 6.25, 4.0, 4.694 , respectively. For larger values of m, coefficient kc is larger. The minimum
value of kc is 4 corresponding to m = 2. Hence, the critical stress is

                cr = 3, 615.24 lb./in.2 .                                              (c)

The critical compressive load Pcr = crbt . Hence,

                Pcr = 3, 615 lb. .                                                     (d)

     The buckling mode for (m, n) = (2, 1) has one half sine wave in the transverse direction and two half
waves in the longitudinal direction. The load Pcr = 3, 615 lb. is the lowest load at which such a plate can lose
its stability.

where 0 < t  b  a . Note that a denotes the long dimension of the plate and b denotes the short dimension. It is
subject to uniformly distributed shear stress  as illustrated in figure. 11.28. From Mohr's circle for plane stress,

the state of pure shear is equivalent to tensile and compressive normal stresses at forty-five degrees to the direc-
tion of pure shear. It is this compressive normal stress that leads to buckling of the thin plate subjected to shear.

The critical value of the shear stress per unit length, cr , is given by the formula

                                                 2       E                       -t-  2

where ks is a nondimensional buckling coefficient for shear loading. This buckling coefficient is a function of the

plate aspect ratio a / b and the boundary conditions applied to the plate. Values of the shear buckling coefficient
are given in figure. 11.30 on page 354. The buckling mode labeled the symmetric mode in the figure pertains to a
buckled form that is symmetric with respect to a diagonal across the plate at the node line slope. For a narrow
range of aspect ratios the plate buckles in an antisymmetric mode. For an infinitely long strip, or a / b   ,
ks = 5.35 for simply supported, or hinged, edges at y = 0, b , and ks = 8.98 for clamped edges.

     A least squares fit of the shear buckling coefficient as a function of the plate aspect ratio is convenient in
problem solving. For the simply supported plate, or the plate with hinged edges, the data listed in table 11.5 was
read from the graph in figure. 11.30.

the calculated transverse shear force Vy = 25, 000 lb. and the bending moment Mx = -4.14106 lb-in. at the
wing root. The thickness and width of the upper and lower cover skins are tf = 0.5 in. and bf = 24 in. , respec-
tively. The thickness and height of the left and right webs are tw = 0.30 in. and bw = 13 in. , respectively, and
the flange area of the stringers Af = 2.0 in.2 . The material is isotropic with properties E = 10106 lb/in.2 and
 = 0.3 . For Mx < 0 , the upper skin is in compression. Determine the rib spacing, denoted by a, such that the
margin of safety for buckling of the upper skin is slightly positive.

Solution. The centroid and the shear center of the cross section coincide with the center of the box beam due to
symmetry. The normal stress due to bending in the upper skin is calculated from the flexure formula; i.e.,

The maximum magnitude of the shear stress in the upper skin is 7.25 percent of the magnitude of the bending
normal stress. Moreover, the average value of the shear stress is zero in the upper skin. Hence, it is reasonable to
neglect the effect of the shear stress on the buckling of the upper skin.

     Assume the upper skin is a simply supported rectangular plate between the stringers and ribs. Actually, the
stringer and ribs provide rotational constraint to the upper skin, but the assumption of no rotational constraint is
conservative with respect to design. The critical compressive stress for simple support on all four edges of the
upper skin underestimates its actual value. Equation (11.110) for the top cover skin is

CHAPTER 12  Introduction to
            aeroelasticity

12.1 The Collar diagram of aeroelastic forces

The following paragraphs are excerpted from Aeroelasticity by R. L. Bisplinghoff, H. Ashley, and R. L. Halfman
(1996).

          Aeroelasticity is defined as a science which studies the mutual interaction between aero-
     dynamic forces and elastic forces, and the influence of this interaction on airplane design.
     Aeroelastic problems would not exist if the airplane structure were perfectly rigid. Modern air-
     plane structures are very flexible, and this flexibility is fundamentally responsible for the vari-
     ous types of aeroelastic phenomena. Structural flexibility itself may not be objectionable;
     however, aeroelastic phenomena arise when structural deformations induce additional aerody-
     namic forces. Such interactions may become smaller and smaller until a condition of stable
     equilibrium is reached, or they may tend to diverge and destroy the structure.

          The term aeroelasticity, however, is not completely descriptive, since many important
     aeroelastic phenomena involve inertial forces as well as aerodynamic and elastic forces. We
     shall apply a definition in which the term aeroelasticity includes phenomena involving interac-
     tions among inertial, aerodynamic, and elastic forces, and other phenomena involving interac-
     tions between aerodynamic and elastic forces. The former will be referred to as dynamic and
     the latter as static aeroelastic phenomena.

          Collar has ingeniously classified problems in aeroelasticity by means of a triangle of
     forces. Referring to Fig. 1-1 [figure. 12.1 below], the three types of forces, aerodynamic. elas-
     tic, and inertial are represented by the symbols A, E, and I, respectively, are placed at the ver-
     tices of a triangle. Each aeroelastic phenomenon can be located on the diagram according to
     its relation to the three vertices. For example, dynamic aeroelastic phenomena such as flutter
     F, lie within the triangle, since they involve all three types of forces and must be bonded to all
     three vertices. Static aeroelastic phenomena such as wing divergence, D, lie outside the trian-
     gle on the upper left side, since they involve only aerodynamic and elastic forces. Although it is
     difficult to define precise limits on the field of aeroelasticity, the classes of problems connected
     by solid lines to the vertices in Fig. 1-1 are usually accepted as the principal ones. Of course,
     other borderline fields of mechanical vibrations, V, and rigid-body aerodynamic stability, DS,
     are connected to the vertices by dotted lines. It is very likely that in certain cases the dynamic

stability problem is influenced by airplane flexibility and it would therefore be moved within the
triangle to correspond with DSA, where it would be regarded as a dynamic aeroelastic prob-
lem.

12.2 Divergence analysis of a rigid wing segment

A model to illustrate the phenomenon of wing divergence consists of a uniform, rigid wing segment hinged to a
fixed support in a wind tunnel as is shown in figure. 12.2. The hinge line is located at the elastic axis (E.A.) of the
wing. The elastic axis coincides with the locus of shear centers of the wing sections.

     Recall that the shear center of the cross section of a bar (wing) is a reference point in the cross section
where the lateral deflections due to bending are de-coupled from the twist due to torsion (i.e., a shear force acting
at the elastic axis results in bending deflections and no twist, and a torque acting at the elastic axis causes twist
but no lateral deflection of the elastic axis due to bending).

     The rigid wing segment is restrained against rotation, or twist, about the E.A. by a linear elastic rotational
spring of stiffness K . This rotational spring is analogous the torsional stiffness per unit span, or (GJ) / L , of a
wing.

     We assume two-dimensional, incompressible aerodynamics is applicable. Let V denote the airspeed,  the
angle of attack relative to the zero lift angle, L the lift, MAC the pitching moment, and let W denote the weight
of the wing segment acting at the center of gravity (C.G.). The lift and pitching moment act at the aerodynamic
center (A.C.), which is the point about which the pitching moment is independent of the angle of attack. Usually
the A.C. is close to the quarter chord. We neglect the drag force D relative to the lift since D  L .

     From eq. (12.10) we see that    as q  qD for 0  q < qD . That is, the angle of attack grows without
bound as q  qD . Of course, this excessive twist is a theoretical result. In reality the wing will stall or twist off
due to a strength failure. Hence, the divergence dynamic pressure is defined as

Divergence corresponds to static instability. At V = VD we get excessive rotation in twist of the wing.

12.2.1 Responses of the rigid wing segment and the imperfect column

The response plots of the rigid wing segment model of article 12.2 and the geometrically imperfect column in
article 11.4 on page 336 are repeated in figure. 12.4. Comparing the two response plots reveals that these phe-
nomena are the same. Both the column buckling and the wing divergence are static instabilities. The critical load
Pcr for the column and the divergence dynamic pressure qD of the rigid wing segment model are determined
from a static analysis of the slightly deflected structure.

12.2.2 Divergence experiments

Experiments to measure the divergence dynamic pressure of an elastic wing confront the issue of damaging the
wing and its supporting structure if the dynamic pressure is near or at its critical value. A nondestructive method
to measure the critical dynamic pressure is accomplished by plotting the data on a Southwell plot, which was
developed for elastic column buckling in article 11.4.1 on page 338. The Southwell plotting coordinates are
determined from eq. (12.10) by formulating the change in the angle of attack  , where
 =  - (0 - (Wd) / K) . After some algebraic manipulations, the change in the angle of attack is written as

                                                   C0(q / qD)                                                                    (12.13)
                                            = ------------------------ ,

                                                    1 - q / qD

where

                                    C0  =  0  -  (  W  d  )  /  K  +    c--      CMAC             .                              (12.14)

                                                                                 ---------
                                                                                   

Equation (12.13) is rearranged as follows: (1), Multiply each side by 1 - q / qD , and write

                                                 - (q / qD) = C0(q / qD) .
(2) Divide by the dynamic pressure and write the final result as

                                            ( + C0)
                                           ------- = ------------------------ .                                                  (12.15)

     On the Southwell plot () / q is the ordinate and  is the abscissa. Thus, eq. (12.15) is a straight line on
the plot as shown in figure. 12.5. The important aspect of the Southwell plot from the experimental viewpoint is
that the slope of the graph is the reciprocal of the divergence dynamic pressure. As the dynamic pressure is
increased from magnitudes less than the divergence dynamic pressure, the changes in angle of attack 
become large, and the data of () / q versus  tends to plot as a straight line. The experimental divergence

incidence could be a function of z for a variable in built-in twist, but we will consider it constant along the span.
So

where z(z) is the twist angle of the wing due to elastic deformation. Neglect airfoil weight, since we saw for the
rigid wing segment that this factor played no role in the divergence dynamic pressure.

From eq. (3.61) on page 43 the differential equation in torsion is

where mz denotes the external torque per unit span. In this case the external torque per unit span is due to the
aerodynamic loads acting on the wing.

In reference to eq. (3.121) on page 60, St. Venant's torsion theory relates the torque to the unit twist as

where GJ is the torsional stiffness of the wing box. From eq. (3.161) page 70, the torsion constant for a single-
cell cross section is given by

12.3.1 Aerodynamic strip theory

Strip theory assumes aerodynamic lift and moment at station z depends only on the angle of attack, or incidence,
at z , and is independent of the angle of attack at any other spanwise locations. Physically, this is reasonable for
high aspect ratio wings.

     The differential lift and differential pitching moment acting at the A.C. on an typical element of the wing are
shown in the figure. 12.7, where cl is the local lift coefficient and cmAC is the local moment coefficient about the
A.C. Hence, the external torque acting on the differential element about the elastic axis is

                                   mzdz = edL + dMAC = [eqccl + qc2cmAC]dz ,     (12.21)

According to strip theory

where a0 is the lift curve slope. Substituting eq. (12.16) into (12.23), we get

Hence,                                cl = a0[0 + z(z)] .                        (12.24)

12.3.2 Differential equation of torsional divergence
Now substitute eq. (12.25) into (12.20) and rearrange the terms to get

                                   2                                             (12.26)

Equation (12.26) is the governing, second order, ordinary differential equation for z(z) with 0 < z < L . The
boundary conditions at z = 0 and z = L are to specify either z or Mz , but not both. For a cantilever wing,
which is clamped at the root and free at the tip, the boundary conditions are

                           z(0) = 0  Mz(L) = GJdz = 0 .                          (12.27)
                                                     dz z = L

     The general solution of the ordinary differential eq. (12.26) is the sum of a particular solution and a homog-
enous solution.

                                                  z(z) = p(z) + h(z) .           (12.28)
By the method of undetermined coefficients the particular solution is

                                                    ccmAC                        (12.29)

Hence, the general solution for the wing twist is

                                                                               ccmAC                                                    (12.33)

Substitute the general solution (12.33) into the boundary conditions (12.27) to determine constants A1 and A2 :

                                       ccmAC                  A1 cos (L) - A2 sin (L) = 0 .                                             (12.34)

                                        ea0
Solving eq. (12.34) for the constants, we get

                                    ccmAC                                                  ccmAC

Substitute eq. (12.35) for A1 and A2 into eq. (12.33) to get the angle of twist for the cantilever wing as

              z(z)              =    0  +  ccmAC           [  tan  (L)  sin  (z)  +  cos (z) - 1] .                                     (12.36)

                                           ea0 

Hence from eqs. (12.16) and (12.36), the total wing incidence is

                                 ccmAC sin (L) sin (z) + cos (L) cos (z)

Using the trigonometric identity for the cosine of the sum of two angles, this last result can be written as

12.4 Effect of wing sweep on divergence

Divergence of a slender straight wing that is approximately perpendicular to the airplane plane of symmetry is
dependent on wing twist, referred to as torsional divergence, and bending is not a factor in the instability. For
slender swept wings bending of the wing has an important and complicating affect on divergence and is referred
to as bending-torsional divergence.

     Let the angle  denote the wing sweep measured rela-                                reference axis
                                                                                               B

a swept-back wing ( > 0 ) bends, its angle of attack in the

effect, consider an upward force applied to the reference axis.
Points A and B deflect upward about the same amount. Point
A has less upward deflection since it is closer to the wing
root. Hence, streamwise segment AB will have a smaller
angle of attack due to bending and a negative increment in lift
results. This negative lift increment due to bending is a stabi-
lizing influence, since it opposes the nose-up twist of segment
AB .

     Consider a swept-forward wing with  < 0 as shown in figure. 12.9. Bending causes an increase in the angle
of attack, or nose-up twist, for the streamwise segment AB . This increase in angle of attack due to bending is a
destabilizing influence. Divergence essentially rules out swept-forward metallic wings. For wings made of com-
posite materials, it is possible to materially couple bending and torsion in such a way to have an acceptable diver-
gence speed for forward-swept wings (e.g., the X-29 demonstrator).

1. An interesting historical account of wing torsional divergence is given by Gordon (2003); An excerpt fol-
lows.

          During World War I Antony Fokker developed an advanced monoplane fighter - the Fokker
     D8 - with performance better than available or in immediate prospect on the Allied side. As
     soon as the D8 was flown in combat conditions it was found out that, when the aircraft was
     pulled out of a dive in a dog fight, the wings came off. Since many lives were lost - including
     those of some of the best and most experienced German fighter pilots - this was a matter of
     very grave concern to the Germans at the time, and is still instructive to study the cause of the
     trouble.

Read pages 260-271 in the book by Gordon and answer the following questions.
a) For a given engine power, why is a monoplane generally faster than a biplane?
b) What was the material of wing skin on the D8? Is it effective in resisting shear?
c) What was the method of loading in the structural test of the wings of the D8?
d) What was the ultimate load factor from the structural test?

3. Consider a rigid wing segment of weight W mounted on an elastic sting in a wind tunnel. The sting is mod-
eled as a uniform, elastic, cantilever beam with bending stiffness EIxx = EI and length 2c . Neglect the weight
of the sting. The model is mounted in such a way to have the angle of attack 0 when the beam is undeformed.
Thus, the angle of attack  = 0 +  , where  is the nose-up rotation of the wing resulting from the bending of

CHAPTER 13  Fracture of cracked
            members

The strength of ductile metals is limited by yielding. However, the presence of a crack in a structure may weaken
it so that it fails by fracturing in two or more pieces. The study of crack propagation in bodies is the subject of
fracture mechanics. Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) is the study of crack propagation in linear elas-
tic bodies.

     Damage tolerant design allows for the presence of subcritical cracks that will not grow to critical length
between inspection intervals. Cracks can nucleate and grow in airplane structures under cyclic loading, or
fatigue. This important structural issue of fatigue crack growth is tragically illustrated by the Comet disasters of
1954.

13.1 Comet disasters of 1954

The content of this article is taken from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, and Cawthon (2005).

     The de Havilland Comet was the world's first commercial jet airliner to reach production. Developed and
manufactured by de Havilland, it first flew in 1949 and was considered a landmark British aeronautical design.
The Comet is an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by four jet engines, approximately the length
of a Boeing 737 but carrying fewer people in greater comfort. The clean, low-drag design featured many unique
or innovative design elements, including a swept leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel bogie
main undercarriage units designed by de Havilland. The Comet was also the first pressurized jet-propelled com-
mercial aircraft. Comet went into commercial service with BOAC on 22 January 1952. In May, the first paying
passengers flew from Heathrow Airport to Johannesburg, South Africa. The Comet could fly higher and faster
than any other airliner of the day and passengers loved it. They especially liked the Comet's big, rectangular win-
dows, which allowed a much better view than those on competing planes. See figure. 13.1.

     The structural flaws in the Comet's design caused two fatal accidents in 1954. The first came just after the
New Year, on January 10. BOAC Comet G-ALYP left Ciampino airport in Rome on its way to London. Less than
a half-hour after takeoff, a routine radio call was cut off in mid-transmission. The Comet had crashed into the
Mediterranean Sea about 16 miles from the island of Elba. The investigators determined the cabin failed because
of metal fatigue. Just three months later, another Comet crashed, this time it was South African Airways G-
ALYY, which was also flying out of Ciampino and also wound up in the Mediterranean, killing all twenty-one
people on board. Authorities were unable to retrieve much wreckage, but cited the circumstances that caused the
January incident.

     Engineers subjected an identical airframe, G-ALYU ("Yoke Uncle"), to repeated repressurization and over
pressurization and after 3,057 flight cycles (1,221 actual and 1,836 simulated), Yoke Uncle failed due to metal
fatigue near the front port-side escape hatch. Investigators began considering fatigue as the most likely cause of
both accidents, and further research into measurable strain on the skin began. Stress around the window corners
was found to be much higher than expected, "probably over 40,000 psi," and stresses on the skin were generally
more than previously expected or tested. This was due to stress concentration, a consequence of the window's
square shape. The stresses caused by thousands of takeoffs and landings were causing the plane's aluminum skin
to begin to crack around the right-angle edges of those nice, big windows that were so popular with the passen-
gers. Eventually the metal would completely fail, causing immediate depressurization of the cabin and cata-
strophic structure failure.

     The problem was exacerbated by the punch rivet construction technique employed. The windows had been
engineered to be glued and riveted, but had been punch riveted only. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of
the hole created by punch riveting may cause the start of fatigue cracks around the rivet.

     The square windows of the Comet 1 were redesigned as oval for the Comet 2, which first flew in 1953. The
skin sheeting was thickened slightly. The remaining Comet 1s and 1As were either scrapped or modified with
oval window rip-stop doublers. All production Comet 2s were modified to alleviate the fatigue problems, and
most of these served with the Royal Air Force as the Comet C2. The Comet did not resume commercial airline
service until 1958, when the much-improved Comet 4 was introduced and became the first jet airliner to enter
transatlantic service. As is often the case in aeronautical engineering, other aircraft manufacturers learned from
and profited by de Havilland's hard-learned lessons. Representatives from American manufacturers such as Boe-
ing and Douglas "admitted that if it hadn't been for our problems, it would have happened to one of them."

     The Comet 4 not only had a stronger airframe and rounded windows, it was also longer, carried more pas-
sengers, and had four new Rolls-Royce Avon engines, which produced twice the thrust of the original de Havil-
land Ghosts. BOAC had ordered nineteen of the new Comets in 1955, before the redesign was completed. The
Comet 4 made its maiden flight on 27 April 1958 and de Havilland began delivering planes to BOAC in Septem-
ber. BOAC started Comet passenger service with London to New York on 4 October 1958, beating Pan Am's
inaugural 707 Clipper Service by three weeks.

     But it was too late. The Comet, unbeatable in 1954, was an also-ran in 1958. In addition to its early prob-
lems, the Comet's dated design and smaller size convinced most carriers to select the newer 707 or Douglas DC-
8. Only seventy-six Comet 4s were built from 1958 to 1964, and it was America, not Great Britain, that owned
the commercial jetliner market for the rest of the twentieth century.

response of a rectangular plate containing a centrally located elliptical hole that is subject to a remote tensile

ences a strength failure at no load. Clearly, this is a theoretical result from linear elasticity. Real materials cannot
support infinite stress. In ductile metals, large plastic deformation exists in the vicinity of the crack tip. The stress
is not infinite and the sharp crack tip is blunted.

     There are generally three modes of loading, which involve different crack surface displacements as depicted
in the sketches of figure. 13.3. The three modes are:

      Mode I: opening or tensile mode (the crack faces are pulled apart)

      Mode II: sliding or in-plane shear (the crack surfaces slide over each other)

      Mode III: tearing or anti-plane shear (the crack surfaces move parallel to the leading edge of the crack
                and relative to each other)

     Mode I        Mode II                                           Mode III

In general the correction factor is a function of the loading configuration as well as the geometry and ratio of a/b.
The reader is referred to Dowling (1999) and the references cited there for additional relations for F.

     The following facts are noted:

 The mode I stress intensity factor KI depends on the remote stress  , and  is the stress y if no crack is
    present.

 The mode I stress intensity factor KI depends on the square root of the half crack length.

 The dimensional units of KI are stress times the square root of length (e.g., ksi in in U.S. customary units,
    or MPa m in SI units.)

     The crack opening displacement v(x) along the crack surface is also of interest, where the origin of the x-
axis is located at the center of the crack as is shown in figure. 13.7. For the infinite plate geometry under mode I

     The critical mode I stress intensity factor is denoted by KIc , and it is assumed to be a material param-
eter.

 KI < KIc . There is no crack growth, and the material resists the crack without brittle fracture.

 KI = KIc . The crack begins to propagate and brittle fracture occurs.

The critical mode I stress intensity factor is also called the fracture toughness. A tough material has a large
value of KIc , which means it is effective in resisting crack growth. At crack growth, the remote stress is denoted
by cr and is given by

                                KIc                                                                    (13.14)

The transition crack length is the approximate length above which strength is limited by fracture. If a > at then
fracture limits strength. If a < at then yielding dominates strength. Materials with

a. high KIc and low Y imply a long at and small cracks are no problem, and

b. low KIc and high Y imply a short at and small cracks can be a problem.

(b) Fracture mechanics approach. Consider that the beam, instead of being defect free, contains an edge crack
of length a normal to the free edge. Further suppose that, as shown in figure. 13.9(b), the crack is located where
the maximum tensile stress is anticipated. This geometry and loading configuration is not the center-cracked
plate. However, for a relatively small crack, an LEFM-based analysis of the flawed beam shown in figure. 13.9(b)
would give a reasonable approximation in the following expression for the stress intensity factor:

                                           KI = 1.12max a ,                                                                                       (d)

where max is the stress that would occur at the crack location in the absence of the crack. The beam is safe

from fracture if KI  KIc . Further assurance can be obtained by having KI < KIc / (FS) , where, just as in the

strength of materials approach, the number FS is the factor of safety. Using eq. (b) to replace max in eq. (d)

0 < a < 0.849 mm , whereas fracture governs failure for a > 0.849 mm . The transition crack length,
at = 0.849 mm , determines the crack length for which it can be expected that fracture rather than yielding gov-
erns the mode of failure. In this example the transition crack length is only 2.8 percent of the height, h, of the

     A comparison between eq. (c) and eq. (g) is instructive. It can be seen that the structural geometry and the
factor of safety enter both relations in exactly the same way - that is, through the multiplicative parameter

(bh2) / (6(FS)L) . Also, both relations contain a basic, albeit different, material property. The essential differ-
ence is that the fracture mechanics approach explicitly introduces a new physical parameter: the size of a (real or
postulated) crack-like flaw. In fracture mechanics the size of the crack is the dominant structural parameter. It is
the specification of this parameter that distinguishes fracture mechanics from conventional failure analyses.

13.4 LEFM stress field in the vicinity of the crack tip for mode II

Mode II fracture is associated with loading that is antisymmetric with respect to the crack surface. Shear loading
is shown in figure. 13.11 and is a mode II fracture problem.

     The critical mode II stress intensity factor is denoted by KIIc , and it is assumed to be a material
parameter.

 KII < KIIc . There is no crack growth, and the material resists the crack without brittle fracture.

 KII = KIIc . The crack begins to propagate and brittle fracture occurs.

The critical mode II stress intensity factor is also called the mode II fracture toughness.

     The displacements on the two crack surfaces are antisymmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let u denote the
displacement component in the x-direction, and let v denote the displacement component in the y-direction. The
expression for the upper surface displacement u(x) as given by Sun (1998, p. 163) is

The origin of the x-axis is located at the center of the crack as is shown in figure. 13.5, and  depends on Pois-
son's ratio, which is given by eq. (13.13). Under antisymmetric loading the crack surfaces are in sliding contact
with each other and do not open as they do in mode I.

13.5 Energy criterion for crack growth

The text that follows is taken from Gordon (1978).

          The paradox that a material with a sharp crack has infinite stress at the tip, so that it fails at
     infinitesimal load, motivated Griffith to develop a fracture theory based on energy.

          From chemistry, the surface energy needed to break chemical bonds on any one plane is
     from 0.1 to 1.0 J/m2 for most structural solids. For brittle materials - stone, brick, concrete - 1
     J/m2 is nearly all the energy, or work, required to produce a new fracture surface. Ductile
     materials - many metals - yield before fracture, so much work goes into plastic deformation
     ahead of the crack tip. Some approximate values of the work of fracture are listed in the table
     [table 13.3] that follows.

13.5.1 Griffith criterion
The rationale for the Griffith energy criterion is the first law of thermodynamics and the theorem of minimum
potential energy for an elastic body. The critical condition for equilibrium crack growth is that there is no net
change in the total energy (Anderson, 1995, p. 36). Consider a cracked plate of thickness t with a through crack
of length a as shown in figure. 13.12. Then the infinitesimal increase in the crack area is dA = tda .

In the latter equation R denotes the material resistance to crack growth, and G denotes the energy release rate.
The energy release rate is a measure of the energy available for an increment of crack extension, and since it is
obtained from the derivative of a potential, it is also called the crack extension force or crack driving force.

When G = R there is sufficient energy in the system to form an additional crack size dA. For the plate under the
action of the load P, the load application points undergo a relative displacement v. When the crack length
increases by da, the displacement will increase by dv. The work done by the external load is Pdv. Hence, for

So dU < 0 for da > 0 , and for v fixed in value, and no external work is done by load P.

     Equations (13.30) and (13.33) show that the strain energy release rate is always equal to the derivative of the
strain energy apart from the sign. Crack extension occurs when GI = R where R is the work of fracture, or the

material resistance to crack extension. For an ideally brittle material, like glass, R  2 J/m2 , which is twice the
surface energy to create two new surfaces. For ductile metals, the work of fracture is much larger than the surface
energy to create new free surfaces because of plastic deformation occurring in front of the crack tip. During crack
extension energy is expended by deformation of a new plastic zone at the tip of the advancing crack. Note that
the Griffith energy criterion is based on linear elastic material behavior, so the formation of a nonlinear effect
such as plasticity seems to negate the analysis. However, if the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip is very small
compared to the bulk material remaining elastic, then the criterion is applicable. If the increase in energy required
for plastic deformation is independent of the increase in crack area, then R = constant . From fracture tests of a
material, the value of G at crack growth, which equals R, is called the critical strain energy release rate,
denoted by Gc , and is assumed to be a material parameter.

              If G < Gc no crack growth                                                           (13.34)
              If G = Gc crack growth initiates .

13.6 Relation between K and G

Consider the through-the-thickness crack in a infinite plate of unit thickness subject to uniform tension, or mode
I loading.as shown in figure. 13.4. The through-crack opening displacement for a crack length of 2a is shown in
figure. 13.5 and given by eq. (13.12). The relation between K and G is established by computing the work done to
close a crack of length 2a, and restore the uniform stress  in the plate to its pre-cracked value. This crack closure
method is presented in several texts on fracture mechanics (e.g., Broek (1986, p. 126), Anderson (1995, p. 70),
and Sun (1998, p. 164)). The analysis for the crack closure method that follows is from Sun. Denote the work

done to close the crack as Ws(a) where

                                  a                                                               (13.35)

                                  -a

The factor of 2 preceding the integral in the expression for Ws(a) accounts for two crack surfaces. The crack
opening displacement v(x) given by eq. (13.12) is symmetric with respect to x, and  is independent of the dis-
placement. Perform the integration to get the work done to close the crack as

      Equations (13.38) to (13.40) are also valid for finite dimensions and arbitrary loading, however, KI and KII
depend on the configuration and loading of the plate. Thin plates that are closer to the ideal plane stress condition
have higher fracture toughness than thick plates that are closer to the state of plane strain. Most standard fracture
tests are performed using thick specimens, and thus they give fracture toughness under the plane strain condition.

Fracture toughness of a material can be given by either Gc or Kc .

13.6.1 Mixed mode fracture

Generally, crack growth occurs under mixed mode loading. Under this type of loading, crack growth might occur
before any of the energy release rate components attain their individual critical value. Failure interaction criteria
are established from mixed mode fracture test configurations. The following criterion has been shown to fit test
data for many materials quite well:

                            GI GII                                                                   (13.41)

                            GIc GIIc

where GIc and GIIc are the single mode critical energy release rates for modes I and II, respectively. From the
relations between G and K in eqs. (13.38) and (13.40), the previous criterion (13.41) in terms of the stress inten-
sity factors is

13.7 Interlaminar failure in composites: delamination

The main failure modes of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites were discussed in article 9.1 on page 271.
Laminated composite structures can fail within lamina, which is intralaminar failure; between lamina, which is
interlaminar failure; or by interacting together in a complex manner. Interlaminar failure refers to debonding of
adjacent lamina, or delamination, which can initiate from an interfacial crack.

          Delamination is the chief vulnerability of composites. However, Boeing's Chief Technology
     Officer states: "We designed [composite parts] so they carry loads even if delaminated. We
     know how to inspect and we know how to repair." (Canaday, 2015)

     In this section delamination is analyzed with the concepts from fracture mechanics. An initial delamination
crack is postulated and fracture mechanics principles are used to determine if the crack will propagate in a self-
similar manner. The examples analyzed here are standard fracture test configurations. The tests are performed on
unidirectional composites with the fibers oriented such that they are parallel to the length of the initial delamina-
tion. Consequently, the fracture configurations are modeled as laminated beams. The material is carbon fiber-
reinforced epoxy with the properties listed in table 13.4.

ture listed for epoxy resins in article 13.5 on page 387.

Example 13.3 Double cantilever beam (DCB) fracture test specimen

Consider a cantilever, laminated beam subject to equal and oppositely directed forces of magnitude P applied at
the free end. Under the action of the forces there is a crack at the free end perpendicular to the forces of length a
and centered with respect to the depth of the beam. The length of the beam is L, depth is 2h, and its thickness is t.
This is a case of mode I loading, and the initial crack length a0 = 50 mm when P = 0. See figure. 13.15. The

In load control, where P is specified and increased slowly from zero, a sudden dynamic increase in crack growth
occurs at P = 73.9238 N since there is no stable adjacent equilibrium state. In displacement control, where v is
specified and is increased slowly from zero to 3.17 mm, the load P increases to 73.92 N. For v > 3.17 mm the
load decreases as the crack increases in length.

Example 13.4 End load split (ELS) configuration

The end load split (ELS) configuration shown in figure. 13.17 has an initial crack length denoted by a = a0 ,
length by L , height by 2h , and thickness normal to the x-y plane by t . The lower arm at the tip is subject to ver-
tical force P . Both arms below and above the crack are identical and are subject to the same load as shown in the
free body diagrams of figure. 13.18. Hence, both arms have the same lateral displacement v(x) and rotation

                                                                                         h

figuration subject to load P shown in part (a) of figure. 13.19 is labeled FRMM, which means fixed ratio mixed

length-displacement response.

thickness denoted by t, where R  t . It is subject to internal pressure p, with the design ultimate pressure speci-
fied as p = 18.2 psi. A damage tolerance philosophy allows for the presence of a subcritical crack that will not

CHAPTER 14  Design of a landing strut
            and wing spar

The methodology for the design of a landing strut and a wing spar are discussed in this chapter. Simultaneous
satisfaction of the strength and deflection are required in the design of the landing strut. The objective for the
wing spar design is to determine two design variables that minimize the weight of the spar subject to constraints
on material yielding, buckling, and fracture. Practice exercises in design are included for the reader to complete.
The exercise in article 14.1.2 requires a re-design of the strut. The exercise in article 14.2.3 involves a mono-
coque spar, and the exercise in article 14.3.3 involves a stringer-stiffened spar.

14.1 Landing strut

Private aircraft are certified in the United States under the FAA Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 23 -
Normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category. Landing gear struts, or shock struts, are designed to absorb
dynamic loads due severe impact. Design of a simple steel leaf spring strut is discussed in this article, which aug-
ments the original design methodology presented by Thurston (1995). FAA design conditions require each main
wheel to carry a vertical load at least equal to the airplane gross weight per FAR 23.473(g) and FAR 23 Appendix
C. The gross weight of the airplane W = 2, 000 lb., and the configuration of the landing strut is shown in figure.
14.1.

14.1.1 Strut deflection

When developing a strut design it is necessary to vary the spring strut dimensions b and h as shown in figure.
14.1 until sufficient deflection is obtained to provide acceptable vertical force load factors. If the spring strut is
too stiff, the deflection is too low and the vertical load factor is high. If the spring strut is too compliant, the
deflection is too large and the landing gear is springy, but the vertical load factor may be acceptable. We use Cas-
tigliano's second theorem to determine the formula for vertical deflection of the strut:

                  U*                   (14.1)
             = ---------- ,

                   R

where U* is the complementary strain energy. Energy is stored in the strut due to bending, compression, and

The axial normal stress (14.15) attains maximum magnitude at z = L. For b = 3 in. and h = 0.69 in. the maximum
magnitude is

Steel alloy 4340, oil quenched and tempered, has a yield strength of 230 ksi and an ultimate tensile strength of
250 ksi. A major application of alloy 4340 is to aircraft landing gears because of its high strength. For design
assume an allowable stress of 160 ksi, which implies a factor of safety of 1.4 with respect to yield. The margin of
safety is defined by

                                excess strength alllowable - z max

The margin of safety is positive for a feasible design, and negative for an infeasible design. For the design b = 3
in. and h = 0.69 in., the MS = -0.233 . Therefore, with respect to strength the design (14.7) is infeasible.

     Moreover, the landing gear limit load factor is specified as 2.0 in FAR 23.473(g), and not the 2.2 determined
for the initial design (14.7). To achieve the required landing gear load factor we compute new values for the
acceleration, the stopping distance and the stroke of the strut as follows:

aG = (2 - 1 + 0.67)g = 53.77 ft./s2                  d  =  V2   /  (  2aG  )   =  8.09 in.                                     = d - 3.14 = 4.95 in. . (14.17)

Set z = 160, 000 psi in eq. (14.20), and by a root finding routine, or by a trial and error method, find

For the design (14.21), the margin of safety (14.16) is positive for 0  z  L as shown in figure. 14.4. At
z = L = 26.53 in. it is 6.710-16  0 and at z = 0 it is 594.7. The design (14.21) is feasible with respect to

14.1.2 Strut design exercise

Although the margin of safety is positive along the length of the strut in figure. 14.4, it is very large over most of
the length of the strut. An efficient use of material to carry the load has a margin of safety that is sightly positive.
The large positive values of the margin of safety shown in figure. 14.4 indicate that the design is too heavy. The
specific weight of steel is 0.284 lb./in.3, so the weight of the leaf spring strut (14.21) is

W = (0.284 lb./in.3)(10.13 in.)(0.4284 in.)(26.53 in.) = 32.7 lb.                                       (14.22)

Since the axial normal stress (14.15) is linear in the coordinate z, it is reasonable to assume that the cross-sec-
tional area of the strut should be linear in z. Take the thickness of the strut h to be independent of z, and let the
width of the strut be a linear function of z. That is,

                      b(z) = bL-z- + b01 - -z-      0zL,                                                (14.23)
                                   L  L

where b0 is the width at the axel and bL is the width at the fuselage. Of course, this means that the second area
moment of the cross section, Ixx = (bh3) / 12 , is a linear function of z.

1. Determine the value of the design variables h, b0 , and bL such that stroke is equal to 4.95 in. and the mag-
nitude of the normal stress z is less than, or equal to, an allowable value of 160,000 psi.

2. Plot the margin of safety for strength of the design in step 1 with respect to z for 0  z  L .
3. Compute the weight of the design determined in step 1.

14.2 Wing spar design

The wing spar is the primary load bearing structure in the wing. Consider the design of a spar for minimum
weight under a particular maneuver condition subject to different design limit states. The example is the Mohawk
commuter airplane shown in figure. 14.5. The wing is slightly tapered, but to simplify the analysis we will treat it
as uniform. The wing span is 74 feet, and the wing area is 592 square feet, so that the average chord is 8 feet.
About 9 feet of this wing span is the fuselage width, so that we will assume that each wing is a 32.5-foot-long
cantilever beam. At the root of the wing, the airfoil is NACA 23016, with a thickness-to-chord ratio (t/c) of 16

stant t/c = 0.14, corresponding to a maximum thickness of the airfoil of 1.12 ft.

Design load condition. The load condition that usually designs most of the wing box is a pull-up maneuver. For
transport aircraft the FAA specifies a maneuver of 2.5 g, with a safety factor of 1.5. That is, the wings need to be
able to carry about 2.5 times the weight of the airplane without suffering material failure. The maximum takeoff
weight is 23,810 lb., but in this condition there is a lot of fuel in the wing, and this fuel provides inertia relief,
reducing the stresses in the wing. Also, part of the lift of the wing is provided by the area over the fuselage, so we
will assume that the two wings carry 20,000 lb. in cruise, and 50,000 lb. in the design pull-up maneuver.

Wing box overall dimensions. Assume a wing box that is 24 in. in the chord-wise direction and 13 in. deep so
that it can fit into the airfoil. See figure. 14.6.

14.2.1 Evaluation of stresses at root cross section

Since the wing box is uniform along the span, the thicknesses are sized by the conditions at the root. Ten loca-
tions for evaluation of the Mises effective stresses and the margins of safety are shown in figure. 14.8.

The axial normal stress at the root due to flexure is determined from eq. (4.6) on page 79. For this symmetric

cross section we get from eq. (4.4) that nx = ny = 0 , k = 1 ., and y(s) = y(s) by eq. (4.7). In the absence of
an axial normal force and no thermal loads, the normal stress in eq. (4.6) reduces to

                                                             Mx(0)                                                   (14.25)

The shear stresses tangent to the contour are determined from the shear flows and thicknesses of the panels of the
box beam (i.e., zs = q(s, z) / t(s) ). For the box beam the shear stresses in each branch are

                                    zs i = i(si) = qi(si) / ti                   i = 1, 2, 3, 4 ,                                          (14.27)

where qi(si) denotes the shear flow in the i-th branch, and si denotes the branch contour coordinate. The total
shear flows are the summation of the shear flow due to the transverse shear force acting through the shear center
and the torque. From eq. (4.25) on page 82, the total shear flow at a given contour location is

                                             Mz(0)                                i = 1, 2, 3, 4 .                                         (14.28)

Strength limit state. The Von Mises criterion given by eq. (4.31) on page 84 is used to predict the initiation of
material yielding. The Mises effective stress is defined by

                                                     Mises =  2     +  3  z2s  .                                                                         (14.33)

If Mises < yield , then the material response is elastic, and if Mises = yield yielding initiates. The margin of
safety (14.16) in this case is

                                                     allowable - Mises allowable

The allowable stress for the strength limit state is the yield strength of the material divided by the factor of safety
(FS). That is

                                                     allowable = yield / (FS) .                                                                          (14.35)

The margin of safety is nonnegative for a feasible design, otherwise the design is infeasible. It should be zero or
a small positive number.

14.2.2 Trial design of the monocoque box beam spar

A computer program was written to evaluate the Mises effective stresses at the ten locations of the root cross sec-
tion using a factor of safety of 1.5. For tf = 0.40 in. , tw = 0.30 in. , and Af = 0 the weight of the spar is
1, 053. lb. The values of the ten margins of safety for this design are listed in table 14.2.

Since the margins of safety are all positive, this design is feasible. Although feasible, this design is too heavy and,
consequently, not optimal. Lower weight feasible designs will have a nonnegative minimum margin of safety
close to zero.

     To aid in the search for the best design, consider the design plane shown in figure. 14.9. The thickness tf is
the abscissa and the thickness tw is the ordinate. Each point in the plane represents a design, some are feasible
some are not. Contours of constant margins of safety and constant spar weights are plotted in the design plane1.

Only designs with a nonnegative margin of safety are feasible. The least weight design occurs at a point (tf*, tw* )

on the margin of safety contour equal to zero. A second condition is needed to determine point (tf*, tw* ) . This sec-

ond condition is to equate the slope  tw / tf  =  - ----M-----S--   MS            on the margin of safety contour  MS  =  0  to the
                                                                   / -----------

slope of the constant weight contour  tw / tf  =  (-bf) / bw . That is, the point  ( t f*,  t*  )  on the contour      MS    =  0  is

                                                                                             w

14.2.3 Design exercise A

Write a computer program to find the thicknesses tf and tw of the wing box for Af = 0 that will minimize the
weight and carry the load without experiencing material yield using a factor of safety of 1.5. Calculate the weight
of the spar and the margins of safety at the ten locations shown in figure. 14.8. Although the design given in arti-
cle 14.2.2 is too heavy, it can be used to assess if the computer program is correct. Include a print out of the pro-
gram and the output for the best design, which includes the ten margins of safety and the weight.

14.3.1 Buckling margin of safety

Let rib spacing along the span, or z-axis, at the root of the wing be denoted by ar , and take ar = bf / 2 . The
upper cover skin, or branch 3 with coordinates [x3(s3), y3] , is subject to compression and shear. The normal
stress is zz = (Mxy3) / Ixx and the shear stress 3(s3) is a linear function in the contour coordinate s3. Assume
the skin can be modeled as simply supported flat plate between stiffeners for the buckling analysis. From eq.
(11.118) on page 355 the combined compression and shear index for buckling is defined by

14.3.2 Fracture margin of safety

The design damage condition is a through crack centered in the lower left skin that is 1.00 in. long
(2a = 1.00 in. ) with the crack faces perpendicular to the z-axis. The lower skin, or branch 1 with coordinates
[x1(s1), y1] , is subject to a tensile stress zz = (Mx y1) / Ixx and a shear stress 1(s1) that is a linear function of
contour coordinate s1. Thus, the crack is exposed to tension and shear, which leads to mixed mode cracking (i.e.,

a mixture of mode I and mode II). The stress intensity factor for mode I is KI = zz a , and the stress intensity

factor for mode II is KII = 1 a . The fracture toughness for mode I loading only is KIc , and the fracture
toughness for mode II loading only is KIIc . A fracture criterion for mixed mode loading is given by eq. (13.42)
on page 391. The plane strain fracture toughness for mode I loading is usually readily available in the literature,
but the mode II fracture toughness is not usually available. Tests for mode II are more difficult to design than for
mode I. Usually mode II loading does not lead to fracture (Anderson, 1995)1. In other words KIIc > KIc . In addi-
tion for the design (tf, tw, Af) = (0.4, 0.3, 0) , the stresses at the center of branch 1 are zz = 29, 202.8 psi and
3(bf / 2) = -1, 201.92 psi . The shear stress is about 4 percent of the normal stress, and so it is expected that
shear would have a small influence on fracture. Thus, we assume fracture is in mode I. The margin of safety for
fracture is

                                      KIc / (FSf) - KI                                                           (14.41)

                                              KI

   filamentary composites as discussed in article 13.7 on page 392.

Consider a longitudinally stiffened configuration of the wing box for the Mohawk 298 commuter airplane
described in article 14.3. Write a computer program to determine the thicknesses tf and tw of the wing box for
selected values of the flange area Af listed in the table below. The objective is to minimize the weight. The design
limit states are material yield (14.34) using a factor of safety of 1.5, that the compression panel of the upper skin
does not buckle (14.40), and that the crack in the lower panel does not propagate (14.41). Evaluate the margin of
safety for yield at point 8 shown in figure. 14.8. The minimum margin of safety should not be negative for a fea-
sible design, but should be a small positive number. Write a computer program to determine the thicknesses tf
and tw of the wing box for selected values of the flange area Af listed in table 14.3.

Unit action states and unit displacement states are defined in the first section followed by an example to show
how these definitions can be used to find flexibility and stiffness influence coefficients. To introduce the basic
methods of matrix structural analysis, the analyses of structures modeled with linear elastic springs are presented
in article 15.2 to article 15.6. The objective is to illustrate the steps in the direct stiffness method, which is sum-
marized in article 15.7. The approach followed here is based on chapters 2, 3, 4, and 6 of Martin (1966).

where a is the elongation of spring a and b is the elongation of spring b. Spring elongations are related to the

That is, the product of flexibility matrix and the stiffness matrix is the identity matrix. In other words, the inverse
of the flexibility matrix is the stiffness matrix.

15.2 Unrestrained structural stiffness matrix

The flexibility influence coefficients cij are defined for a structure restrained against rigid body motion. How-
ever, it is not necessary to impose this rigid body constraint when forming the stiffness influence coefficients kij
of a structure. Specifying the generalized displacements in the method of unit displacement states encompasses
both rigid body displacements and those causing deformation. Consider a single, linear elastic spring element
with two-degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) connected between joints i and j, where integers i  j , as shown in figure
15.9. Let k denote the stiffness of the spring, which has dimensional units of F/L.

UDS 1. qi = 1 and qj = 0 . Therefore eq. (15.5) gives S = -k  1 . Nodal equilibrium, eq. (15.4), and the
matrix relation, eq. (15.3), give

                       Qi = -(-k  1) = kii        Qj = -k  1 = kji .                         (15.6)

UDS 2. qi = 0 and qj = 1 . Therefore eq. (15.5) gives S = k  1 . Nodal equilibrium, eq. (15.4), and the
matrix relation, eq. (15.3), give

                       Qi = -k  1 = kij           Qj = k  1 = kjj .                          (15.7)

So that the unrestrained structural stiffness matrix is given by

                       K = k -k = k 1 -1 .                                                   (15.8)

                                            -k k  -1 1

Note that the unrestrained structural stiffness matrix (15.8) has the following properties:

1. Matrix K is symmetric (i.e., K T = K ).

                                                                                        2

2. The sum of the column elements equals zero.  kij = 0 for j = 1, 2 . The vanishing of this sum results
                                                                                     i=1
    from Qi + Qj = 0 for each UDS.

3. The det K = k2 - (-k)2 = 0 . That is, the unrestrained structural stiffness matrix is singular. This occurs

    because the structure is not restrained against rigid body translation in the horizontal direction.
    Under the action of no external loads (i.e., Qi = 0 and Qj = 0 ), the structure can translate horizontally at a
    constant speed. Rigid body motion can be used to establish constraints between elements of the unrestrained
    structural stiffness matrix. For example, let v denote the horizontal speed and let t denote time, then

                                            qi = qj = vt .                                   (15.9)

Equation (15.3) gives

                                         0 = kii kij vt ,                                    (15.10)
                                                                                             (15.11)
                                         0  kji kjj vt                                       (15.12)

or

                       (kii + kij)q = 0     (kji + kjj)q = 0      q = vt  0 .

Therefore, the constraints between elements of the unrestrained stiffness matrix are

                       kii + kij = 0              kji + kjj = 0 .

4. Diagonal elements of K are positive. This must be true based on physical grounds. If Qi > 0 and qj = 0 ,
    then we expect qi > 0 . Thus, in the relation Qi = kiiqi , the stiffness influence coefficient kii > 0 .

Assembly of the individual spring element stiffness matrices is accomplished by displacement continuity at the
joints and equilibrium at the joints. Displacement continuity requires

                         Q1 = Qi          Q2 = Qj + Qk        Q3 = Ql .                                 (15.16)

Substitute for the displacements of the individual spring elements in eqs. (15.13) and (15.14) the structural dis-
placements in eqs. (15.15). Then substitute, in turn, these results into the nodal equilibrium eq. (15.16) to elimi-
nate individual spring forces Qi, Qj, Qk, and Ql . We get

Hence, the unrestrained structural stiffness matrix is

                                                  0 -kb kb

     Note the following properties of the unrestrained structural stiffness matrix in eq. (15.19):
1. The matrix is symmetric, or K T = K .
2. Using a co-factor expansion by the third column, the determinate of the matrix is computed as follows:

              det K = (0)det -ka (ka + kb) - (-kb)det ka -ka + (kb)det ka -ka
                                        0 -kb                                         0 -kb      -ka (ka + kb)

              det K  =            0  -  k a k b2  +  (  kb  )[  ka(  ka  +  kb  )  -  k2   ]  =  - kakb2 + kakb2  =  0  .

                                                                                        a

    Since the determinate is zero, the matrix is singular. The unrestrained structural stiffness matrix is singular
    because rigid body translation is not restrained.

                                                                               3

3. The sum of the column elements is zero.  kij = 0 for j = 1, 2, 3 .
                                                                             i=1

4. Diagonal elements are positive kii > 0 .

     Of course, we could have used the method of unit displacement states to determine the unrestrained struc-
tural stiffness matrix (15.19) for the two springs in series rather than the assembly procedure given above.

     Another way to obtain the unrestrained structural stiffness matrix is to first expand the element unrestrained
stiffness matrices to size 3X3 by adding rows and columns of zeros, and then add the 3X3 element stiffness
matrices. For spring element stiffness matrix given by eq. (15.13), displacement compatibility, eq. (15.15), iden-
tifies qi = q1 and qj = q2 . That is, columns one and two of the element stiffness matrix are associated with
global degrees of freedom one and two. We write the element stiffness matrix as

                                                                q1 q2 q3

                                                             ka -ka 0                                                      (15.20)
                                                  Ka = -ka ka 0

The global degrees of freedom are written above the appropriate columns of the expanded element stiffness
matrix in eq. (15.20) to aid in keeping the order of the element columns consistent with the ordering of the global

displacements. For the spring element stiffness matrix given by eq. (15.14), displacement compatibility, eq.
(15.15), identifies qk = q2 and ql = q3 . That is, columns one and two of the element stiffness matrix are asso-
ciated with global degrees of freedom two and three. We write the element stiffness matrix as

                                  q1 q2 q3

                          [Kb] =  00 0

                                  0 -kb kb .                  (15.21)

Note that the only non-zero elements in the expanded element stiffness matrix (15.21) are in rows and columns
two and three. Since matrices (15.20) and (15.21) are of the same dimensions we can add them to get the unre-
strained stiffness matrix of the structure; i.e.,

                                           q1  q2  q3

                      [K] = [Ka] + [Kb] =  ka -ka 0
                                           -ka (ka + kb) -kb
                                            0 -kb kb .        (15.22)

The unrestrained structural stiffness matrix in eq. (15.22) is the same as the matrix in eq. (15.19). Thus, the
superposition of individual element stiffness matrices to obtain the unrestrained structural stiffness matrix is
equivalent to imposing displacement compatibility and equilibrium at the joints.

15.4 Prescribed nodal displacements and forces

At a joint we can prescribe either the displacement or the corresponding force, but not both. Consider the unre-
strained structure of the last section in which we prescribe the values of the displacement q1 , force Q2 , and force
Q3 . That is, nodal values of q1, Q2, and Q3 are known, and nodal values of Q1, q2, and q3 are unknown. Nodal
forces Q2, and Q3 are the applied loads, and nodal force Q1 is a reactive force, or support reaction. Nodal dis-
placements q2, and q3 are the unknown, or active, displacement degrees of freedom. We partition the unre-
strained stiffness matrix given in eq. (15.22) by drawing lines between rows and columns to separate active and
reactive nodal variables. In this example, we partition row 1 and column 1 as

                      Q1  ka -ka 0 q1

                      Q2 = -ka (ka + kb) -kb q2 .             (15.23)

                      Q3  0 -kb kb q3

Now rearrange the order of the equations and the order of the displacements in eq. (15.23). The equations for the
applied loads Q2, and Q3 are moved to correspond with rows one and two, and the reactive force equation for
Q1 is put in row three. Simultaneously, the unknown displacements q2, and q3 are ordered such that they appear
in columns one and two, and the prescribed displacement q1 appears in column three. The equations in matrix
form now read as

In terms of matrix algebra, the unrestrained stiffness matrix in eq. (15.22) was rearranged to the matrix in eq.
(15.25) by the following four-step sequence: First interchange elements in rows 1 and 3. Second, interchange ele-
ments in columns 1 and 3. Third, interchange elements in rows 1 and 2. Fourth, interchange elements in columns
1 and 2.

     Let the vector of unknown displacement degrees of freedom be denoted by {q} , the vector of prescribed
displacements by {q} , the vector of applied forces by {Q} , and the vector of reactive forces by {Q} . In the
example of this and the last section these vectors are

              {q} = q2              {q} = q1        {Q} = Q2         {Q} = Q1 .          (15.26)

The unrestrained structural stiffness matrix is rearranged to separate unknown and known nodal variables. In
general, this partitioned matrix is written in the form

                                        K=    K     K .                                  (15.27)
                                              K     K

For the example in this and the last section, a comparison to the matrix in eq. (15.25) gives the submatrices in eq.
(15.27) as

     K = (ka + kb) -kb              K = -ka         K = -ka 0                  K = ka .  (15.28)

The matrix equations for the structure in partitioned form are now written as

                                    {Q} =     K K   {q} .                                (15.29)

Submatrix [K] is called the restrained structural stiffness matrix. It is a square, symmetric matrix. For the
example of this section it is seen from eq. (15.28) that the restrained stiffness matrix is 2X2, and its determinate
is positive (i.e., det[K] = kakb > 0 ). The restrained structural stiffness matrix is nonsingular if the prescribed

428                                                                              Aerospace Structures

nodal displacements are sufficient to prevent rigid body motion of the structure. The restrained structural stiffness
matrix for this example was determined by the method of unit displacement states in example 15.1. See eq.(r).
The submatrix [K] is, in general, square and symmetric. For the example in this section, eq. (15.28) shows
[K] is 1X1. The off-diagonal submatrices are, in general, rectangular, but they satisfy the relationship

                                                       T                                        (15.30)

                              K = K .

15.5 Solution for the unknown nodal variables

Multiply out the matrix equations (15.29) following the ordinary matrix product formula to get

                              {Q} = [K]{q} + [K]{q}                                             (15.31)

                              {Q} = [K]{q} + [K]{q} .                                           (15.32)

Since the applied load vector {Q} and the prescribed displacement vector {q} are known, solve eq. (15.31)
for the unknown nodal displacement vector to get

                              -1                -1
                              {q} = K {Q} - K K {q} .                                           (15.33)

     Continuing with the example of the last two sections, the restrained structural stiffness matrix is given in first
of eqs. (15.28). Its inverse can be computed from

                                            adj K
                              [K]-1 = ---------------------- .

                                            det K

where adj K is the adjoint matrix. The adjoint matrix1 is the transpose of the matrix of co-factors of matrix

 K . For the 2X2 restrained structural stiffness matrix (15.28)1 in this example, the adjoint matrix is simple to
compute. It is

                              adj K = kb kb  T  = kb kb .

                                                                                                (15.34)

                              kb (ka + kb)                kb (ka + kb)

Hence, the inverse matrix is

1. Many determinates must be evaluated to compute the adjoint matrix. For large matrices, evaluating many determinates is
    computationally inefficient. Other, more efficient methods to solve large linear systems of equations are used in numerical
    algorithms.

Of course, the inverse of the restrained structural stiffness matrix is recognized as the flexibility matrix. Equation

Equation (15.36) is the solution for the unknown nodal displacements.

     To find the reactive nodal force vector, substitute the solution for the active nodal displacement vector from
eq. (15.33) into eq. (15.32) to get

Performing some of the matrix products, we get

This last matrix expression is equivalent to the scalar equation

The result (15.41) for the reactive nodal force is as expected from overall equilibrium of the structure shown in
figure. 15.11.

15.6 Stress matrix

The stress matrix is a matrix that directly yields the internal forces or stresses in an element in terms of the nodal
displacements. Consider a typical spring element between joints i and j as shown in figure. 15.13. From the over-

all solution for the structural response, the nodal displacement vector {q} is determined. Hence, the actual
nodal displacements qi and qj for the typical spring element are known. Define a vector of equivalent nodal
forces as the element stiffness matrix times the known nodal displacement vector, or

                                         e                                            (15.42)

                                    Qj -k k qj

These equivalent nodal forces are not the actual forces at the joints, so they are fictitious. From this equation, the
equivalent nodal forces at the joint are

                      Qe =             qi        Qe =                qi .             (15.43)

From the free body diagram shown in figure. 15.13, the spring force Sij is related to the equivalent nodal forces
by

                              Qe    =  -Sij      Qe    =      Sij .                   (15.44)

                                 i                  j

Substitute eqs. (15.43) into (15.44) to eliminate the equivalent nodal forces to find that both of eqs. (15.44) lead
to the same expression for the spring element force. The result is

                              Sij = -k k qi = S qi ,                                  (15.45)

where S is the stress matrix for the spring element given by

     For the example problem, the stress matrix for the spring between joints 1 and 2 is -ka ka . Then, force in
the spring element is

From eq. (15.36), the displacement at joint 2 is

Hence, the force in the spring element between joints 1 and 2 is

The stress matrix for the spring between joints 2 and 3 is -kb kb . Then the force in this spring element is

Substitute the solution for the nodal displacements from eq. (15.36) into previous equation to get

cussions beginning in article 15.2 through article 15.6. The method is summarized as follows:

1. Formulate the member stiffness matrix, and expand it to the overall structural degrees of freedom by adding
    rows and columns of zeros.

2. Assemble of the member stiffness matrices to form the unrestrained structural stiffness matrix.

2. Consider a three-degree-of-freedom model of the string in tension shown in figure. 15.16. Let T denote the
horizontal component of the tension force. The three degrees of freedom are the vertical displacements and cor-
responding forces at the quarter points. The analysis of this structure is different from the analyses we have been
using in that we have to take equilibrium on a slightly deflected configuration rather than on the undeformed con-
figuration even though the displacements are small. A typical free body diagram to be used in the analysis is

shown in the figure. Note that it is the horizontal component of the string tension that is equal to T .

16.1 Coplanar trusses

The member stiffness matrix for a truss bar in the X-Y plane is developed from the analysis in article 6.1.1 on
page 153. A typical bar of length L located between joints i and j is shown in figure. 16.1. The coordinates of
beginning joint i are (Xi, Yi) , and coordinates of the end joint j are (Xj, Yj) , in the undeformed state. The angle
between the positive X-direction and directed line element i-j is denoted as  , and is determined from

                Xj - Xi                         Yj - Yi        Li - j = (Xj - Xi)2 + (Yj - Yi)2 .  (16.1)

Substitute the elongation-displacement relation (16.4) into Hooke's law (16.2) to get

     Free body diagrams of the bar and joints i and j are shown figure. 16.1. External forces in the X- and Y-direc-
tions at joint i are denoted by Q2i - 1 and Q2i , respectively, and external forces in the X- and Y-directions at joint
j are denoted by Q2j - 1 and Q2j , respectively. Equilibrium at joints i and j yield

     Q2i - 1 + Ni - j cos  = 0 , Q2i + Ni - j sin  = 0 , Q2j - 1 - Ni - j cos  = 0 , and Q2j - Ni - j sin  = 0 .  (16.8)

where {Q}i - j is the joint force vector and matrix b is defined in eq. (16.6). Substitute eq. (16.7) for the axial
force in eq. (16.9) to get

                                  {Q}i - j = E-----A-- b     b T{q}i - j -  b (NT)i - j .                         (16.10)

vector. The stiffness matrix for the truss bar is

                                                  -cs -s2 cs s2

Properties of the truss stiffness matrix (16.12):

 It is symmetric since the bar is linear elastic and the displacements are small.

 The sum of column elements is zero. This results from equilibrium of the bar for each unit displacement state.

For example UDS 1 {q} = 1 0, 0 0 T and the joint forces are

                               T                   T
{Q} = Q2i - 1 Q2i Q2j - 1 Q2j = (EA / L) c2 cs -c2 -cs (1) .

    Sum forces horizontally Q2i - 1 + Q2j - 1 = (EA / L)(c2 + (-c2))(1) = 0 .
    Sum forces vertically Q2i + Q2j = (EA / L)(cs + (-cs))(1) = 0 .
    Sum moments about joint i LcQ2j - LsQ2j - 1 = L(EA / L)[c(-cs) - s(-c2)](1) = 0 .
 Det[K] = 0 since the bar is not restrained against rigid body displacements.
 Diagonal elements are positive.

The fixed-end force vector is

                      {Q0}i - j =  Q02i - 1                                 -c         (16.13)
                                    Q02i           = - b (NT)i - j = - -s (NT)i - j .

                                   Q02j - 1                                  c
                                    Q02j                                     s

Note that the nodal force vector is equal to the fixed-end vector when the joints are fixed and cannot displace; i.e.,
{Q}i - j = {Q0}i - j if {q}Ti - j = 0 0 0 0 .

Equation (16.7) is rewritten for bar i-j as

                                   Ni - j = S {q}i - j - (NT)i - j ,                   (16.14)

and the 4X1 fixed-end actions for the truss member. The stiffness matrices are expanded to 6X6 by adding two
rows and two columns of zeros, and the column vectors are expanded to 6X1 by adding two rows of zeros. Refer

Addition of the 6X1 force vectors for each truss member equals the external joint force vector acting on the truss.
This addition of force vectors satisfies equilibrium at the joints assuming the procedure to expand each truss ele-
ment to six degrees of freedom to four degrees of freedom is done correctly. Hence, the condition of equilibrium

16.1.1 Assembly algorithm

Consider again the three-bar truss in example 16.1 on page 440. For computer implementation an algorithm is
presented to assemble the 6X6 unrestrained structural stiffness matrix from the three 4X4 truss stiffness matrices,
and to assemble the 6X1 fixed-end vector from the three 4X1 fixed-end action vectors. Let a truss member be
denoted by m, where m = 1 for bar 1-2, m = 2 for bar 1-3, and m = 3 for bar 2-3. A description of symbols used in
the of assembly algorithm is given in table 16.2.

The fixed-end action vector in eq. (i) of example 16.1 for the unrestrained truss reduces to

                       {Q0} = 0 (NT)1 - 3 0 0 0 -(NT)1 - 3 T . (e)

Elements in rows 3 and 6 constitute  {Q0 }  while the remaining rows constitute     {  Q0   }  .  Thus,

Solution to part (b). Equation (15.31) on page 429 with the addition of the fixed-end action vector is

                       {Q} =                K {q} +  K       {q}  +  {  Q  0  }  .                           (g)
                                                                           

The fixed-end action vector is subtracted from each side of this equation, since it is a known vector determined
from the specified temperature changes in the bars. That is, eq. (g) is written in the form

                                     {Q} + (-{Q0 }) = K {q} + K {q}

The vector -{Q0} is called the equivalent joint force vector. In this example the prescribed joint displacement
vector is {q} = q1 q2 q4 q5 T = 0 0 0 0 T , and the prescribed joint force vector is

{Q}T = Q3 Q6 = 0 0 . The solution for the unknown joint displacement vector is

{q} = K         -1  0{-Q } , where the inverse matrix is     [K]-1      =     adj   K           / det K   .  (i)

So the inverse of the restrained structural stiffness matrix is

Hence, the inverse satisfies K K = I . The solution for the unknown nodal displacement vector is

Combine terms in eq. (s) to get the final result

Hence, the matrix solution for reactive forces Q1 and Q5 satisfy horizontal equilibrium. The condition for vertical
equilibrium is Q2 + Q4 = 0 . Substitute the results for these reactive forces from eq. (q) into the condition for
vertical equilibrium to get

Note that the algebra in eq. (u) is the same as the algebra detailed in eq. (r) to eq. (t). So the condition for vertical

Note that for this statically indeterminate truss all three bar forces are proportional to the change in temperature
of bar 1-3.

16.1.2 Self-strained truss
Strain of the bars in a truss can occur due to temperature changes and also due to the lack of fit during assembly,
even in the absence of applied nodal forces. The analysis for lack of fit of bar 1-3 in example 16.2 is achieved by
replacing the thermal force by

                                                    (NT)1 - 3  EA( / L)1 - 3 ,

where  is the specified displacement of the bar to connect it to joints 1 and 3. For a gap between joints  > 0
and for an overlap  < 0 . Hence, the solution for the bar forces in example 16.2 can be interpreted for the prob-
lem of lack of fit of bar 1-3 by replacing (NT)1 - 3 with EA( / L)1 - 3 .

Example 16.3 Self-strained configuration of the truss in example 16.2

Now consider a statically determinate configuration of the truss in figure. 16.2, which is shown in figure. 16.6.
Support conditions impose displacements q2 = q4 = q5 = 0 . The applied external forces are specified as
Q1 = Q3 = Q6 = 0 , and only bar 1-3 is subject to a thermal force (NT)1 - 3 = EA(T) .

                             {Q} =     K {q} +             K        {q}         +  {  Q  0  }  .                                 (e)

The solution of eq. (e) for the unknown joint forces, or the reactive forces, is

                                       Q2 = Q4 = Q5 = 0 .                                                                        (g)

There no external forces acting on the truss since both the applied and reactive forces are zero. Consequently, it is
reasonable to surmise that the internal forces in the bars vanish. That is,

                                    N1 - 2 = N1 - 3 = N2 - 3 = 0 ,                                                               (h)

which can be verified using eq. (16.14).

Solution to part (c). The elongation of a truss is determined from eq. (16.4). Using the direction cosines listed
in table 16.1, the elongation of each bar is given by

                           1 - 2 = (1)(q3 - q1) + (0)(q4 - q2) = 0

                           1 - 3 = (0)(q5 - q1) + (1)(q6 - q2) = L(T) . (i)

              2 - 3 = -----1-- (q5 - q3) + ---1--- (q6 - q4) = ---1--- (q6 + q3) = 0

Hence, bars 1-2 and 2-3 do not change in length, and the new length of bar 1-3 is L(1 + T) . Assuming
T > 0 , the displaced truss is shown with respect to initial configuration in figure. 16.7.

The compliance matrix in eq. (m) was obtained by inverting two 2X2 sub-matrices, rather than directly inverting
the 4X4 stiffness matrix K . Exploiting the symmetry conditions as illustrated in figure. 16.10, reduces the

16.2 Structures containing beam members

Consider a prismatic, homogeneous beam that is referenced to the Cartesian system x-y-z. The z-coordinate is the
longitudinal axis, and the coordinates x and y define cross-sectional axes with the origin at the centroid. Assume
at least one axis x and/or y is an axis of symmetry so that the product area moment Ixy = 0 . External loads are
specified as a transverse distributed load fy(z) as shown in figure. 3.8 on page 41, and we assume a change in
temperature in the form T(y, z) = y(z)y(s) . For this form of the prescribed change in temperature the ther-
mal axial force NT = 0 in eq. (3.75), and thermal bending moment MxT  0 in eq. (3.78). The plane of loading
fy(z) coincides with the locus of shear centers. Hence, the beam bends in the y-z plane. Assume the Euler-Ber-
noulli theory in which the transverse shears in eq. (4.28) on page 82 equal zero. That is,

456                                                                                      Aerospace Structures

tial equations (3.54) and (3.55) are

where the thermal bending moment is given by eq. (3.78) on page 46. The change in temperature on the contour
is T = y(z)y(s) and eq. (3.78) simplifies to

                               MxT = EIxxy(z) .                                              (16.22)

Let q1 denote the y-direction displacement of the neutral axis at z = 0, q2 the rotation of the cross section about
the x-axis at z = 0, q3 the y-direction displacement of the neutral axis at z = L, and q4 the rotation of the cross
section about the x-axis at z = L. Then the boundary conditions at the ends of the beam are

     The solution to the governing boundary value problem is sought by the method of superposition. Let the lat-
eral displacement be represented by the sum of displacements in the form

In eqs. (16.27) and (16.28) ordinary derivatives with respect to z are denoted by primes (e.g., v = dv ). Also, we
                                                                                                                       dz

let EIxx = EI . The boundary value problem (16.27) for displacement function v0(z) consists of an inhomoge-
neous differential equation with homogeneous boundary conditions, while the boundary value problem (16.28)
for displacement function v1(z) consists of a homogeneous differential equation with inhomogeneous boundary
conditions. Since the displacements and rotations vanish at the end points of the beam in the boundary value
problem for v0(z) , the solution for it will lead to fixed-end actions in the matrix structural analysis method. That
is, the fixed-end action problem accounts for distributed load intensity fy(z) , and the distributed temperature gra-
dient y(z) . By superposition the total bending moment is

                            Mx(z)  =  - EI(v0'' + v1'') - EIy         =   M0    +  M1    ,              (16.29)

16.2.1 Boundary value problem (16.28). Generalized displacements at the boundaries

The general solution for v1(z) satisfying the differential equation in boundary value problem (16.28) is a cubic
polynomial in the longitudinal coordinate, which is written as

The stiffness matrix of the beam member (16.49) has the following properties:
 It is symmetric, because the material is linear elastic and the displacements and rotations of the beam are

    assumed small.
 The column elements satisfy equilibrium for each unit displacement state.

    For example consider unit displacement state one with {q} = 1 0 0 0 T .

                                                                                                                        T                -6     -12       -6     T

As result of the four unit displacement states the elements of the beam stiffness matrix satisfy the following
relationships.

 The sum of L/2 times row one plus row two minus L/2 times row three plus row four is equal to zero.

 (L / 2)k1j + k2j - (L / 2)k3j + k4j = 0 .

 Since the stiffness matrix is symmetric, the column elements satisfy the same relationships as do the row ele-
 ments

 Det[K] = 0 , since the beam member is not restrained against rigid body displacement.

16.2.2 Boundary value problem (16.27). Fixed-end actions

The fixed-end action vector is computed from the boundary value problem (16.27) to account for the distributed
load and the temperature distribution in the direct stiffness method. Many practical problems can be analyzed
with a linear distribution of the load intensity and a linear distribution of the cross-sectional temperature gradient.
These linear distributions are specified as

              fy(z) = fy1(1 - z / L) + ffy2(z / L) and y(z) = y1(1 - z / L) + y2(z / L) .                                                            (16.50)

The values of the distributed load and temperature gradient at z = 0 are fy1 and y1 , respectively. At z = L, the
distributed load intensity is fy2 and the temperature gradient is y2 . The boundary value problem (16.27) reduces
to

                           EIv0 = fy1(1 - z / L) + ffy2(z / L)        0<z<L                                                                          (16.51)

{Q} = {Q0} + {Q1} . From eq. (16.48) we have

                                   {Q1} = K {q} ,                                (16.58)

where the 4X4 beam stiffness matrix is given by eq. (16.49) and {q} is the 4X1 joint displacement vector.
Hence, the total joint force vector is given by

                                                {Q} = {Q0} + K {q} .             (16.59)
Equation (16.59) is written in the form

                             {Q} + (-{Q0}) = K {q} ,                             (16.60)

where the vector -{Q0} is called the equivalent joint force vector. It is the negative of the fixed-end action vec-
tor.

     To summarize, the analysis of a structure composed of beam members, with some members subject to dis-
tributed loads and temperature gradients, is as follows:

1. Lock every joint of the structure against translation and rotation, and calculate the fixed-end actions.
2. Apply the fixed-end actions with the opposite sign.
3. Analyze the structure with the specified joint forces and the negative of the fixed-end actions;

    {Q} + (-{Q0}) . Note that the joint displacements computed in this step are the actual joint displacements.
4. Obtain the internal actions consisting of the shear force and bending moment by superposition.

tor of the beam member obtained from the solution of the assembly of the structural members.

Example 16.6 Multispan beam

Consider the multispan uniform beam in figure. 16.12. It is subject to equal and opposite couples in the y-z plane
at z = 0 and z = L. The magnitude of the moment of these couples is denoted by Ma . The bending stiffness EI is
the same constant in each span.

     a) Determine the unknown joint displacements using symmetry to reduce problem size.
     b) Draw the shear force and bending moment diagrams.
     c) Determine the support reactions.

Solution for the unknown joint displacements. The joints are taken at the support locations and are numbered
one to five from left to right. Hence, there are ten degrees of freedom (DOFs) as is shown in the top sketch in fig-
ure. 16.13. The support conditions mean the vertical displacements vanish; i.e.,

                                                     T
                                {q} = q1 q3 q5 q7 q9 = 05X1 .                           (a)

The geometry, boundary conditions, and material properties of the structure are symmetric about the vertical cen-

terline. If the top sketch of the beam and its DOFs are rotated 180 about this vertical centerline, the bottom
sketch is obtained. See figure. 16.13. The displacements and rotations at the joints in the top and bottom sketch
must be the same. Hence, symmetry implies the joint rotations must satisfy

Clearly, the last symmetry condition on the rotations means rotation of the center joint vanishes; q6 = 0 . Then,
the analysis for the response of the beam reduces to a two-span beam, clamped at its right end as is shown in fig-
ure. 16.14. The two active degrees of freedom are rotations q2 and q4 . The stiffness matrices (16.49) for beam

Again, note that the z -coordinate in these formulas for the shear force and bending moment in member 2-3 is

local to the member and runs from zero to L. However, the beginning joint 2 corresponds to the global longitudi-
nal coordinate L, and end joint 3 corresponds to the global longitudinal coordinate 2L. The relationship between
the member local coordinate and the global structural coordinate has to be taken into account when drawing the
shear force and bending moment diagrams. The shear force and bending moment diagrams are shown in figure.
16.15. In this example, the shear force diagram in antisymmetric, and the moment diagram is symmetric, about
the center of the multispan beam.

Example 16.7 Clamped-clamped, stepped beam restrained by a spring

The beam structure shown in figure. 16.18(a) has a step change in thickness at midspan, and is clamped at each
end. The left half of has a uniform flexural stiffness 2EI , and the right half has a uniform flexural stiffness EI .
Each half has a length denoted by a . A vertical linear elastic spring of stiffness k = 6EI / a3 is connected at
midspan. The structure is subject to a vertical distributed load and a vertical point force P applied at midspan.
The distributed load is uniform on the left half with intensity fy0 , and decreases linearly from fy0 to zero on the
right half. Model the response of the beam with two beam members, one in each half, and a spring member.
Determine

     a) The restrained structural stiffness matrix.

     b) The fixed-end action vector.

     c) The unknown joint displacements.

     d) The support reactions.

     e) The shear force and bending moment in the left half of the beam.

16.3 Coplanar frame structures

Frame members in a skeletal structure resist applied loads both by axial deformation and bending deformation.
Frames are often modeled by assuming the joints are rigid, which means that members meeting at a joint have the
same rotation. That is, instead of frictionless pins or ball and socket joints used to model trusses, the connections
at a joint under the rigid joint assumption implies that bending moments in the members at the joint do not van-
ish. When distributed lateral loads act on the member, frame elements may be required even if the joints at the
end of the member are modeled as frictionless pins. In a truss the loads are assumed to only act on the joints, and
the members are not subject to lateral distributed loads. The stiffness matrix for a frame member is the superpo-
sition of the stiffness matrix for a truss member and the stiffness matrix for a beam member. There are three
degrees of freedom at each joint in a coplanar frame member: two displacements and a rotation as shown in fig-
ure. 16.20. In this figure, degrees of freedom labeled one and four account for axial deformation, degrees of free-
dom two and five account for lateral deformation in bending, and degrees of freedom three and six account for
rotations in bending. These degrees of freedom are referred to Cartesian coordinate directions along the longitu-
dinal axis and the axis perpendicular to the member. Let the coordinate along the longitudinal, centroidal axis be
denoted by z, 0  z  L , and let y be the coordinate perpendicular to the member.

The frame member stiffness matrix (16.64) is symmetric, singular, and its diagonal elements are positive. Let the
6X1 generalized joint force vector corresponding to the generalized displacement vector for the member in local
coordinates be denoted by

                                                                                                      T  (16.65)

where the frame member stiffness matrix in local coordinate directions is given by eq. (16.64).

16.3.1 Transformation of Cartesian coordinates

Let a coplanar frame assembly be defined with respect to global Cartesian coordinate directions (X,Y,Z). The
local Cartesian coordinates of a frame member are (z, y, x) with the z-coordinate along the reference axis of the
member. The z-axis lies in the X-Y plane at an angle  with respect to the positive X-direction as shown in figure.
16.22. To effect the assembly of member stiffness matrices it is necessary to transform the stiffness matrix
(16.64) of a member from local coordinate directions (z, y, x) to the global coordinate directions (X,Y,Z). The
transformation from one Cartesian system (X,Y,Z) to another Cartesian system (z,y,x) at joint i is effected by the
direction cosines of the latter with respect to the former. For example, denote the cosine of the angle of the z-
direction with respect to the Z-direction as cos(z, Z) , the cosine of the angle of the z-direction with respect to the

Y-direction as cos(z, Y) , etc. Then the Cartesian coordinate transformation from global to local directions in
terms of the direction cosines is

                                     z = cos(z, X)X + cos(z, Y)Y + cos (z, Z)Z                           (16.67)
                                     y = cos(y, X)X + cos(y, Y)Y + cos (y, Z)Z .
                                     x = cos(x, X)X + cos(x, Y)Y + cos (x, Z)Z

From figure. 16.22 the directions cosines in terms of angle  are as follows.

cos (z, X) = cos , cos(z, Y) = cos(-  + 90) = sin , cos(z, Z) = cos90 = 0                              (16.68)

cos (y, X) = cos( + 90) = -sin , cos(y, Y) = cos , cos(y, Z) = cos 90 = 0 ,                            (16.69)

cos (x, X) = cos90 = 0 , cos(x, Y) = cos90 = 0 , cos (x, Z) = cos180 = -1 .                           (16.70)

It follows from the coordinate transformation in eq. (16.76) that the transformation of the generalized displace-
ments from global to local directions is

In matrix notation the transformation in eq. (16.80) is written as

                                        {qi} =  T{qi} .

The matrix of direction cosines has the following properties:

T  cos  -sin  0 cos  sin  0 cos2  + sin2                                     0  0 100

  = sin cos 0 -sin  cos 0 =                     0                   sin2  + cos2  0 = 0 1 0 = I , (16.82)

and det  = 1 . Hence, the inverse of matrix  is equal to its transpose. Matrix  is said to be an orthogo-
nal matrix.

      Let c = cos and s = sin . The transformation of the displacements at joint j is the same matrix equa-
tion as at joint i except that the components of the vectors are those corresponding to joint j. Hence, the transfor-
mation of the generalized displacement vector from global to local coordinate directions for frame member i-j
can be written in matrix form as

Transformation matrix T is also an orthogonal matrix. That is, its determinate is equal to one and its inverse is
equal to its transpose.

16.3.2 Frame stiffness matrix in global coordinate directions

The generalized joint force vector for frame member i-j transforms from global coordinate directions to local
coordinate directions in the same manner as the generalized displacement vector does for the member. Hence,
from eq. (16.84) the transformation of the 6X1 generalized force vector for element i-j is

              {Q} = T {Q} ,                                              (16.86)

                                                                                                                                                                                            T

where the 6X1 generalized force vector in global directions is {Q} = Q3i - 2 Q3i - 1 Q3i Q3j - 2 Q3j - 1 Q3j .
Since the 6X6 transformation matrix is orthogonal, the inverse transformation from local to global directions is

              {Q} = T T{Q} .                                             (16.87)

     To obtain the 6X6 frame element stiffness matrix in global coordinate directions, substitute (16.84) for the
generalized displacement vector, and substitute (16.86) for the generalized force vector, into eq. (16.66) to get

                                                   T {Q} = K T {q} .     (16.88)
Pre-multiply this equation by T T , recognizing that T T T = I , to get

                                  T                                      (16.89)

              {Q} = T K T {q} = K {q} .

                                                T

The 6X6 matrix K = T K T is the frame member stiffness matrix in global coordinate directions, and is
given by

Fig. 16.23 Frame member with an arbitrary orientation referenced to global coordinate directions.

The frame stiffness matrix (16.90) is symmetric and singular, and the diagonal elements are positive. Equilibrium
of the frame member shown in figure. 16.23 for each of the six unit displacement states leads to the following
relations for the elements of the stiffness matrix.

 Horizontal equilibrium: k1j + k4j = 0 , j = 1, 2, ..., 6 , which implies row 1 plus row 4 = 0.

 Vertical equilibrium: k2j + k5j = 0 , j = 1, 2, ..., 6 , which leads to row 2 plus row 5 = 0.

 Moment equilibrium about joint i: k3j + (L sin )k4j - (L cos )k5j + k6j = 0 , j = 1, 2, ..., 6 , which leads

The stress matrix for the frame member i-j relates the internal axial force N , the transverse shear force V , and
the bending moment M to the generalized joint displacement vector. We can combine the stress matrix for the
truss member, eq. (16.14), and the stress matrix for the beam member, eq. (16.44), if local coordinate direction
displacements are employed. With due regard for the joint numbering convention for the frame member relative
to the numbering convention of the truss and beam members, the following relationship can be obtained from the
stress matrices of the truss and beam members:

Recall that the axial coordinate z is a local coordinate in the frame element, which is zero at the beginning joint

i and equal to the length L of the frame element at end joint j. The 3X6 stress matrix S(z) (16.91) is refer- i - j
enced to the generalized displacement vector in local coordinate directions. The stress matrix in terms of the gen-
eralized displacement vector in global coordinate directions is obtained by substituting (16.84) for the
displacement vector in eq. (16.91) to get

The spar is clamped at the root and free at the tip, and the strut is pinned-connected to the spar and the support.
The matrix structural model consists of three members as shown in figure. 16.32(a). Since the air load bends the
spar which in turn stretches the strut, the structure is modeled with a frame member between joints 1 and 2, a
beam member between joints 2 and 3. and a truss bar between joints 2 and 4. The degree of freedom numbering
convention is shown in figure. 16.32(b).

CHAPTER 17  Finite element method

The direct stiffness method presented in chapters 15 and 16 developed matrix structural analyses for the linear
elastic response of truss and frame members connected at a finite number of joints. Engineering bar theory mod-
eled the frame members so that the deflection and stresses were readily computed in the member once the gener-
alized displacements of the joints were determined by matrix methods. The direct stiffness method is a finite
element method applied to trusses and frames. In the finite element method the joints are called nodes and the
members are called elements. The development of the finite element method arose out of the need to determine
influence coefficients for semimonocoque construction used in aerospace structures. Stiffened shells and flat
plates are continuum structures an with an infinite number of interconnection points. In this chapter we present
the finite element method to continuum structures in one dimension. Developments for two- and three-dimen-
sional continuum formulations are found in the large literature on the finite element method. We mention only
two of the many references on finite elements for engineering students: Reddy (2019), and Huebner, Thornton,
and Byrom (1995).

loads consist of an axial distributed load with intensity fz(z) (F/L) and a change in temperature that is indepen-
dent of the contour coordinate s but a function of the axial coordinate z (i.e., T(s, z) = 0(z) ). The bar is
restrained by a distributed spring proportional to the axial displacement with an intensity given by -cw(z) and
c  0 (F/L2). A free body diagram of a segment of the bar is shown in figure 17.1(b). The internal axial normal
force is denoted by N(z) . Axial equilibrium of the segment as z  0 leads to the differential equation

                             - d----N-- + cw = fz(z)               0<z<L.                       (17.1)

Hooke's law including the prescribed thermal force is N + NT = EAdw / dz , where NT = EA0(z) . Thus,

                                             N = EAd----w-- - 0 .                               (17.2)

Substitute (17.2) for the axial force in equilibrium equation (17.1) to get the governing differential equation for
axial displacement w(z) as

                             -d           EA  dw      -  0    + cw = fz(z) .                    (17.3)

                             dz  dz

The boundary conditions at z = 0 and z = L are to prescribe either the displacement w or the axial normal force
N. The displacement prescribed at the boundary is also called the essential boundary condition and the force pre-
scribed at the boundary is called the natural boundary condition.

Multiply (17.3) by an arbitrary axial displacement function w(z) and integrate:

                        L   d dw                                     L

     If the governing boundary value problem for w(z) (17.3) is satisfied, then (17.6) is also satisfied for any

w(z) for which the operations in (17.6) are defined. Note that in (17.6) the highest derivative of the displacement

form of the differential equation (17.3).

      In the finite element method the function w(z) is called a trial function. The function w(z) is called a test

function or a virtual displacement, and dw / dz is the virtual strain. Function w(z) is called a virtual displace-
ment because it is not the actual physical displacement, but merely a hypothetical, admissible displacement. Each
term in (17.6) represents virtual work, that is, the work done by the internal action EAdw / dz through the virtual
strain, work done by the distributed spring through the virtual displacement, work done by the prescribed distrib-
uted load and boundary forces through the virtual displacement, and the work of the virtual thermal force

The bilinear form B[w, w] associates a real number with any two functions w(z) and w(z) , and the linear form
F[w] associates a real number for any function w(z) . The bilinear form B[w, w] represents the internal virtual
work and the linear form F[w] represents the external virtual work. Let U[w] denote the portion of the strain
energy due to mechanical strain1 and that from the distributed spring. The expression for the strain energy is

All continuous functions w(z) defined on the open interval   {z 0 < z < L} have a finite strain energy

0  U <  , and U = 0 only if w(z) = 0 on  . The conditions that restrict the set of all continuous functions
having a finite strain energy are called displacement, kinematic, and essential boundary conditions. For example,
if it is prescribed that the trial function w(0) = q1 where q1 has a numerical value, and the total displacement at

z = 0 is w(0) + w(0) = q1 , then the virtual displacement w(0) = 0 . The external virtual work for w(0) = 0

For displacement prescribed boundary conditions the virtual displacement must vanish at the boundaries. Kine-
matically admissible trial functions w(z) are continuous, single valued, and equal the prescribed displacement
boundary conditions.

The principle of virtual work is to find a kinematically admissible displacement function w(z) such that

              B[w, w] = F[w] for all kinematically admissible w(z) .                                          (17.11)

The principle of virtual work (17.11) is a statement of equilibrium for the linear elastic bar, and it depends on the
boundary conditions. The trial function w(z) is selected to satisfy displacement boundary conditions, if any, on

the closed domain  = {z 0  z  L} . In the applications of the principle of virtual work it is not practical to
consider an infinite number of kinematically admissible test functions. Instead, a subset of kinematically admis-
sible functions is assumed. For example, polynomials in z are often selected because they are easy to differentiate
and integrate. Consider an approximate polynomial for the trial function w(z) and a similar polynomial for the

test function w(z) by selecting

              w(z) = a1 + a2z + a3z2 and w(z) = b1 + b2z + b3z2 .                                             (17.12)

Unknown coefficients ai in the trial function are determined from the principle of virtual work for every choice of
the coefficients bi, i = 1, 2, 3, in the test function. Coefficients bi are independent of the coefficients ai in the trial
function.

Example 17.1 An approximate solution by the principle of virtual work

Dimensional and material data for the bar shown in figure 17.1 are L = 500 mm, A = 400 mm2, E = 70,000 N/
mm2,  = 23.10-6 / (캜) , and c = 5103 N/mm2 . Uniform external loads are prescribed as fz(z) = 0 and a
prescribed change in temperature 0(z) = 40캜 for 0 < z < L . Boundary conditions are
w(0) = q1 = -0.20 mm and N(L) = FL = -40, 000N . Assume the trial and test functions for the displace-
ments as

                                 w(z) = q1 + a1z and w(z) = b1z .                                             (a)

Note that the trial function w(z) satisfies the prescribed displacement boundary condition at z = 0, and that the

test function, or virtual displacement function, w(z) vanishes at z = 0. The internal virtual work (17.7) is

                                     L

      B[w, w] =  {EA(a1)(b1) + c(q1 + a1z)(b1z)}dz = b1[(EAL + cL3 / 3)a1 + (cL2 / 2)q1] , (b)

              F[w] = N(L)(w(L)) + EAd----w-- 0dz = b1[LFL + EAL0] .

                                 0

The principle of virtual work (17.11) for the assumed displacement functions is

              b1[(EAL + cL3 / 3)a1 + (cL2 / 2)q1] = b1[LFL + EAL0]               b1  0 .                      (d)

The displacement and axial force in the approximate solution do not compare well with the exact solution.
Including polynomial terms of higher degree for the trial function and test functions (a) results in improved
approximate solutions. Rather than selecting polynomials of higher degree in the principle of virtual work, con-
sider a finite element approximation using piecewise, linear polynomials as is discussed next in article 17.2.

17.2 Finite elements in one dimension

As stated in eq. (17.11) the principle of virtual work applies over the whole domain  of the bar. However, the
principle of virtual work can also be applied to subdomains of the bar. In the finite element method we partition
 into subdomains called finite elements. Partitions are called meshes, and finite element meshes are character-
ized by the selection of nodal points. Consider the mesh

                         0 = z1 < z2 < z3 < ... < zM < zM + 1 = L ,                                                                (17.13)

where M denotes the number of elements and M+1 is the number of nodes. The kth element is denoted by

              k  {z zk  z  zk + 1}             k = 1, 2, ..., M .                                                                  (17.14)

Each element is mapped onto a standard element denoted by

                                                  st  { - 1 <  < 1} .                                                              (17.15)
The standard element is mapped onto the kth element by

               z = 1()zk + 2()zk + 1 , where 1() = (1 - ) / 2 and 2() = (1 + ) / 2 .                                               (17.16)
The inverse mapping is

                         2z - zz - zk + 1 2z - zz - zk + 1                            z  k .

                              zk + 1 - zk  hk

The length of the element is denoted by hk where hk = zk + 1 - zk . Functions i() , i =1, 2, are called shape
functions or interpolation functions, which have the properties

              1(-1) = 1       1(1) = 0     2(-1) = 0                                  1(1) = 1 .                                   (17.18)

     Kinematic admissibility requires the displacement function w(z) to be continuous between elements and
within an element. Continuity insures the derivative of the displacement is a square integrable function on  so

494                                                                                               Aerospace Structures

that the strain energy (17.9) is finite. The displacement in the kth element is denoted by w(k)(z) , z  k . Let the

displacements at the nodes zk and zk + 1 be denoted by w(k)(zk) = qk and w(k)(zk + 1) = qk + 1 , respectively. A
linear polynomial in the axial coordinate with two coefficients is sufficient to interpolate the displacement at the
two nodes, and it meets the continuity requirement within the element. The simple choice is to use the same lin-
ear interpolation functions for the displacement of the kth element as were used to interpolate coordinate z  k
(17.16). Hence, the trial function for the axial displacement of the kth element is

                                w(k) = 1()qk + 2()qk + 1                                      st .                                   (17.19)

At node zk + 1 the displacement from the end of the kth element is w(k)(zk + 1) = 2(1)qk + 1 = qk + 1 , and the

beginning displacement of the k+1 element is w(k + 1)(zk + 1) = 1(-1)qk + 1 = qk + 1 . Thus, interelement conti-
nuity is satisfied. The virtual displacement for the kth element is assumed to be the same functional form as the
trial function:

                                w(k) = 1()bk + 2()bk + 1                                      st ,                                   (17.20)

where coefficients bk are independent of the trial function.

                                                    (k) dw(k)
     The axial strain in the kth element is  = ------------ . By the chain rule and the inverse mapping (17.17) we

                                                             dz
transform the derivative with respect to z to the derivative with respect to  by

                                        d         =   d d             =    --2--  d         .                                        (17.21)

                                        dz d dz hk d

Take the virtual displacement equal to the trial displacement, or w(k) = w(k) , in (17.26), which implies bk = qk
and bk + 1 = qk + 1 . Then, multiply the result by one-half to identify the strain energy in the kth element as

                               U(k) = 1-2-(Bk[w(k), w(k)]) = 1-2- qk qk + 1 K(k) qk .                                                                                       (17.28)

corresponding external forces are shown at each node.

     If at node zk there is no prescribed externally applied point force, then we have the following relation from
eq. (17.42):

                                             Qk = 0 = N(k - 1)(zk) - N(k)(zk) .                                                      (17.43)

Equation (17.43) implies that the axial force is continuous at the node connecting the k-1 element to the kth ele-
ment if Qk = 0 . Displacement continuity at the common nodes is imposed in the finite element method. How-
ever, for the linear interpolation functions (17.20) the axial force is, in general, discontinuous at the common
nodes (i.e., N(k - 1)(zk) - N(k)(zk)  0 ). The jump in the axial force at common nodes decreases with mesh refine-
ment as is illustrated in example 17.2 below.

Example 17.2 Solution of example 17.1 using two finite elements

First consider a uniform mesh with M = 2 using the interpolation functions (17.16). The nodes are z1 = 0 ,
z2 = L / 2 , and z3 = L . The lengths of the elements are h1 = h2 = L / 2 . The total displacements for each ele-
ment are

                     w(1)() = 1()q1 + 2()q2 , and w(2)() = 1()q2 + 2()q3 .                                                              (a)

Note that virtual displacement in the first element at node one w(1)(-1) = 0 , since the displacement q1 is pre-
scribed at node one in the trial function.

The total external virtual work is the sum of the contributions from eqs. (i) and (k) is

              F[w]        =  F1[w(1)] + F2[w2]                         =  b 2 ( Q 2( 1 )  +  F(1)  +  Q(2)  +  F(2))      +  b 3 ( Q 3( 2 )   +  F(2))  .             (m)

At node 2 there is no prescribed external force, so                          Q2     =        2Q(1) + Q(2)2   =  0 . Also at node 2 the sum of the thermal

forces (j) and (l) is zero: that is,         F2       =     F(1) + F(2)2  2  =   EA0 + (-EA0)                        =    0 . Hence, the total external force at

node 2 vanishes. At node 3 the prescribed force                              Q3  =        Q(2)  =     FL , and the thermal force                 F3  =     F(2)  =  EA0 .

The total external virtual work is

Equate expressions (f) and (n) to get the principle of virtual work:

It follows from eq. (o) that the matrix equation to determine the displacements is

Note that the term involving displacement q1 is known and so it is moved to the right-hand side of eq. (p).
Numerical evaluation of matrix equation (p) is

The axial coordinate in element 1 is z = 2()(250 mm) and in element 2 it is

z = 1()(250 mm) + 2()(500 mm) . The axial displacement is plotted with respect to z from the exact solu-

The finite element representation of the axial displacement is a piecewise linear polynomial, which is an
improvement with respect to the virtual work result shown in figure 17.2.

17.2.1 Results from 4, 8, and 16 finite element solutions to example 17.1

Improved numerical solutions are obtained by considering uniform meshes of four, eight, sixteen, etc., elements.
As shown in figure 17.10, the piecewise polynomial approximation for the axial displacement using eight uni-
form elements is, to the scale of the plot, very close to the exact solution. The axial force from the exact solution

The strain energy and the natural boundary condition at z = L are used to measure the error in the finite element
solutions with respect to the exact solution. Results for uniform meshes of one to sixteen elements are listed in
table 17.1. The data in the table demonstrates that the strain energy converges faster than the natural boundary
condition to the exact solution as the number of elements is increased.

17.2.2 Convergence requirements

Heubner et al. (1995, p. 85) list the following requirements for mathematical convergence of the finite element
solution to the exact solution as an increasing number of smaller elements are used in the remeshng process.

 The elements must be made smaller in such a way that every point in the solution domain can always be
    within an element regardless of how small the element may be.

 All previous meshes must be contained in the refined meshes.
 The form of the interpolation functions must remain unchanged.
For example, the nodes in the mesh for M = 2 are also contained in the mesh for M = 4, nodes in the mesh for M
= 4 are also contained in the mesh for M = 8, etc. The same linear interpolation functions (17.16) are used in each
discretization.

17.2.3 Apparent loadings from the 8- and 16-element solutions of example 17.1

As illustrated in figure 17.11, the axial force exhibits jumps at the nodes between neighboring elements. These
jumps can be interpreted as a series of concentrated forces applied at the nodes, and these forces are called the
apparent loading (Szabo and Babuska, p. 63). Let Qk denote the apparent axial force at node zk . From (17.42),
the apparent axial force in the positive z-direction at an interior node is

                      Qk = N(k - 1)(zk) - N(k)(zk)  k = 2, 3, ..., M - 1 .  (17.44)

The forces at the nodes computed from the jump in the internal axial force are listed in table 17.2 for the 8-ele-
ment model and for the 16-element model. Note that the sum of these forces Qk vanishes in each model, which

is a consequence of the principle work as a statement of equilibrium. At common interior nodes the force Qk is
smaller in the 16-element model than in the 8-element model.

17.2.4 Adaptive mesh refinement beginning with the 8-element solution to example 17.1

A uniform mesh may converge slowly to the exact solution with continued refinement. In practice, finite element
simulations are performed on a structure where the exact solution is not known. For those structures whose exact
solutions are unknown, the apparent loading from the finite element solution can be used in adaptive procedures
to refine the mesh. Adaptive mesh refinement is based on assessing the relative error of the energy norm in each
element between the original loading and the apparent loading (Szabo and Babuska, p. 63). The energy norm for
a kinematically admissible function w(z) is denoted by w(z) , and it is defined as the square root of the strain

energy (17.9) (i.e., w  U[w] ). The mesh and shape functions of the original model are not changed in the sec-
ond solution of the model subject to the apparent loading. Those elements exhibiting the largest discrepancy in
the energy norm between the original loading and the apparent loading are subdivided to generate a new mesh.
The new mesh will not be uniform, and is called quasi-uniform. The adaptive mesh procedure is repeated with
respect to the new mesh. This repeated use of mesh refinement generates a sequence of meshes. An optimum
mesh is achieved when the local error is distributed uniformly through the mesh (Heubner et al., p. 514).

Consider the eight-element model (M = 8) with nine nodes. The nine nodes in the uniform mesh are

                      {z9} = {0, 1 / 8, 1 / 4, 3 / 8, 1 / 2, 5 / 8, 3 / 4, 7 / 8, 1}L .                      (17.45)

structural stiffness matrix K is 8X8. The displacement degrees of freedom and the corresponding forces are

The matrix equation K {q} = {Q} is solved numerically to determine the displacement vector {q} .
The axial displacement w(k) in each of the eight elements is computed from {q} , followed by the computation
of the energy norm in each element w(k) , k = 1, 2, ..., 8 .

For the apparent loading the nodal force vector from table 17.2 is                                           (17.48)

Without changing the restrained structural stiffness matrix, the equation K {q} = {Q} is solved numeri-

cally for the displacement vector {q} . Note that {q}  {q} . From the displacement vector {q} the axial
displacement in the kth element w(k) is determined. The energy norm for the displacement in each element from

est. A finite element analysis of this 14-element model resulted in a strain energy of the assembly of 7,788.23 N-

mm, and a natural boundary condition N(L) = -38, 164.2 N . Compared to the exact solution the percentage
error in the strain energy is 0.438 percent, and the error in the natural boundary condition is 4.59 percent. More-
over, compared to the results from the 16-element model with a uniform mesh in table 17.1, the 14-element
model has a smaller error in the strain energy and a smaller error in the natural boundary condition.

17.3 A beam element including transverse shear deformation

The principle of virtual work is developed for a uniform beam of length L that is symmetric about the y-z plane
as shown in figure 17.13. It is subject to a lateral distributed load intensity fy(z) (F/L) and a change in tempera-
ture T = y(z)y , 0  z  L , where y(z) (캜 / L ) is the prescribed through the thickness temperature gradient.
The y-direction displacement of the centroidal axis is denoted by v(z) (L), and the rotation of the cross section
about the x-axis is denoted by x(z) (radians).

                      prescribe either v or Vy , and to prescribe either x or Mx .                                                  (17.54)

For a symmetric cross section the transverse shear stiffness syy = 1 / cyy , where cyy (F-1) is the transverse shear
compliance. (Equations for the shear compliances are given by eq. (5.62) on page 142 for an open cross-sectional
contour and eq. (5.85) on page 145 for a closed cross-sectional contour.)

The basis functions 1() and 2() are the external shape functions with the interpolation properties (17.18).

The basis functions 3() and 4() are called internal shape functions. The internal shape functions vanish
at the nodes  = +-1 . The selection of the internal shape functions is based on Legendre polynomials. From
Szabo and Babuska (1991, p. 38) the expressions for the internal shape function are

     Consider the strain  = dx / dz appearing in the bending moment (17.52), and the rotation x appearing in
the transverse shear strain y() (17.53). As discussed by Reddy (2019, p. 294), in order to avoid the numerical
problem of "shear locking" in the thin beam limit where y  0 , a consistent interpolation procedure is
employed. That is, a consistent interpolation of the shear strain y() requires that the polynomial for the dis-
placement v() be one degree greater in  than the polynomial for the rotation x() . The beam element devel-
oped here is capable of representing a linear distribution of the bending moment Mx() and a constant shear
force Vy . Then dx / dz is linear in , which implies the rotation is quadratic in . It follows that displacement
v() is cubic in . The trial functions for the kth element are

Virtual degrees of freedom b2k - 1 b2k b2k + 1 b2k + 2 are associated with the nodal displacements (external
shape functions), and virtual degrees of freedom c(k) c(k) c(k) are associated with the internal shape functions.

Elements of the virtual displacement vectors {bk} and {c(k)} are independent of the trial functions (17.69).

17.3.3 Static condensation

The internal degrees of freedom  a(k) ,      a(k)       ,  and                        a(k)  associated with the internal shape functions do not affect

interelement continuity. To reduce the number of system equations to solve resulting from the assembly of ele-

ments, the internal degrees of freedom can be eliminated at the element level in the process called static conden-

sation. Further, the assembly algorithm is simplified if only the nodal displacements, or external degrees of

freedom are employed. The internal degrees of freedom are eliminated in terms of the nodal displacements

{q(k)} and the generalized force vector {FI(k)} by solving (17.100). Thus, from (17.100)

17.3.4 Bending moment and shear force
Substitute vector {a(k)} from (17.101) into the strain vector (17.77) to get

The bending moment and shear force are determined from the matrix relation

17.3.5 Requirements of the interpolation functions.

The remeshing procedure for an increasing number of elements presented in article 17.2.2 has the old mesh
embedded in the new mesh. Monotonic convergence of this sequence of finite element meshes also requires the
interpolation functions to be compatible and complete (Bathe, 1982). Compatibility means the displacements
must be continuous within the elements and between elements. Completeness means the displacement functions
of the element must be able to represent the rigid body displacements and uniform strain states. Consequently,
the beam element under consideration must be capable of representing zero strain states for rigid body displace-
ments when the element is not subject to external loads. Note that the determinate of the stiffness matrix (17.106)
is zero, since the element is not restrained against rigid body displacements. Now consider the response of the
beam element under the two rigid body modes:

              {q(k)}1 =   1 0 1 0 T and {q(k)}2 =                                             T                                                             (17.113)

                                                               hk / 2 1 -hk / 2 1 .

Generalized displacement vector {q(k)}1 is a vertical displacement of the element, and the generalized displace-
ment vector {q(k)}2 is a clockwise rotation of the element about its center. In the absence of external loading the
generalized force vectors {Q(k)} = 04X1 , {FE(k)} = 04X1 , {FI(k)} = 03X1 , and {F(k)} = 04X1 . The internal
degrees of freedom (17.101) for the rigid body modes and no external loading also vanish; i.e.,

              {a(k)}1 = Gaq {q(k)}1 = 03X1 and {a(k)}2 = Gaq {q(k)}2 = 03X1 .                                                                               (17.114)

Also, evaluation of eq. (17.104) for the rigid body displacements results in K(k) {q(k)}1 = 04X1 and

 K(k) {q(k)}2 = 04X1 , which are consistent with vanishing external loads. Finally, the strains (17.77) in the ele-
ment vanish for the rigid body displacements:

              {(k)}1 = q() {q(k)}1 = 02x1 and {(k)}2 = q() {q(k)}2 = 02x1 .                                                                                 (17.115)

Therefore, the beam element satisfies part of the completeness requirement of vanishing strains under rigid body
displacements. Constant strain states are demonstrated in the next two examples.

The bending moment is constant in the element and it is equal to the prescribed external moment Ma . The shear
force vanishes within the element. If Ma = 0 and y  0 , then bending moment Mx = 0 . However, the rotation
and displacement are not zero; i.e.,

                                                          x = 2 . (p) (Ly) / 2L

The shear force is constant in the beam and is equal to the prescribed external force Fa. For Fa > 0 the bending
moment decreases linearly from zero at the free end to a minimum (-FaL ) at the clamped end. The finite ele-
ment solution for transverse bending is the same as the exact solution of the governing boundary value problem.

ized forces acting on elements 1 and 2 from the distributed airload (a) are computed by numerical integration
because of the complexity of the integrands (17.97). (Refer to article 17.3.6 for details on numerical integration.)
The external generalized forces acting on each element are determined from eq. (17.105). The transpose of the

Guyan matrix used to compute the generalized force vectors {F(1)} and {F(2)} in eq. (17.105) is the same for
each element in this example. It is given by

We carry out Gaussian integration of eq. (17.118) after a discussion of the method.

                                                                                                                            1

The method of Gaussian quadrature is to approximate the integral I =  f()d by

                                                                                                                           -1

                                                              n                                                                            (17.119)

                                        I  Iappr = wi f(i) ,
                                                           i=1

where i are the abscissas of the Legendre polynomial Pi() , and wi are the weight factors. The abscissas, or
roots, of the Legendre polynomial are symmetrically located in the interval -1    1 . The weight factors are
determined such that a polynomial of degree p is exactly equal to the sum in (17.119). Consider a polynomial of
second degree f() = c0 + c1 + c22 . The exact integral is

                                                                1                                                                          (17.120)

                     I =  (c0 + c1 + c22)d = 2c0 + 2-3-c2 .

                                                               -1

The exact integral is determined by two coefficients, c0 and c2. The Legendre polynomial for n = 2 is

P2() = (- 1 + 32) / 2 . The roots of P2() = 0 are

                                        -1 / 3 and 1 / ( 3) .                                                                              (17.121)

526                                                                                                                            Aerospace Structures

Equation (17.119) for n = 2 is

                                I = Iappr. = w1f  -----1-- + w2f ---1--- .                          (17.122)
                                       3               3

Evaluating eq. (17.122) we get

                                      (w2 - w1) 1
                      I = Iappr. = 2(w1 + w2)c0 + ---------------------- c1 + --(w1 + w2) .         (17.123)
                                                      3
                                          3

Equate like coefficients in (17.120) and (17.123) to get three linear equations for the weight factors w1, and w2:

2 = w1 + w2                     0 = (w2 - w1) / ( 3)  21                                            (17.124)
                                                      -- = --(w1 + w2) .
                                                      33

The solution of eq. (17.124) is w1 = w2 = 1 . Note that the weight factors of the positive root and the corre-
sponding negative root are the same because the term with the odd power of  does not contribute to I (17.120).

Thus, a polynomial of degree 2 can be integrated exactly by evaluating it at +-1 / 3 and multiplying by the
appropriate equal weight factors.

     Consider the cubic polynomial f() = c0 + c1 + c22 + c33 whose exact integral is I = 2c0 + (2 / 3)c2 .
The Legendre polynomial for n = 3 is P3() = (- 3 + 53) / 2 . The roots of P3() = 0 are 0 , and +- 3 / 5 .
Equation (17.119) for n = 3 is

I = Iappr. = w1f(0) + w2f(- 3 / 5) + w2f( 3 / 5) = c0(w1 + w2) + c2(6w2 / 5) .                      (17.125)

Equating like coefficients between the last equation and the exact integral we find the weight factors w1 = 8 / 9
and w2 = 5 / 9 . In general, a polynomial of degree p is integrated exactly if n  (p + 1) / 2 .

Now consider the integrand in the definite integral (17.118). The integrand is

                      f() = 954.930(1 + ) 0.4357 - 0.375 - 0.06252 .                                (17.126)

Function f() is continuous in the interval   1 as shown in figure 17.22. Its Taylor's formula is an infinite

                           

series f() =  amm , where the am are real numbers. Consequently if f() is replaced by its Taylor series,
                         m=0

then the integrand is a polynomial of infinite degree. The integral of a polynomial of infinite degree implies an
infinite number of abscissas and weights for Gaussian quadrature, which, of course, is not practical. Only a finite
number of abscissas and weights in Gaussian quadrature are considered in the sequence of numerical integrations
to follow.

     Gaussian quadrature of the integrand (17.119) for n = 2 is                                     (17.127)
            Iappr. = w1f(-1 / 3) + w1f(1 / 3) = (1)(321.154) + (1)(673.889) = 995.043 lb.

Gaussian quadrature of the integrand (17.119) for n = 3 is

Iappr. = w1f(0) + w2f- 3-- + w2f 3-- = 8-- (631.627) + 5-- (178.857) + 5-- (560.829) = 972.382 lb.  (17.128)

For n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 the abscissa and weight factors are listed in table 17.4. Approximate values of
the integrals of (17.126) are listed in table 17.5 based on the data in table 17.4. The results in table 17.5 show the
integrals are slowly decreasing as the number of terms in the Gaussian integration increase. Apparently, the
approximate values of the integrals are asymptotically approaching the value of 961.96 lb., which is the value of
the integral of (17.126) computed from the function NIntegrate[f(), {, -1, 1}] in Mathematica.

17.4 Euler-Bernoulli beam element

The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory was discussed following table 4.4 on page 102, and in this theory we set the
transverse shear strain y = 0 . Hence, from eq. (17.53) the rotation of the cross section is related to the rotation

of the centroidal axis by x = -(dv / dz) . The material law for the shear force (i.e Vy in eq. (17.52) is not valid).
The shear force is reactive and it is determined by the first equilibrium equation (17.51). Combine the equilib-
rium equations (17.51) by eliminating the shear force to get

                       d2Mx                                   0<z<L.            (17.129)
                       ------------ + fy(z) = 0
                        dz2

The material law for the bending moment in eq. (17.52) becomes

                              Mx          EIxx  d2v           y

                                                 dz

Substitute the material law for the bending moment (17.130) into the equilibrium equation (17.129) to find the
fourth order differential equation for the lateral displacement v(z):

              d2        d2v                     + fy(z) = 0            0<z<L.

The boundary conditions at z = 0 and z = L in eq. (17.54) become

              prescribe either v or Vy , and prescribe either -d----v- or Mx .  (17.132)

     Multiply (17.131) by the virtual displacement v(z) and integrate over the domain. Then integrate the result
by parts twice with respect to z to get

st  { - 1 <  < 1} (17.15) is mapped to the kth element by (17.16), and the inverse mapping is given by

CHAPTER 18  Introduction to flexible
            body dynamics

The transient response of a rocket at liftoff is presented to motivate the subject of structural dynamics. The accel-
erations at launch result in significant load factors imposed on the spacecraft, or payload. User guides for a
launch vehicle specify load factors for preliminary design of the primary structure of the spacecraft. Often there
are limits placed on the lowest natural frequency of the payload to ensure its dynamic characteristics do not
adversely affect the control system of the booster (Sarafin, 1995). Thus, the capability to predict the load factor
for the primary structure of the payload/spacecraft at launch, and the frequencies of the payload package, are
necessary in the payload design. The example we begin with is the Atlas I.

18.1 Description of Atlas I

A spacecraft consists of mission-specific equipment called the payload and a collection of subsystem compo-
nents called a bus. Typical subsystem components may include attitude control, propulsion, communications,
electrical power, etc. (Sarafin, 1995, p. 451). The spacecraft bus may be able to support different payloads for dif-
ferent missions. As shown in figure 18.1, the main components of the Atlas I space launch vehicle from bottom to
top are an expendable booster, an expendable second stage called Centaur, and the payload/spacecraft (Isakowitz,
1995). The spacecraft is covered by a fairing. An adapter, also known as a launch vehicle adapter, structurally

Propellant weights in the booster and second stage, and the approximate structural weight are listed in table 18.2.

a. Gross weight of 362,200 lb. less the sum of propellant weights of 335,500 lb.and the payload weight of 3,773 l.

In terms of percentages

92.6 percent of the total weight is propellant,
6.33 percent of the total weight is structure, and
1.04 percent of the total weight is payload.

Clearly, most of the weight is propellant.

Objective. Determine the maximum vertical load factor of the payload at liftoff. We assume the loss of mass due
to propellant burn-off is small and can be neglected in the initial instants after liftoff.

18.2 Rigid body load factor

First, we assume Atlas I is a rigid body and determine the load factor from dynamic equilibrium. This analysis is
shown in figure 18.2, where it is determined that the load factor is 1.213. However, this rigid body analysis omits
information on frequencies. To determine frequencies of the structure we must consider flexible body dynamics,
which is discussed beginning in the next section.

18.3 Steps in flexible body dynamics

1. Equations of motion relative to the equilibrium state.
2. Free vibration problem; normal modes.
3. Coordinate transformation from physical coordinates to modal coordinates.
4. Transform initial conditions from physical coordinates to modal coordinates. Solve for the time history of the

    modal coordinates.
5. Transform back to physical coordinates.
6. Calculate the payload acceleration time history.

Step 1: Equations of motion about equilibrium. Consider a three-degree-of-freedom model of Atlas I shown
in figure 18.3(a). The model consists of three particles with lumped masses m1, m2, and m3 and two springs with
stiffnesses k12, and k23. Mass m1 is one-half the mass of the booster and Centaur, mass m2 is one-half of the mass
of the booster and Centaur plus the mass of the fairing, and mass m3 is the mass of the payload. The stiffness of
the booster and Centaur is represented by k12, and the stiffness of the launch vehicle adapter is represented by
k23.

The axial coordinates of the particles in the equilibrium state at t = 0 are zi(0) , i = 1, 2, 3 , and the displace-
ments of the masses from their equilibrium state are denoted by wi(t) , and wi(0) = 0 . The weight of each par-
ticle is denoted by Wi , i = 1, 2, 3 . From the free body diagram shown in figure 18.3(b) the equations of motion
are

                       F1(t) - W1 + F12 = m1w1 ,                                                          (18.1)

                       - W2 - F12 + F23 = m2w2 , and                                                      (18.2)

The spring forces are related to the relative coordinates between the particles. That is,
                                                                                                                                          (18.6)

                                    F23 = k23[(z3(0) + w3(t)) - (z2(0) + w2(t))]                                                          (18.8)
Substitute the spring force relations (18.5) into the equations of motion (18.1) to (18.3) to get

                      F1(t) - W1 + k12(z2(0) - z1(0))   =      
                                                           m1w1 + k12w1 - k12w2 ,

- W2 - k12(z2(0) - z1(0)) + k23(z3(0) - z2(0))   =                  +  ( k 12         +  k 23 ) w 2  -  k 23 w 3  ,  and
                                                        m2w2-k12w1

                      - W3 - k23(z3(0) - z2(0))  =

In the equilibrium state the eqs. (18.6) to (18.8) are

                                         F1(0) - W1 + k12(z2(0) - z1(0)) = 0                                                              (18.9)
                                    - W2 - k12(z2(0) - z1(0)) + k23(z3(0) - z2(0)) .

                                                - W3 - k23(z3(0) - z2(0))

The solution of the equilibrium equation (18.9) is

                      F1(0) = W1 + W2 + W3 = 362, 200 lb.

                      k23[z3(0) - z2(0)] = -W3                         .                                                  (18.10)

                      k12[z2(0) - z1(0)] = - W2 - W3

Force F1(0) is the reaction force from the launch pad acting on the rocket in the equilibrium state prior to liftoff.

     The equations of motion with respect to the equilibrium state are obtained by substituting eq. (18.10) into
the equations of motion (18.6) to (18.8). Writing these equations in matrix form we get

To estimate the structural stiffness of the booster and Centaur, assume the vehicle structure is a thin-walled cylin-

72.7 ft. The approximate weight of Centaur is 4,300 lb., and its length is 30 ft. We equate this structural weight to
the volume of material in the shell wall of the booster and Centaur times the specific weight of stainless steel; i.e.,

                 19, 900 lb. = 2(5 ft.)tw(102.7 ft.)(12in./ft.)20.286lb./in.3 .

Solve this equation for the booster shell wall thickness to get tw = 0.149763 in . Hence the equivalent cross-sec-
tional area of the booster and Centaur is 56.459 in.2 The structural stiffness is given by

We neglect the loss of mass due to fuel burn during the initial period of liftoff, and assume the net thrust is a step
function of time. That is,

The linear ordinary differential equation (18.14) with constant coefficients can be solved numerically by step-by-
step integration with respect to time, or they can be solved by the mode-separation method. The mode-separation
method is limited to linear differential equations, but the step-by-step method can be used for linear and nonlin-
ear ordinary differential equations. Step-by-step methods are discussed by Craig (1981, pp. 455-464) and
Schiesser (1994), which contain many references to the literature. The mode-separation method is detailed in the
following steps.

                                              {w(t)} = {} cos(t - ) .                                                                   (18.15)
Substitute eq. (18.15) into the free vibration equation of motion to get

                                 ( K - 2 M ){}( cos t - ) = 0             t > 0 .                                                                    (18.16)
Satisfying eq. (18.16) leads to
                                                                                                                               Aerospace Structures

                      ( K -  M ){} = 0 ,where  = 2 .                                            (18.17)

One solution to eq. (18.17) is for the amplitude vector {} = 03X1 , which leads to w(t) = 0 for all time. For
non-zero solutions of the amplitude vector we require

                                    Det( K -  M ) = 0 .                                         (18.18)

Evaluating the determinate (18.18) leads to the characteristic equation for  , which in this case is a cubic poly-
nomial:

          [- k12k23(m1 + m2 + m3) + (k12m3(m1 + m2) + k23m1(m2 + m3)) - m1m2m32] = 0 .          (18.19)
Numerical solution for the roots of (18.19), which are called eigenvalues, are

                      1 = 67159.2          2 = 5474.23   3 = 0 .                                (18.20)

For each eigenvalue (18.20) there are three linear equations to determine the amplitude vector {} obtained
from eq. (18.17). Since the determinate of eq. (18.17) vanishes for each eigenvalue, the three linear equations to
determine the amplitude vector {} corresponding to each  are not independent. Solutions for {} are called
eigenvectors. From eigensystem software we find the following eigen pairs:

                         -3                              -0.953559

                      1

The eigen pairs (1, {1}) and (2, {2}) correspond to elastic modes, and (3, {3}) corresponds to a rigid
body mode. An eigenvector {i} can be multiplied by a non-zero constant and still be a solution to eq. (18.17)
with  = i .

Step 3: Coordinate transformation. Now consider the solution to the forced vibration problem (18.14). Define
the modal matrix  whose columns are the eigenvectors:

                                                         0.94554410-3 -0.953559 1              (18.22)

Transform from physical coordinates {w(t)} to modal coordinates {q(t)} using the modal matrix:

                                    w1(t)    q1(t)

                                    w2(t) =  q2(t) .                                            (18.23)

                                    w3(t)    q3(t)

Step 4: Solutions for the time history of modal coordinates. Substitute transformation (18.23) into the force
vibration problem (18.14) to get

                         M  {q(t)} + K  {q(t)} = {T} .                                          (18.24)

Pre-multiply the previous matrix equation by the transpose of the modal matrix and write the result as

The generalized mass matrix is defined by Mg =  M  , the generalized stiffness matrix by

 Kg =  T K  , and the generalized force vector by {Tg} =  T{T} . The generalized mass and stiff-

The equations of motion for the modal displacements are decoupled. Equations (18.13) and (18.23) determine
the initial conditions for the modal displacements as

                 q1(0)            w1(0)                        q1 ( 0 )              w1 ( 0 )

ply it by  M to find  M   =  M . But  K  = Mg . Hence,

The inverse of the generalized mass matrix is equal to the reciprocal of the diagonal elements of Mg . For this
example the initial conditions for the modal coordinates are

                 qi(0) = 0        qi(0) = 0                     i = 1, 2, 3 .                           (18.28)

where 1 = 1 = 259.151 rad/s . The constants c1 and c2 are determined from initial conditions (18.28). The
final result for the first modal displacement is

Step 5: Transform back to physical coordinates. Equations (18.30), (18.33), and (18.35) are substituted for
q1, q2. and q3, respectively, into the transformation (18.23) to determine the physical displacements. The payload
displacement is

      w3(t) = - 0.00135416 + 3.42714t2 + 0.00136322 cos (73.988t) - 9.0573410-6 cos (259.151t) . (18.36)

Step 6: Payload acceleration. The payload acceleration computed from the second derivative of eq. (18.36) is

w3(t) = 6.85428 - 7.46257 cos (73.988t) + 0.608283 cos (259.151t) .                                      (18.37)

The payload acceleration over one period of the lowest frequency is plotted in figure 18.4. Maximum accelera-
tion is 14.56 ft./s2 at t = 0.0453 s . The payload load factor is n = 1 + 14.56 / 32.2 = 1.452 , which is a 19.7

                      [A]{r} = r{r} .                                                                     (18.40)

The eigenpairs are denoted by (r, {r}) . If {r} is a solution to eq. (18.40)), then cr{r} is also a solution
where cr is an arbitrary constant. Thus, the solution for the eigenvector is not unique. Scaling, or normalization,
is the process to make the amplitude of the eigenvector unique. One method to normalize the amplitude is to
require {r} be a unit vector in the n-dimensional space. That is, we specify

                                                      {r}T{r} = 1 .                                       (18.41)
Consider the eigenvalue problem for s-th mode

                                                   [A]{s} = s{s} .                                        (18.42)
Pre-multiply the r-th mode in eq. (18.40) by {s}T to get

                                            {s}T[A]{r} = r{s}T{r} .                                       (18.43)
Pre-multiply the s-th mode in eq. (18.42) by {r}T :

                                            {r}T[A]{s} = s{r}T{s} .                                       (18.44)
Take the transpose of eq. (18.43) and use the property of symmetry [A]T = [A] to find

                                            {r}T[A]{s} = r{r}T{s} .                                       (18.45)
Subtract eq. (18.45) from eq. (18.44) to find

                      0 = (r - s){r}T{s} .                                                                (18.46)

For r  s

                      {r}T{s} = 0     rs  r, s = 1, 2, ..., n .                                           (18.47)

The eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. The eigenvectors are said to be orthonormal if

                                   T      1 r = s
                      {r} {s} = 
                                       0 r  s                        .                                    (18.48)

     Since the characteristic equation p() = 0 has real coefficients, the roots  are real or occur as complex
conjugate pairs. It can be shown that roots are real (Boresi, 1965, p. 34).

     Let [] denote the nxn modal matrix whose columns are the orthonormal eigenvectors. The r-th column
contains the eigenvector {r} associated with eigenvalue r , r = 1, 2, ..., n . Since the eigenvectors are
orthonormal, the modal matrix has the property

                                              []T[] = [][]T = [I] .                                       (18.49)
The modal matrix is called an orthogonal matrix, and it has the properties

                      []-1 = []T          Det[] = 1 .                                                     (18.50)

Using the modal matrix the standard eigenvalue problem can be written as

     An nxn real, symmetric matrix is positive definite if all eigenvalues r > 0 , r = 1, 2, ..., n . It is positive
semidefinite if the eigenvalues r  0 , that is, some of its eigenvalues may equal zero. For structures having
rigid body freedoms the stiffness matrix [K] has as many zero eigenvalues as it has rigid body modes.

     The mode superposition method leads to the generalized eigenvalue problem

                                         [K]{} = [M]{} ,                        (18.55)

where the nxn matrices [K] and [M] are real and symmetric, {} is the nx1 eigenvector, or modal vector, and the
eigenvalue  is equal to the square of the natural frequency  . Refer to eq. (18.17). The generalized eigenvalue
problem (18.55) can be reduced to the standard form in eq. (18.38) if the mass matrix is positive definite (Bathe,
p. 573). Then all the properties of the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and characteristic polynomials can be derived
from the properties of the standard eigenvalue problem. In particular, for the generalized eigenvalue problem

 all n of the r 's are real (no complex conjugates), and

 for r  s , {r}T[M]{s} = 0 (i.e., the eigenvectors are M-orthogonal).

     Vanishing of the determinate Det([K] - [M]) = p() = 0 is equivalent to finding the roots of a polyno-

mial of degree n. If n  5 , iterative solution procedures have to be employed (Graig, 1981). There are many effi-
cient subroutines available in various scientific subroutine libraries to numerically solve eigenvalue problems. In
Mathematica the function "Eigensystem[{K,M}]" finds numerical eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the general-
ized eigenvalue problem. In MATLAB the statement "[V,D] = EIG(K,M)" finds a diagonal matrix D of general-
ized eigenvalues and a full matrix V whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors so that

[K][V] = [M][V][D] . For the numerical solutions to the practice exercises listed in article 18.11 it is assumed
the reader has access to a subroutine to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

18.5 Hamilton's principle and Lagrange's equations

Consider a particle of mass M in motion along the x1-x2 plane as shown in figure 18.6. The position vector of the
particle at time t is denoted by R(t) , where

                      R(t) = x1(t)^i1 + x2(t)^i2 ,                                                  (18.56)

where ^i1 and ^i2 are unit vectors in the x1 -, and x2-directions, respectively. From Newton's second law the equa-

tion of motion for the particle is solved for its motion R(t) , t > t0 , given its position R(t0) and the velocity

dR
------(t0) at t = t0 . In contrast to Newton's method, Hamilton's approach to this moving particle is to determine
dt

the motion R(t) given the positions R(t0) and R(t1) , t1 > t0 . All positions in the interval t0  t  t1 describe a

time-dependent path illustrated by a curve in figure 18.6. The path labeled R(t) represents the actual motion.

The path labeled R (t) represents a motion from R(t0) to R(t1) in the vicinity of the actual motion.

Begin with D'Alembert's principle and introduce the inertia force in addition the applied force F and write the
dynamic equation of equilibrium as follows:

                                        d2R                                                         (18.57)
                                 F - M-------- = 0 .

                                         dt2

At a fixed time introduce an infinitesimal virtual displacement denoted by the function R(t) . We can imagine
the motion is stopped at time t when the virtual displacement is imposed on the particle with both the applied
force and inertia force acting on the particle. The virtual changes in the coordinates imposed on the particle at a
fixed time are denoted by x1(t) and x2(t) , so that

                      R(t) = x1(t)^i1 + x2(t)^i2 .                                                  (18.58)

The varied path R*(t) in the vicinity of the actual path R(t) is

                                 R*(t) = R(t) + R(t) .                                              (18.59)

Since the varied path and actual path coincide at t = t0 and t = t1 the virtual displacement vanishes at these times:

Equation (18.63) shows we can interchange the virtual operator ( ) and the differential operator d( ) / dt . Use
the result from eq. (18.63) to write eq. (18.62) as

                                                            t0

Equation (18.69) is Hamilton's principle. Note that W is not the total virtual work. It is the virtual work of the
non-inertial forces.

18.5.1 Lagrange's equations

Deriving equations of motion for connected bodies using Newton's laws as was done in step 1 of article 18.3
requires separate free body diagrams of each component, and the forces of interaction had to be eliminated to
arrive at the final set of equations. An alternative method is to use the scalar functions kinetic energy T and the
potential energy V of the system in Lagrange's equations to obtain the equations of motion. Lagrange's equations
are derived from Hamilton's variational principle (18.69). In general, the kinetic energy of a particle as depicted
in figure 18.6 is a function of its position (x1, x2) and its velocities (x1, x2) at time t (i.e., T = T(x1, x2, x1, x2) ).
The virtual change in kinetic energy is

                                                  T             T               T  T 
                                     T = ------- x1 + ------- x2 + ------- x1 + ------- x2 .                                                             (18.70)
                                                  x1            x2              x1                 x2

     The virtual work of the applied force acting on the particle is W = F  R = F1x1 + F2x2 . The applied
forces can be decomposed as Fi = Qi + Ri , i = 1, 2 , where Qi are non-conservative forces and Ri are the con-
servative forces. Conservative forces are determined in terms of the potential energy function V(x1, x2) by the
relations

                                               R1 = -----V---               R2 = -----V--- .                                                             (18.71)

The virtual work is expressed as

    W = (Q1 + R1)x1 + (Q2 + R2)x2 = Q1 - ----V--- x1 + Q2 - ----V--- x2 .                                                                                (18.72)
                                                                                 x1                                     x2

18.6 The dynamic response of an elastic thin-walled bar

Starting with Hamilton's principle we develop a weak form for the dynamic response of a thin-walled bar suit-
able for a finite element analysis. Assume the bar is homogenous with a uniform cross section along the z-axis,
0  z  L , where L denotes the length of the bar. Since the bar is a one-dimensional continuum, Hamilton's prin-
ciple (18.69) is expressed as

                                        t1 L                                                             (18.80)

                                         (T + W)dz dt = 0 ,

                                        t0 0

where T is the virtual kinetic energy per unit axial length, and W is the virtual work of the non-inertial forces
per unit axial length. From eqs. (3.20) and (3.22) on page 36, and eq. (3.26) on page 37, the displacements of a
material point on the contour of the cross section are

                      us(s, z, t) = - u(z, t) sin (s) + v(z, t) cos (s) + rn(s)z(z, t) ,                 (18.81)

             u(s, z, t) = u(z, t) cos (s) + v(z, t) sin (s)-rt(s)z(z, t) , and                           (18.82)

                      uz(s, z, t) = w(z, t) + y(s)x(z, t) + x(s)y(z, t) .                                (18.83)

     The virtual work per unit axial length is determined from conservative forces and non-conservative forces. It
is expressed as

18.7 Finite element model for the dynamics of an axial bar

The weak form governing the response of the bar is given by eq. (18.118). Following the discussion in article

where M denotes the number of elements, and M+1 is the number of nodes. The kth element is denoted by

Each element is mapped into a standard element denoted by

                                                 st  { - 1 <  < 1} .                                                     (18.124)
The standard element is mapped onto the kth element by

              z = 1()zk + 2()zk + 1 , where 1() = (1 - ) / 2 and 2() = (1 + ) / 2 .                                      (18.125)

The length of the element is denoted by hk where hk = zk + 1 - zk . Let w(k)(z, t) denote the axial displacement

Note that the mass matrix in eq. (18.134) is not diagonal, but it is symmetric. This mass matrix is called a consis-
tent mass matrix, since the spatial distribution of the velocity function is consistent with the assumed spatial
distribution of the axial displacement function (18.127).

Consider a three-degree-of freedom model of a uniform bar shown in figure 18.11 that undergoes unrestrained
axial motion. The mass per unit length m and the axial stiffness EA are constant. The bar is modeled with two
finite elements 1 and 2, each with lengths h1 = h2 = L .

The Dirac delta function is depicted in figure 18.12, in which we take the limit            Fig. 18.12

is well defined. Note the dimensional units of the Dirac delta function are recip-   --     the Dirac
rocal seconds, and the dimensional units of impulse Q^ are force-seconds. The               delta
impulsive force causes an initial velocity of the bar. To determine the initial             function.

Example 18.3 Free vibrations of a three-bar truss

The truss shown in figure 18.15 consists of three bars: 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4. Joints, or nodes, 2, 3, and 4 are fixed and

only joint 1 is movable. For all three bars the cross-sectional area A = 47510-6m2 , the modulus of elasticity

E = 70 GPa , and the mass density  = 2710 Kg/m3 . The length L = 2m . Determine the natural frequencies

in Hz and the corresponding modal vectors. Normalize the modal vectors such that the component with the larg-
est magnitude is equal to one.

18.8 Dynamic bending of a bar with two axes of symmetry

If the cross section is symmetric with respect to both the x- and y-axes through the centroid, then xsc = ysc = 0 ,
Ixy = 0 , rxy = 0 , and sxy = 0 . In this case of double symmetry, transverse bending is decoupled from torsion
in both the inertia and stiffness terms. That is, the inertia axis and elastic axis coincide. However, the motions of
the lateral displacement v(z, t) and the rotation x(z, t) are linked because of the presence of transverse shear
deformation y . The governing weak forms (18.117) and (18.119) are

   L                               L

    [m(v)v + syy(v + x)v]dz =  fy(z, t)v(z)dz + Q2(t)v(0, t) + Q8(t)v(L, t) .

The development of the generalized displacements in k follows the discussion in article 17.3.1 on page 508.

The lateral displacement of the kth element is denoted by                                  v(k)(, t)  and the rotation by       (k)(                      ,  t  )  .  Define  the

18.8.2 Method of dynamic condensation

To eliminate the internal degrees of freedom we employ the Guyan reduction method (Craig, p. 413) and (Qu,
2004, p. 52). The Guyan condensation matrix is determined by ignoring the inertia terms in the internal degrees
of freedom. Of course, an error is introduced with respect to the full dynamic model of element k. Refer to the
discussions about the error in the latter references. Let

with the data from example 6.5 on page 162. The length l = 0.8 m, cross-sectional area A = 171.01410-6m2 ,
second area moment Ixx = 124.2510-9m4 , radius of gyration rx = Ixx / A = 0.026955 m , modulus of elas-
ticity E = 68.3GPa , transverse shear coefficient syy = 2.195 MN , and the mass density  = 2, 710 Kg./m3 .
The flexural stiffness EIxx = 8, 486.28 N-m2 .

Determine the natural frequencies in Hz and the corresponding vibration modes for the one-element model
shown in figure 18.18(b).

For this two-degree-of-freedom model there is no prediction of the third and higher frequencies.

     For the cantilever beam of example 18.4, numerical analyses were conducted with two to sixteen equally
spaced condensed elements. The details are omitted here, but the results for the first four frequencies are listed in
table 18.4. The frequencies decrease with increasing mesh refinement, and the lowest two frequencies are con-
verging to 116.4 Hz and 668 Hz, respectively. The last row in the table lists the frequencies from a continuum
analysis of the cantilever beam using Euler-Bernnolli beam theory. The inclusion of transverse shear deformation
and rotary inertia in the finite element model result in lower values for the frequencies with respect to the Euler-
Bernnolli theory, particularly in the higher frequencies.

The lateral displacement for the first four modes of the cantilever beam are shown in figure 18.19. The mode
shapes were plotted such that the tip displacement was set equal to 0.2 m for clarity in the plots. The lateral dis-
placement passes through zero in the open domain 0 < z < 0.8 m once for mode two, twice for mode three, and
thrice for mode four. These zeros crossings are called vibration nodes. Vibration nodes are not to be confused

18.9 Vibrations of a coplanar frame

A bar in a coplanar frame is subject to extension and bending. In the local x-y-z coordinates of a bar, we assume
that it is symmetric with the respect to the longitudinal x-z plane and the y-z plane as in article 18.8. The dynamic
response of the bar for extension and bending in its y-z plane is governed by eq. (18.115) on page 555, which
reduces to

L  mvv + mww + mrx2xx + N----w--            x

We use Euler-Bernoulli theory so that transverse shear strain y = 0 , which means the cross-sectional rota-

tion. x = -----v- . Also, neglect the rotary inertia mrx2x in eq. (18.174). Ignoring rotary inertia and transverse
               z

shear deformation has negligible effect on the first few modes of vibration for slender bars (Langhaar, p. 288)1.
Let one finite element model the bar so that L = hk and z = 1()L . The frame element is shown in its refer-
ence configuration in figure 18.20(a) and in rotated configuration in figure 18.20(b). The 6X1 displacement vec-
tor of the frame element shown in figure 18.20(a) is

    of all modes when the theory of beams is employed as a basis for a study of vibrations of complicated structures, such as
    airplane wings and hulls of ships."

Example 18.5 A two-bar frame subject to harmonic excitation

The frame shown in figure 18.21(a) consists of two identical bars of length L. It is modeled with two finite ele-
ments. Element 1 is vertical with c = 0 and s =1, and element 2 is horizontal with c = 1 and s = 0. The base
of the vertical bar is subject to a horizontal harmonic displacement a sin(t) , where the amplitude is denoted by
a and the driving frequently by . There are nine degrees of freedom as shown in figure 18.21(b) for the unre-

For element 2 the mass matrix is given by eq. (18.186), and the stiffness matrix is given by eq. (18.187), where

the order of the columns is associated with generalized displacements u4 u5 u6 u7 u8 u9 . Assemble the mass

matrices to get the 9X9 unrestrained mass matrix Mu = M(1) + M(2) with due regard in the summation of

the matrix elements from the individual mass matrices to their location in Mu . Similarly, the 9X9 unrestrained

stiffness matrix is assembled as Ku = K(1) + K(2) . After assembly, the unrestrained matrix equation of

motion is reordered by simultaneously interchanging the rows and columns to u3 u4 u5 u6 u9 u1 u2 u7 u8 .
The resulting matrix equation of motion in partitioned form is

The prescribed displacement terms in the matrix equation of motion lead to a generalized force vector defined by

The matrix equation of motion governing the unknown displacements is rewritten as

The initial conditions are {u(0)} = 05X1 and {u(0)} = 05X1 . Transform from the physical displacements to
the modal displacements by {u(t)} = []{q(t)} , where the columns of the modal matrix [] are the eigen-
vectors. Equations of motion in modal coordinates are

Transform from modal coordinates to physical coordinates by {u(t)} =  {q(t)} . The vertical displacement
at the joint connecting the frame members is u5(t) , and for  = 0.91 it is

u5(t) = 256.34610-6 sin (t) - 333.60910-6 sin (5t) - 151.00910-6 sin (4t) - 47.468810-6 sin (3t) +

41.669310-6 sin (2t) + 20.198110-6 sin (1t)                                                               . (x)

The first term on the right-hand side of u5(t) is the forced motion and has the same frequency as the excitation.
The remaining five terms on the right-hand side constitute the natural motion with contributions from the five
natural frequencies of the frame. A graph of the displacement response is shown in figure 18.9 for 0  t  20 ,
where  is the period of the lowest natural frequency (i.e.,  = (2) / 5 = 0.006797 s ). The displacement
response exhibits the phenomena of beating.

           Pure undamped beating, in general, is the combination of two sinusoids that have differ-
     ent but closely spaced frequencies, as the two sinusoids pass into and out of phase with each
     other. (Hallauer, 2016).

In the case of the frame response shown in figure 18.22, the driving frequency  is close to the lowest natural
frequency 5 , and it is the combination of the two sinusoids sin (t) and sin (5t) that are the source of beat-
ing.

For  = 5 , the displacement u5(t) is

u5(t) = - 0.406236t cos (t) + 319.3410-6 sin (5t) - 158.11510-6 sin (4t) - 52.310910-6 sin (3t) +

45.908810-6 sin (2t) + 22.304210-6 sin (1t)                                                               . (y)

A graph of the displacement response is shown in figure 18.23 for 0  t  10 , where  is the period of the lowest
natural frequency. As shown in the graph, the amplitude of the vibrations for  = 5 increase linearly in time,
which is the condition of resonance.

APPENDIX A            Linear elasticity of solid
                      bodies

Solid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics that studies the behavior of solid materials under the action
of forces, temperature changes, or other external agents. Elasticity is a branch of solid mechanics that refers to
the ability of the body to return to its original size and shape after the forces causing deformation are removed. In
this appendix the basic equations of the three-dimensional elasticity theory are developed at material point in the
body. A material point, or particle, is identified by its position in a rectangular cartesian coordinate system

(x1, x2, x3) . The fundamental equations of elasticity consist of the geometry of deformation in Article A.1, the
stresses and equilibrium in Article A.2, and the stress-deformation relations in Article A.3. The focus is on the
classical linear elasticity theory in which the strains are small with respect to unity and the material is linear elas-
tic. The basic equations are summarized in Article A.4 along with a description of the boundary value problems
of elasticity ,

A.1 Geometry of deformation

A continuous three-dimensional body occupies a closed region denoted by B0 in the reference state. Let every
point of B0 be defined in a fixed rectangular cartesian system of axes x1, x2, x3 . Let B denote the closed region
of the body after it undergoes a deformation.The position vector of the point P0 in region B0 with respect to the
origin is

                      r      =    ^   +    ^             +    ^   ,  (A.1)
                                x1i1     x2i2               x3i3

where the unit vectors along the fixed axes are ^i1, ^i2, ^i3 . The particle at P0:(x1, x2, x3) passes to point
P:(y1, y2, y3) in region B , where coordinates (y1, y2, y3) are defined in the same fixed coordinate system. See
Fig. A.1. The position vector of point P referred to the same origin is

                      R      =    ^   +    ^             +    ^   .  (A.2)

The deformation of the body is defined by the equations

right-hand side denotes a function of three variables x1, x2, x3 , and yi on the left-hand side denotes the value of
the function. Equation (A.3) defines the final location of the particle in B that is located at point P0 in B0 . To
prohibit the possibility that a particle at point P in region B maps to more than one point in region B0 , or visa
versa, it is required that there is a one-to-one correspondence between points in regions B0 and B . It follows that
in region B eqs. (A.3) have single-valued solutions

           x1 = x1(y1, y2, y3)                 x2 = x2(y1, y2, y3)      x3 = x3(y1, y2, y3)             (A.4)

The functions defined in eqs. (A.3) and (A.4) are assumed to be continuous and differentiable in their respective
variables. Continuity insures no fracture of the body results in the deformation. If we choose eq. (A.3) to describe
the deformation of the body then x1, x2, x3 are the independent variables, and the formulation is called the
Lagrangian or the referential or material description. In the Lagrangian formulation we follow the particle origi-
nally at point P0:(x1, x2, x3) as the deformation proceeds. If we choose eq. (A.4) to describe the deformation of

the body then y1, y2, y3 are the independent variables, and the formulation is called the Eulerian or spatial
description. In the Eulerian formulation the same fixed spatial position y1, y2, y3 is occupied by different parti-
cles as the deformation proceeds. The Lagrangian description of the deformation is selected for the developments

that follow in this appendix. The position vector of point P relative to point P0 is denoted by u and is called the
displacement vector. Thus,

           u = R - r = (y1 - x1)^i1 + (y2 - x2)^i2 + (y3 - x3)^i3 .                                     (A.5)

Components of the displacement vector are

           u1(x1, x2, x3) = y1(x1, x2, x3) - x1

           u2(x1, x2, x3) = y2(x1, x2, x3) - x2                                                         (A.6)

     Deformation is quantified by the change in distance between any two points in a body. Consider two infini-
tesimally close points P0 and Q0 in region B0 that pass to points P and Q , respectively, in region B . The dif-

ferential line element P0Q0 in region B0 shown in Fig. A.2(a) passes to the differential line element PQ in

region B shown in Fig. A.2(b). The differential position vector of line element P0Q0 is

A.1.1 Physical interpretation of strain components ij

For the line element parallel to the x1 -axis in the reference configuration the components of the unit vector are
(n1, n2, n3) = (1, 0, 0) , and from eq. (A.16) its strain is given by L = 11 . For line element parallel to the x2 -
axis the components of the unit vector are (n1, n2, n3) = (0, 1, 0) , and its strain is given by L = 22 . For the
line element parallel to the x3 axis its strain is L = 33 . The physical interpretation of component 12 is deter-
mined from the passing of line elements dx1^i1 and dx2^i2 in region B0 to directions (N^ )1 and (N^ )2 , respec-
tively, in region B . In general the components of unit vector N^ are given by

If we and take (n1, n2, n3) = (0, 1, 0) in eq. (A.24), then L = 22 and the transition of the unit vector is
^i2  (N^ )2 . The result for (N^ )2 is

                                  ^     y1^ y2 ^ y3^  1 
                         (N)2 = ------- i1 + ------- i2 + ------- i3 ----------------------- .                                                            (A.26)

The scalar product of the two unit vectors (N^ )1 and (N^ )2 is equal to the cosine of the angle between them. Let
this angle be denoted by  / 2 - 12 such that,

                                     (N^ )1  (N^ )2  =  cos        -  12  =  sin 12 ,                                                                    (A.27)

                                                              2 

where 12 denotes the change in the angle with respect to a right angle. Substitute eq. (A.25) for (N^ )1 and eq.
(A.26) for (N^ )2 in the left-hand side of eq. (A.27) to get

                                     y1y1 y2y2 y3y3                                                      1

Next substitute yi = ui + xi , i = 1, 2, 3 , in the terms in the square brackets of the previous equation, and com-
pare the result to eq. (A.21) to find

                                                           212                                                                                            (A.28)
                                     sin 12 = ----------------------------------------------- .

Thus, the right angle between line elements dx1^i1 and dx2^i2 in region B0 is changed in the transition to region
B in direct proportion to the strain component 12 . If 12 = 0 , then 12 = 0 , and the right angle is preserved in
the deformed body. Similarly, the strain component 13 is proportional the change in the right angle between line
elements dx1 and dx3 in the transition to the deformed body.

the equivalent form

since the product of the direction cosines commute. In eq. (A.30) the engineering the shear strains are defined by

For many materials the strains are very small in the elastic range. A linear theory of deformation is characterized

by the magnitude of the nine displacement gradients                ui        10-3 . Hence, we neglect the quadratic terms in the
                                                                   -------

A.1.4 Transformation of the strains between two cartesian coordinate systems

In the reference configuration B0 consider the two orthogonal cartesian coordinate systems (x1, x2, x3) and
(x1, x2, x3) which have the same origin. In (x1, x2, x3) system, or simply the xi system, the corresponding
unit vectors are (^i1, ^i2, ^i3) . In the (x1, x2, x3) system, or the xi system, the corresponding unit vectors are
(^i1, ^i2, ^i3) . The position vector r of a point P0 in space is the same if written in the xi -system or in the xi -
system. That is,

                                   r  =    ^   +    ^     +    ^   =    x1^i1 + x2^i2 + x3^i3                             (A.35)
                                         x1i1     x2i2       x3i3

The linear form    ^   +    ^   +    ^   is said to remain invariant under the transformation of variables. Take the sca-
                 x1i1     x2i2     x3i3

lar product, or dot product, of eq. (A.35) with unit vector ^i1 to get

                                           ^     ^i1  +    ^     ^i1  +    ^     ^i1  =  x1 .                          (A.36)
                                         x1i1             x2i2             x3i3

Define the nine direction cosines ij , i, j = 1, 2, 3 , by

                                                  ^ii  ^ij  ij = cos (xi, xj) .                                          (A.37)

For example, 12 = cos (x1, x2) is the cosine of the angle between the x1 axis and the x2 axis, and
21 = cos (x2, x1) is the cosine of the angle between the x2 axis and the x1 axis. From the definition of ij eq.
(A.36) is x1 = 11x1 + 12x2 + 13x3 . If we take the dot product of eq. (A.35) with ^i2 and use the definition
(A.37), then we find x2 = 21x1 + 22x2 + 23x3 . The relation between the xi coordinates and the xi coordi-
nates at point P0 is given by the linear transformation

The compact form of matrix eq. (A.38) is

The unit vectors in the xi system are related to those in the xi system by the same relation given in eq. (A.38):

                                                    ^i1           11 12 13 ^i1

                                                    ^i2  =        21 22 23             ^.                                                          (A.41)
                                                                                       i2

                                                    ^i3           31 32 33 ^i3

Consider the dot product ^i1  ^i1 = 1 , and from eq. (A.41) write it in terms of the unit vectors in the xi system;
i.e.,

                                1  =          ^     +       ^     +     ^              ^     +     ^     +     ^       .
                                         (  11 i 1        12 i 2      13 i 3 )     (  11 i 1      12 i 2      13 i 3 )

Since unit vectors (^i1, ^i2, ^i3) are mutually perpendicular we find the relation

                                                         1  =        2     +  2     +  2      .

                                                                       11       12       13

Consider the dot product ^i1  ^i2 = 0 and write ^i1 and ^i2 from eq. (A.41) to get

                                0  =          ^     +       ^     +     ^              ^     +     ^     +     ^       .
                                         (  11 i 1        12 i 2      13 i 3 )     (  21 i 1      22 i 2      23 i 3 )

Again (^i1, ^i2, ^i3) are mutually perpendicular, so we find the relation

                                         0 = 1121 + 1222 + 1323 .

We can proceed by performing the scalar products ^i1  ^i3 = 0 , ^i2  ^i2 = 1 , ^i2  ^i3 = 0 , and ^i3  ^i3 = 1 .
Collectively we find the following relations between the direction cosines:

           1  =  2     +  2     +  2                     1  =        2     +  2     +  2

                   11       12       13                                21       22       23

           0 = 1121 + 1222 + 1323 ,                                                              , and       1  =       2     +  2     +  2     .  (A.42)

           0 = 1131 + 1232 + 1333 0 = 2131 + 2232 + 2333                                                                  31       32       33

There are six relations in eq. (A.42) between the nine direction cosines. Hence, only three of direction cosines are

independent. We show some interesting properties of the direction cosine matrix  beginning with the matrix

Compare the elements of the matrix in eq. (A.43) to the relations in eq. (A.42) to find

                                                            100                                                                 (A.44)

Equation (A.44) shows that the matrix  is an orthogonal matrix. That is, the inverse  -1 is equal to its
transpose  T . Also det(   T) = det  det  T , but det  T = det  . Hence.

                               det(   T) = (det  )2 = (det I )2 = 1 .

The determinate of an orthogonal matrix is either 1 or -1. The inverse of eq. (A.39) is {x} =  T{x} which
written in expanded form is

                                               L = (  T{n})T   T{n} , or

                                               L = {n}T    T{n}                                        (A.52)
For eq. (A.52) to be an invariant form of eq. (A.51) we conclude                                       (A.53)

                                                       =    T .
Hence,

           L = {n}T  {n} .                                                                             (A.54)

Compare the forms of eq. (A.51) and eq. (A.54) to note their similarity. Also, we have the inverse transformation

            =  T   .                                                                                   (A.55)

If we take the transpose of eq. (A.53) and use the fact that matrix  is symmetric, then  T =  . The engi-

neering shear strain  12 = 12 + 21 , and 12 = 21 . Thus 12 = 21 =  12 / 2 . In terms of engineering shear
strains (A.31) the strain transformation (A.53) is

A.2 Stress

The reference configuration B0 the body is assumed to be the natural or unstressed state. External forces acting
on the body cause a state of stress in the deformed configuration B , and it is in the configuration B where the
study of stresses is to be carried out. However, for infinitesimal displacement gradients the point P0 in region B0
and point P in region B lie very close together so that we do not distinguish between them. For small deforma-
tion theory, the study of equilibrium at a point in a deformable body is performed in the reference configuration.

     Consider a continuos deformable body acted on by external forces shown in Fig. A.3(a). Due to the action of
the external forces there will be internal forces acting between particles of the body. To examine the internal
forces we pass a plane labeled mm through point P that is parallel to the x2x3 plane. Consider the free body to the
left of the plane mm shown in Fig. A.3(b). Plane mm is divided into a large number of small areas, each x2 by
x3 . The internal forces acting on each of these areas varies in magnitude and in direction.

    Fig. A.3 (a) Isolated, continuous body acted on by external forces.
    (b) Internal forces acting on plane mm.

The internal force F acting at point P is a resultant of distributed force intensities acting over area

x2x3 . Let A1 denote the area x2x3 . Force F represents the action exerted by the material outside the
plane mm through area A1 on the material inside the plane mm. Point forces do not occur in nature. Forces are
always distributed throughout regions which can have dimensions of length, area or volume. (However, point
forces are an essential concept in the mechanics of solid bodies.) Consequently, as A1  0 the resultant of the

distributed force intensities acting over A1 vanishes; i.e, F  0 . The stress vector or traction vector acting at
point P is defined as

                          T(^i1) = lim(F / A1)                                                           (A.57)
                                   A1  0 ,

where the unit normal to area A1 is ^i1 . Now consider a rectangular parallelepiped with edges x1 , x2 , and

x3 cut out of the body. It will have six separate plane surfaces which enclose the volume containing point P.
Identify a surface face in terms of the coordinate axis normal to the surface. A face is defined as a positive face
when its outwardly directed normal vector points in the direction of the positive coordinate direction, and as a

parallelepiped in the x1-x2 plane is shown Fig. A.4, where only the internal forces acting on the positive and neg-
ative faces normal to the x1 -axis are explicitly shown. Not shown in the figure are the surface forces acting on
the four lateral faces and the body force acting in the volume. Let x1  0 without changing the values of x2
and x3 . In the limit the forces acting on the lateral surfaces and the body force vanish, and force equilibrium
yields

                                         T(-^i1)A1 + T(^i1)A1 = 0 .

Since A1 > 0 , we find from equilibrium that the stress vector on the negative x1 -face is equal to the negative of
the stress vector on the positive x1 -face; i.e.,

x2 T(-^i1)A1             T ( ^i1 )  A 1                             T(-^i1) = -T(^i1) .      (A.58)

Positive stress components acting on the positive faces of the rectangular parallelepiped are show in Fig. A.5. The
stress components on the negative faces of the parallelepiped are equal and oppositely directed to those on the
positive faces according to conditions like eq. (A.58). Hence, there are nine stress components at a point, not
eighteen. We express the nine stress components at point in the matrix form

     We pose the following question: Are the nine stress components at point P sufficient to determine the
stresses on an arbitrarily orientated plane face through the point? To answer this question we consider equilib-

consist of three right triangles normal to the coordinate axes, and one oblique triangular area that is shaded in
Fig. A.6. For the surface with unit outward normal vector -^i1 the area is A1 = (x2x3) / 2 , for the surface
with unit outward normal -^i2 the area is A2 = (x1x3) / 2 , and for the surface with unit outward normal vec-
tor -^i3 the area is A3 = (x1x2) / 2 . The area of the oblique surface is denoted by An and its unit outward
normal vector is n^ . To calculate the area of the oblique face we use the fact the cross product of two position vec-
tors is equal to the area of a parallelogram formed by the vectors and in a direction normal to the plane of the par-
allelogram. The vectors along the edges of the oblique face are - x1^i1 + x2^i2 and - x1^i1 + x3^i3 , and the
area of the parallelogram formed by these vectors is equal to 2An . Thus,

             2Ann^ = (- x1^i1 + x2^i2)  (- x1^i1 + x3^i3) = (x2x3^i1 + x1x3^i2 + x1x2^i3) ,
which simplifies to

                             Ann^ = A1^i1 + A2^i2 + A3^i3 .                                                      (A.61)

of the unit normal vector are

Equilibrium of the free body diagram in Fig. A.6(b) leads to

           T(n^ )An + (-T1A1) + (-T2A2) + (-T3A3) + B(dVol) = 0 ,

where B is the body force vector per unit volume. The tetrahedron is also a triangular pyramid where An is the
area of its triangular base, and the volume of the pyramid is hAn / 3 where h is its height. Divide eq. (A.63) by
An to get

                     (n)

                   T = T1n1 + T2n2 + T3n3 - B(h / 3) ,

It can be shown that the height in this case is given by h = x1n1 = x2n2 = x3n3 . In the limit where
x1  0 , x2  0 and x3  0 , the height h  0 . Hence, in the limit the equilibrium equation is

                         T(n^ ) = T1n1 + T2n2 + T3n3 .                                                (A.64)

The implication of eq. (A.64) is that the nine stress components ij at point P are sufficient to determine the trac-
tion, or stresses, on any face through the point.

Hence, the stress matrix (A.59) is symmetric.

A.2.2 Transformation of stresses between two cartesian coordinate systems
At point P coordinates (x1, x2, x3) are linearly related to coordinates (x1, x2, x3) by eq. (A.38). The stress
components ij are functions in the variables (x1, x2, x3) , and the stresses ij are functions in the variables
(x1, x2, x3) . The stress vectors acting on the xi -faces are denoted by Ti , and those acting on the xi -faces are
denoted by Ti . These stress vectors are written in their respective coordinate systems by

In eq. (A.73) the stress matrices are

Equation (A.72) shows that the stress matrix  is symmetric. The stress transformation equations between the

cartesian coordinate systems (x1, x2, x3) and (x1, x2, x3) is determined by selecting the unit normal in eq.

Second, let n = i2 such that T = T2 and from eq. (A.41) we have n = 21i1 + 22i2 + 23i3 . Hence, eq.

(A.64) becomes

                                                         T2 = 21T1 + 22T2 + 23T3 .

Third, let n = i3 such that T = T3 and n = 31i1 + 32i2 + 33i3 . Hence,

To satisfy eq. (A.78) we find that the stress components ij in the xi system are related to the stress compo-
nents ij in the xi system by

Equation (A.79) in compact form is

                                     =    T .                   (A.80)

Pre-multiply eq. (A.80) by  T , post-multiply it by  , and note that  T  =   T = I to find the
inverse transformation

                                     =  T   .                   (A.81)

The transpose of eq. (A.80) is   T  T , but  T =  , so the stress matrix  is also symmetric. Com-
paring the strain transformation eq. (A.53) to the stress transformation eq. (A.80), it is clear that the transforma-
tion of strains ij is the same form as the transformation of the stresses ij .

A.2.3 Cartesian tensors
A tensor is a system of numbers or functions, whose components obey a certain law of transformation when the
independent variables undergo a linear transformation. If the independent variables are the rectangular cartesian
systems xi and xi transforming by the linear relations given by {x} =  {x} at point P, then the systems
obeying certain laws of transformation are called cartesian tensors.
Definition. A system of order two may be defined to have nine components ij in xi and nine components ij
in xi . If

                                                                                                                  T

                                                        ij =  ij 

then the functions ij and ij are the components in their respective variables of a second order cartesian ten-
sor. Similarly, functions ij and ij are the components in their respective variables of a second order carte-
sian tensor.

A.3 Linear elastic material law

To this point in the study of the mechanics of a solid body we have eighteen unknown functions of the cartesian
coordinates x1, x2, x3 . These are the three displacements u1, u2, u3 , the six strains 11, 22, 33,  23,  31,  12 , and
nine stresses 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33 . There are twelve equations relating these unknowns; the
six strain-displacement equations (A.32) and (A.33), and the six equilibrium equations (A.68) and (A.72). There-

                                                                      Linear elastic material law

fore we need six more equation to get the number of unknowns equal to number of equations. The additional six
equations come from the relations between the strains and the stresses which express the material law. This rela-
tion between strains and stresses for different materials is established by material characterization tests on stan-
dard test specimens.

     Solid bodies that can instantly recover their original size and shape when the forces producing the deforma-
tion are removed are called perfectly elastic. The elastic limit is defined as the greatest stress which can applied
without resulting in permanent strain on release of the stress. Elasticity is applicable to any body provided the
stresses do not exceed the elastic limit. For many solid bodies there is a region where the stress is very nearly pro-
portional to strain. The proportional limit is defined as the greatest stress for which the stress is still proportional
to the strain. Both the elastic limit and proportional limit cannot be precisely determined from test data since they
are defined by the limiting cases of no permanent deformation and no deviation from linearity. In practice the
definition of the yield strength of a material is used to determine the limit of elastic behavior.

     The theoretical basis for an elastic material law is the first law of thermodynamics applied to an arbitrary
infinitesimal rectangular parallelepiped isolated from the body. We assume the deformation process is adiabatic.
That is, no heat is lost or gained in the body during the deformation. The work expended in the transition from
the reference state to the final deformed state is independent of the manner in which the process proceeds. The
first law of thermodynamics states that work done on the rectangular parallelepiped is equal to the change in
internal energy of the material contained in the parallelepiped.1 In elasticity the internal energy is called the
strain energy. The strain energy per unit volume of the reference configuration, or strain energy density, is a func-
tion of the six strain components and is denoted by U(11, 22, 33,  23,  31,  12) . The strain energy density func-
tion depends on the physical properties of the material. The incremental work of the tractions and body force
acting on the parallelepiped is formulated in terms of incremental displacements from the equilibrium state.
These incremental displacements functions are denoted by ui(x1, x2, x3) , i = 1, 2, 3 , and to be kinematically

admissible they are continuous and single-valued in the independent variables. In addition, functions ui are

                                                                                  ~
assumed to be infinitesimal in magnitude. The total displacement is ui = ui + ui , where ui are the displace-
ments components in the equilibrium state.

Note that when all strain components equal zero, eq. (A.95) yields k = Sk . Non-zero stresses can occur in a
state of vanishing strains when there is a change in temperature. Let the change in temperature from the reference

Clearly, --(S12 + S21) = --(S21 + S12) , so we can take S12 = S21 without changing the stress-strain relation. By

The 6X6 elasticity matrix S is symmetric which means there are twenty-one independent elastic constants, and

there are six independent thermal coefficients. Equation (A.97) is the material law for an anisotropic material
where the number of independent elastic constants is determined by the existence of the strain energy density
function and the symmetry of the strain and stress tensors.

A.3.1 Material symmetry

Consider a monoclinic material for which the x1x2 plane at a point P is a plane of elastic symmetry. This means
that the elastic constants at point P have the same values for a pair of Cartesian coordinate systems which are

mirror images of one another in the elastic plane. The elastic constants Sij are invariant under the reflection
coordinate transformation x1 = x1 , x2 = x2 , and x3 = -x3 . The direction cosines for this reflection transfor-
mation are listed in Table 1

From strain and stress transformations in eq. (A.53) and eq. (A.79), respectively, we find

                         i = i                    i' = i      i = 1, 2, 3, 6

In the xi system the first of eq. (A.97) becomes

Substitute the stress and strain transformation relations into the latter equation to find

                           1 = - 1(T - T0) + S111 + S122 + S133 - S144 - S155 + S166 .

Comparison of last equation to the first equation from (A.97) shows that S14 = 0 and S15 = 0 . Constructing
material law for 2 and following a similar procedure used for the 1 material law leads to S24 = 0 and
S25 = 0 . Considerations for the material law for 3' leads to S34 = 0 and S35 = 0 , material law 4 leads to
4 = 0 and S46 = 0 , and finally material law 5 leads to 5 = 0 and S56 = 0 . The material law for the
x1x2 plane of elastic symmetry is

     Certain elastic constants in eq. (A.98) vanish if in addition to the x1x2 plane of elastic symmetry the x2x3
plane is a plane of elastic symmetry. The reflection coordinate transformation is x1 = -x1 , x2 = x2 , and

Substitute the transformations for the stress and strain in the last equation to get

                                 1 = - 1(T - T0) + S111 + S122 + S133 - S166 .           (A.99)
In the xi system the first of eq. (A.98) is

Comparison of eq. (A.99) and eq. (A.100) leads to S16 = 0 . Also, following the same procedure for the equation
starting with 2 leads to S26 = 0 , and starting with the equation for 3 leads to S36 = 0 . Following this pro-
cedure for we find (4 = S444 + S455)  4 = S444 - S455 . Hence S45 = 0 . Finally, consider
(6 = - 6(T - T0) + S666)  -6 = - 6(T - T0) - S666 , Hence 6 = 0 . The material law for two orthog-

If we additonally impose the that the x3x1 plane is a plane of elastic symmetry, this condition does not change
the results given in eq. (A.101). An orthotropic material has three mutually orthogonal planes of elastic symme-
try, nine independent elastic constants Sij , and three independent thermal coefficients. Equation (A.101) is the
material law for an orthotropic material; e.g wood.

     The material properties are independent of direction for an isotropic material. Starting with the orthotropic
material law (A.101) consider the following sequence of rotations from the (x1, x2, x3) coordinates to the
(x1, x2, x3) coordinates.

                                                                                                 100
1. 90 rotation about the x1 -axis. The direction cosine matrix  = 0 0 1 .

2. 90 rotation about the x3 -axis. The direction cosine matrix  = -1 0 0 .

                                                                                                  0 01

3. 45 rotation about the x3 -axis. The direction cosine matrix  = -1 / 2 1 / 2 0 .

                                                                       0                                01

For the material law to be invariant from the first rotation we find

                      S12 = S13  3 = 2                    S33 = S22    S55 = S66 .

For the material law to be invariant from the second rotation we find

                      2 = 1      S12 = S23                S11 = S22

For the third rotation the material law for 1 in the (x1, x2, x3) coordinates is

                                   1 = - 1(T - T0) + S111 + S122 + S123 ,                                      (A.102)
since S13 = S12 . The stress transformation and the strain transformations relations are

(1 = (1 + 2) / 2 + 6  1 = (1 + 2 + 6) / 2                          2 = (1 + 2 - 6) / 2)                        3 = 3 (A.103)

Substitute the transformations in (A.103) into eq. (A.102) to get

In the (x1, x2, x3) coordinates the formulation of the quantity (1 + 2) / 2 + 6 is

                                    1                              1
(1 + 2) / 2 + 6 = -1(T - T0) + --(S11 + S12)1 + --(S12 + S11)2 + S123 + S446 .                                 (A.105)

For eqs. (A.104) and (A.105) to be identical we get that

                                 1                                                                             (A.106)

1 = 1 / E , 2 = 3 = -1 = -(1 / E) , where E denotes Young's modulus, or the modulus of elasticity,

and  denotes Poisson's ratio. The tension test results correspond to the first column of the 6X6 compliance
matrix (A.108). Hence, C11 = 1 / E and C12 = -  / E . Substitute the values for C11 and C12 from the ten-
sile test into eq. (A.109) to get

                      +G                           1          -

                   3G + 2G2 E                         2(3G + 2G2) E

From the previous equations we can write Young's modulus an Poisson's ratio in terms of  and G as

                         3G + 2G2                                                                       (A.110)

It can be shown from the two expressions in eq. (A.110) that the Lame constants in terms of E and  are

                         E                                          E                                   (A.111)
              G = --------------------                 = ------------------------------------- .

Also note that (C11 + C12 + C12) = [(1 - 2) / E] =  , where  is the linear coefficient of thermal expan-
sion. In shear tests of an isotropic, homogeneous material Lame's elastic constant G is called the shear modulus

A.4 Summary and the boundary value problems of elasticity

At a point P:(x1, x2, x3) in the body the unknown functions are
 three displacements u1(x1, x2, x3) , u2(x1, x2, x3) , and u3(x1, x2, x3)
 six strains 11, 22, 33,  23,  31,  12
 nine stresses 11, 22, 33, 12, 13, 23, 21, 31, 32
The total number of unknown functions is eighteen.

     The number of equations are

 six strain-displacement equations (A.32) and (A.33)
 three force equilibrium equations (A.68)
 three moment equilibrium equations (A.72)
 six equations for the material law from one of the following expressions: anisotropic (A.97), monoclinic

    (A.98), orthotropic (A.101), or isotropic (A.112).
The total number of equations is eighteen.

     Let the boundary surface of region B0 be denoted by S . On the surface S we can prescribe the displace-
ments and/or the tractions. In eq. (A.64) let n^ be the unit outward normal to the surface S . We write eq. (A.64) in
the form

                                   T(n^ )  =  T (n) ^i1 + T (n) ^i2 + T (n) ^i3123= T1n1 + T2n2 + T3n3 ,

where  T(n) ,  T(n)  ,  and  T(n)  are the cartesian components of the traction vector acting on the surface. We use eq.

         1       2             3

(A.59) to determine that these traction components are related to the stresses by

                                           T(n)  =  n11j + n22j + n33j ,            j  =  1, 2, 3 .

                                             j

On the portion of the surface where tractions are prescribed we have the boundary conditions

                             T(n)  =       n11j + n22j + n33j  =  prescribed functions .                  (A.113)

    body in equilibrium when the body forces Bi(xj) are prescribed and the displacements ui of points on the
    surface of the body are prescribed functions.

3. Boundary value problem 3, or the mixed boundary value problem. Determine the distribution of the stress and
    displacement of an elastic body in equilibrium when body forces are prescribed, and the distribution of sur-
    face tractions are prescribed on surface S and displacements are prescribed on surface Su . That is, surface
