Appendix A: Included Open Textbooks                      660
Welcome! This book is an introduction to engineering mechanics:
statics, when acceleration is 0. Hopefully, this course will help you
to see statics everywhere in the world - because it truly is
everywhere! Concepts include:

  · particles and rigid body equilibrium equations,
  · free-body diagrams,
  · distributed loads,
  · shear and moment diagrams,
  · trusses, method of joints and sections, &
  · inertia.

This is the first of two courses to describe how objects move and
the forces that cause motion. This combines math and physics
fundamentals with real-world application. A structured problem-
solving process is included, and by the end of the book, you should
be able to recognize and describe motion all around you in your
everyday life.

   Chapter 1 contains the fundamental math and physics concepts
including vectors, Pythagorean theorem, sine and cosine laws, dot
product, Newton's laws, weight and mass, unit conversions, and the
problem solving process.

   Chapter 2 explains the difference between particles and rigid
bodies and introduces free-body diagrams and equilibrium
equations for particles.

   Chapter 3 contains introductory rigid body concepts, including
cross products, the right hand rule, torques/moments and couples,
distributed loads and reaction/support forces.

   Chapter 4 introduces free-body diagrams and equilibrium
equations for rigid bodies, as well as external forces, frictional and
impending motion.

   Chapter 5 introduces trusses and two methods to solve truss
systems: method of joints and method of sections.

   Chapter 6 explains internal forces and breaks down shear/
moment diagrams.

                                                                                    Introduction | 1
   Chapter 7 introduces center of mass, mass moment of inertia,
area moment of inertia, and the parallel axis theorem.

   Appendix A has a reference list of open textbooks.

          This book is a combination of many other open
       educational resources (OER) under similar creative
       commons licenses. This information is denoted inside a
       box like this. The links to the original source are very
       clearly included so you can go to those books to see
       what they say on other topics and try out their sample
       problems.

     Key Takeaways

        Most sections have a `key takeaway' that includes text
     from me (Libby), containing the most important part of the
     section (Basically), where it occurs in the real world
     (Application), and what part of this course it connects to -
     the why are we learning this (Looking ahead).

The last section of each chapter includes examples that were
submitted by former ENGN 1230 statics students to help you learn.
Statics and most engineering courses are `team sports'. I
recommend finding a few study partners to struggle through the
homework and study for the tests together.

   This book is a good start to helping you learn, but ultimately
it's up to you. Complete every homework and go to every class.
But that's not enough. Look at the solutions that are posted and
practice. You'll get out of it what you put in, and statics can be fun.

It's how engineers apply physics concepts to the real world. I hope
you learn to love learning engineering as much as I enjoy teaching it.
Hopefully, you'll get a sense of the wonder of engineering through
this book.

CHAPTER 1:
FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS

Static vs Dynamic Motion
   Before we start, what is the difference between static and

dynamic? Static problems are all problems where there is no
acceleration. As you're driving down the road and you're cruising
along at a constant velocity, that is a static problem. As soon as you
start to slow down for a stop light or speed up, you are in dynamic
motion, and that's much more complicated. For this course, we
will only consider problems where there is no motion (such as the
`static' is used in the English language), or constant velocity. Be
prepared to give many examples of static versus dynamic, because
before you can solve a problem, you have to know what type of
problem it is!

   Introduction to Chapter 1: Fundamental Concepts
   This chapter has a lot of concepts from math and physics that
are necessary for you to understand before we can apply them in
engineering contexts. It's kind of like: before you can write an essay
to express your opinion, you need to know how to write the a,
b, c's and what each word means. Here, you need to know how
to compute a cross product before you can calculate how much
Torque is created from a force.
   Some of this might be new. Some of this might be familiar, but we
might be applying it in a different way. (Such as calculating torque -
this is not what you learned in high school physics!) Some of it might
feel new, so practice practice practice!
   Here are the sections in this Chapter:

  · 1.1 Math & Physics Important Concepts (Mass, Weight, Slugs,
      Trig, Units, Conversions, Scalar, Vector, Newton's Laws)

1.1 Preparatory Concepts

1.1.1 Scalar vs. Vector

          Many familiar physical quantities can be specified
       completely by giving a single number and the
       appropriate unit. For example, "a class period lasts 50
       min" or "the gas tank in my car holds 65 L" or "the
       distance between two posts is 100 m." A physical
       quantity that can be specified completely in this manner
       is called a scalar quantity. Scalar is a synonym of
       "number." Time, mass, distance, length, volume,
       temperature, and energy are examples
       of scalar quantities.

          Scalar quantities that have the same physical units
       can be added or subtracted according to the usual rules
       of algebra for numbers. For example, a class ending 10
       min earlier than 50 min lasts (50 min - 10 min) = 40 min.
       Similarly, a 60-cal serving of corn followed by a 200-cal
       serving of donuts gives (60 cal + 200 cal) = 260 cal of
       energy. When we multiply a scalar quantity by a
       number, we obtain the same scalar quantity but with a
       larger (or smaller) value. For example, if yesterday's
       breakfast had 200 cal of energy and today's breakfast
       has four times as much energy as it had yesterday, then
       today's breakfast has 4(200 cal) = 800 cal of energy. Two
       scalar quantities can also be multiplied or divided by

                                                                  1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 7
       each other to form a derived scalar quantity. For
       example, if a train covers a distance of 100 km in 1.0 h,
       its speed is 100.0 km/1.0 h = 27.8 m/s, where the speed
       is a derived scalar quantity obtained by dividing distance
       by time.

          Many physical quantities, however, cannot be
       described completely by just a single number of physical
       units. For example, when the U.S. Coast Guard
       dispatches a ship or a helicopter for a rescue mission,
       the rescue team must know not only the distance to the
       distress signal, but also the direction from which the
       signal is coming so they can get to its origin as quickly
       as possible. Physical quantities specified completely by
       giving a number of units (magnitude) and a direction are
       called vector quantities. Examples of vector quantities
       include displacement, velocity, position, force, and
       torque. In the language of mathematics, physical vector
       quantities are represented by mathematical objects
       called vectors. We can add or subtract two vectors, and
       we can multiply a vector by a scalar or by another
       vector, but we cannot divide by a vector. The operation
       of division by a vector is not defined.

Key Takeaways

   Basically: a scalar has only magnitude, whereas a vector
has magnitude and direction.

   Application: I might have gone for a 4 km walk (scalar),
but whether I walked in a straight line, took turns, or went
2 km out and turned around to walk 2 km back would tell
me a lot more information (vector).

   Looking ahead: We will talk about this again in sections 1.3

                                                             1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 9

     cross products.

1.1.2 Newton's Laws

          1st Law:
          Newton's first law states that: "A body at rest will
       remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
       A body in motion continues in motion with the same
       speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by
       an unbalanced force."
          This law, also sometimes called the "law of inertia",
       means that bodies maintain their current velocity unless
       a force is applied to change that velocity. If an object is
       at rest with zero velocity, it will remain at rest until
       some force begins to change that velocity, and if an
       object is moving at a set speed and in a set direction, it
       will remain at that same velocity until some force begins
       to change that velocity.
          Net Forces: It is important to note that the net force
       is what will cause a change in velocity. The net force is
       the sum of all forces acting on the body. For example,
       we can imagine gently pushing on the rock in the figure
       below and observing that the rock does not move. This
       is because we will have a friction force equal in

10 | 1.1 Preparatory Concepts
magnitude and opposite in direction opposing our
gentle pushing force. The sum of these two forces will
be equal to zero; therefore, the net force is zero, and the
change in velocity is zero.

   Rotational Motion: Newton's first law also applies to
moments and rotational velocities. A body will maintain
its current rotational velocity until a net moment is
exerted to change that rotational velocity. This can be
seen in things like toy tops, flywheels, stationary bikes,
and other objects that will continue spinning once
started until brakes or friction stop them.

  In the absence of friction in space, this space capsule will
  maintain its current velocity until some outside force causes
  that velocity to change. Public Domain image by NASA.

          This rock is at rest with zero velocity and will remain at rest
          until a net force causes the rock to move. The net force on the
          rock is the sum of any force pushing the rock and the friction
          force of the ground on the rock opposing that force. Image by

   2nd Law:
   Newton's second law states that: "When a net force
acts on any body with mass, it produces an
acceleration of that body. The net force will be equal to
the mass of the body times the acceleration of the
body."

                                                        1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 13
             F=ma
          You will notice that the force and the acceleration in
       the equation above have an arrow above them. This
       means that they are vector quantities, having both a
       magnitude and a direction. Mass, on the other hand, is a
       scalar quantity having only a magnitude. Based on the
       above equation, you can infer that the magnitude of the
       net force acting on the body will be equal to the mass of
       the body times the magnitude of the acceleration, and
       that the direction of the net force on the body will be
       equal to the direction of the acceleration of the body.
          Rotational Motion: Newton's second law also applies
       to moments and rotational velocities. The revised
       version of the second law equation states that the net
       moment acting on the object will be equal to the mass
       moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation
       (I) times the angular acceleration of the body.

             M=I
          You should again notice that the moment and the
       angular acceleration of the body have arrows above
       them, indicating that they are vector quantities with
       both a magnitude and direction. The mass moment of
       inertia, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity having
       only a magnitude. The magnitude of the net moment
       will be equal to the mass moment of inertia times the
       magnitude of the angular acceleration, and the direction
       of the net moment will be equal to the direction of the
       angular acceleration.

   3rd Law:
   Newton's Third Law states, "For any action, there is
an equal and opposite reaction." By "action," Newton
meant a force, so for every force one body exerts on
another body, that second body exerts a force of equal
magnitude but opposite direction back on the first body.
Since all forces are exerted by bodies (either directly or
indirectly), all forces come in pairs, one acting on each
of the bodies interacting.
   Though there may be two equal and opposite forces
acting on a single body, it is important to remember that
for each of the forces, a Third Law pair acts on a
separate body. This can sometimes be confusing when
there are multiple Third Law pairs at work. Below are
some examples of situations where multiple Third Law
pairs occur.

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: These 3 laws form the foundation of statics and
     dynamics. It makes our problems interesting! In statics, we
     don't do a lot with rotation.

         · 1st law: the motion of an object won't change unless
             there is a force to cause the change.

         · 2nd law: Combination of all forces = mass *
             acceleration

         · 3rd law: A system of interacting objects can be split
             up into parts, where forces are used to model the
             other part. Forces are equal (same size) and opposite
             (their directions cancel out - one up, one down

        Application: 1st law: a rock rolling down the hill will keep
     going unless it hits a tree. 2nd law: the amount of forces on
     the rock and how massive (heavy) it is will determine how
     much it is accelerating (or decelerating). 3rd law: the rock is
     pushing on the ground with the same amount of force as
     the ground is pushing on the rock, but in the opposite
     direction.

        Looking ahead: You'll see these concepts again in Ch 7 on
     Inertia (1st law), Section 2.3 and 4.3 on equillibrium
     equations (2nd law), Section 4.2 on system free-body
     diagrams (3rd law).

1.1.3 Units

          Giving numerical values for physical quantities and
       equations for physical principles allows us to
       understand nature much more deeply than qualitative
       descriptions alone. To comprehend these vast ranges,
       we must also have accepted units in which to express
       them. We shall find that even in the potentially mundane
       discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds, a
       profound simplicity of nature appears: all physical
       quantities can be expressed as combinations of only
       seven base physical quantities.

          We define a physical quantity either by specifying
       how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated
       from other measurements. For example, we might
       define distance and time by specifying methods for
       measuring them, such as using a meter stick and a
       stopwatch. Then, we could define average speed by
       stating that it is calculated as the total distance traveled
       divided by time of travel.

          Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in
       terms of units, which are standardized values. For
       example, the length of a race, which is a physical
       quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for
       sprinters) or kilometers (for distance runners). Without
       standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for
       scientists to express and compare measured values in a
       meaningful way.

          Two major systems of units are used in the world: SI

                                                                 1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 19
       units (for the French Système International d'Unités),
       also known as the metric system, and English units (also
       known as the customary or imperial system). English
       units were historically used in nations once ruled by the
       British Empire and are still widely used in the United
       States. English units may also be referred to as
       the foot-pound-second (fps) system, as opposed to
       the centimeter-gram-second (cgs) system.

          SI Units: Base and Derived Units

          In any system of units, the units for some physical
       quantities must be defined through a measurement
       process. These are called the base quantities for that
       system and their units are the system's base units. All
       other physical quantities can then be expressed as
       algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of
       these physical quantities is then known as a derived
       quantity and each unit is called a derived unit. The
       choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long
       as they are independent of each other and all other
       quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal
       is to choose physical quantities that can be measured
       accurately to a high precision as the base quantities.
       The reason for this is simple. Since the derived
       units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the
       base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as
       the base units from which they are derived.

          Based on such considerations, the International
       Standards Organization recommends using seven base
       quantities, which form the International System of
       Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to
       define the SI base units. The following table lists these

20 | 1.1 Preparatory Concepts
seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base
units.

   You are probably already familiar with some derived
quantities that can be formed from the base quantities.
For example, the geometric concept of area is always
calculated as the product of two lengths. Thus, area is a
derived quantity that can be expressed in terms of SI
base units using square meters (m x m = m2).

   Similarly, volume is a derived quantity that can be
expressed in cubic meters (m3). Speed is length per
time; so in terms of SI base units, we could measure it in
meters per second (m/s). Volume mass density (or just
density) is mass per volume, which is expressed in terms
of SI base units such as kilograms per cubic meter

               1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 21
       (kg/m3). Angles can also be thought of as derived
       quantities because they can be defined as the ratio of
       the arc length subtended by two radii of a circle to the
       radius of the circle. This is how the radian is defined.
       Depending on your background and interests, you may
       be able to come up with other derived quantities, such
       as the mass flow rate (kg/s) or volume flow rate (m3/s)
       of a fluid, electric charge (A·s), mass flux density
       kg/(m2·s), and so on. We will see many more examples
       throughout this text. For now, the point is that every
       physical quantity can be derived from the seven base
       quantities, and the units of every physical quantity can
       be derived from the seven SI base units.

While most Canadian companies use SI, much manufacturing still
uses English units, so it's important for you to be familiar with them.
What is a big number in feet? What is small? It's important to know.
The most important advice is to stay in one unit system. So, if you
are doing a homework problem that has a mixture, convert to one
system to be consistent. Challenge yourself to try the one you aren't
comfortable with. Here is a table of the most common quantities
that we'll use in this class:

Key Takeaways

   Basically: Units give us a standard so we can use the same
language to describe a concept.

   Application: In 1999, after taking 286 days for NASA Mars
Orbiter satellite to get to Mars, a conversion error between
N and lb caused the $125 million satellite to be lost, forever.

want to design ANYTHING, you need to be sure everyone
involved is using the same unit system.

   Looking Ahead: The next section (1.1.4) will look at
converting the units back and forth between the two
systems.

1.1.4 Measurement Conversions

          It is often necessary to convert from one unit to
       another. For example, if you are reading a European
       cookbook, some quantities may be expressed in units of
       liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or perhaps
       you are reading walking directions from one location to
       another and you are interested in how many miles you
       will be walking. In this case, you may need to convert
       units of feet or meters to miles.

          Let's consider a simple example of how to convert
       units. Suppose we want to convert 80 m to kilometers.
       The first thing to do is to list the units you have and the
       units to which you want to convert. In this case, we have
       units in meters and we want to convert to kilometers.
       Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating
       meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio that
       expresses how many of one unit are equal to another
       unit. For example, there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 1609 m in 1 mi,
       100 cm in 1 m, 60 s in 1 min, and so on. In this case, we
       know that there are 1000 m in 1 km. Now we can set up
       our unit conversion. We write the units we have and
       then multiply them by the conversion factor so the units
       cancel out, as shown:

                      80m\times\frac{1km}{1000m}=0.080km
          Note that the unwanted meter unit cancels, leaving
       only the desired kilometer unit. You can use this method
       to convert between any type of unit. Now, the
       conversion of 80 m to kilometers is simply the use of a

24 | 1.1 Preparatory Concepts
metric prefix, as we saw in the preceding section, so we
can get the same answer just as easily by noting that

   Since "kilo-" means 103, however, using conversion
factors is handy when converting between units that are
not metric or when converting between derived units,
as the following examples illustrate.

Going back and forth between SI and English will become a very
useful skill. If you can memorize km to mi, ft to m, and inches to
ft, you'll be able to communicate better with coworkers. Here are
common conversions you'll need for this course:

Quantity  SI             English                          Convert
Length    1 km = 1000 m  1 mi = 5,280 ft                  1 m = 3.28 ft
Mass      1 m = 1000 mm  1 ft = 12 in                     2.2 km = 1 mi
Force     kg             slug                             1 slug = 14.6 kg
Pressure  N              lb                               1 lb = 4.448 N

          Pa             psi                              1psi = 6895 Pa

All of the other units that we will encounter will be a mix of these
units (intensity w = N/m or lb/ft). One additional conversion that is
common is 1 lb = 2.2 kg, though this only works on Earth because it

                                                                 1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 25

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: Different industries use different standards.
     English is common in the US. SI is standard many other
     places, however not generally in aerospace.

        Application: In 1999, after taking 286 days for NASA Mars
     Orbiter satellite to get to Mars, a conversion error between
     N and lb caused the $125 million satellite to be lost, forever.
     Click here for more fun conversion error stories. If you
     want to design ANYTHING, you need to be sure everyone
     involved is using the same unit system.

        Looking Ahead: Always always always check what unit
     you're using. So many students lose points on homework
     and the test because they aren't paying attention to units.

1.1.5 Weight vs. Mass

          Weight is the force exerted by gravity. While all
       objects with mass exert an attractive force of gravity on

                                                                1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 29
       all other objects with mass, that force is usually
       negligible unless the mass of one of the objects is very
       large. For an object near the surface of the Earth, we
       can, to a very good degree of approximation, assume
       that the only force of gravity on the object is from the
       Earth. We usually label the force of gravity on an object
       as Fg. All objects near the surface of the Earth will
       experience a weight, as long as they have a mass. If an
       object has a mass, m, and is located near the surface of
       the Earth, it will experience a force (its weight) that is
       given by:

          where g is the Earth's "gravitational field" vector and
       points towards the centre of the Earth. Near the surface
       of the Earth, the magnitude of the gravitational field is
       approximately g = 9.81 m/s2. The gravitational field is a
       measure of the strength of the force of gravity from the
       Earth (it is the gravitational force per unit mass). The
       magnitude of the gravitational field is weaker as you
       move further from the centre of the Earth (e.g. at the
       top of a mountain, or in Earth's orbit). The gravitational
       field is also different on different planets; for example,
       at the surface of the moon, it is approximately gm =
       1.62 m/s2 (six times less) - thus the weight of an object
       is six times less at the surface of the moon (but its mass
       is still the same). As we will see, the magnitude of the
       gravitational field from any spherical body of mass M
       (e.g a planet) is given by:

30 | 1.1 Preparatory Concepts
          where G = 6.67 × 10-11 is Newton's constant of gravity,
       and r is the distance from the centre of the object.

          Although we have not yet introduced the concept of
       mass, it is worth emphasizing that mass and weight are
       different (they have different dimensions). Mass is an
       intrinsic property of an object, whereas weight is a force
       of gravity that is exerted on that object because it has
       mass and is located next to another object with mass
       (e.g. the Earth). On Earth, when we measure our weight,
       we usually do so by standing on a spring scale, which is
       designed to measure a force by compressing a spring.
       We are thus measuring mg, which can easily be related
       to our mass since, on Earth, weight and mass are related
       by a factor of g = 9.81 m/s2; this is usually what leads to
       the confusion between mass and weight.

   In the English language, the words `mass' and `weight' are used
interchangeably. A person might say, "I weigh 50 kg", but in statics
language, that's wrong! Or more accurately, that language isn't
precise enough for statics.

                                                                 1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 31
                                  An object's mass is the same
                               whether they are on the moon,
                               Mars, or Earth. However, their
                               weight changes because the
                               constant of gravity with which
                               that planet is pulling changes
                               (see above description

Weight = mass * gravitational constant

Units of mass are kg (SI) or slugs (English), whereas units of

weight/force are N (SI) or lb (English). Because `slugs' is such an odd,

unfamiliar unit, the graphic on the left uses real slugs to help you

remember to say "my mass is 50 kg (or 3.43 slugs)" or "I weigh 490 N

(or 110 lb)".

While most Canadian companies use SI units, it's important to be

familiar with English, so you should learn slugs. You don't want to be

excluded from a conversation at your future job.

Note lbm (pound-mass) is not used in this book, though some

textbooks use it as a mass value. When lb is used, it is assumed to be

lbf (pound-force).

Key Takeaways

32 | 1.1 Preparatory Concepts
        Basically: Mass and force are two different quantities.
     Mass is in kg (SI) or slug (English), and weight is in N (SI)
     and lb (English).

        Application: Mass stays the same, but weight changes
     from the Earth to the moon.

        Looking ahead: This will become very important when we
     look at forces in Section 4.1.

1.1.6 Pythagorean Theorem

          Right triangle: a triangle containing a 90° angle.
       Pythagorean theorem: a relation among the three sides
       of a right triangle which states that the square of the
       hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the
       other two sides (legs).

          Using the Pythagorean theorem can find the length of
       the missing side in a right triangle.

                                                                 1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 33
           c is the longest side of the triangle (hypotenuse).
        Other two sides (legs) of the triangle a and b can be
       exchanged.

   A special case of the right triangle is called a 3-4-5 triangle, or
a Pythagorean triple. The two short sides are 3 and 4, and the
hypotenuse is 5! Many of your homework problems will use this
coincidence, so you can save on the math by remembering 3-4-5
triangles: 32 + 42 = 52, 9 + 16 = 25. Wow!

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: The Pythagorean theorem will help you find a
     lot of information throughout this course. The longest side
     c2 = a2 + b2

        Application: If I have a 6 ft ladder leaned up against a wall
     whose base is 2 ft from the wall, the Pythagorean theorem
     helps you to calculate the vertical height of the ladder (b2 =
     62 - 22 ).

     aspects of the problems, especially when we get into
     trusses in Ch 5.

1.1.7 Sine/Cosine Laws

          The Six Basic Trigonometric Functions
          Trigonometric functions allow us to use angle
       measures, in radians or degrees, to find the coordinates
       of a point on any circle--not only on a unit circle--or to
       find an angle given a point on a circle. They also define
       the relationship among the sides and angles of a
       triangle.
          To define the trigonometric functions, first consider
       the unit circle centred at the origin and a point P = (x,y)
       on the unit circle. Let  be an angle with an initial side
       that lies along the positive x-axis and with a terminal
       side that is the line segment OP. We can then define the
       values of the six trigonometric functions for  in terms
       of the coordinates x and y.

                                                                 1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 35
          Let P=(x,y) be a point on the unit circle centered at the
       origin O. Let  be an angle with an initial side along the
       positive x-axis and a terminal side given by the line
       segment OP. The trigonometric functions are then
       defined as

36 | 1.1 Preparatory Concepts
   If x=0, sec and tan are undefined. If y=0, then cot
and csc are undefined.

   We can see that for a point P=(x,y) on a circle of radius
r with a corresponding angle ,the coordinates x and y
satisfy:

   The values of the other trigonometric functions can
be expressed in terms of x, y, and r:

   The table below shows the values of sine and cosine at
the major angles in the first quadrant. From this table,

                                                        1.1 Preparatory Concepts | 37
       we can determine the values of sine and cosine at the
       corresponding angles in the other quadrants. The values
       of the other trigonometric functions are calculated
       easily from the values of sin and cos:

          Trigonometric Identities
          A trigonometric identity is an equation involving
       trigonometric functions that is true for all angles  for
       which the functions are defined. We can use the
       identities to help us solve or simplify equations. The
       main trigonometric identities are listed next.

   I remember that cos is close - the side that's close to the angle is
cosine. (It kind of rhymes and `close' is a more familiar word than
`adjacent').

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: Trigonometric functions will help you to solve
     problems. You'll use SOH-CAH-TOA in many statics
     problems, whether to componentize a vector or resolve a
     force.

        Application: A 6ft ladder leaning up against a house is at a
     60-degree angle. We can find the vertical height where the
     ladder reaches the house by using height = 6 ft * sin 60
     degrees. (sin = opp / hyp)

        Looking Ahead: Chapter 4 (forces) and Chapter 5 (trusses)
     will use the calculation of angles a lot.

1.2 XYZ Coordinate Frame

We need a standard to be able to share a common language. The
Cartesian coordinate frame lets us express the location of a point so
that others can understand what we're talking about.In this section,
we'll look at 2d and 3d coordinate frames.

     1.2.1 Cartesian Coordinate Frame in
    2D

          Vectors are usually described in terms of their
       components in a coordinate system. Even in everyday
       life we naturally invoke the concept of orthogonal
       projections in a rectangular coordinate system. For
       example, if you ask someone for directions to a
       particular location, you will more likely be told to go 40
       km east and 30 km north than 50 km in the direction
       37° north of east.

          In a rectangular (Cartesian) x-y coordinate system in a
       plane, a point in a plane is described by a pair of
       coordinates (x, y). In a similar fashion, a vector \vec A
       in a plane is described by a pair of its vector coordinates.
       The x-coordinate of vector A is called its x-component,
       and the y-coordinate of vector A is called
       its y-component. The vector x-component is a vector
       denoted by Ax. The vector y-component is a vector

                                                                1.2 XYZ Coordinate Frame | 41
       denoted by AY. In the Cartesian system,
       the x and y vector components of a vector are the
       orthogonal projections of this vector onto the x-
       and y-axes, respectively. In this way, following the
       parallelogram rule for vector addition, each vector on a
       Cartesian plane can be expressed as the vector sum of
       its vector components:

          As illustrated in the figure below, vector \vec A is
       the diagonal of the rectangle where the x-component

          \vec A_x is the side parallel to the x-axis and
       the y-component \vec A_y is the side parallel to the
       y-axis. Vector component \vec A_x is orthogonal to
       vector component \vec A_y.

42 | 1.2 XYZ Coordinate Frame
The figure shows the vector A in a plane in the Cartesian
coordinate system, represented as the vector sum of its x- and
y-components. The x-component vector, Ax, is the orthogonal
projection of Vector A onto the x-axis, and the y-component
vector, Ay, is the orthogonal projection onto the y-axis. The
numbers Ax and Ax that multiply the unit vectors are the scalar
components of the vector.

   It is customary to denote the positive direction on
the x-axis by the unit vector i and the positive direction
on the y-axis by the unit vector j. Unit vectors of the
axes, i and j, define two orthogonal directions in the
plane. As shown in the figure above, the x-
and y-components of a vector can now be written in
terms of the unit vectors of the axes:

                  \vec A_x = A_x\underline{\hat{i}}
                  \vec A_y = A_y\underline{\hat{ j}}

                                                      1.2 XYZ Coordinate Frame | 43
           The vectors Ax and Ay defined by the figure above are
        the vector components of vector \vec A. The numbers
        Ax and Ay that define the vector components above are
         the scalar components of vector \vec A. Combining

             the diagram above with the equations above, we
                   obtain the component form of a vector:
                        \vec A=A_x\underline{\hat {i}} + A_y\
                                     underline{\hat { j}}

          If we know the coordinates b(xb, yb) of the origin point
       of a vector (where b stands for "beginning") and the
       coordinates e(xe, ye) of the end point of a vector
       (where e stands for "end"), we can obtain the scalar
       components of a vector simply by subtracting the origin
       point coordinates from the end point coordinates:

                                       A_x = x_e - x_b
                                       A_y = y_e - y_b

     1.2.2. Cartesian Coordinate Frame
    in 3D

          To specify the location of a point in space, we need
       three coordinates (x, y, z), where
       coordinates x and y specify locations in a plane, and
       coordinate z gives a vertical position above or below the
       plane. Three-dimensional space has three orthogonal
       directions, so we need not two but three unit vectors to
       define a three-dimensional coordinate system. In the

44 | 1.2 XYZ Coordinate Frame
Cartesian coordinate system, the first two unit vectors
are the unit vector of the x-axis i and the unit vector of
the y-axis j. The third unit vector k is the direction of
the z-axis, as can be seen below. The order in which the
axes are labeled, which is the order in which the three
unit vectors appear, is important because it defines the
orientation of the coordinate system. The order x-y-z,
which is equivalent to the order i-j-k, defines the
standard right-handed coordinate system (positive
orientation).

   In three-dimensional space, vector \vec A has three

                                                      1.2 XYZ Coordinate Frame | 45
       vector components: the x-component
          \vec A_x = A_x\underline{\hat{i}}, which is the part

       of vector \vec A along the x-axis; the y-component
          \vec A_y = A_y\underline{\hat{ j}}, which is the part

       of \vec A along the y-axis; and the z-component
          \vec A_z = A_z \underline{\hat{k}}, which is the part

       of the vector along the z-axis. A vector in three-
       dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector
       components:

                         \vec A= A_x\underline{\hat{i}}+A_y\
                    underline{\hat{ j}}+A_z\underline{\hat{k}}
          If we know the coordinates of its origin b(xb, yb,
       zb) and of its end e(xe, ye, ze) its scalar components are
       obtained by taking their differences, and
       the z-component is given by:

                                        A_z=z_e-z_b
          Magnitude A is obtained by the following equation:

                     A=\sqrt {A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}+A_{z}^{2}}
          This expression for the vector magnitude comes from
       applying the Pythagorean theorem twice. As seen in the
       figure below, the diagonal in the x-y plane has length
          \sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}} and its square adds to
       the square Az2 to give A2 . Note that when
       the z-component is zero, the vector lies entirely in
       the x-y plane and its description is reduced to two
       dimensions.

The Cartesian coordinate frame is a right-orthogonal system. This
will matter when we start looking at the right-hand rule in section
3.1. What it means is that when you draw two of the directions (say
x and y), then z must go either up or down. We'll get into that more
later.

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: The Cartesian coordinate frame gives us a way
     to communicate the location of a point in space. In 2-d we
     use [x, y] and in 3-d we also include z: [x, y, z].

        Application: If I am trying to walk across the room, I can
     walk in a straight line for 5 steps, or I can take 3 steps to
     the right and 4 steps ahead. If I wanted to describe the
     position of where I went in the Cartesian coordinate frame,
     it would be [3, 4], assuming x is to the right and y is straight
     ahead.

        Looking ahead: This will connect with everything we do in
     this class, especially with cross-products (1.5), torque (1.6),
     and equilibrium equations (everywhere).

1.3 Vectors

1.3.1 Vector Components

Some fun facts about vectors:

  · The vector is denoted with a line on top or bottom: \vec A or
      A.

  · There are two parts of a vector (\vec A): magnitude (A or |A|)
      and direction (\underline{\hat{a}}):
      \vec A = |\underline{A}|*\underline{\hat{a}}

  · In 2-dimensions, there are two components: x and y. In 3D,
      there are three components: x, y, and z.

  · Vectors can be denoted using Cartesian form or brackets:
      \vec A=A_x\underline{\hat{i}}+A_y\underline{\hat{ j}}+A_z\
      underline{\hat{k}}
      or using the bracket form horizontally: \vec A=[ A_x, A_y, A_z
      ] or vertically:
      \vec A=\begin{bmatrix}A_x\\A_y,\\A_z \end{bmatrix}

  · The magnitude (A or |A|) is calculated using the Pythagorean
      theorem for each component in 2d:
      A = \sqrt{{A}_{x}^{2}+{A}_{y}^{2}} and 3d:
      A = \sqrt{{A}_{x}^{2}+{A}_{y}^{2}+{A}_{z}^{2}}

The position vector describes the position of an object or person
from a predefined origin (a starting point, absolute 0, or some other
point), for example the point where A in the above image is point at.
A is the position vector. You can add individual position vectors to
find the total position traveled (c = a + b), for example if someone
walks from one point on campus to another, they would rarely walk
in one straight line like c. In the image below, imagine that there
is a building in the square near where a and b meet, so the person
couldn't take c but had to walk around. The total distance traveled
is |a| + |b|, not |c| (because |c|  |a| + |b|).

Subtraction works the same way, but instead of going from tail to
head of the arrow, the reverse direction is taken, from head to tail.
For example, a = c-b, follow c from tail to head, then go in the
reverse direction of b from head to tail, and you end up at a.

1.3.4 Vector Math

Here's more official language to describe vectors:

   Vectors can be added together and multiplied by
scalars. Vector addition is associative and commutative,
and vector multiplication by a sum of scalars is
distributive. Also, scalar multiplication by a sum of
vectors is distributive:

\alpha(\vec A+\vec B)=\alpha\vec A +\alpha\vec B

In this equation,  is any number (a scalar). For

example, a vector antiparallel to vector

\vec A=A_x\hat{i}+A_y\hat{ j}+A_z\hat{k} can be

expressed simply by multiplying  \vec A by the scalar
=-1:

-\vec A=-A_x\hat{i}-A_y\hat{ j}-A_z\hat{k}

   The generalization of the number zero to vector
algebra is called the null vector, denoted by \vec 0. All
components of the null vector are zero

   \vec 0 = 0 \hat{i} + 0 \hat{ j} + 0 \hat{k} , so the null
vector has no length and no direction.

54 | 1.3 Vectors
   Two vectors \vec A and \vec B are equal
vectors if and only if their difference is the null vector:

      \vec{0} = \vec{A} - \vec{B} = (A_x\hat{i} + A_y\hat{ j}
   + A_z\hat{k}) - (B_x\hat{i} + B_y\hat{ j} + B_z\hat{k})
   \\ = (A_x - B_x)\hat{i} + (A_y - B_y)\hat{ j} + (A_z -
   B_z)\hat{k}

          \space=(A_x - B_x)\underline{\hat{i}} + (A_y -
                    B_y)\underline{\hat{ j}} + (A_z -
                         B_z)\underline{\hat{k}}

   This vector equation means we must have
simultaneously A_x-B_x=0, A_y-B_y=0, and

   A_z-B_z=0. Hence, we can write \vec A=\vec B if
and only if the corresponding components of vectors

   \vec A and \vec B are equal:
                             \vec A =\vec B if

     \begin{bmatrix}A_x=B_x\\A_y=B_y\\A_z=B_z\
                              end{bmatrix}

   Two vectors are equal when their corresponding
scalar components are equal.

   Resolving vectors into their scalar components (i.e.,
finding their scalar components) and expressing them
analytically in vector component form allows us to use
vector algebra to find sums or differences of many
vectors analytically (i.e., using graphical methods). For
example, to find the resultant of two vectors

   \overset{\to }{A} and \vec B, we simply add them
component by component, as follows:

                                                                            1.3 Vectors | 55

56 | 1.3 Vectors
Key Takeaways

   Basically: Vectors help describe position, forces, and
quantities. Vectors use components, magnitude, and
direction (unit vector) to do so.

   Application: A hammock hangs at an angle from the wall.
When a person is in the hammock, they are pulling on the
wall with a force at an angle. This force vector could be
componentized into x and y, using the angle and the weight
of the person to calculate it.

   Looking ahead: The next place vectors will appear is in
Moments in 1.6.

                                                                               1.3 Vectors | 57
1.4 Dot Product

A dot product produces a single number to describe the product
of two vectors. If you haven't taken linear algebra yet, this may
be a new concept. This is a form of multiplication that is used to
calculate work, unit vectors, and to find the angle between two
vectors.

                 \vec A\cdot \vec B=|\vec A||\vec B|\cos\theta

          A vector can be multiplied by another vector, but it
       may not be divided by another vector. There are two
       kinds of products of vectors used broadly in physics and
       engineering. One kind of multiplication is a scalar
       multiplication of two vectors. Taking a scalar product of
       two vectors results in a number (a scalar), as its name
       indicates. Scalar products are used to define work and
       energy relations. For example, the work that a force (a
       vector) performs on an object while causing its
       displacement (a vector) is defined as a scalar product of
       the force vector with the displacement vector. A quite
       different kind of multiplication is a vector multiplication
       of vectors. Taking a vector product of two vectors
       returns as a result a vector, as its name suggests. Vector
       products are used to define other derived vector
       quantities. For example, in describing rotations, a vector
       quantity called torque is defined as a vector product of
       an applied force (a vector) and its distance from pivot to
       force (a vector). It is important to distinguish between

58 | 1.4 Dot Product
these two kinds of vector multiplications because the
scalar product is a scalar quantity and a vector product
is a vector quantity.

   Scalar multiplication of two vectors yields a scalar
product.

                                Dot Product
          The scalar product \vec A\cdot \vec B
       of two vectors \vec A \text{ and } \vec B is
       a number defined by the equation:

               \vec A\cdot \vec B=|\vec A||\vec B| \cos
                                       \phi

          where  is the angle between the vectors.
       The scalar product is also called the dot
       product because of the dot notation that
       indicates it.

   When the vectors are given in their vector component
forms:

                 \vec A=A_x\underline{\hat{i}}+A_y\
    underline{\hat{ j}}+A_z\underline{\hat{k}}\text{ and

               }\vec B=B_x\underline{\hat{i}}+B_y\
            underline{\hat{ j}}+B_z\underline{\hat{k}}
   We can compute their scalar product as follows:

                                                                     1.4 Dot Product | 59
             \vec A\cdot\vec B=(A_x\underline{\hat{i}}+A_y\
          underline{\hat{ j}}+A_z\underline{\hat{k}})\cdot(B_x\
          underline{\hat{i}}+B_y\underline{\hat{ j}}+B_z\
          underline{\hat{k}})\\=A_xB_x\
          underline{\hat{i}}\cdot\underline{\hat{i}}+A_xB_y\
          underline{\hat{i}}\cdot\underline{\hat{ j}}+A_xB_z\
          underline{\hat{i}}\cdot\
          underline{\hat{k}}\\+A_yB_x\
          underline{\hat{ j}}\cdot\underline{\hat{i}}+A_yB_y\
          underline{\hat{ j}}\cdot\underline{\hat{ j}}+A_yB_z\
          underline{\hat{ j}}\cdot\
          underline{\hat{k}}\\+A_zB_x\
          underline{\hat{k}}\cdot\underline{\hat{i}}+A_zB_y\
          underline{\hat{k}}\cdot\underline{\hat{ j}}+A_zB_z\
          underline{\hat{k}}\cdot\underline{\hat{k}}

          Since scalar products of two different unit vectors of
       axes give zero, and scalar products of unit vectors with
       themselves give one, there are only three nonzero terms
       in this expression. Thus, the scalar product simplifies to:

                 \vec A\cdot\vec B=A_xB_x+A_yB_y+A_zB_z

          We can use the equation below to find the angle
       between two vectors. When we divide

          \vec A\cdot\vec B=|\vec A||\vec B| \cos\phi by
          |\vec A || \vec B| , we obtain the equation for cos(),
       into which we substitute the equation from above:

             \text{cos}\,\phi =\frac{\overset{\to
          }{A}·\overset{\to
          }{B}}{AB}=\frac{{A}_{x}{B}_{x}+{A}_{y}{B}_{y}+{A}_{z}{B}_
          {z}}{AB}
          The angle , between vectors

   \vec A \text{ and }\vec B is obtained by taking the
inverse cosine of the expression above.

But what IS it?

The dot product is the

component of vector A along B
( |A| cos  ) times the

magnitude (size of B). OR, it's

the component of B on A times

the magnitude of A. Visually,

this can be seen in the figure.

   One neat thing about the dot

product is that A · B = B · A

An example of a dot product is in a solar panel. To maximize

efficiency, the rays coming from the sun should be perpendicular

to the panels, that is, straight on. You could use the dot product

between a vector of the sun's rays (yellow in the image below) and

the unit vector perpendicular to the surface (green in the image) to

calculate what portion of a ray that comes in at an angle produces

energy.

   Unit vectors allow for a straightforward calculation of
the cross product of two vectors under even the most
general circumstances, e.g. circumstances in which each
of the vectors is pointing in an arbitrary direction in a
three-dimensional space. To take advantage of the
method, we need to know the cross product of the
Cartesian coordinate axis unit vectors i, j, and k with
each other. First off, we should note that any vector
crossed with itself gives zero. This is evident from the
equation:

        |\vec A\times\vec B|=|\vec A||\vec B|\sin\theta.
   because if A and B are in the same direction, then  =
0°, and since sin 0° = 0, we have

                                                                 1.5 Cross Products | 65
   |\vec A\times\vec B|=0. Regarding the unit vectors,
this means that:

                  \underline{\hat{i}}\times\
underline{\hat{i}}=0\\\underline{\hat{ j}}\times\
underline{\hat{ j}}=0\\\underline{\hat{k}}\times\

                     underline{\hat{k}}=0

   Next, we note that the magnitude of the cross
product of two vectors that are perpendicular to each
other is just the ordinary product of the magnitudes of
the vectors. This is also evident from the equation:

|\vec {A}\times\vec{B}|=|\vec A||\vec B|\sin\theta

   because if \vec A is perpendicular to  \vec B then
 = 90° and sin90° = 1 so:

|\vec A\times\vec B|=|\vec A||\vec B|

   Now, if A and B are unit vectors, then their
magnitudes are both 1, so the product of their
magnitudes is also 1. Furthermore, the unit vectors i, j,
and k are all perpendicular to each other, so the
magnitude of the cross product of any one of them with
any other one of them is the product of the two
magnitudes, that is, 1.

   Now, how about the direction? Let's use the right-
hand rule to get the direction of i×j:

66 | 1.5 Cross Products
   [To find the direction, we use the right-hand rule,
which we will cover more in section 3.1. Here is an
overview.] With the fingers of the right hand pointing
directly away from the right elbow, and in the same
direction as i, (the first vector in "

   \underline{\hat{i}}\times\underline{\hat{ j}}") to
make it so that if one were to close the fingers, they
would point in the same direction as

   \underline{\hat{ j}}, the palm must be facing in the +y
direction. That being the case, the extended thumb
must be pointing in the +z direction. Putting the

                                                                 1.5 Cross Products | 67
       magnitude (the magnitude of each unit vector is 1) and
       direction (+z) information together, we see that:

            · \underline{\hat{i}}\times\
                   underline{\hat{ j}}=\underline{\hat{k}}

            · \underline{\hat{ j}}\times\
                   underline{\hat{k}}=\underline{\hat{i}}

            · \underline{\hat{k}}\times\
                   underline{\hat{i}}=\underline{\hat{ j}}

            · \underline{\hat{ j}}\times\underline{\hat{i}}=-
                   \underline{\hat{k}}

            · \underline{\hat{k}}\times\underline{\hat{ j}}=-
                   \underline{\hat{i}}

            · \underline{\hat{i}}\times\underline{\hat{k}}=-
                   \underline{\hat{ j}}

          One way of remembering this is to write
          \underline{\hat{i}},\underline{\hat{ j}},\underline{\h
       at{k}}
       twice in succession:

             \underline{\hat{\textbf{i}}},\underline{\hat{\textbf{ j
           }}},\underline{\hat{\textbf{k}}},\underline{\hat{\textbf
          {i}}},\underline{\hat{\textbf{ j}}},\underline{\hat{\textb

                                               f{k}}}
          Then, crossing any one of the first three vectors into
       the vector immediately to its right yields the next vector
       to the right. But crossing any one of the last three
       vectors into the vector immediately to its left yields the
       negative of the next vector to the left (left-to-right "+",
       but right-to-left "-").
          Now we're ready to look at the general case. Any

vector \vec A can be expressed in terms of unit
vectors:

   \vec{\textbf{A}}=A_x\hat{\underline{i}}+A_y\
hat{\underline{ j}}+A_z\hat{\underline{k}}

   Doing the same for a vector  \vec B then allows us
to write the cross product as:

hat{\underline{k}})\times(B_x\hat{\underline{i}}+B_y\
hat{\underline{ j}}+B_z\hat{\underline{k}})

   Using the distributive rule for multiplication, we can
write this as:

   \begin{aligned}\vec{\textbf{A}}\times\

          Using, in each term, the commutative rule and the
       associative rule for multiplication, we can write this as:

             \begin{aligned}\vec{\textbf{A}}\times\

          hat{\underline{k}})\end{aligned}

          Now we evaluate the cross product that appears in
       each term:

   \underline{\hat{i}})+A_zB_z(0)\end{aligned}
   Eliminating the zero terms and grouping the terms
with i together, the terms with j together, and the terms
with k together yields:

      \begin{aligned}\vec A\times\vec
   B=&amp;A_yB_z(\underline{\hat{i}})+A_zB_y(-

   \underline{\hat{ j}})+\\&amp;A_xB_y(\underline{\hat{

   Factoring out the unit vectors yields:

      \begin{aligned}\vec A\times\vec B=&amp;(A_yB_z-
   A_zB_y)\underline{\hat{i}}+\\&amp;(A_zB_x-
   A_xB_z)\underline{\hat{ j}}+\\&amp;(A_xB_y-
   A_yB_x)\underline{\hat{k}}\end{aligned}
   which can be written on one line as:

      \vec A\times\vec B=(A_yB_z-
   A_zB_y)\underline{\hat{i}}+(A_zB_x-
   A_xB_z)\underline{\hat{ j}}+(A_xB_y-
   A_yB_x)\underline{\hat{k}}
   This is our end result. We can arrive at this result
much more quickly if we borrow a tool from that branch
of mathematics known as linear algebra (the
mathematics of matrices).

                                                                  1.5 Cross Products | 71
          We form the 3×3 matrix:
                     \begin{bmatrix} \underline{\hat{i}} &amp;

            \underline{\hat{ j}} &amp; \underline{\hat{k}} \\ A_x
            &amp; A_y &amp; A_z \\ B_x &amp; B_y &amp; B_z

                                        \end{bmatrix}
          by writing i, j, k as the first row, then the components
       of the first vector that appear in the cross product as
       the second row, and finally the components of the
       second vector that appear in the cross product as the
       last row. It turns out that the cross product is equal to
       the determinant of that matrix. We use absolute value
       signs on the entire matrix to signify "the determinant of
       the matrix." So we have:

                         \vec A\times\vec B=\begin{bmatrix}
             \underline{\hat{i}} &amp; \underline{\hat{ j}} &amp;
            \underline{\hat{k}} \\ A_x &amp; A_y &amp; A_z \\

                    B_x &amp; B_y &amp; B_z \end{bmatrix}
          To take the determinant of a 3×3 matrix, you work
       your way across the top row. For each element in that
       row, you take the product of the elements along the
       diagonal that extends down and to the right, minus the
       product of the elements down and to the left, and you
       add the three results (one result for each element in the
       top row) together. If there are no elements down and to
       the appropriate side, you move over to the other side of
       the matrix (see below) to complete the diagonal.

             For the first element of the first row, the i, take the
                         product down and to the right,

72 | 1.5 Cross Products
   ( this yields iAyBz) minus the product down and to the
                                     left

         ( the product down-and-to-the-left is iAzBy).
   For the first element in the first row, we thus have:
   \underline{\hat{i}}AyBz - \underline{\hat{i}}AzBy
which can be written as: (AyBz - AzBy)
   \underline{\hat{i}}. Repeating the process for the
second and third elements in the first row (the j and the
k) we get (AzBx - AxBz) \underline{\hat{ j}} and (AxBy -
AyBx) \underline{\hat{k}} respectively. Adding the

                                                                 1.5 Cross Products | 73
       three results to form the determinant of the matrix
       results in:

                              \vec A\times\vec B=(A_yB_z-
                       A_zB_y)\underline{\hat{i}}+(A_zB_x-

                              A_yB_x)\underline{\hat{k}}

       product:

Key Takeaways

        Basically: Cross product is a method to find a
     vector that is a product of two vectors,
     perpendicular to the plane created from the two
     vectors.

        Application: While bicycling, the force of my foot
     pushing on the pedal produces the most rotation
     when the force is 90 degrees (perpendicular) from the
     surface of the pedal. The pedals themselves rotate,
     so I can change the angle I am pushing with,
     otherwise, when the pedal is at the bottom, it would
     be very difficult to produce forward motion.

        Looking ahead: In the next section, 1.6 on Torque,
     we will use the cross product to find the moment
     produced by forces.

                                                                    1.5 Cross Products | 75
1.6 Torque/Moment

1.6.1 Moments

Moments are created by a force acting at a distance from the center
of rotation. There are three ways to calculate moments: scalar,
vector, and using the right-hand rule. The first two methods will be
presented in this section, and the third method will be discussed in
section 3.1.3 on the right-hand rule.

          A moment (sometimes called a torque) is defined as
       the "tendency of a force to rotate a body". Where forces
       cause linear accelerations, moments cause angular
       accelerations. In this way, moments can be thought of
       as twisting forces.

76 | 1.6 Torque/Moment
Imagine two boxes on an icy surface. The force on box A would
simply cause the box to begin accelerating, but the force on box B
would cause the box to both accelerate and to begin to rotate. The
force on box B is exerting a moment, whereas the force on box A
is not.

   The Vector Representation of a Moment:
   Moments, like forces, can be represented as vectors
and have a magnitude, a direction, and a "point of
application". For moments, however, a better name for
the point of application is the axis of rotation. This will
be the point or axis where we will determine all the
moments.
   Magnitude:
   The magnitude of a moment is the degree to which
the moment will cause angular acceleration in the body
it is acting on. It is represented by a scalar (a single
number). The magnitude of the moment can be thought
of as the strength of the twisting force exerted on the
body. When a moment is represented as a vector, the
magnitude of the moment is usually explicitly labelled.

                                                               1.6 Torque/Moment | 77
       Though the length of the moment vector also often
       corresponds to the relative magnitude of the moment.

          The magnitude of the moment is measured in units of
       force times distance. The standard metric units for the
       magnitude of moments are newton meters, and the
       standard English units for a moment are foot pounds.

               M = F \cdot d \\ \text{Metric: } \mathrm{N} \cdot
              \mathrm{m} \\ \text{English: } \mathrm{lb} \cdot

                                         \mathrm{ft}
          Direction:
          In a two-dimensional problem, the direction can be
       thought of as a scalar quantity corresponding to the
       direction of rotation the moment would cause. A
       moment that would cause a counter-clockwise rotation
       is a positive moment, and a moment that would cause a
       clockwise rotation is a negative moment.
          In a three-dimensional problem, however, a body can
       rotate about an axis in any direction. If this is the case,
       we need a vector to represent the direction of the
       moment. The direction of the moment vector will line
       up with the axis of rotation that moment would cause,
       but to determine which of the two directions we can use
       along that axis we have available, we use the right-hand
       rule. To use the right-hand rule, align your right hand as
       shown so that your thumb lines up with the axis of
       rotation for the moment and your curled fingers point in
       the direction of rotation for your moment. If you do this,
       your thumb will be pointing in the direction of the
       moment vector.

78 | 1.6 Torque/Moment
   If we look back at two-dimensional problems, all
rotations occur about an axis pointing directly into or
out of the page (the z-axis). Using the right-hand rule,
counter-clockwise rotations are represented by a vector
in the positive z direction and clockwise rotations are
represented by a vector in the negative z direction.

   Axis of Rotation:
   In engineering statics problems, we can choose any
point/axis as the axis of rotation. The choice of this
point will affect the magnitude and direction of the
resulting moment, however, and the moment is only
valid about that point.

                                                               1.6 Torque/Moment | 79
        The magnitude and direction of a moment depend upon the
        chosen axis of rotation. For example, the single force above would
        cause different moments about Point A and Point B, because it
        would cause different rotations depending on the point we fix in
        place.

          Though we can take the moment about any point in a
       statics problem, if we are adding together the moments
       from multiple forces, all the moments must be taken
       about a common axis of rotation. Moments taken about
       different points cannot be added together to find a `net
       moment'

          Additionally, if we move into the subject of dynamics,
       where bodies are moving, we will want to relate
       moments to angular accelerations. For this to work, we
       will need to take the moments either about a single
       point that does not move (such as the hinge on a door)
       or we will need to take the moments about the center of
       mass of the body. Summing moments about other axes
       of rotation will not result in valid calculations.

          Calculating Moments:
          We will have two main options to calculate the

80 | 1.6 Torque/Moment
       moment that a force exerts on a body: scalar
       methods and vector methods. Scalar methods are
       generally faster for two-dimensional problems where a
       body can only rotate clockwise or counterclockwise,
       while vector methods are generally faster for three-
       dimensional problems where the axis of rotation is more
       complex.

          Given any point on an extended body, if there is a
       force acting on that body that does not travel through
       that point, then that force will cause a moment about
       that point. As discussed on the moments page, a
       moment is a force's tendency to cause rotation.

1.6.2 Scalar Method in 2 Dimensions

          In discussing how to calculate the moment of a force
       about a point via scalar quantities, we will begin with
       the example of a force on a simple lever as shown below.
       In this simple lever there is a force on the end of the
       lever, distance d away from the center of rotation for
       the lever (point A) where the force has a magnitude F.

                                                                        1.6 Torque/Moment | 81
          When using scalar quantities, the magnitude of the
       moment will be equal to the perpendicular distance
       between the line of action of the force and the point
       about which we are taking the moment.

                         M=F\ast d

          To determine the sign of the moment, we determine
       what type of rotation the force would cause. In this
       case, we can see that the force would cause the lever to
       rotate counterclockwise about point A.
       Counterclockwise rotations are caused by positive
       moment,s while clockwise rotations are caused by
       negative moments.

          Another important factor to remember is that the
       value d is the perpendicular distance from the force to
       the point we are taking the moment about. We could
       measure the distance from point A to the head of the

82 | 1.6 Torque/Moment
force vector, or the tail of the force vector, or really any
point along the line of action of force F. The distance we
need to use for the scalar moment calculation, however,
is the shortest distance between the point and the line
of action of the force. This will always be a line
perpendicular to the line of action of the force, going to
the point we are taking the moment about.

                                                              1.6 Torque/Moment | 83
If the position vector and force aren't exactly 90 degrees, the
equation T = |r| |F| sin  can be helpful and still produce a scalar
number for moment or torque. This would be good if we had simple
systems, such as opening a door or spinning a top. What happens
when you have a rotating door and a few people try to go through
it? Or a force that isn't exactly along two axes? We'll use vectors as
shown in the next section to solve that.

1.6.3 Vector Method in 3 Dimensions

          An alternative to calculating the moment via scalar
       quantities is using the vector or cross product methods.
       For simple two-dimensional problems, using scalar
       quantities is usually easier, but for more complex
       problems, using the cross product method is usually
       easier. The cross product method for calculating
       moments says that the moment vector of a force about a
       point will be equal to the cross product of a
       vector r from the point to anywhere on the line of
       action of the force and the force vector itself.

                              \vec M=\vec r\times\vec F
          A big advantage of this method is that r does not have
       to be the shortest distance between the point and the
       line of action; it goes from the point to any part of the
       line of action. For any problem, there are many possible
       r vectors, though, because of the way the cross product
       works, they should all result in the same moment vector
       in the end.

84 | 1.6 Torque/Moment
  The moment vector of the force F about point A will be equal
  to the cross product of the r vector and the force vector. The r
  vector is a vector from point A to any point along the line of
  action of the force.

   It is important to note here that all quantities
(r, F and M) are vectors. Before you can solve for the
cross product, you will need to write out r and F in
vector component form. Also, even for two-dimensional
problems, you will need to write out all three
components of the r and F vectors. For two-dimensional
problems, the z components of the r and F vectors will
simply be zero, but those values are necessary for the
calculations.

                                                              1.6 Torque/Moment | 85
          The moment vector you get will line up with the axis
       of rotation for the moment, where you can use the
       right-hand rule to determine if the moment is going
       clockwise or counterclockwise about that axis.

           The result of r cross F will give us the moment vector. For this
           two-dimensional problem, the moment vector is pointing in
           the positive z direction. We can use the right-hand rule to
           determine the direction of rotation from the moment (line
           our right thumb up with the moment vector, and our curled
           fingers will point in the direction of rotation from the
           moment).

          Finally, it is also important to note that the cross

86 | 1.6 Torque/Moment
       product, unlike multiplication, is not commutative. This
       means that the order of the vectors matters, and
       r cross F will not be the same as F cross r. It is
       important to always use r cross F when calculating
       moments.

       http://mechanicsmap.psu.edu/websites/

       momentvector.html

Whether you use scalars: M = |r| |F| sin or vectors: M = r x F,
you can solve most moment/torque problems. The scalar method is
faster for 2-D problems, especially if the vectors are at 90-degree
angles from each other (sin 90º = 1). The vector method is more
robust, especially if there are additional angles involved. There is
the potential to make errors, so it's recommended to use the Step
6 Review step to try multiple methods to ensure your answer is
correct.

   See the examples in section 1.8, as many of them concern
moments.

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: There are three methods to calculate moments,
     two of which were discussed here. Moments or Torque is
     created by a force acting at some distance from an axis of
     rotation.

                                                                       1.6 Torque/Moment | 87
        Application: When you are opening a heavy door, you
     push on the door. If you push closer to the axis of rotation,
     you'll need a bigger force to make it move. If you push
     further away from the axis (so r is bigger), the force can be
     smaller to make the same motion occur.

        Looking ahead: Moments apply when rigid bodies are
     involved, so we'll pick up moments again in Chapter 3.1.3,
     when you'll learn the third way to calculate moments
     (torque).

1.7 Problem Solving Process

Learning how to use a structured problem-solving process will help
you to be more organized and support your future courses. Also, it
will train your brain how to approach problems. Just like basketball
players practice jump shots over and over to train their body how to
act in high-pressure scenarios, if you are comfortable and familiar
with a structured problem-solving process, when you're in a high-
pressure situation like a test, you can just jump into the problem like
muscle memory.

6-Step Problem-Solving Method:

 1. Problem

        Write out the answer with all the necessary information
            that is given to you. It feels like it takes forever, but it's
            important to have the problem and solution next to each
            other.

2. Draw

        Draw the problem; this is usually a free-body diagram
            (don't forget a coordinate frame). Eventually, as you get
            further into the course, you might need a few drawings.
            One would be a quick sketch of the problem in the real
            world, then modelling it into a simplified engineering
            drawing, and finally, the free-body diagram.

3. Known and Unknowns

        Write out a list of the known/given values with the

                                                             1.7 Problem Solving Process | 89
            variable and unit, i.e m = 14 kg (variable = number unit)
        Write out a list of the unknown values that you will have to

            solve for in order to solve the problem.
        You can also add any assumptions you made here that

            change the problem.
        Also state any constants, i.e. g = 32.2 ft/m2 or g = 9.81

            m/s2
        This step helps you have all the information in one place

            when you solve the problem. It's also important because
            each number should include units, so you can see if the
            units match or if you need to convert some numbers so
            they are all in English or SI. This also gives you the
            variables side by side to ensure they are unique (so you
            don't accidentally have 2 `d' variables and can rename one
            with a subscript).

4. Approach

        Write a simple sentence or phrase explaining what
            method/approach you will use to solve the problem.

        For example: `use method of joints', or equilibrium
            equations for a rigid body, MMOI for a certain shape, etc.

        This is going to be more important when you get to the
            later chapters, and especially next semester in Dynamics,
            where you can solve the same problem many ways. Might
            as well practice now!

5. Analysis

        This is the actual solving step. This is where you show all
            the work you have done to solve the problem.

        When you get an answer, restate the variable you are
            solving for, include the unit, and put a box around the
            answer.

6. Review

90 | 1.7 Problem Solving Process
        Write a simple sentence explaining why (or why not) your
            answer makes sense. Use logic and common sense for this
            step.

        When possible, use a second quick numerical analysis to
            verify your answer. This is the "gut check" to do a quick
            calculation to ensure your answer is reasonable.

        This is the most confusing step as students often don't
            know what to put here and up just writing `The number
            looks reasonable'. This step is vitally important to help you
            learn how to think about your answer. What does that
            number mean? What is it close to? For example, if you find
            that x = 4000 m, that's a very large distance! In the review,
            I would say, `the object is 4 km long which is reasonable for
            a long bridge'. See how this is compared to something
            similar? Or you could do a second calculation to verify the
            number is correct, such as adding up multiple parts of the
            problem to confirm the total length is accurate, i.e. `x + y +
            z = total, yes it works!'

Additional notes for this course:

  · It's important to include the number and label the steps so it's
      clear what you're doing, as shown in the example below.

  · It's okay if you make mistakes, just put a line through it and
      keep going.

  · Remember, your header should include your name, the page
      number, the total number of pages, the course number, and
      the assignment number. If a problem spans a number of pages,
      you should include it in the header too.

          It makes sense that the angle is less than 45, because
       y is smaller than x. Also, if you use the Pythagorean
       theorem to find r, you get the same answer.

          1. Problem

                  Mark is fishing in the ocean with his
               favourite fishing rod. The distance between
               the tip of the rod and the reel is 8 ft and the
               length of the reel handle is 0.25 ft. The angle
               between the fishing rod and fishing line is 45
               degrees. If Mark catches a fish when 25 ft of

                   · Mark can reel in the fish when he

                       generates more torque with the handle
                       than the amount of torque that the fish
                       is applying to the reel while pulling on
                       the line.

   6. Review
   Though yielding a very large number, the answer
appears correct from the information given. 13,000 N of
force is the amount of force Mark would need to apply
to the reel handle to generate the same amount of force
that the fish creates. 13,000 N in reality is too much for
one to generate, but also in a real scenario, one would
not have to generate the same amount of force to reel in
the fish, to reel gearing, the amount of torque generated
by the fishing rod itself, etc. In other words 13 000 N of
force is too high in a real scenario, but with the
assumptions given in the problem, the number seems
reasonable. The answer also has the correct unit, N.

Example 1.8.4: Torque, Submitted by Luke
McCarvill

1. Problem

106 | 1.8 Examples
   To start riding her bicycle, Jane must push
down on one of her bike's pedals, which are
on 16-centimetre-long crank arms. Jane can
push directly downwards with her legs with a
force of 100N. Jane notices that the pedal's
starting position can sometimes make it
more or less useful in generating torque.

   a) What is the ideal angle that Jane's bike
pedal should be at in order to generate the
most torque? Prove this mathematically.
(Assume we only care about the very start of
her very first push, and choose a reference
frame for the angle that makes most sense
for you.)

   b) What angle(s) should the bike pedal be at
if Jane wants to generate exactly half of the
maximum amount of torque?

   c) Is there any position(s) at which the
pedal will create zero torque? Where are
they and why?

          For part a), I will find a general equation for torque

       function for its maxima
          For part b), I will find the magnitude of 50% of
       maximum torque and then reverse-engineer the

be at to satisfy the equation.

   For part c), I will look back at my equation and find
when the equation equals zero, then try to understand
why, given the example problem.

   5. Analysis
   Part a:

      \begin{aligned} &amp;T=\left|\vec F_{A}\right| *
   \left|\vec r\right| * \sin \theta \\ &amp;T=(100 N)
   *(0.16 m) * \sin \theta \\ &amp;T=16 \sin \theta
   \mathrm{Nm} \\ &amp;\quad\
   left\{90^{\circ}+360^{\circ} k ; k \in
   \mathbb{Z}\right\} \end{aligned}

   Thinking about the shape of the sine function in the
first period, the maximum occurs at 90 degrees.

   You could say algebraically that the maximum is at 90,
450, 810, etc., but these angles all represent the same
position on the wheel. Therefore, we will use 90.

   Part b:

       etc \end{aligned}
          Therefore, Jane could push at 30 from vertical, or 150
       from vertical to create half the torque.
          *Interesting to note is that half the angle does not
       yield half the torque; the angle is 30, not 45. This is
       because the sine function is nonlinear.*
          Part C:
          T = 16 sin tells us that the angles of 0 and 180 will
       give us zero torque.
          This makes sense given that pushing straight down on
       a stable pendulum will not cause the pendulum to
       rotate!
          Likewise, if you just stand on your pedals, you're
       providing lots of downward force, but creating zero
       torque since the crank arm and the direction of the
       force are parallel (or antiparallel)!

       degrees) and are within a reasonable order of magnitude

          1. Problem
                  A person is pushing on a door with a force

               of 100 N. The door is at an angle  = 45° as
               shown in the sketch below.

                  a) Calculate the moment when r is 45 cm
               and 75 cm.

                  b) At what angle(s) is the moment zero?
               Explain why.

          4. Approach
          Use the equation below.

          5. Analysis
          Part a)
          The angle we were given is not technically the one we
       should use in the moment equation. The angle should be
       between r and F. Therefore, we have to find the new
       angle.

          As shown below, the angle we find is also 45°. Now we
       can continue and solve for M1 and M2.

             \theta=90^{\circ}-45^{\circ}
             \theta=45^{\circ}

   M=0\\\sin\
   theta=0\\\theta=\sin^{-1}(0)\\\theta=0^{\circ},

   Answer: The moment is zero when the angle between
the force and the moment arm is 0° or 180° (360 would
represent the same angle as 0°, as would 540°, etc.)

   6. Review

   It makes sense that the moment is zero when the door
is either closed or wide open, because when we apply a
force at those positions, no movement of the door is
possible.

            1.8 Examples | 117
                  George travelled a displacement of dg = [7
               0 8] m from his car. George's dog, named
               Sparky, on the other hand, travelled a
               displacement of ds = [0 6 6] m from George's
               car. George called Sparky's name, and the
               dog ran to George's position. It took Sparky
               four seconds to get there.

   6. Review
   Part a:
   One way to review the question is to walk through the
solution verbally. Our solution shows that for Sparky to
get to George, he must walk 7 m in the positive x-
direction (almost out of the page), 6 m in the negative y-
direction (left), and finally 2 m in the positive z-direction
(up).
   Firstly, since the dog initially did not go in the x-
direction, it makes sense that Sparky would have to
copy George's exact x movement. Secondly, since
George did not move in the y-direction, it would make

                                                                        1.8 Examples | 121
       sense that Sparky would just have to retrace his steps,
       and if he initially went 6 m right, he would have to go 6
       m left. Thirdly, George and Sparky both went upwards,
       but George went 2 m higher with an altitude of 8 m
       compared to Sparky's 6 m, correlating to Sparky having
       to go positive 2 m in the z-direction to meet George.

          Therefore, since all the movements make sense for
       Sparky to meet George (using logic), the answer is
       proven to be right.

          Parts b and c:
          Since B and C correlate to the same magnitude, they
       can be reviewed together. From a quick search, an
       average dog tops out at a speed of 19 miles per hour. We
       can convert this to SI units:

             \frac{19 \text { miles }}{1 h r}\left(\frac{1
          \mathrm{~km}}{0.621371 \text { miles
          }}\right)\left(\frac{1000 \mathrm{~m}}{1
          \mathrm{~km}}\right)\left(\frac{1
          \mathrm{hr}}{3600}\right)=8.49 \mathrm{~m} /
          \mathrm{s}
          The top speed of an average dog is 8.49 m/s. So
       2.36m/s is approximately a quarter of the top speed of
       an average dog. Sparky probably was not sprinting at full
       speed and he could be a slower dog breed, making
       2.36m/s a reasonable answer.

      rigid bodies

126 | Chapter 2: Particles
2.1 Particle & Rigid Body

This may seem like a simple concept, but it is important to know the
difference between particles and rigid bodies because it will change
the type of analysis you perform.

          Particles are bodies where all the mass is
       concentrated at a single point in space. Particle analysis
       will only have to take into account the forces acting on
       the body and translational motion because rotation is
       not considered for particles.

          Rigid bodies, on the other hand, have mass that is
       distributed throughout a finite volume. Rigid body
       analysis is more complex and also has to take into
       account moments and rotational motions. In actuality,
       no bodies are truly particles, but some bodies can be
       approximated as particles to simplify analysis. Bodies
       are often assumed to be particles if the rotational
       motions are negligible when compared to the
       translational motions, or in systems where there is no
       moment exerted on the body, such as a concurrent
       force system.

                                                                 2.1 Particle & Rigid Body | 127

Particles are typically part of a larger scale, such as a sky diver falling
through the sky, or a football flying through the air. Rigid body
analyses are required when the length or size of the object must be

                                                                2.1 Particle & Rigid Body | 129
considered, such as if you need to calculate the torque from turning
a bolt with a wrench, or if there is rotation, such as the bolt that is
being turned.

   One way to think of it is that particles have mass, whereas rigid
bodies have mass and shape. We make an assumption that neither
particles nor rigid bodies deform (change shape). Note: we say
particles don't deform even though we are already assuming that
the shape of particles is negligible.

   In baseball, if you want to consider how far the ball travels, that
would be a particle analysis because the speed is much greater than
the size of the ball. A rigid body analysis would be how the bat
swings to hit the ball, because the length of the bat would change
how far the ball travels. A rigid body analysis could be to calculate
the spin on the ball as it flies through the air (if you focus on how it
is rotating).

You would have done particle analyses in your high school physics
130 | 2.1 Particle & Rigid Body
classes. Starting in chapter 3, we'll expand on these concepts to
include rigid bodies and bring shape and size into the problem.

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: Particles have non-deforming mass & rigid
     bodies have non-deforming mass with shape & size. Rigid
     body analyses are required when length or size of the
     object much be considered, including rotation and torque.
     Particle analyses are for a grander scale where the object is
     small in comparison to the distance or speed.

        Application: A particle analysis would be an airplane as it
     flies at a high speed through the air. A rigid body analysis
     would be if you analyze how the plane is rotating in order
     to turn, or to consider the size of the wheels as it is taxing
     on the runway or the size of the wings to keep it in the air.

        Looking ahead, Chapter 2 concerns particle analyses, and
     Chapters 3 - 7 focus on rigid body analyses.

                                                                 2.1 Particle & Rigid Body | 131
2.2 Free Body Diagrams for
Particles

  A free-body diagram (FBD) helps you to simplify a complicated
  problem. The first thing to remember is the object should always be
  free which means, floating in space. You represent the floor or other
  surfaces with forces. You might have done these particle free body
  diagrams in your high school physics class, where all the forces act
  at the centre of the object. (This will be different for rigid bodies).

     To draw a free-body diagram remember four points:

    · Add coordinate frame (which way is positive x and positive y?)
    · Replace surfaces with forces ( floor, hand, and objects touching

        it become arrows)
    · Point forces in the correct direction (the head of the arrow

        points to where the force acts. FG acts down)
    · Use unique (different) names (be sure to name each force with a

        different name).

  For a baseball being hit by a bat (and neglecting air), the force of
  gravity acts at the center, the force of the bat acts on the outside.
  Notice in the figure1 the names FBat and FG are different in the figure
  below. Also - you can understand what they represent quickly. Also
  see the coordinate frame? You'll be adding these in your sleep by the
  end of this class.

  132 | 2.2 Free Body Diagrams for Particles
   As you draw a free body diagram, there are a couple of
things you need to keep in mind:

             (1) Include only those forces acting ON the
          object whose free body diagram you are drawing.
          Any force exerted BY the object on some other
          object belongs on the free body diagram of the
          other object.
          (2) All forces are contact forces and every force
          has an agent. The agent is "that which is exerting
          the force." In other words, the agent is the life
          form or thing that is doing the pushing or pulling

                                       2.2 Free Body Diagrams for Particles | 133
                 on the object. No agent can exert a force on an
                 object without being in contact with the object.
          We are going to introduce the various kinds of forces
       by means of examples. Here is the first
       example:

             A rock is thrown up into the air by a person. Draw the
             free body diagram of the rock while it is up in the air.
             (Your free body diagram is applicable for any time after
             the rock leaves the thrower's hand, until the last instant
             before the rock makes contact with whatever it is
             destined to hit.) Neglect any forces that might be exerted
             on the rock by the air.

                If you see the rock flying through the air, it
             may very well look to you like there is nothing
             touching the rock. But the earth's gravitational
             field is everywhere in the vicinity of the earth. It
             can't be blocked. It can't be shielded. It is in the
             air, in the water, even in the dirt. It is in direct
             contact with everything in the vicinity of the
             earth. It exerts a force on every object near the
             surface of the earth. We call that force the
             gravitational force. You have already studied the
             gravitational force. We give a brief synopsis of it
             here.

134 | 2.2 Free Body Diagrams for Particles
   The Gravitational Force Exerted on Objects
Near the Surface of the Earth.

   Because it has mass, the earth has a
gravitational field. The gravitational field is a
force-per-mass field. It is invisible. It is not
matter. It is an infinite set of force-per-mass
vectors, one at every point in space in the
vicinity of the surface of the earth. Each force
per-mass vector is directed downward, toward
the center of the earth and, near the surface of
the earth, has a magnitude of 9.81 N/kg. The
effect of the earth's gravitational field is to exert
a force on any object that is in the earth's
gravitational field. The force is called the
gravitational force and is equal to the product of
the mass of the object and the earth's
gravitational field vector: Fg=mg. Where g=9.81
N/kg is the magnitude of the earth's
gravitational field vector. The direction of the
near-earth's-surface gravitational force is
downward, toward the center of the earth.

   Here is the free body diagram and the
corresponding table of forces:

                                 2.2 Free Body Diagrams for Particles | 135
                (1) The only thing touching the object while it
             is up in the air (neglecting the air itself) is the
             earth's gravitational field. So there is only one
             force on the object, namely the gravitational
             force. The arrow representing the force vector is
             drawn so that the tail of the arrow is touching
             the object, and the arrow extends away from the
             object in the direction of the force.

                (2) Unless otherwise stipulated, label the
             diagram yourself however it makes most sense.
             Always draw a coordinate frame (Usually x is
             upwards, and y extends to the right).

                (3) There is no velocity information on a free
             body diagram

                (4) There is no force of the hand acting on the
             object because, at the instant in question, the
             hand is no longer touching the object. When you
             draw a free body diagram, only forces that are
             acting on the object at the instant depicted in
             the diagram are included. The acceleration of

136 | 2.2 Free Body Diagrams for Particles
the object depends only on the currently-acting
forces on the object. The force of the hand is of
historical interest only.

   (5) Regarding the table of forces:
a) Make sure that for any free body diagram you
draw, you are capable of making a complete
table of forces. You are not required to provide a
table of forces with every free body diagram you
draw, but you should expect to be called upon to
create a table of forces more than once.
b) In the table of forces, the agent is the life form
or thing that is exerting the force and the victim
is the object on which the force is being exerted.
Make sure that, in every case,
the victim is the object for which the free body
diagram is being drawn.
c) In the case at hand, there is only one force so
there is only one entry in the table of forces.
d) For any object near the surface of the earth,
the agent of the gravitational force is the earth's
gravitational field. It is okay to abbreviate that to
"Earth" because the gravitational field of the
earth can be considered to be an invisible part of
the earth, but it is NOT okay to call it "gravity."
Gravity is a subject heading corresponding to
the kind of force the gravitational force is,
gravity is not an agent

             A ball of mass m hangs at rest, suspended by a string.
             Draw the free body diagram for the ball, and create the
             corresponding table of forces.

                To do this problem, you need the following
             information about strings:

                The Force Exerted by a Taut String on an
             Object to Which it is Affixed (This also applies
             to ropes, cables, chains, and the like.)

                The force exerted by a string, on an object to
             which it is attached, is always directed away
             from the object, along the length of the string.
             Note that the force in question is exerted by the
             string, not for instance, by some person pulling
             on the other end of the string. The force exerted
             by a string on an object is referred to as a
             "tension force" and its magnitude is
             conventionally represented by the symbol FT.

                Note: There is no formula to tell you what the
             tension force is. If it is not given, the only way to
             get it is to use Newton's 2nd Law.

                Here is the free body diagram of the ball, and
             the corresponding table of forces:

138 | 2.2 Free Body Diagrams for Particles
   There is no "force of motion" acting on an object. Once
you have the force or forces
exerted on the object by everything that is touching the
object, you have all the forces. Do not add a "force of
motion" to your free body diagram. It is especially
tempting to add this force when there are no actual forces
in the direction in which an object is going. Keep in mind,
however, that an object does not need a force on it to keep
going in the direction in which it is going; moving along
at a constant velocity is what an object does when there is
no net force on it.

        Basically: Free-body diagrams (FBDs) give you a way to
     model complicated problems in a simple way. All exterior
     forces are modelled with an arrow.

        Application: A baseball can be modelled using a FBD to
     show how the bat and gravity affect the ball.

        Looking ahead: You'll use a FBD in every step 2 in nearly
     every homework problem. These are especially helpful with
     Equilibrium Equations in the next section.

2.3 Equilibrium Equations for
Particles

For a particle in static equilibrium, Newton's 2nd law can be adapted
for \vec a = 0 and componentized in x y and z:

                                  \sum\vec F=m*\vec a
                                        \sum\vec F=0

      \sum F_x=0\quad\quad\sum F_y=0\quad\quad\sum F_z=0
   Notice that the left side of the equation says `sum of the forces',
which means add up all the forces in that direction. In statics, they
will all cancel out. If you aren't sure if something is in static motion,
sum the forces and see if they equal 0.

Static Equilibrium:

          Objects in static equilibrium are objects that are not
       accelerating (either linear acceleration or angular
       acceleration). These objects may be stationary, or they
       may have a constant velocity.

          Newton's Second Law states that the force exerted on
       an object is equal to the mass of the object times the
       acceleration it experiences. Therefore, if we know that
       the acceleration of an object is equal to zero, then we
       can assume that the sum of all forces acting on the
       object is zero. Individual forces acting on the object,
       represented by force vectors, may not have zero

                                             2.3 Equilibrium Equations for Particles | 141
       magnitude, but the sum of all the force vectors will
       always be equal to zero for objects in equilibrium.

          The equations used when dealing with particles in
       equilibrium are:

                                        \sum\vec F=0
          Which leads to:

                   \sum F_x=0\\\sum F_y=0\\\sum F_z=0
          Since it is a particle, there are no moments involved,
       like there are when it comes to rigid bodies.

Finding the Equilibrium Equations:

          The first step in finding the equilibrium equations is
       to draw a free-body diagram of the body being
       analyzed. This diagram should show all the known and
       unknown force vectors acting on the body. In the free
       body diagram, provide values for any of the known
       magnitudes or directions for the force vectors and

142 | 2.3 Equilibrium Equations for Particles
provide variable names for any unknowns (either
magnitudes or directions).

   The first step in equilibrium analysis is drawing a free-
body diagram. This is done by removing everything but
the body and drawing in all forces acting on the body.
Labelling all forces, key dimensions, and angles is also
useful.

   Next, you will need to choose the x, y, and z axes.
These axes do need to be perpendicular to one another,
but they do not necessarily have to be horizontal or
vertical. If you choose coordinate axes that line up with
some of your force vectors, you will simplify later
analysis.

   Once you have chosen axes, you need to break down
all of the force vectors into components along the x, y
and z directions (see the vectors page in Appendix 1 if
you need more guidance on this). Your first equation will
be the sum of the magnitudes of the components in the
x direction being equal to zero, the second equation will
be the sum of the magnitudes of the components in the

                                   2.3 Equilibrium Equations for Particles | 143
       y direction being equal to zero, and the third (if you
       have a 3D problem) will be the sum of the magnitudes in
       the z direction being equal to zero. Collectively, these
       are known as the equilibrium equations.

          Once you have your equilibrium equations, you can
       solve them for unknowns using algebra. The number of
       unknowns that you will be able to solve for will be the
       number of equilibrium equations that you have. In
       instances where you have more unknowns than
       equations, the problem is known as a statically
       indeterminate problem, and you will need additional
       information to solve for the given unknowns.

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: Equilibrium equations allow you to separate the
     forces and motion into each axis.

        Application: A heavy object is lifted using a rope and
     pulley. Based on the forces, is it in static equilibrium?
     (Answer: if the sum of the forces in each direction is equal
     to zero, then yes!)

        Looking ahead: We will next apply equilibrium equations
     to rigid bodies, allowing use to solve more complex
     problems.

  ·  = 60°

vectors to find T_{B} and T_{A}.
   Note: T_{B} = T_{A}

5. Analysis
Components of T_{B}

   \sum F_{y}= -T_{By} -T_{By}-280 lb = 0 \\ T_{By} = \dfrac{-280
lb}{2} = -140 lb
Note that the -ve sign here means that the direction of vector TB

                                                                             2.4 Examples | 151
is opposite to that drawn in the FBD diagram. So now the FBD is as
given below:

   now, T_{B} \sin {60} = 140 lb
      T_{B} = \dfrac{140 lb}{\sin{60}}

   Thus, T_{B} = T_{A} = 161.66 lb
   The magnitude of the tension carried by each of the cables is
161.66 lb.
   6. Review
   The results show that the x component does no essential
contribution towards carrying the weight of the pipe because the
sum of forces in the x direction just cancels out and equals 0lb.

               brick walls that displace 1200N of force each
               upwards along the pole. There is also a single

       To solve for tension in the chains, we would require
       more information about the distribution of the weights
       on points A and B.

3.1 Right Hand Rule

Before we can analyze rigid bodies, we need to learn a little trick to
help us with the cross product called the `right-hand rule'. We use
the right-hand rule when we have two of the axes and need to find
the direction of the third.
This is called a right-orthogonal system. The `orthogonal' part
means that the three axes are all perpendicular to each other, and
the' right' part means that
\underline{\hat{i}}\times\underline{\hat{ j}}=\underline{\hat{k}},
hence the right hand rule. Remember these from section 1.5?

         \underline{\hat{i}}\times\
            underline{\hat{ j}}=\underline{\hat{k}}

         \underline{\hat{ j}}\times\
            underline{\hat{k}}=\underline{\hat{i}}

         \underline{\hat{k}}\times\
            underline{\hat{i}}=\underline{\hat{ j}}

         \underline{\hat{ j}}\times\underline{\hat{i}}=-
            \underline{\hat{k}}

         \underline{\hat{k}}\times\underline{\hat{ j}}=-
            \underline{\hat{i}}

         \underline{\hat{i}}\times\underline{\hat{k}}=-
            \underline{\hat{ j}}

The opposite of the right-orthogonal system is the left-orthogonal

system                                                    where

\underline{\hat{i}}\times\underline{\hat{ j}}=-\underline{\hat{k}}

. We don't use that one!

There are two ways to do the right hand rule, and they take

practice to conceptually understand, but this will make solving

problems much quicker. You're going to use your fingers and thumb

to represent the x, y, and z axes.

                                    3.1 Right Hand Rule | 169
3.1.1 The Whole-Hand Method

In the following description, A x B = C, so for the coordinate frame,
X x Y = Z (
\underline{\hat{i}}\times\underline{\hat{ j}}=\underline{\hat{k}}).
Your fingers go in the direction of X, then you bend them 90
degrees to point towards Y, and your thumb is in the direction of Z.

          The direction of the cross product vector A x B is
       given by the right-hand rule for the cross product of
       two vectors. To apply this right-hand rule, extend the
       fingers of your right hand so that they are pointing
       directly away from your right elbow. Extend your thumb
       so that it is at
       right angles to your fingers.

          Keeping your fingers aligned with your forearm, point

170 | 3.1 Right Hand Rule
your fingers in the direction of the first vector (the one
that appears before the "×" in the mathematical
expression for the cross product; e.g. the A in A x B ).

   Now rotate your hand, as necessary, about an
imaginary axis extending along your forearm and along
your middle finger, until your hand is oriented such that,
if you were to close your fingers, they would point in
the direction of the second vector.

                                                               3.1 Right Hand Rule | 171
          Your thumb is now pointing in the direction of the
       cross product vector. C = A x B. The cross product
       vector C is always perpendicular to both of the vectors
       that are in the cross product (the A and the B in the case
       at hand). Hence, if you draw them so that both of the
       vectors that are in the cross product are in the plane of
       the page, the cross product vector will always be
       perpendicular to the page, either straight into the page,
       or straight out of the page. In the case at hand, it is
       straight out of the page.

          When we use the cross product to calculate the
       torque due to a force F whose point of application has a
       position vector r, relative to the point about which we
       are calculating the torque, we get an axial torque vector
       . To determine the sense of rotation that such a torque
       vector would correspond to, about the axis defined by
       the torque vector itself, we use the Right Hand Rule for
       Something Curly Something Straight. Note that we are

172 | 3.1 Right Hand Rule
       calculating the torque with respect to a point rather
       than an axis--the axis about which the torque acts
       comes out in the answer.

axes and envisioning how they are perpendicular to each other.

trying to find x.

176 | 3.1 Right Hand Rule
3.1.2 Right Hand Rule and Torque

The third way to calculate torque, as was alluded to in Section 1.6,
is to use the right-hand rule to identify the axis of rotation. The
first way (the scalar method) uses | M | = |r| |F| sin , and often
the angle between the position vector and force is 90 degrees.
The vector method is for more complicated situations and uses
the cross product r x F = M. The third method finds the scalar
value separately, then uses the right-hand rule to find the direction
(positive or negative along the third axis).

  · Point your fingers in the direction of the perpendicular part of
      the position vector r (as you would for x)

  · Curl them towards the direction of the Force vector F (as you
      would for y)

  · Your thumb is in the direction of the moment M that results
      from the force (as for z)

The following will help you understand what is meant by: the
perpendicular part of the position vector:

          The torque  can be expressed as the cross product of

                                                                        3.1 Right Hand Rule | 177
       the position vector r for the point of application of the
       force, and the force vector F itself: r x F = M

          Before we begin our mathematical discussion of what
       we mean by the cross product, a few words about the
       vector r are in order. It is important for you to be able to
       distinguish between the position vector r for the force,
       and the moment arm, so we present them below in one
       and the same diagram. We use the same example that
       we have used before:

          in which we are looking directly along the axis of
       rotation (so it looks like a dot) and the force lies in a
       plane perpendicular to that axis of rotation. We use the
       diagramatic convention that, the point at which the
       force is applied to the rigid body is the point at which
       one end of the arrow in the diagram touches the rigid
       body. Now we add the line of action of the force and the
       moment arm r to the diagram, as well as the position
       vector r of the point of application of the force.

178 | 3.1 Right Hand Rule
   The moment arm can actually be defined in terms of
the position vector for the point of application of the
force. Consider a tilted x-y coordinate system, having an
origin on the axis of rotation, with one axis parallel to
the line of action of the force and one axis
perpendicular to the line of action of the force. We label
the x axis  for "perpendicular" and the y axis || for
"parallel".

                                                               3.1 Right Hand Rule | 179
          Now we break up the position vector r into its
       component vectors along the  (perpendicular) and ||
       (parallel) axes.

180 | 3.1 Right Hand Rule
          From the diagram it is clear that the moment arm r is
       just the magnitude of the component  vector, in the
       perpendicular-to-the-force direction, of the position
       vector of the point of application of the force.

   You use the right-hand rule twice during this method to find the
vector. First, to determine the coordinate frame and again to see
in which direction the torque is aligned. Then you multiply by the

                                                                        3.1 Right Hand Rule | 181

or the "moment arm") and the magnitude of the force vector. ):

   * though it's not always the \hat{\underline{k}} direction, it
could be \hat{\underline{i}} or \hat{\underline{ j}} as well. It
depends on how you define your coordinate frame.

3.1.3 Three-Finger Configuration

If you find curling your fingers too confusing, you can try this
method that uses your thumb, pointer finger, and middle finger all
90 degrees apart. Your thumb is x, your pointer finger is y, your
middle finger is z.
182 | 3.1 Right Hand Rule
   This is done by using your right hand, aligning your
thumb with the first vector and your index with the
second vector. The cross product will point in the
direction of your middle finger (when you hold your
middle finger perpendicular to the other two fingers).
This is illustrated in the Figures below.

                                                              3.1 Right Hand Rule | 183

The "Curly Method"

For axial vectors, you use what I'm calling the curly method. To find
whether the axis of rotation is positive or negative, curl your fingers
in the direction of rotation and your thumb shows the direction of
rotation, i.e. whether rotation is along the positive or negative x y
or z direction. (This assumes you already have a coordinate frame
defined to see which axis the wheel is rotating around and which
direction).

   If a wheel is rolling, the axis is what it rolls around. Curl your

184 | 3.1 Right Hand Rule

  direction of rotation.1

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: The right hand rule helps us to be consistent
     with how the x - y - z axes are oriented. It follows the rule
     that X x Y = Z. Using your fingers and thumb, there are two
     different methods. For one point, point your fingers in the
     direction of x, curl them towards y (you may have to flip
     your hand), and your thumb shows the direction of z.
     Trying to copy this 3d image onto your 2d page may be
     difficult, but with practice, you'll see the right angles
     between the drawn axes.

        Application: How do I know which way to push on the
     torque wrench to make the bolt on my wheel turn? If I
     point my thumb in the direction I want the bolt to move,
     and curl my fingers around the direction of the threads, I
     can see whether to push or pull on the wrench.

        Looking Ahead: We will calculate the moment many times
     throughout the rest of the book, and we need the right-
     hand rule every time, especially as we get into Chapter 4
     and Rigid Body Equilibrium Equations.

186 | 3.1 Right Hand Rule
3.2 Couples

          A couple is a set of equal and opposite forces that
       exerts a net moment on an object but no net force.
       Because the couple exerts a net moment without
       exerting a net force, couples are also sometimes
       called pure moments.

                                                                                  3.2 Couples | 187
         The two equal and opposite forces exerted on this lug wrench
         are a couple. They exert a moment on the lug nut on this wheel
         without exerting any net force on the wheel. Adapted from
         image by Steffen Heinz Caronna CC-BY-SA 3.0.

          The moment exerted by a couple also differs from the
       moment exerted by a single force in that it is
       independent of the location about which you are taking
       the moment. In the example below, we have a couple
       acting on a beam. Each force has a magnitude F, and the
       distance between the two forces is d.

188 | 3.2 Couples
The moment exerted by this couple is independent of the distance
x.

   Now we have some point A, which is distance x from
the first of the two forces. If we take the moment of
each force about point A, and then add these moments
together for the net moment about point A we are left
with the following formula.

                        M=-(F\ast x)+(F\ast(x+d))
   If we rearrange and simplify the formula above, we
can see that the variable x actually disappears from the
equation, leaving the net moment equal to the
magnitude of the forces (F) times the distance between
the two forces (d).

       M=-(F\ast x)+(F\ast x)+(F\ast d)\\\\M=(F\ast d)
   This means that no matter what value of x we have,
the magnitude of the moment exerted by the couple will
be the same. The magnitude of the moment due to the
couple is independent of the location at which we are

                                                                         3.2 Couples | 189
       taking the moment. This will also work in two or three
       dimensions. The magnitude of the moment due to a
       couple will always be equal to the magnitude of the
       forces times the perpendicular distance between the
       two forces.

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: Couples are made from two forces in opposite
     directions that create a moment around an axis

        Application: Turning the steering wheel of your car, you
     push one hand up and the other down to turn the wheel. To
     calculate the size of the couple, you multiply the force
     exerted by the distance between your hands (the diameter
     of the wheel).

        Looking Ahead: While moments are more common in Ch 4
     rigid body equations, it's important to know what couples
     are and how to find them.

3.3 Distributed Loads

3.3.1 Intensity

Distributed loads are a way to represent a force over a certain

distance. Sometimes called intensity, given the variable:

Intensity        w = F / d  [=] N/m, lb/ft

While pressure is force over area (for 3d problems), intensity is

force over distance (for 2d problems). It's like a bunch of mattresses

on the back of a truck. You can model it as 1 force acting at the

center (an equivalent point load as in 3.3.2, or you can model it as

intensity and divide the total force by the width of the truck bed (the
distance that's not visible in this image1).

          A distributed load is any force where the point of
       application of the force is an area or a volume. This
       means that the "point of application" is not really a point
       at all. Though distributed loads are more difficult to
       analyze than point forces, distributed loads are quite
       common in real-world systems, so it is important to
       understand how to model them.

          Distributed loads can be broken down into surface
       forces and body forces. Surface forces are distributed
       forces where the point of application is an area (a
       surface on the body). Body forces are forces where the
       point of application is a volume (the force is exerted on
       all molecules throughout the body). Below are some
       examples of surface and body forces.

        volume of the fruit. Gravitational forces are an example of body
        forces. Image by Zátonyi Sándor CC-BY 3.0.

          Distributed loads are represented as a field of vectors.
       This is drawn as a number of discrete vectors along a

194 | 3.3 Distributed Loads
line, over a surface, or over a volume, that are
connected with a line or a surface, as shown below.

This is a representation of a surface force in a 2D problem (A
force distributed over a line). The magnitude is given in units of
force per unit distance.

This is a representation of a surface force in a 3D problem (a
force distributed over an area). The magnitude is given in units
of force per unit area (also called a pressure).

   Though these representations show a discrete
number of individual vectors, there is actually a
magnitude and direction at all points along the line,
surface, or body. The individual vectors represent a
sampling of these magnitudes and directions.

                                                           3.3 Distributed Loads | 195
          It is also important to realize that the magnitudes of
       distributed forces are given in force per unit distance,
       area, or volume. We must integrate the distributed load
       over its entire range to convert the force into the usual
       units of force.

      Analyzing Distributed Load:

          For analysis purposes in statics and dynamics, we will
       usually substitute in a single point force that is statically
       equivalent to the distributed load in the problem. This
       single point force is called the equivalent point load and
       it will cause the same accelerations or reaction forces as
       the distributed load while simplifying the math.

This is a more complex example of a distributed load.
This is a cartoon of an airplane with its wing covered in
a combination of snow and ice. In a real-world situation,
loads will not accommodate people for ease of
calculation; you get what you get. In this case, we could
approximate this shape with two semi-circles on each
end of the wing with a triangle \nabla in the middle.
For more accuracy, we could use a system similar to the
trapezoidal rule.

3.3.2 Equivalent Point Load & Location

Distributed loads can be modelled as a single point force that is
located at the centroid of the object. You can use straightforward
algebra, or use integration for more complex shapes. Then you
replace the distributed load with the single point load acting at x
distance. See the truck example:

   There are two ways to calculate this, using integrals and using the
area and centroid.

          An equivalent point load is a single point force that
       will have the same effect on a body as the original
       loading condition, which is usually a distributed load.
       The equivalent point load should always cause the same
       linear acceleration and angular acceleration as the
       original load it is equivalent to (or cause the same
       reaction forces if the body is constrained). Finding the
       equivalent point load for a distributed load often helps
       simplify the analysis of a system by removing the

198 | 3.3 Distributed Loads
integrals from the equations of equilibrium or equations
of motion in later analysis.

If the body is unconstrained as shown on the left, the equivalent
point load (shown as a solid vector) will cause the same linear
and angular acceleration as the original distributed load (shown
with dashed vectors). If the body is constrained as shown on the
right, the equivalent point load (shown as a solid vector) will
cause the same reaction forces as the original distributed force
(shown with dashed vectors).

 Finding the Equivalent Point Load

   When finding the equivalent point load we need to
find the magnitude, direction, and point of application
of a single force that is equivalent to the distributed load
we are given. In this course we will only deal with
distributed loads with a uniform direction, in which case
the direction of the equivalent point load will match the
uniform direction of the distributed load. This leaves the

                                                           3.3 Distributed Loads | 199
       magnitude and the point of application to be found.
       There are two options available to find these values:

           1. We can find the magnitude and the point of
                application of the equivalent point load via
                integration of the force functions.

          2. We can use the area/volume and the centroid/
                center of volume of the area or volume under the
                force function.

          The first method is more flexible, allowing us to find
       the equivalent point load for any force function that we
       can make a mathematical formula for (assuming we have
       the skill in calculus to integrate that function). The
       second method is usually faster, assuming that we can
       look up the values for the area or volume under the
       force curve and the values for the centroid or center of
       volume for the area under the curve.

      Using Integration in 2D Surface Force
    Problems:

          Finding the equivalent point load via integration
       always begins by determining the mathematical formula
       that is the force function. The force function
       mathematically relates the magnitude of the force (F) to
       the position (x). In this case the force is acting along a
       single line, so the position can be entirely determined
       by knowing the x coordinate, but in later problems we
       may also need to relate the magnitude of the force to

200 | 3.3 Distributed Loads
the y and z coordinates. In our example below, we can
relate magnitude of the force to the position by stating
that the magnitude of the force at any point in Newtons
per meter is equal to the x position in meters plus one.

The block shown above has a distributed force acting on it. The
force function relates the magnitude of the force to the x-position
along the top of the box.

   The magnitude of the equivalent point load will be
equal to the area under the force function. This will be
the integral of the force function over its entire length
(in this case, from x = 0 to x = 2).

                  F_{eq}=\int_{xmin}^{xmax}F(x)dx
   Now that we have the magnitude of the equivalent
point load such that it matches the magnitude of the
original force, we need to adjust the position (xeq) such
that it would cause the same moment as the original

                                                           3.3 Distributed Loads | 201
       distributed force. The moment of the distributed force
       will be the integral of the force function (F(x)) times the
       moment arm about the origin (x). The moment of the
       equivalent point load will be equal to the magnitude of
       the equivalent point load that we just found times the
       moment arm for the equivalent point load (xeq). If we set
       these two things equal to one another and then solve for
       the position of the equivalent point load (xeq), we are left
       with the following equation:

                     x_{eq}=\frac{\int_{xmin}^{xmax}(F(x)\ast
                                         x)dx}{F_{eq}}

          Now that we have the magnitude, direction, and
       position of the equivalent point load, we can draw the
       point load in our original diagram. This point force can
       be used in place of the distributed force in further
       analysis.

202 | 3.3 Distributed Loads
The values for F_eq and x_eq that we have solved for are the
magnitude and position of the equivalent point load.

 Using the Area and Centroid in 2D
Surface Force Problems:

   As an alternative to using integration, we can use the
area under the force curve and the centroid of the area
under the force curve to find the equivalent point load's
magnitude and point of application, respectively.

                                                           3.3 Distributed Loads | 203
        The magnitude of the equivalent point load is equal to the area
        under the force function. Also, the equivalent point load will
        travel through the centroid of the area under the force function.

          The magnitude(Feq) of the equivalent point load will
       be equal to the area under the force function. We can
       find this area using calculus, but there are often easier
       geometry-based ways of finding the area under the
       force function.

          The equivalent point load will also travel through the
       centroid of the area under the force function. This
       allows us to find the value for xeq. The centroid for many
       common shapes can be looked up in tables, and the

204 | 3.3 Distributed Loads
       parallel axis theorem can be used to determine the
       centroid of more complex shapes (see the centroid page
       for more details).

3.3.3 Composite Distributed Loads

When there is a complicated shape, it can be easier to model it
as more than 1 type of distributed load. You calculate each force
separately and then use a weighted equation to find the total
distance the force acts from a point that you select.

      quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \text{Using Integrals:}\\
   \quad\quad\quad\quad\bar{x}=\frac{\sum F_{i}x_i}{\sum F_i}
     \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad

                    \bar{x}=\frac{\int x w(x) d x}{\int w(x) d x}
   A bit bigger:

   For the following complex shape, this is how you find the
composite equivalent point force and location ( \bar{x}):

210 | 3.3 Distributed Loads
Key Takeaways
   Basically: Distributed loads are a way to model forces in

2d. F = w d. Sometimes called intensity, distributed loads
have units of force over distance: N/m or lb/ft.

   Application: For a truck carrying a heavy, uneven load,
find where the center of the force is.

   Looking ahead, Distributed load helps to model uneven
loads. We'll see it again as we do the beam analysis

                                                               3.3 Distributed Loads | 211
3.4 Reactions & Supports

Imagine a beam extending from the wall. How much weight can the
beam handle before it breaks away or falls off the wall? It depends
on the way it's attached to the wall. We model these real-world
situations using forces and moments. For example, the Grand
Canyon Skywalk lets people walk out over the Grand Canyon. You
want to be sure that the skywalk is so that the people on it are safe.

   We call the skywalk a cantilever beam and turn the real world
beam into a 2d model with constrains. So we can use the same
terminology, it is a fixed constraint, preventing horizontal
movement, vertical movement, and rotation.

212 | 3.4 Reactions & Supports
   Reaction forces and moments are how we model constraints on
structures. They are external forces. There are 3 different kinds
of constraints we will focus on in this course and they each have
different reaction forces and moments:

   1. Pinned (Frictionless)
        Two reaction forces
            acting perpendicularly
            in the x and y directions.
        Pinned constraint and then its free body diagram shown:

   2. Fixed
        Two reaction forces acting perpendicularly in the x and y
            directions

        Moment rotating about fixed constraint (usually a wall),
                                                               3.4 Reactions & Supports | 213
            use right hand rule to find its direction
        This is also called a cantilever beam.
        Fixed constraint and then FBD shown

   3. Roller (there are multiple kinds)
        Single reaction force
            acting in the y
            direction
        No moment is created
        This can be the
            ground that the object
            rests on as well
        Free body diagram shown for roller

   Notice that the Fixed restraint is the most restrictive and the
roller is the least restrictive. You put a force to show how the
restraint restricts motion. The roller only keeps the object from
moving vertically, so there is only 1 force. The pinned restraint
doesn't allow horizontal or vertical movement, hence the two
forces. The fixed beam restricts vertical translation, horizontal
translation, and rotation, so there is a moment and two forces. Note
that this applies only to 2d restraints.

   Here is a summary showing what motion is allowed by that type
of constraint:

214 | 3.4 Reactions & Supports
   Typically, reaction forces are either as follows: a roller and a
pinned reaction force together (1 reaction force + 2 reaction forces
= 3 restraints) or a fixed beam (2 reaction forces and 1 moment = 3
restraints).

The information shown here is to model 2d situations. We don't
get into 3d problems in this statics course, needless to say, there
are more reaction forces and moments involved in 3-dimentsions

                                                               3.4 Reactions & Supports | 215
instead of 2 dimensions. The following section provides a second
explanation on reactions & supports:

          3.4.1 Pin or Hinge Support
          A pin support allows rotation about any axis but
       prevents movement in the horizontal and vertical
       directions. Its idealized representation and reactions are
       shown in Table 3.1

                        Table 3.1 Reaction Representations

          3.4.2 Roller Support
216 | 3.4 Reactions & Supports
   A roller support allows rotation about any axis and
translation (horizontal movement) in any direction
parallel to the surface on which it rests. It restrains the
structure from movement in a vertical direction. The
idealized representation of a roller and its reaction are
also shown in Table 3.1.

   3.4.3 Rocker Support
   The characteristics of a rocker support are like those
of the roller support. Its idealized form is depicted in
Table 3.1.
   3.4.4 Link
   A link has two hinges, one at each end. It permits
movement in all direction, except in a direction parallel
to its longitudinal axis, which passes through the two
hinges. In other words, the reaction force of a link is in
the direction of the link, along its longitudinal axis.
   3.4.5 Fixed Support
   A fixed support offers a constraint against rotation in
any direction, and it prevents movement in both
horizontal and vertical directions.

   Example 1:

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: Reaction forces and moments (or constraints)
     show how motion is restricted, here that is in 2 dimensions.

        Application: A beam attached to the wall has three ways
     of restricting the motion: horizontal, vertical, and
     rotational.

        Looking Ahead: Every time we model a scenario, we will
     use reaction forces to show what type of motion is being
     restrained. In Chapter 4, we will be able to calculate the
     reaction forces/moments.

3.5 Indeterminate Loads

Determinate Loads

Once you have your equilibrium equations, you can solve them for
unknowns using algebra. The number of unknowns that you will be
able to solve for will be the number of equilibrium equations that
you have. In the x-y-z coordinate frame, there are 3 equations. so
there can be 3 unknowns. These are statically determinate.

   Typically, reaction forces are either as follows: a roller and a
pinned reaction force together (1 reaction force + 2 reaction forces
= 3 restraints) or a fixed beam (2 reaction forces and 1 moment = 3
restraints).

Indeterminate Loads

When you have more unknowns than equations, the problem is
a statically indeterminate problem and you will need additional
information to solve for the given unknowns. You'll learn how to
model and solve for these problems in your Structures course, but
for Statics you need to be able to identify what is determinate and
what is indeterminate.

                                                                3.5 Indeterminate Loads | 223
   Essentially, a problem in statically indeterminate if there are more
unknown variables then there are equations you can use to solve
for the unknowns. This means it cannot be solved using equilibrium
equations alone. You would need to simplify the problem or make
as assumption for it to be solved. You'll look into that more in
Structures, because in real life, we want redundancy. We want to be
sure that structures are strong and one part can fail but that the
whole building doesn't collapse. However, we cannot over-constrain
something so that is breaks because it has no way to expand during
heat or cooling. All of this makes it harder to model, but safer to use.

   Here are examples of statically indeterminate problems:

   Here is a real world example of beams. Notice the breaks between
sections (in the yellow circles) to allow for expansion and
contraction. The top beam in between yellow circles would be an
example of a pin and roller system where one side is pinned and the
other side is a roller allowing for horizontal expansion.

        Basically: When you have more unknowns than
     equations, the problem is a statically indeterminate
     problem

        Application: Most situations are statically indeterminate,
     such as how beams are supported to provide for redundancy;
     thus, we make assumptions to model a problem using
     equilibrium equations.

       N_A=776.13N\\\\\\\underline{N_A=776N}
          6. Review
          It is interesting that NB is larger than NA, because the
       weight of the mother and child combined (80 kg) is
       larger than that of the father (70 kg). However, when you
       sum the moments at point B instead of A, you get the
       same answer. The distance between the reaction forces
       and the nearest forces is important, as well as the
       magnitude of the forces themselves. The distance
       between A and Fc is 1 m, while the distance between B
       and Ff is only 0.5 m.
          Additionally, it makes sense that both NA and NB are
       positive, i.e. are in the positive y direction.

   6. Review
   Notice that for the x-coordinates, the positive x-
direction was taken to the left, and this was consistently
followed in the calculation. It's important to stay
consistent with your chosen direction, as mixing it up
can lead to sign errors.
   This answer makes sense because there is only one
moment acting in the k direction.
   Note: We could have come to the same answer using
the formula M = F*d, which would have been faster.

      M=f\cdot d\\M=7.5lb\cdot
   10in(\frac{1ft}{12in})\\M=7.5lb\cdot
   \frac{5}{6}ft\\\\M=6.25ft\cdot lb
   This answer is slightly more accurate because we
didn't round when converting between inches and feet
(in the original solution, we rounded 0.416667 to 0.42).

             5.5Nm=F\times0.11m
             F=\frac{5.5Nm}{0.11m}\\F =50N

   6. Review
   Because the radius and force values in both instances
have the same magnitude but different directions, the
net moments for left and right turns were expected to
have the same magnitudes and different directions;
thus, the answers make sense.

          1. Problem
                  Josh has two sons; the older one weighs 50

               kg, while the younger one weighs 35 kg. Josh
               wants to
               build a Seesaw (tatter-totter) for his sons in a
               way that both the kids have to apply an equal
               amount
               of force. What is the required ratio of the
               lengths of both arms to achieve this?
               Acceleration due to gravity is 9.81m/s2.

   Knowns:

    · m1 = 35kg
    · m2 = 50kg
    · g = 9.81 m/s2

   Unknown:

    · R1
    · R2
   4. Approach:
   Convert the masses to forces using gravity.
Equate the moments caused by each force.
Solve for the ratio of lengths.
   5. Analysis:
For the children to apply an equal amount of force while
playing on the seesaw, they must create an equal
moment.
Therefore:
   M_1 = M_2
These moments can be rewritten in terms of F and R.
   F_1 \cdot R_1 = F_2 \cdot R_2
The F values can be solved by multiplying the child's

                                                                       3.6 Examples | 257
       mass by gravity to find the force they exert on the
       seesaw.

          (m_1 \cdot g) \cdot R_1 = (m_2 \cdot g) \cdot R_2
       Gravity can be cancelled out as it exists on both sides of
       the equation, leaving:

          m_1 \cdot R_1 = m_2 \cdot R_2
       Putting values into this equation gives:

          35kg \cdot R_1 = 50kg \cdot R_2
       The equation can now be adjusted to solve for R1/R2.

          \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{50kg}{35kg}
       This can be simplified to give the ratio:

          \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{10}{7} \\ R_1 : R_2 = 10 : 7
          6. Review
          It makes sense that the lighter child needs to be
       further away to produce an equal moment to that of the
       heavier child. 10:7 is a reasonable ratio that matches the
       ratio of their weights.

Knowns:

 · Dimensions of the cars and the bridge

Unknowns:

          5. Analysis
          a. Finding the location along the x-axis and the
       magnitude of the resultant force of 3 cars
          Since all 3 cars are identical F_{A}=F_{B}=F_{C}.

          From the fig above
             F_{R1}=1000 N/m \times 1.5 m = 1500 N
             F_{R2} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1.5 m \times 1000 N/m =

          750 N
             F_{A} = 1500 N + 750 N = 2250N
             \bar {x} for resultant force of car A

          From O F_{R1} locates at 1+ \frac{1}{2}(1.5) = 1.75 m
             F_{R2} locates at 1+ 1.5+ \frac{1}{3}(1.5) = 3 m

          now, \bar{x}=\frac{\sum F_{i}x_i}{\sum F_i}

262 | 3.6 Examples
   thus
   \bar{x_{A}}= \frac {(1500 N/m\times 1.75m+(750 N/
m\times 3m)}{(1500N +750N)}

\bar{x_{A}} = 2.17 m from left side.

Also for one car the  \bar{x} of 2250 N force is
2.17m - 1 m = 1.17 m

   Using these calculations, the following figure can be
drawn.

   The total resultant force of all 3 cars is
   F_{R3} = 2250N \times 3 = 6750 N

      \bar{x}=\frac{\sum F_{i}x_i}{\sum F_i}
   therefore,

      \bar{x} = \frac{(2.17 \times 2250)+(6.17\times
   2250)+(10.17\times 2250)}{6750}

      \bar{x} = 6.17 m from left side .

   b. Position and magnitude of the resultant force of the
2 cars on the lane.

      F_{D} = F_{E}=2250 N
   Total force of the 2 cars
   F_{R2} = 2250 \times 2= 4500 N
   Position of the resultant forces from the 2 cars,

                                                                       3.6 Examples | 263
             \bar {x_{2}} = \frac {(4.17 \times 2250) + (9.17 \times
          2250)}{4500}=6.67 m
          6.67 m is from the right side, but from the left side
          \bar{x_{2}} = 13-6.67 = 6.33 m
          c. Position and magnitude of the total resultant force
       on the bridge.
          Total force on bridge due to the 5 cars
          F_{R5} =F_{R2} +F_{R3} = 4500 N + 6750 N = 11250 N

             \bar{x} = \frac{(F_{R2}\times
          \bar{x_{2}})+(F_{R3}\times\bar{x_{3}})}{F_{R5}}

             \bar {x} =\frac{ (6.33 \times 4500)+ (6.17 \times 6750
          )}{11250}= 6.234 m

             \bar {y} for all the cars is half of its width
          therefore,
          \bar{y_{5}} = \frac{(\bar{y_{2}}\times F_{R3}
       )+(\bar{}y_{3}\ times F_{R3})}{F_{R5}}

             \bar{y_{5}} = \frac{(6m \times 4500 N )+(2m \times
          6750 N)}{11250 N}

             \bar{y_{5}} = 3.6 m
             F_{R5} = 11250 N \quad at \quad (6.234m , 3.6 m )
          6. Review
          This problem is less complex because of the symmetry
       of the cars and the bridge. The coordinates of the
       resultant force are just as expected. x is closer to the
       side with more weight (due to the distribution of weight
       of the vehicles), and y is less than halfway across the
       bridge because that side has more vehicles

4.1 External Forces

When we say `forces' in Statics, we are generally talking about
external forces (such as the reaction forces discussed in the
previous chapter) and internal forces (that we will discuss in
Chapters 5 and 6). Generally, external forces include:

· gravitational force (or weight)
· normal force
· frictional force
· spring force
· applied force (such as reaction forces & tension) - this also

   includes applied moments, such as from motors

In science class, you probably learned about the fundamental forces
of nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear
forces. Normal force, friction, spring, and applied forces are all types
of electromagnetic forces. The charged and neutral particles attract
or repel each other. For example, the reason your laptop doesn't
fall through the table is that the electrons in the atoms of the
two objects are repelling each other, and both objects are being
pulled down by another fundamental force: gravitational force. See
this page for more information. The four fundamental forces are
beyond the scope of this Statics class, but it's important to know
the background on how the external forces operate. In this class,
we'll use our understanding of the external forces to learn how to
quantify the forces and calculate the value of other forces.
To calculate each force individually, use the following equations:

· Gravity: Fg = mg
· Normal: Calculated
· Friction: Ff = mN
· Spring: FS = -kx
· Applied: Measured or calculated

                                   4.1 External Forces | 271
          Forces are given many names, such as push, pull,
       thrust, and weight. Traditionally, forces have been
       grouped into several categories and given names
       relating to their source, how they are transmitted, or
       their effects. Several of these categories are discussed in
       this section.

      Normal Force

          Weight (also called the force of gravity) is a pervasive
       force that acts at all times and must be counteracted to
       keep an object from falling. You must support the weight
       of a heavy object by pushing up on it when you hold it
       stationary. But how do inanimate objects like a table
       support the weight of a mass placed on them, such as
       shown in the figure below? When the bag of dog food is
       placed on the table, the table sags slightly under the
       load. This would be noticeable if the load were placed on
       a card table, but even a sturdy oak table deforms when a
       force is applied to it. Unless an object is deformed
       beyond its limit, it will exert a restoring force much like
       a deformed spring (or a trampoline or diving board). The
       greater the deformation, the greater the restoring force.
       Thus, when the load is placed on the table, the table
       sags until the restoring force becomes as large as the
       weight of the load. At this point, the net external force
       on the load is zero. That is the situation when the load is

272 | 4.1 External Forces
stationary on the table. The table sags quickly, and the
sag is slight, so we do not notice it. But it is similar to
the sagging of a trampoline when you climb onto it.

Figure: (a) The person holding the bag of dog food must supply an
upward force F_hand equal in magnitude and opposite in
direction to the weight of the food w so that it doesn't drop to the
ground. (b) The card table sags when the dog food is placed on it,
much like a stiff trampoline. Elastic restoring forces in the table
grow as it sags until they supply a force N equal in magnitude
and opposite in direction to the weight of the load

   We must conclude that whatever supports a load, be
                                                               4.1 External Forces | 273
       it animate or not, must supply an upward force equal to
       the weight of the load, as we assumed in a few of the
       previous examples. If the force supporting the weight of
       an object, or a load, is perpendicular to the surface of
       contact between the load and its support, this force is
       defined as a normal force and here is given by the
       symbol \vec N (This is not the newton unit for force,
       N.) The word normal means perpendicular to a surface.
       This means that the normal force experienced by an
       object resting on a horizontal surface can be expressed
       in vector form as follows:

             \vec N=-m\vec g
          In scalar form, this becomes:

             N=mg
          The normal force can be less than the object's weight
       if the object is on an incline.
          When an object rests on an incline that makes an
       angle  with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting
       on the object is divided into two components: a force
       acting perpendicular to the plane, wy, and a force acting
       parallel to the plane, wx. The normal force \vec Nis
       typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to
       the perpendicular component of the weight wy. The
       force acting parallel to the plane, wx, causes the object
       to accelerate down the incline.

274 | 4.1 External Forces
Figure: An object rests on an incline that makes an angle theta
with the horizontal

   Be careful when resolving the weight of the object
into components. If the incline is at an angle  to the
horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight
components are:

      w_x=w\sin\theta=mg\sin\theta
   and

      w_y=w\cos\theta=mg\cos\theta
   We use the second equation to write the normal force
experienced by an object resting on an inclined plane:

      N=mg\cos\theta
   Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to
be able to determine them from reason. To do this, we
draw the right angle formed by the three weight
vectors. The angle  of the incline is the same as the
angle formed between w and wy. Knowing this property,
we can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of
the weight components:

                                                               4.1 External Forces | 275
             \cos\theta=\frac{w_y}{w},\:w_y=w\cos\theta=mg\
          cos\theta\\\sin\theta=\frac{w_x}{w},\:w_x=w\sin\
          theta=mg\sin\theta

      Tension

          A tension is a force along the length of a medium; in
       particular, it is a pulling force that acts along a stretched
       flexible connector, such as a rope or cable. The word
       "tension" comes from a Latin word meaning "to stretch."
       Not coincidentally, the flexible cords that carry muscle
       forces to other parts of the body are called tendons.

          Any flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain,
       wire, or cable, can only exert a pull parallel to its length;
       thus, a force carried by a flexible connector is a tension
       with a direction parallel to the connector. Tension is a
       pull in a connector. Consider the phrase: "You can't push
       a rope." Instead, tension force pulls outward along the
       two ends of a rope.

          Consider a person holding a mass on a rope. If the
       5.00-kg mass in the figure is stationary, then its
       acceleration is zero and the net force is zero. The only
       external forces acting on the mass are its weight and
       the tension supplied by the rope. Thus,

             F_{net}=T-w=0
          where T and w are the magnitudes of the tension and
       weight, respectively, and their signs indicate direction,
       with up being positive. As we proved using Newton's
       second law, the tension equals the weight of the

276 | 4.1 External Forces
supported mass:
      T=w=mg

   Thus, for a 5.00-kg mass (neglecting the mass of the
rope), we see that

      T=mg=(5.00kg)(9.80m/s^2)=49.0N
   If we cut the rope and insert a spring, the spring
would extend a length corresponding to a force of 49.0
N, providing a direct observation and measure of the
tension force in the rope.

                                                               4.1 External Forces | 277
        When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to
        bend it) such as this rope transmits a force vec T, that force must
        be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. By Newton's third
        law, the rope pulls with equal force but in opposite directions on
        the hand and the supported mass (neglecting the weight of the
        rope). The rope is the medium that carries the equal and opposite
        forces between the two objects. The tension anywhere in the rope

278 | 4.1 External Forces
between the hand and the mass is equal. Once you have
determined the tension in one location, you have determined the
tension at all locations along the rope.

   Flexible connectors are often used to transmit forces
around corners, such as in a hospital traction system, a
tendon, or a bicycle brake cable. If there is no friction,
the tension transmission is undiminished; only its
direction changes, and it is always parallel to the flexible
connector, as shown below:

   If we wish to create a large tension, all we have to do
is exert a force perpendicular to a taut flexible
connector. We can see that the tension in the rope is
related to the force acting perpendicularly in the
following way:

      T=\frac{w}{2\sin\theta}
   We can extend this expression to describe the
tension T created when a perpendicular force (F) is
exerted at the middle of a flexible connector:

      T=\frac{F\perp}{2\sin\theta}
   The angle between the horizontal and the bent
connector is represented by . In this case, T becomes
large as  approaches zero. Even the relatively small
weight of any flexible connector will cause it to sag,
since an infinite tension would result if it were

                                                               4.1 External Forces | 279
       horizontal (i.e., =0 and sin =0). For example, the image
       below shows a situation where we wish to pull a car out
       of the mud when no tow truck is available. Each time the
       car moves forward, the chain is tightened to keep it as
       straight as possible. The tension in the chain is given by

          T=\frac{F\perp}{2\sin\theta} and since  is small, T
       is large. This situation is analogous to the tightrope
       walker, except that the tensions shown here are those
       transmitted to the car and the tree rather than those
       acting at the point where F is applied.

        Figure: We can create a large tension in the chain, and
        potentially a big mess, by pushing on it perpendicular to its
        length, as shown.

      Friction

          Friction is a resistive force opposing motion or its
       tendency. Imagine an object at rest on a horizontal
       surface. The net force acting on the object must be zero,
       leading to equality of the weight and the normal force,
       which act in opposite directions. If the surface is tilted,
       the normal force balances the component of the weight
       perpendicular to the surface. If the object does not slide
       downward, the component of the weight parallel to the
       inclined plane is balanced by friction. Friction is
       discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.

 Spring Force

   A spring is a special medium with a specific atomic
structure that has the ability to restore its shape if
deformed. To restore its shape, a spring exerts a
restoring force that is proportional to and in the
opposite direction in which it is stretched or
compressed. This is the statement of a law known as
Hooke's law, which has the mathematical form

      \vec F=-k\vec x
   The constant of proportionality k is a measure of the
spring's stiffness. The line of action of this force is
parallel to the spring axis, and the sense of the force is
in the opposite direction of the displacement vector.
The displacement must be measured from the relaxed
position; x=0 when the spring is relaxed.

                                                               4.1 External Forces | 281

     Key Takeaways

282 | 4.1 External Forces
· Basically: External forces include: gravitational,
   applied, normal, frictional, and spring.

· Application: Everything. A book on a table, Tigger
   bouncing on his tail, a shooting star, and a soccer ball
   rolling into the goal.

· Looking Ahead: Ch 5 and 6 will look at internal
   forces. Section 4.3 will use the known forces to
   calculate the unknown forces. Section 4.2 will model
   the forces on a diagram.

                                                            4.1 External Forces | 283
4.2 Rigid Body Free Body
Diagrams

Following what we learned in Section 2.2 on particle Free-Body
Diagrams (FBDs), this section will expand on that for rigid bodies.
The biggest difference between a particle and a rigid body FBD
is where the force is applied. In a rigid body FBD, you have to be
precise about pointing the head of the force arrow to the location
where it is applied. For example, if we wanted to make an FBD of you
and me high-fiving, you would apply the force from your hand onto
my hand, not at my center of mass.

   In this section, first we will learn how to do a FBD for a part, then
we will look at how to model a system of multiple objects.

4.2.1 Part FBD

When modelling a single object using an FBD, you are simplifying
a complex problem into specific forces using arrows and an object
floating in space. The floor becomes a normal force arrow and a
frictional force arrow. Pushing or pulling on an object becomes an
applied force with the arrow pointing to or from (pushing or pulling)
the location where the pushing or pulling occurs. Remember the
rules from section 2.2 still apply:

  · Add coordinate frame (which way is positive x and positive y?)
  · Replace surfaces with forces ( floor, hand, and objects touching

      it become arrows)
  · Point forces in the correct direction (the head of the arrow

      points to where the force acts. FG acts down)
  · Use unique (different) names (be sure to name each force with a

284 | 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams
      different name).

Here are some tips to keep in mind about each of the forces:

  · Gravity acts on every particle in an object. Because we don't
      want a million little arrows on the object, we sum the effect of
      gravity at the center of mass. This is also because we generally
      know the total mass of something and where that occurs on an
      object (often at the geometric center), so we concentrate the
      force of gravity at this center of mass.

  · Normal forces always act perpendicular to the surface, so if the
      ground is at an angle, then the normal force acts 90 degrees
      from that angle (perpendicular).

  · Frictional forces act parallel to the plane between the two
      surfaces. This makes it a shear force, which we'll look at in
      Chapter 6.

  · Friction always opposes motion, a fact that will be very
      important in your dynamics class.

  · Spring force is often shown as negative because the force acts
      in the opposite direction of the motion travelled. In
      application, you set the direction of the frictional force to
      match if it is pushing or pulling.

  · Applied forces (and moments), such as distributed loads,
      motors, pushing on an object, tension, etc.

The steps to make an FBD are:

 1. Draw shape
2. Add a coordinate frame
3. Replace forces with arrows
4. Label each force uniquely

To model a book being pushed across the table, you would apply the
following forces at the following locations (see image below)

  · The normal force on the bottom of the book (green arrow)

                                                 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams | 285
  · The frictional force running along the bottom surface between
      the book and the table (yellow arrow)

  · The gravitational force acting at the center of mass (pink
      arrow)

  · any applied force at the point of application, such as your hand
      pushing on the book (blue arrow)

   If instead, the book were being pulled by a string, the image would
be the same, but the applied force and frictional force would change
direction (because friction always opposes motion).

286 | 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams
   A free body diagram is a tool used to solve
engineering mechanics problems. As the name suggests,
the purpose of the diagram is to "free" the body from all
other objects and surfaces around it so that it can be
studied in isolation. We will also draw in any forces or
moments acting on the body, including those forces and
moments exerted by the surrounding bodies and
surfaces that we removed.

   The diagram below shows a ladder supporting a
person and the free body diagram of that ladder. As you
can see, the ladder is separated from all other objects

                                        4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams | 287
       and all forces acting on the ladder are drawn in with key
       dimensions and angles shown.

        A ladder with a man standing on it is shown on the left.
        Assuming friction only at the base, a free body diagram of the
        ladder is shown on the right.

          The first step in solving most mechanics problems will
       be to construct a free-body diagram. This simplified
       diagram will allow us to more easily write out the
       equilibrium equations for statics or strengths of
       materials problems, or the equations of motion for
       dynamics problems.

          To construct the diagram, we will use the following
       process.

           1. First, draw the body being analyzed, separated
                from all other surrounding bodies and surfaces.

288 | 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams
     Pay close attention to the boundary, identifying
     what is part of the body and what is part of the
     surroundings.
2. Second, draw in all external forces and
     moments acting directly on the body. Do not
     include any forces or moments that do not
     directly act on the body being analyzed. Do not
     include any forces that are internal to the body
     being analyzed. Some common types of forces
     seen in mechanics problems are:

         Gravitational Forces: Unless otherwise
             noted, the mass of an object will result in a
             gravitational weight force applied to that
             body. This weight is usually given in pounds
             in the English system, and is modelled as
             9.81 (g) times the mass of the body in
             kilograms for the metric system (resulting in
             a weight in Newtons). This force will always
             point down towards the center of the Earth
             and act on the center of mass of the body.
                                                                          Gravita

                            Normal Forces (or Reaction
                                Forces): Every object in direct contact
                                with the body will exert a normal force
                                on that body, which prevents the two
                                objects from occupying the same
                                space at the same time. Note that only
                                objects in direct contact can exert
                                normal forces on the body.
                                     An object in contact with
                                         another object or surface will
                                         experience a normal force that
                                         is perpendicular (hence normal)
                                         to the surfaces in contact.

                                              Normal forces always act
                                              perpendicular to the surfaces in
                                              contact. The barrel in the hand truck
                                              shown on the left has a normal force
                                              at each contact point.

                                     Joints or connections between
                                         bodies can also cause reaction
                                         forces or moments, and we will
                                         have one force or moment for
                                         each type of motion or rotation

290 | 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams
             the connection prevents.

              The roller on the left allows for
              rotation and movement along the
              surface, but a normal force in the y
              direction prevents motion vertically.
              The pin joint in the center allows for
              rotation, but normal forces in the x
              and y directions prevent motion in all
              directions. The fixed connection on
              the right has a normal force
              preventing motion in all directions
              and a reaction moment preventing
              rotation.

 Friction Forces: Objects in direct
    contact with the body can also exert
    friction forces on the body, which will
    resist the two bodies sliding against
    one another. These forces will always
    be perpendicular to the surfaces in
    contact. Friction is the subject of an
    entire chapter in this book, but for
    simple scenarios, we usually assume

                  4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams | 291
                                rough or smooth surfaces.
                                     For smooth surfaces, we
                                         assume that there is no friction
                                         force.
                                     For rough surfaces, we
                                         assume that the bodies will not
                                         slide relative to one another, no
                                         matter what. In this case, the
                                         friction force is always just large
                                         enough to prevent this sliding.

                                              For a smooth surface, we assume only
                                              a normal force perpendicular to the
                                              surface. For a rough surface, we
                                              assume normal and friction forces are
                                              present.

                            Tension in Cables: Cables, wires or
                                ropes attached to the body will exert a
                                tension force on the body in the
                                direction of the cable. These forces
                                will always pull on the body, as ropes,
                                cables and other flexible tethers

292 | 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams
                         cannot be used for pushing.

                            The tension force in cables always acts along
                            the direction of the cable and will always be
                            a pulling force.

                     The above forces are the most
                         common, but other forces such as
                         pressure from fluids, spring forces and
                         magnetic forces may exist and may act
                         on the body.

   3. Once the forces are identified and added to the
        free body diagram, the last step is to label any key
        dimensions and angles on the diagram.

4.2.2 System FBD

A system free-body diagram is composed of multiple parts, so you
can have multiple `levels' to consider: the system level with all
objects on the same FBD, and a part FBD for each individual part.
This is especially helpful if you have more unknowns than equations
when using the equilibrium equations, so you can find more
information by splitting the system up into individual parts.

   For the system FBD, you look at the parts combined together
and add only the external forces (gravity, applied, normal, frictional,
spring). When you look at each part separately, you now have to
include the interaction between the objects, replacing a part with
forces (generally 2 forces: vertical and horizontal forces).

   For example, if there are 2 books stacked on top of each other, you
now need 3 FBDs:

 1. a system-level FBD with both books,
2. a part FBD for the bottom book, with the top book replaced by

      arrows (forces)
3. a part FBD for the top boo,k with the bottom book replaced by

      arrows (forces)

294 | 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams
  To make a system FBD:

1. Draw system FBD using unique consistent labels (ie, a letter or
     number per part)

       The system should be floating in space with no surface
           (such as the floor)

       Include a coordinate frame
       Use only external forces on the system FBD (gravity,

           applied, normal, frictional, spring).
       DO NOT include internal forces
       It is especially important to use unique labels, so the top

           book forces are labelled 1, and the bottom book forces are
           labelled 2 (or T for top and B for bottom, or A and B).

2. Draw a FBD for each part separately & coordinate frame with
     equal and opposite arrows for internal system forces

       The part should be floating in space with no surfaces or

                                                4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams | 295
            other objects
        Include a coordinate frame (yes, again! This is to ensure

            you didn't rotate the object).
        Copy the external forces onto the part FBD from the

            system FBD with the identical labels and arrow directions
        Now add internal forces, replacing the other object with

            force arrows (red arrows)
        When you draw the second part FBD, follow the above

            bullets for the second object (with label 2 instead of 1,
            copying the system-level external force labels). Note,
            though, that you use the same labels for the internal forces
            from the first part FBD, but the direction is reversed (left
            becomes right and up becomes down). Following Newton's
            laws, the objects exert equal and opposite forces on each
            other, and should cancel out at the system level, so they
            have the same label (magnitude) and opposite directions.

Some tips:

  · Differentiate one object from the other through the labels,
      using either a letter or a number for each part. These same
      labels go on the system-level FBD (except for the internal
      labels).

  · Use the same labels between the part and system FBDs for
      external forces. Don't change the label - that will make the
      equations impossible to solve and look like you have more
      unknowns.

  · Use the same unique labels between the internal forces for the
      part FBDs, but in the opposite direction.

  · If you know the location of the center of mass, you could
      combine the gravitational forces into 1 system level
      gravitational force. You could also model the gravitational
      force as one force per part acting at the center of mass for
      each object. This is a better method if you have to separate the
      objects to do the calculations.

     Key Takeaways

        Basically, A part free-body diagrams (FBDs) give you a
     way to model complicated problems in a simple way with
     arrows. Systems FBDs allow you to combine objects and
     analyze them separately.

        Application: A bat swinging could be modelled as a part
                                                 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams | 301
     FBD with gravity and multiple applied forces (hands on one
     end and the ball on the other). You could model the
     moment the bat and ball are touching using a system FBD.

        Looking ahead: You'll use an FBD in every step 2 in nearly
     every homework problem. These are especially helpful with
     Equilibrium Equations in the next section.

302 | 4.2 Rigid Body Free Body Diagrams
4.3 Rigid Body Equilibrium
Equations

We use the equilibrium equations to calculate any unknown forces
& moments using the known forces and values, and the following
equations:

   The particle equilibrium equations were covered in section 2.3.
These are:

      \Sigma F_{x}=0, \Sigma F_{y}=0, \Sigma F_{z}=0
   Now, for a rigid body where forces are analyzed at different points
on a body, we can take moments into account. There are 3 equations
for 2d and 4 equations for 3d:
   Rigid Body-Two Dimensions

      \Sigma F_{x}=0, \Sigma F_{y}=0, \Sigma M_{O}=0
   Rigid Body-Three Dimensions

      \begin{gathered} \Sigma F_{x}=0, \Sigma F_{y}=0, \Sigma
   F_{z}=0 \\ \Sigma M_{x^{\prime}}=0, \Sigma M_{y^{\prime}}=0,
   \Sigma M_{z^{\prime}}=0 \end{gathered}
   Because these are static bodies, the right side of the equations
equals 0. In dynamics, they will equal the mass times the
acceleration for translation and rotation.

          For a rigid body in static equilibrium, that is, a non-
       deformable body where forces are not concurrent, the
       sum of both the forces and the moments acting on the
       body must be equal to zero. The addition of moments
       (as opposed to particles, where we only looked at the
       forces) adds another set of possible equilibrium

                                             4.3 Rigid Body Equilibrium Equations | 303
       equations, allowing us to solve for more unknowns as
       compared to particle problems.

          Moments, like forces, are vectors. This means that our
       vector equation needs to be broken down into scalar
       components before we can solve the equilibrium
       equations. In a two-dimensional problem, the body can
       only have clockwise or counterclockwise rotation
       (corresponding to rotations about the z-axis). This
       means that a rigid body in a two-dimensional problem
       has three possible equilibrium equations; that is, the
       sum of force components in the x and y directions, and
       the moments about the z axis. The sum of each of these
       will be equal to zero.

          For a two-dimensional problem, we break our one
       vector force equation into two scalar component
       equations.

                   \sum\vec F=0\\\sum F_x=0\:\sum F_y=0

          The one moment vector equation becomes a single
       moment scalar equation.

                            \sum\vec M=0\\\sum M_z=0

          If we look at a three-dimensional problem, we will
       increase the number of possible equilibrium equations
       to six. There are three equilibrium equations for force,
       where the sum of the components in the x, y, and z
       directions must be equal to zero. The body may also
       have moments about each of the three axes. The second
       set of three equilibrium equations states that the sum of
       the moment components about the x, y, and z axes must
       also be equal to zero.

304 | 4.3 Rigid Body Equilibrium Equations
   We break the forces into three component equations
       \sum\vec F=0\\\sum F_x=0\:\sum F_y=0\:\sum
                                      F_z=0

   We break the moments into three component
equations

                \sum\vec M=0\\\sum M_x=0\:\sum
                           M_y=0\:\sum M_z=0

 Finding the Equilibrium Equations:

   As with particles, the first step in finding the
equilibrium equations is to draw a free-body diagram of
the body being analyzed. This diagram should show all
the force vectors acting on the body. In the free body
diagram, provide values for any of the known
magnitudes, directions, and points of application for the
force vectors and provide variable names for any
unknowns (either magnitudes, directions, or distances).

   Next, you will need to choose the x, y, and z axes.
These axes do need to be perpendicular to one another,
but they do not necessarily have to be horizontal or
vertical. If you choose coordinate axes that line up with
some of your force vectors, you will simplify later
analysis.

   Once you have chosen axes, you need to break down
all of the force vectors into components along the x, y
and z directions. Your first equation will be the sum of
the magnitudes of the components in the x direction

                                     4.3 Rigid Body Equilibrium Equations | 305
       being equal to zero, the second equation will be the sum
       of the magnitudes of the components in the y direction
       being equal to zero, and the third (if you have a 3D
       problem) will be the sum of the magnitudes in the z
       direction being equal to zero.

          Next, you will need to come up with the moment
       equations. To do this, you will need to choose a point to
       take the moments about. Any point should work, but it
       is usually advantageous to choose a point that will
       decrease the number of unknowns in the equation.
       Remember that any force vector that travels through a
       given point will exert no moment about that point. To
       write out the moment equations, simply sum the
       moments exerted by each force (adding in pure
       moments shown in the diagram) about the given point
       and the given axis (x, y, or z) and set that sum equal to
       zero. All moments will be about the z-axis for two-
       dimensional problems, though moments can be about x,
       y and z axes for three-dimensional problems.

          Once you have your equilibrium equations, you can
       solve these equations for the unknowns. The number of
       unknowns that you will be able to solve for will again be
       the number of equations that you have.

down on the beam must be balanced by the reaction forces pushing
up. The two reaction forces are equivalent because the forces on
top are balanced evenly between the reaction forces. If they are at

4.4 Friction and Impending
Motion

Dry Friction

          Dry friction is the force that opposes one solid
       surface sliding across another solid surface. Dry friction
       always opposes the surfaces sliding relative to one
       another and can have the effect of either opposing
       motion or causing motion in bodies.

          The most commonly used model for dry friction
       is coulomb friction. This type of friction can further be
       broken down into static friction and kinetic friction.
       These two types of friction are illustrated in the diagram
       below. First imagine a box sitting on a surface. A pushing
       force is applied parallel to the surface and is constantly
       being increased. A gravitational force, a normal force,
       and a frictional force are also acting on the box.

                                                 4.4 Friction and Impending Motion | 313
        As the pushing force increases, the static friction force will be
        equal in magnitude and opposite in direction until the point of
        impending motion. Beyond this point, the box will begin to slip as
        the pushing force is greater in magnitude than the kinetic
        friction force opposing motion.

          Static friction occurs prior to the box slipping and
       moving. In this region, the friction force will be equal in
       magnitude and opposite in direction to the pushing
       force itself. As the magnitude of the pushing force
       increases, so does the magnitude of the friction force.

          If the magnitude of the pushing force continues to
       rise, eventually the box will begin to slip. As the box
       begins to slip, the type of friction opposing the motion
       of the box changes from static friction to what is called
       kinetic friction. The point just before the box slips is
       known as impending motion. This can also be thought
       of as the maximum static friction force before slipping.
       The magnitude of the maximum static friction force is
       equal to the static coefficient of friction times the

314 | 4.4 Friction and Impending Motion
       normal force existing between the box and the surface.
       This coefficient of friction is a property that depends on
       both materials and can usually be looked up in tables.

          Kinetic friction occurs beyond the point of
       impending motion when the box is sliding. With kinetic
       friction, the magnitude of the friction force opposing
       motion will be equal to the kinetic coefficient of friction
       times the normal force between the box and the
       surface. The kinetic coefficient of friction also depends
       upon the two materials in contact, but will almost
       always be less than the static coefficient of friction.

Slipping vs. Tipping

          Imagine a box sitting on a rough surface as shown in
       the figure below. Now, imagine that we start pushing on
       the side of the box. Initially, the friction force will resist
       the pushing force, and the box will sit still. As we
       increase the force pushing the box, however, one of two
       things will occur.

           1. The pushing force will exceed the maximum

                                                 4.4 Friction and Impending Motion | 315
                static friction force, and the box will begin to slide
                across the surface (slipping).
          2. Or, the pushing force and the friction force will
                create a strong enough couple that the box will
                rotate and fall on its side (tipping).

        As the pushing force increases on the box, it will either begin to
        slide along the surface (slipping) or it will begin to rotate
        (tipping).

          When we look at cases where either slipping or
       tipping may occur, we are usually interested in finding
       which of the two options will occur first. To determine
       this, we usually determine both the pushing force
       necessary to make the body move and the pushing force
       necessary to make the body tip over. Whichever option
       requires less force is the option that will occur first.

316 | 4.4 Friction and Impending Motion
   Determining the Force Required to Make an Object
"Slip":

   A body will slide across a surface if the pushing force
exceeds the maximum static friction force that can exist
between the two surfaces in contact. As in all dry
friction problems, this limit to the friction force is equal
to the static coefficient of friction times the normal
force between the body. If the pushing force exceeds
this value, then the body will slip.

If the pushing force exceeds the maximum static friction force (
* F) then the body will begin to slide.

   Determining the Force Required to Make an Object
"Tip":

   The normal forces supporting bodies are distributed
forces. These forces will not only prevent the body from
accelerating into the ground due to gravitational forces,
but they can also redistribute themselves to prevent a
body from rotating when forces cause a moment to act

                                         4.4 Friction and Impending Motion | 317
       on the body. This redistribution will result in the
       equivalent point load for the normal force shifting to
       one side or the other. A body will tip over when the
       normal force can no longer redistribute itself any
       further to resist the moment exerted by other forces
       (such as the pushing force and the friction force).

        At rest (A), the normal force is a uniformly distributed force on
        the bottom of the body. As a pushing force is applied (B), the
        distributed normal force is redistributed, moving the equivalent
        point load to the right. This creates a couple between the gravity
        force and the normal force that will counter the couple exerted by
        the pushing force and the friction force. If the pushing force
        becomes large enough (C), the couple exerted by the gravitational
        force and the normal force will be unable to counter the couple
        exerted by the pushing force and the friction force.

          The easiest way to think about the shifting normal
       force and tipping is to imagine the equivalent point load
       of the distributed normal force. As we push or pull on
       the body, the normal force will shift to the left or right.
       This normal force and the gravitational force create a
       couple that exerts a moment. This moment will be

318 | 4.4 Friction and Impending Motion
countering the moment exerted by the couple formed
by the pushing force and the friction force.

   Because the normal force is the direct result of
physical contact, we cannot shift the normal force
beyond the surfaces in contact (aka. the edge of the
box). If countering the moment exerted by the pushing
force and the friction force requires shifting the normal
force beyond the edge of the box, then the normal force
and the gravity force will not be able to counter the
moment, and as a result, the box will begin to rotate (aka
tip over).

The body will tip when the moment exerted by the pushing and
friction forces exceeds the moment exerted by the gravity and
normal forces. For an impending motion, the normal force will be
acting at the very edge of the body.

Example 5: Slipping vs Tipping

Explanation: If it's tipping, all of the normal force will be at the
corner. If it starts slipping, it must overcome the static frictional
force. Comparing the pushing force needed to tip or slip, the
pushing force is lower to cause tipping occurs than the pushing
force to cause slipping, there fore it will tip first.

          The box shown below is pushed as shown. If we keep
       increasing the pushing force, will the box first begin to
       slide or will it tip over?

Key Takeaways

   Basically, Friction always opposes motion. The coefficient
of static friction is always higher than the coefficient of
kinetic friction.

        Application: Slipping and tipping are interesting cases,
     looking at friction. Depending on the mass, the height of
     the applied force, and the frictional surface, you can
     calculate whether the object will tip or slip first.

        Looking Ahead: This will become important in Dynamics.

   6. Review
   FN, Fg, and the y component of FA are the only forces
in the y direction so it makes sense that they need to
equal zero for the equilibrium equations. FN is the only
positive force in the y direction, so it makes sense that it
equals the magnitude of the other two put together.
   The coefficient found between the box and the floor is
reasonable as it is less than 1, and it's reasonable for a

       box on the floor. For example, if the box was wood and
       the floor was wood, the coefficient of static friction

             \underline{F_f=-62.158N}
          Because the frictional force is negative, that means
       the frictional force actually acts in the opposite
       direction, so the friction is keeping the ball from going
       up the plane.
          6. Review
          The units of Ff are newtons, which makes sense
       because it is a force. It also makes sense that FAx is
       larger than FGx and FBx.

Calculating N

          Finding µ

          Comparing µ and µs
          1.019> 0.72

          Thus, the trailer is is in motion, i.e. sliding along the
       surface.
          6. Review
          From initial inspection of the FBD, it is clear that w
       (acting downwards) is opposite to the normal forces
       (acting upwards). The sum of the normal forces would
       not exceed w.
          FF should be equal and opposite to P.

          Because mass is given force by gravity,
          F_{g }= m\times g=19,620 N
          Since the tension applied by Spider-Man is a force
       with both x and y components, we would need angle
          \theta

             \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{h_c - h_s}{20} \right)
          = 22.3^\circ
          Analyzing the force diagram:

358 | 4.5 Examples
   Looking at the force diagram for the shipping
container, it is understood that if the container were to
tip towards Spiderman, the sum of moments on point B
would equal zero. It is noticeable that among the forces
on the container( frictional force, normal force, force of
gravity, and tension) only force of gravity and x

                                                                       4.5 Examples | 359
       component of tension contribute to the moment at
       point B. Therefore, the following equation for the
       moment at B is derived.

             M_{B} =\: -h_{c}\times T_{x}+\frac{w}{2}\times
          F_{g} \:=0\\ \kern 1pc =10m \times
          T_{x}+\frac{2.5}{2}\times 19,620 N
          thus, T_{x} = 2,452.5 N
          Also

             T_{x} = T\cos{\theta}
             \lvert T\rvert = \frac{T_{x}}{\cos{\theta}}=2,651 N
          The required tension to tip the container is 2,651 N
          6. Review
          We can ensure that the container will tip, not slip, by
       examining the role of frictional force in the net force. If
       the maximum frictional force is greater than the pulling
       force, the container would tip. To verify this, we analyze
       the below given force diagram to find the frictional
       force.

360 | 4.5 Examples
   \begin{aligned} F_y &amp;= -T_y + F_n - F_g \\ 0
&amp;= -T \sin{\theta} + F_n - F_g \\ 0 &amp;= -2651
\cdot \sin{22.3^\circ} + F_n - 19620 \\ F_n &amp;=
20626\,N \end{aligned}
now F_{f}=\mu \times F_{n} \\ F_{f} = 4,125 N
Because Ff > Tx, the container will tip.

                                                                    4.5 Examples | 361

          Knowns:
            · m= 70 kg
            · P = 300N
            ·  = 30°

            · Fg
            · FF
          4. Approach
            · Find Fg by using Fg = mg.

364 | 4.5 Examples
    · Apply the equilibrium equation to figure out the
        rest of the forces.

   5. Analysis
   Finding Fg

      F_{g} = m \cdot g = 70 kg \cdot 9.81m/s^2 = 686.7 N
   Forces in x and y components
   Since P, FF, and N are in the direction of either x or y,
only Fg has x and y components.

      F_{gx} =686.7\cdot \sin{30}
      F_{gx} =343.35N
   Equilibrium equation in the x-axis
   Fx = 300N - FF- 686.7N sin(30°) = 0
   FF=-43.35N
   Since this value is negative, it just means that the
drawing has the force of friction acting in the opposite
direction.
   6. Review
   The answer obtained makes sense as the force of
friction should be small and be working against the cart
sliding down the incline. The force of gravity in the x
component is only slightly larger than that of the person
pulling the cart so the force of friction being only
43.35N makes sense.

                                                                       4.5 Examples | 365

friction, Submitted by Liam Murdock

          1. Problem

                  You are developing an accessible gaming
               platform for a charity to allow everyone to
               play their favourite games.

               The platform can be simplified for the
               calculations into a box 0.8 m long and 0.15m
               high. The platform has a mass of 4 kg and
               rests on the two thighs of a person, each
               0.2m wide and each 0.1 m away from the
               edges of the platform. Say the charity would
               want to make sure that a force of 10 N (from
               any of the top corners of the platform, going
               parallel to the surface) will not push it over.
               Make proper assumptions if needed and

          4. Approach:
          Define an origin point to measure all forces from to
       simplify the problem.
       Determine D1 and the coordinates of all forces measured
       from the origin O.
       Find Fg.
       Use the sum of moments around A to find NB.
       Use the sum of forces in the Y direction to find NA.
       Use the sum of forces in the X direction to find .
          5. Analysis:
       Defining the origin as the bottom left corner of the
       gaming platform:
          N_A\ is\ measured\ D_3 + \frac{1}{2} D_2\ from\
       the\ origin. \\ N_B\ is\ measured\ D_3 + D_2 + D_1
       + \frac{1}{2} D_2 \ from\ the\ origin. \\ F_g\ is\
       measured\ D_3 + D_2 + \frac{1}{2} D_1 \ from\ the\
       origin.
       To find D1:

368 | 4.5 Examples
   L = 2D_3 + 2D_2 + D_1 \\ D_1 = L - 2D_3 - 2D_2 \\
D_1 = 0.8m - 2 \cdot 0.1m - 2 \cdot 0.2m \\ D_1 =
0.2m
To find Fg:

   F_g = mg = 4kg \cdot 9.81 m/s^2 = 39.24N
The coordinates of these forces can now be shown as:

   N_A\ is\ at\ [0.2, 0]m \\ N_B\ is\ at\ [0.6, 0]m \\
F_g\ is\ at\ [0.4, 0]m \\ F_A\ is\ at\ [0, 0.15]m

   The sum of moments around point A can now be done
to find NB. The distance between each force and point A
is the difference between their coordinates.

   \sum M_A = 0 = -F_g \cdot (0.4m - 0.2m) + N_B
\cdot (0.6m - 0.2m) - F_A (0.15m - 0m) \\ N_B =
\frac{F_g \cdot 0.2m + F_A \cdot 0.15m}{0.4m} \\
N_B = \frac{39.24N \cdot 0.2m + 10N \cdot
0.15m}{0.4m} \\ N_B = 23.37 N
The Sum of forces in the Y direction can be used to find
NA now:

   \sum F_y = 0 = -F_g + N_A + N_B \\ N_A = F_g -
N_B = 39.24N - 23.37N \\ N_A = 15.87N
Before the sum of forces in the X is done, it must be
noted that Ffa and Ffb are equivalent to NA and NB,
respectively.

   \sum F_x = 0 = F_A - F_{fa} - F_{f b} = F_A - \mu
\cdot N_A - \mu \cdot N_B \\ -F_A = -\mu \cdot
N_A - \mu \cdot N_B \\ \frac{-F_A}{\mu} = -N_A -
N_B \\ \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{-N_A - N_B}{-F_A} \\
\mu = \frac{-F_A}{-N_A - N_B} \\ \mu =
\frac{-10N}{-15.87N - 23.37N} \\ \mu = 0.25

   6. Review:

                                                                       4.5 Examples | 369
          To review this solution, the value for NA can be solved
       for by taking the moment around point B.

          \sum M_B = 0 = F_g \cdot (0.6m - 0.4m) - N_A \cdot
       (0.6m - 0.2m) - F_A \cdot (0.15m) \\ N_A = \frac{(F_g
       \cdot 0.2m ) - (F_A \cdot 0.15m)}{0.4m} \\ N_A =
       \frac{(39.24N \cdot 0.2m) - (10N \cdot
       0.15)}{0.15m}{0.4m} \\ N_A = 15.87N
       The value found is the same value originally found,
       providing evidence that there was no error in the
       calculation.

Trusses are rigid structures made up of two-force members, which
are objects with exactly two forces/connections. Trusses are
commonly found in the frame of a roof and the sides of a bridge:

You'll analyze these structures more in your Structures course, but
for Statics, you will need to know how to calculate the force in each
member, using the method of joints and the method of sections. The
method of joints is more like a particle analysis, wherein you use
only x and y equilibrium equations. The method of sections is more
like a rigid body analysis, where you can also include the moment
equilibrium equation. Those are in the next sections.

5.1.1 Two Force Members

Before we discuss the structure of trusses, we must begin by
defining two force members:

          A two-force member is a body that has forces (and

374 | 5.1 Trusses Introduction
only forces, no moments) acting on it in only two
locations. In order to have a two-force member in static
equilibrium, the net force at each location must be
equal, opposite, and collinear. This will result in both
force members being in either tension or compression
as shown in the diagram below.

The forces acting on two force members need to be equal,
opposite, and collinear for the body to be in equilibrium.

   Imagine a beam where forces are only exerted at each
end of the beam (a two-force member). The body has
some non-zero force acting at one end of the beam,
which we can draw as a force vector. If this body is in
equilibrium, then we know two things: 1) the sum of the
forces must be equal to zero, and 2) the sum of the
moments must be equal to zero.

   In order to have the sum of the forces equal to zero,
the force vector on the other side of the beam must be
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This is the
only way to ensure that the sum of the forces is equal to
zero with only two forces.

                                                       5.1 Trusses Introduction | 375
          In order to have the sum of the moments equal to
       zero, the forces must be collinear. If the forces were not
       collinear, then the two equal and opposite forces would
       form a couple. This couple would exert a moment on the
       beam when there are no other moments to counteract
       the couple. Because the moment exerted by the two
       forces must be equal to zero, the perpendicular distance
       between the forces (d) must be equal to zero. The only
       way to achieve this is to have the forces be collinear.

        In order to have the sum of the moments be equal to zero, the
        forces acting on two force members must always be collinear,
        acting along the line connecting the two points where forces are
        applied.

376 | 5.1 Trusses Introduction
5.1.2 Trusses

A truss is an

engineering structure

that is made entirely

of two force members. In

addition, statically

determinate trusses

(trusses that can be

analyzed completely       Adapted from image by
using the equilibrium     ToddC4176 CC-BY-SA 3.0

equations), must

be independently rigid. This means that if the truss was

separated from its connection points, no one part would

be able to move independently with respect to the rest

of the truss.

   When we talk about analyzing a truss, we are usually
looking to identify not only the external forces acting on
the truss structure, but also the forces acting on each
member internally in the truss. Because each member of
the truss is a two-force member, we simply need to
identify the magnitude of the force on each member and
determine if each member is in tension or compression.

   To determine these unknowns, we have two methods
available: the method of joints and the method of
sections. Both will give the same results, but each
through a different process.

   The method of joints focuses on the joints, or the
connection points where the members come together.
We assume we have a pin at each of these points that we

                          5.1 Trusses Introduction | 377
       model as a particle, we draw out the free body diagram
       for each pin, and then write out the equilibrium
       equations for each pin. This will result in a large number
       of equilibrium equations that we can use to solve for a
       large number of unknown forces.

          The method of sections involves pretending to split
       the truss into two or more different sections and then
       analyzing each section as a separate rigid body in
       equilibrium. In this method, we determine the
       appropriate sections, draw free-body diagrams for each
       section, and then write out the equilibrium equations
       for each section.

          The method of joints is usually the easiest and fastest
       method for solving for all the unknown forces in a truss.
       The method of sections, on the other hand, is better
       suited to targeting and solving for the forces in just a
       few members without having to solve for all the
       unknowns. In addition, these methods can be combined
       if needed to best suit the goals of the problem solver.

5.1.3 Parts of a Truss

A truss is composed of:
  · joints
  · members, and
  · external forces (reaction forces and applied forces).
   The joints are often labelled with a letter and are where the

external forces and members connect.

Here is an example of just the joints without the members:

        forces supporting the truss structure.

       https://mechanicsmap.psu.edu/websites/

The members are the metal or wooden beams that are labelled with

                                                                5.1 Trusses Introduction | 381
the connection between joints. For example member AB connects
joints A and B.

   The external forces are the reaction forces and the applied forces.
The applied forces come from the load distributed across the bridge
or from the roof.

   The applied force/load from trucks and cars goes from the deck
to the stringers, across the beams, to the joints of the truss, where
it is carried as applied (external) forces on the edges of the bridge.

5.1.4 Tension & Compression

The two-force members carry internal forces in either tension or
compression between the joints. One standard sign convention is to
assume all members are in tension, labelled as positive (+), then any
negative number (-) means the member is in compression.

Source: https://www.flickr.com/photos/121935927@N06/13580545445
Following Newton's 3rd law regarding equal and opposite reactions,
when there is tension in a member, there is also tension in a joint.
Pulling on the member (tension) in turn pulls on the joint. Similarly,
pushing on a member (compression) pushes on the joint as well.

                                                                5.1 Trusses Introduction | 387
   Similarly, the force from member AB (Fab) is distributed from
joint a through member ab to joint b. Shown here in compression,
Fab is negative. The magnitude of Fab on joint a is the same as
the magnitude on joint b, even though they are pointing in two
different directions (hence equal and opposite). Member bc will
have a different magnitude.

   When you look at each joint, compression (-) appears to be
pushing on the joint while tension (+) is pulling on it with the force
named for the member ( Fab ).

388 | 5.1 Trusses Introduction
   In the next section, we will discuss each of these methods in
greater detail and how to solve problems using them.

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: A truss is a rigid structure composed of two
     force members (where forces are applied at only two
     locations) that connect at joints and have external forces
     applied. The internal forces of the truss put members in

     and metal bridges.

     trusses more in your Structures course.

5.2 Method of Joints

The method of joints is a form of particle analysis. After solving for
the reaction forces, you solve for the unknown forces at each joint
until you have found the value of each member. You start with your
model:

   Convert the constraints into reaction forces with the appropriate
labels:

                                                                      5.2 Method of Joints | 391
   Now solve for the reaction forces (Rax Ray Re) looking only at the
external forces using the equilibrium equations for a rigid body:

                     \sum F_x=0\\\sum F_y=0\\\sum M=0
   Assuming the length of each member is L:

                \sum F_x=R_{ax} = 0, \\\underline{R_{ax} = 0}

\sum F_y=R_{ay}+R_e - F_g - F_f= 0, \\R_{ay} +R_e = 150 lb

\sum M_a= -L*F_g - 2L * F_f+3L*R_e = 0\\R_e = \frac{100L +
                 100L}{3L}\\\underline{R_e =66.7 lb}

R_{ay} = 150 lb - 66.7 lb\\ \underline{ R_{ay}= 83.3 lb }

   Next, pick a joint where there are 2 or fewer unknown values,
such as a or e. This is because you only have 2 equations available
to find the unknowns: \sum F_x=0 \text{, } \sum F_y=0. The
following table shows the number of known and unknown forces at
each joint.

Joint:                      ab c de f g

Known                       20001 1 1
forces:

Unknown forces: 2 3 4 3 2 4 4

Choosing joint a (or e), do a particle analysis, assuming all of the
members are in tension. That way, if the force is negative, that
means it is in compression. Notice Rax has been excluded because it
is equal to zero.

392 | 5.2 Method of Joints
           \sum F_y=0\\R_{ay}+F_{ab}sin(60^\circ) = 0\\F_{ab}=-
         \frac{R_{ay}}{sin(60^\circ)}=-\frac{83.3 \text{ lb}}{ 0.866}
       \\\underline{F_{ab} = - 96.2 \text{ lb}} \text{(compression)}

         \sum F_x=0\\F_{ag} + F_{ab}cos(60^\circ) = 0 \\F_{ag} =-
              F_{ab}cos(60^\circ) = - (-96.2 \text{ lb}) * (0.5) \\
             \underline{F_{ag} = + 48.1 \text{ lb}} \text{(tension)}

   Next, move to joint b because you now only have 2 unknowns at
joint b (Fbc and Fbg).

   Keep analyzing joints until you've calculated the load in all
members:

Member      ab bc cd de ef fg ag bg cg cf df

Force (lb)  96.2 96.2 77.0 77.0 38.5 86.6 48.1 96.2 19.3 19.3 77.0

Tension or Compression C C C C T T T T T C T

            5.2 Method of Joints | 393
And that's it! If you don't specify compression or tension, you should
use positive and negative to denote tension and compression,
respectively.

   Here is a second explanation on how to solve using the method of
joints:

          The method of joints is a process used to solve for the
       unknown forces acting on members of a truss. The
       method centers on the joints or connection points
       between the members, and it is usually the fastest and
       easiest way to solve for all the unknown forces in a truss
       structure.

      Using This Method:

          The process used in the method of joints is outlined
       below:

           1. In the beginning, it is usually useful to label the
                members and the joints in your truss. This will
                help you keep everything organized and
                consistent in later analysis. In this book, the
                members will be labelled with letters, and the
                joints will be labelled with numbers.

394 | 5.2 Method of Joints
     The first step in the method of joints is to label each joint
     and each member.

2. Treating the entire truss structure as a rigid
     body, draw a free body diagram, write out the
     equilibrium equations, and solve for the external
     reacting forces acting on the truss structure. This
     analysis should not differ from the analysis of a
     single rigid body.

     Treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for the
     reaction forces supporting the truss structure.

                                                         5.2 Method of Joints | 395
          3. Assume there is a pin or some other small
                amount of material at each of the connection
                points between the members. Next, you will draw
                a free-body diagram for each connection point.
                Remember to include:
                    Any external reaction or load forces that
                        may be acting at that joint.
                    A normal force for each of the two force
                        members connected to that joint. Remember
                        that for a two-force member, the force will
                        be acting along the line between the two
                        connection points on the member. We will
                        also need to guess if it will be a tensile or a
                        compressive force. An incorrect guess now,
                        though, will simply lead to a negative
                        solution later on. A common strategy then is
                        to assume all forces are tensile, then later in
                        the solution, any positive forces will be
                        tensile forces, and any negative forces will
                        be compressive forces.
                    Label each force in the diagram. Include
                        any known magnitudes and directions, and
                        provide variable names for each unknown.

396 | 5.2 Method of Joints
               Drawing a free body diagram of each joint, we
               draw in the known forces as well as tensile forces
               from each two force member.

4. Write out the equilibrium equations for each of
     the joints. You should treat the joints as particles,
     so there will be force equations but no moment
     equations. This should give you a large number of
     equations.

          The sum of the forces in the x direction
             will be zero, and the sum of the forces in the
             y direction will be zero for each of the joints.
                \sum\vec F=0\\\sum F_x=0\:\sum
             F_y=0

5. Finally, solve the equilibrium equations for the
     unknowns. You can do this algebraically, solving
     for one variable at a time, or you can use matrix
     equations to solve for everything at once. If you
     assumed that all forces were tensile earlier,
     remember that negative answers indicate
     compressive forces in the members.

Key Takeaways

   Basically: Method of joints is an analysis technique to find
the forces in the members of a truss. It looks at each joint
individually using the particle equilibrium equations.

   Application: To calculate the loads on bridges and roofs,
especially if you need to know all of the values of the
members.

                                                                5.2 Method of Joints | 403
        Looking Ahead: The next section explores a method to
     solve for one or two members of a truss (instead of finding
     all of them).

404 | 5.2 Method of Joints
5.3 Method of Sections

The method of sections uses rigid body analysis to solve for a specific
member or two. Instead of looking at each joint, you make a cut
through the truss, turning the members along that line into internal
forces (assume in tension). Then you solve the rigid body using
the equilibrium equations for a rigid body:
\sum F_x=0\;\sum F_y=0\;\sum M_z=0

   The truss:

is split into two to solve for FE.

                                                                 5.3 Method of Sections | 405

5-5_method_of_sections/methodofsections.html

For this example, you could choose the right half or the left half.
For some problems, being strategic is necessary; otherwise, you
need to make multiple cuts. In this problem, you had to solve for
the reaction forces first, but that isn't always the case, as you can
sometimes just make the cut (see example 2 below).

   Here are more examples of how to make a cut and show the
naming convention:

Here is a detailed explanation:

          The method of sections is a process used to solve for
       the unknown forces acting on members of a truss. The
       method involves breaking the truss down into individual
       sections and analyzing each section as a separate rigid
       body. The method of sections is usually the fastest and
       easiest way to determine the unknown forces acting in a
       specific member of the truss.

      Using This Method:

          The process used in the method of sections is
       outlined below:

           1. In the beginning, it is usually useful to label the
                members in your truss. This will help you keep
                everything organized and consistent in later
                analysis. In this book, the members will be labelled
                with letters.

408 | 5.3 Method of Sections
     The first step in the method of sections is to label each
     member.

2. Treating the entire truss structure as a rigid
     body, draw a free body diagram, write out the
     equilibrium equations, and solve for the external
     reacting forces acting on the truss structure. This
     analysis should not differ from the analysis of a
     single rigid body.

     Treat the entire truss as a rigid body and solve for the
     reaction forces supporting the truss structure.

                                                     5.3 Method of Sections | 409
          3. Next, you will imagine cutting your truss into
                two separate sections. The cut should travel
                through the member that you are trying to solve
                for the forces in, and should cut through as few
                members as possible (The cut does not need to be
                a straight line).

                  Next, you will imagine cutting the truss into two parts. If
                  you want to find the forces in a specific member, be sure to
                  cut through that member. It also makes things easier if you
                  cut through as few members as possible.

          4. Next, you will draw a free-body diagram for
                either one or both sections that you created. Be
                sure to include all the forces acting on each
                section.
                    Any external reaction or load forces that
                        may be acting on the section.
                    An internal force in each member that was
                        cut when splitting the truss into sections.
                        Remember that for a two-force member, the
                        force will be acting along the line between

410 | 5.3 Method of Sections
             the two connection points on the member.
             We will also need to guess if it will be a
             tensile or a compressive force. An incorrect
             guess now, though, will simply lead to a
             negative solution later on. A common
             strategy then is to assume all forces are
             tensile, then later in the solution, any
             positive forces will be tensile forces, and any
             negative forces will be compressive forces.
         Label each force in the diagram. Include
             any known magnitudes and directions, and
             provide variable names for each unknown.

               Next, draw a free-body diagram of one or both
               halves of the truss. Add the known forces, as well as
               the unknown tensile forces for each member that
               you cut.

5. Write out the equilibrium equations for each
     section for which you drew a free body diagram.
     These will be extended bodies, so you will need to
     write out the force and the moment equations.

                                                      5.3 Method of Sections | 411
                    You will have three possible equations for
                        each section: two force equations and one
                        moment equation.
                           \sum\vec F=0\; \; \sum\vec
                        M=0\\\sum F_x=0\; \; \sum F_y=0\; \;
                        \sum M_z=0

          6. Finally, solve the equilibrium equations for the
                unknowns. You can do this algebraically, solving
                for one variable at a time, or you can use matrix
                equations to solve for everything at once. If you
                assumed that all forces were tensile earlier,
                remember that negative answers indicate
                compressive forces in the members.

     Key Takeaways

             Basically, the Method of Sections is an analysis
          technique to find the forces in some members of a
          truss. It separates the truss into two sections and
          then uses the rigid body equilibrium equations.

             Application: To calculate the loads on bridges and

420 | 5.3 Method of Sections
roofs, especially if you need to know only one or
two of the members.

   Looking Ahead: The next section explores a trick
that makes solving faster, especially for the method
of joints.

5.4 Zero-Force Members

This is a special case that is especially useful for the method of joints
and the method of sections. These special types of members, called
zero-force members, ensure the truss stays in a particular shape as
a rigid body, but carries no load.

   Zero-force members are members that you can tell just by
inspection carry no load. They are important to the structure to
ensure it stays in a rigid shape.

   Zero-force members can be found by considering the equilibrium
equations. Look at the joint E below. In the y direction, there is only 1
force: Feh. So if the sum of the forces in the y direction \sum F_{y}
= 0, then Feh = 0. Similarly, Fmk and Fcp are zero-force members (if
you look at joint m and c). Note that if you looked at joint k or p, you
couldn't tell that Fmk and Fcp are zero-force members.

422 | 5.4 Zero-Force Members

426a1d4.png

There isn't a huge problem if you can't find zero-force members just
from inspection, but you might find that certain joints are not able
to be solved as easily. (Zero-force members let you have one less
unknown.)

                                                               5.4 Zero-Force Members | 423
   Also, see that L and G have no zero-force members because the
externally applied loads balance the members.

   Here are some examples to practice on:

Example 1

Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Camelback-truss.svg

   (I count 3 zero-force members, assuming there are no loads on
the bridge at the joints).

Example 2

424 | 5.4 Zero-Force Members
(I count 1 zero-force member, assuming there are no loads on the
bridge at the joints.)

Example 3

Source: https://pxhere.com/en/photo/995729
(Looking at only 1 side of the bridge, in theory there are 7 zero-force
members, but because there is a load on the deck it is more likely
that all of them would be carrying a load).

   Admittedly, zero-force members are more theoretical than actual.
     Key Takeaways

        Basically: Zero-force members are two-force members
     that do not carry any load but help keep the structure into
     a certain shape.

        Application: In trusses.

Example 5.5.1: Method of Sections,
Submitted by Riley Fitzpatrick

          1. Problem

                  A flower cart at a local garden center is
               being pushed with a force of 500N at joint G.
               Its back wheels (A) are locked, so it is not
               moving. There is 1 meter of space between
               each of the four shelves in height, and each
               shelf is four meters long.

                  a) Calculate the reaction forces of the
               locked wheels and the unlocked wheels.

                                                                                5.5 Examples | 427
                  b) Calculate the load carried by FCG, and
               whether it is in tension or compression

                  Which method did you use, joints or
               sections? Which is faster for the style of
               questions? How would your strategy change
               if you were calculating the load in each
               member?

   Part a: Determine reaction forces using equilibrium
equations

                                                                       5.5 Examples | 431
          Part b: Calculate FCG using the method of sections.
       Make a cut, then solve internal forces using equilibrium
       equations

          5. Analysis
          Part a:
          Solving for RAx:

             \sum F_x=0=P+R_{Ax}\\R_{Ax}=-P\\R_{Ax}=-500N
          Solving for RBy:

             \sum M_A=0=(r_{BA}\cdot R_{By})-(r_{GA}\cdot
          P)\\r_{BA}\cdot R_{By}=r_{GA}\cdot
          P\\R_{By}=\frac{r_{GA}\cdot
          P}{r_{BA}}\\R_{By}=\frac{2m\cdot
          500N}{4m}\\R_{By}=250N
          Solving for RAy:

             \sum F_y=0=R_{By}+R_{Ay}\\R_{Ay}=-
          R_{By}\\R_{Ay}=-250N
          The answers we got that were negative numbers
       mean that the direction of the vector is drawn wrong on
       our original diagram (in reference to our coordinate
       frame). This makes sense as RAy and RBy are the only
       external forces in the y direction, so they have to cancel
       each other for the equilibrium equations to be true
       (Same for the vectors in the x direction.) Therefore, one
       of them should have a negative direction. We will leave
       this answer as is for now, but the next time we draw the
       system, we will change the direction of the arrow.

             \underline{R_{Ax}=-500N,\; R_{Ay}=-250N, \;
          R_{By}=250N}

432 | 5.5 Examples
   Part b:
   Firstly, we redraw the diagram, changing the direction
of the RAy and RAx. Then, since we are using the method
of sections, we make a cut so that the member FCG (the
one we want to find) is cut.

   Now we redraw, choosing one of the pieces from the
cut. Here, the top half is chosen, but you could also
choose the bottom half and get the right answer. The
only reason the top half was chosen here is because
there are fewer external forces to consider for the top.

                                                                       5.5 Examples | 433
          Solve for the member we are looking for:

          \sum
       F_x=0=P+\frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}F_{CG}\\\frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}
       F_{CG}=-P\\F_{CG}=-
       P(\frac{\sqrt{17}}{4})\\F_{CG}=-500N(\frac{\sqrt{17}}{4
       })\\F_{CG}=-515.388N

          Again, the number we get is negative. The way we
       drew FCG originally was as if the member was in tension.
       The negative number just means that it is actually
       compression, not tension.

             \underline{F_{CG}=515 \text{N (Compression)}}
          Part C:
          For part b, I used the method of sections, as it would
       be the fastest method. The method of joints would
       require the lower joints to be solved first, which would
       be a much slower process, whereas with this method, a

434 | 5.5 Examples
simple cut can be made, and the member's load can be
quickly solved using equilibrium equations. Had the
question asked for all member loads to be solved,
however, the method of joints would have been the
faster approach.

   6. Review

   Part a:

   RAx is equal and opposite to P so we know it is
correct, and the value of RBy should also be correct as
its moment about A (250 * 4m = 1000 Nm), is equal and
opposite to the moment of P about A, (500 N * 2 m =
1000 Nm). as RAy is equal and opposite to RBy it is also
correct.

   Part b:

   The x component of the calculated value of FCG is
equal in magnitude to P (see equation below), and it is
the only cut member acting in the x direction.
Therefore, it must be correct.

      \frac{4}{\sqrt{17}}(515 N)=500 N

   Part C:

   The method of sections allows you to solve a very
specific area of the system's internal forces (the
members that are cut), whereas the method of joints
usually requires you to solve most, if not all, of the
internal forces of the system. Therefore, the method of
sections is the most efficient for finding the internal
forces of specific parts of the system, whereas the
method of joints is more efficient for solving the whole
system.

                                                                       5.5 Examples | 435
Example 5.5.2: Zero-Force Members,
Submitted by Michael Oppong-Ampomah

          1. Problem
                  A bridge with uneven ground has been

               built as shown below. Force is applied at
               three points on the top of the bridge.

                  a) Find any zero-force members
                  b) What purpose do these members serve?

          2. Draw
          Free-body diagram:
436 | 5.5 Examples
   3. Knowns and Unknowns
   Knowns:
    · All of the known values do not mean anything -

        we only need to know where the forces exist
   Unknown:
    · Which members are zero-force
   4. Approach
   Look at each joint and determine how many forces are
in each direction. If there is only one force in a
direction, that member is zero-force.
   5. Analysis
   Part a:
   Let's start with joint C. If we think of the forces acting
in the x and y directions as shown below by the
coordinate frame, we see that there are two forces
acting in the y direction, and only one in the x direction.

                                                                       5.5 Examples | 437
       Therefore, assuming the joint is in static equilibrium,
       member CE is a zero-force.

          If we do the same type of analysis for the other joints
       and remove the zero-force members, the structure now
       looks like this:

438 | 5.5 Examples
   After one more analysis of the joints, we find one
more zero-force member, as shown below.

                                                                       5.5 Examples | 439
          Answer: CE, DG, and FG are zero-force members.
          Part b:
          Zero-force members exist to provide stability to the
       truss, to keep the shape rigid.
          6. Review
          Although the new truss (without zero-force members)
       looks strange, there are no joints where there's only one
       force in one direction; therefore, there are no more
       zero-force members.

               has a bucket full of water hanging off the
               middle. The mass of the water bucket is 15 kg.

   b. FAF, FEF, FDE, FBD are zero force members because
for joints F and D, there are only 2 members each, and

   The answers make sense because FCEis in tension as
imagined due to the weight of the bucket. Members AC
and BC are under reaction forces, are equally under
tension, and members AE and BE are balanced by
compression. The identified zero-force members also
make sense due to the rules being met.

          1. Problem

                  Jeffery is unsuccessfully pushing a
               2-dimensional shopping cart shown below
               with a force of 70N. It is made up of steel
               (8g/cm3) rods with 2cm diameters. The
               wheel of the cart that is closest to him is
               stuck (pinned) while the front wheel is free to
               roll (roller). The total height of the cart is
               0.75m, and its total length is 1.5m.

                  What is the total mass of the cart? (For the
               purposes of the equilibrium equations,
               assume the total weight acts only at the
               centre point of the system, and otherwise the
               rods are massless.) What are the reaction

          4. Approach
          Use trigonometry and equilibrium equations, as well
       as the method of joints, to calculate unknowns
          5. Analysis
          Finding total mass:
          There are four 75cm rods, two rods that are
          75\sqrt{2}cm, and one rod that is 1.5m long, all of
       which have a diameter of 2cm. The total mass is
       therefore
          8g/cm^3 \cdot ((4 \pi \cdot (1cm)^2\cdot (75cm) +
       2\pi\cdot (1cm)^2 \cdot \\ (75 \sqrt(2)cm) + \pi
       (1cm)^2 \cdot (150cm)) \\ \approx 16,641g = 16.641kg =
       m_{tot}
          Fg can then be found using
          F_g = g \cdot m_{tot} = -9.81m/s^2 \cdot 16.641kg
       \approx -163.25N

452 | 5.5 Examples
   The sum of forces and moments can now be used to
determine reaction forces

      \sum F_x = P_x - R_{Ax} \\ R_{Ax} = P \cdot
   cos(\theta) = 70N cos(15^\circ) \\ R_{Ax} \approx
   67.6N

      \sum F_y = -F_g - P_y + R_{Ay} + R_{By} = 0
   With two unknowns, the sum of moments must be
considered. Summing moments around point A finds:

      \sum M_A = 0 = -(0.75m \cdot Pcos(\theta)) - (0.75m
   \cdot F_g) + (1.5m \cdot R_{By})

      \sum M_A = 0 = -(0.75m \cdot 70N cos(15^\circ)) -
   (0.75m \cdot 163.25N) + (1.5m \cdot R_{By})

      R_{By} \approx 115.43N
   Sum of Forces in Y can now be used to find RAy

      F_y = -F_g - P_y + R_{Ay} +R_{By} = 0
      R_{Ay} \approx 65.94N
   The method of joints can now be used to determine if
any zero-force members exist in the shopping cart.
   Looking at Point A, it can be found that
   F_{AO} = 65.94\,N in compression and
   F_{AC} = 67.6\,N in tension. Continuing through each
joint, it can be found that member CB is a zero-force
member as point B only has one component in the X
direction, which, in a static system, implies that the
force must be zero.
   6. Review
   Given the high weight of the cart creating a large Fg

                                                                       5.5 Examples | 453
       and the applied force of 70N, the reaction forces found
       and the internal forces all seem to be of appropriate
       magnitude and direction.

    · FHI =?
    · dHI = ?
    · P =?
    · m=?

   4. Approach
Use the method of sections to show internal forces and
analyze as a rigid body.

   5. Analysis
First, the distance dHI can be found:

   d_{HI} = \sqrt{(0.1 m)^2 + (0.2 m)^2} \\ d_{HI} =
0.2236 m
This value can be used to find the equivalents to cos
and sin:

   \cos{\theta} = \frac{0.1 m}{0.2236 m} \\ \sin{\theta}
= \frac{0.2 m}{0.2236 m}
The sum of forces in the X direction can be used to
determine the value of FHI:

   \sum F_x = 0 = -F_{CD} + F_{GH} + F_{HI} \cdot
\cos{\theta} \\ F_{HI} = \frac{(F_{CD} -
F_{GH})}{\cos{\theta}} \\ F_{HI} = \frac{0.2236 m}{0.1
m} \cdot (25 N - 15 N) \\ F_{HI} = 22.36N
The sum of forces in the Y direction can now be used to
determine the value of P:

   \sum F_y = 0 = -P + F_{HI} \cdot \sin{\theta} \\ P =
F_{HI} \cdot \sin{\theta} \\ P = (22.36 N) \cdot
\frac{0.2 m}{0.2236 m} \\ P = 20 N
The mass can now be simply found by dividing the force
by gravity:

   P = mg \\ m = \frac{P}{g} \\ m = \frac{20 N}{9.81
\frac{m}{s^2}} \\ m = 2.04 kg

                                                                       5.5 Examples | 457
          6. Review
       A brief review of this question is the sign and magnitude
       of the result. The force generated by the mass pushes
       downwards with gravity, which is expected. The
       magnitude of the mass, while defining this shelf as one
       that is particularly flimsy, is a reasonable mass.

CHAPTER 6: INTERNAL
FORCES

In the last chapter we looked at the normal (axial) force running
through beams joined into trusses by analyzing either the joints or a
whole section of the truss.

   In this chapter, we look at what happens along a single beam. We
will look at three types of internal forces and moments. Note that
when we say `internal forces', we really mean `internal forces and
moments'. Inside a beam, we will calculate the normal and shear
forces as well as the bending moment at any point in the beam.

   For this chapter: the shear force and bending moment change
throughout the beam because additional transverse forces are
applied. However, the normal force usually stays the same, because
it's uncommon to have applied axial forces along the beam.

   Here are the sections in this Chapter:

  · 6.1 Types of Internal Forces - shear force, normal force and
      bending moment

  · 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams - graphing the shear force and
      bending moment

  · 6.3 Examples - Examples from your peers

Here are the important equations for this chapter:

6.1 Types of Internal Forces

When you make a cut in an object, similar to a fixed reaction, we
describe what is happening at that point using one horizontal force
(called normal force), one vertical force (called shear force), and a
bending moment.

6.1.1 Types of Internal Forces

There are 3 types of internal forces (& moments):
  · Normal force (N) - the horizontal force we calculated in
      trusses in the last chapter
                                                            6.1 Types of Internal Forces | 461
· Shear force (V) - the vertical force that changes based on the
   applied loads

· bending moment (M) - changes based on the applied loads and
   applied moments

Normal force is represented by `N'. Shear force, the vertical force, is
represented by `V'. Bending moment is `M'. Normal and shear have
units of N or lb, and bending moment has units of Nm or ft-lb.
The following table summarizes information on internal forces (and
moments).

Force/       Abbreviation Unit  Directions
Moment                          for a
                                horizontal
Normal       N  N or lb         beam
 Force
                                horizontal
Shear Force  V  N or lb
                                vertical
Moment       M Nm or ft-lb
                                rotation

Note that for a vertical column, the normal force would be vertical.
For this reason, the normal force is often called `axial' as in: along
the axis. The shear force for a column would be horizontal and is
sometimes called `transverse'.

   This is for a 2d analysis of the beam, assuming there is negligible
loading in the third dimension.

          When a beam or frame is subjected to transverse
       loadings, the three possible internal forces that are
       developed are the normal or axial force, the shearing

462 | 6.1 Types of Internal Forces
force, and the bending moment, as shown in section k of
the cantilever of the figure below. To predict the
behaviour of structures, the magnitudes of these forces
must be known. In this chapter, the student will learn
how to determine the magnitude of the shearing force
and bending moment at any section of a beam or frame
and how to present the computed values in a graphical
form, which is referred to as the "shearing force" and
the "bending moment diagrams." Bending moment and
shearing force diagrams aid immeasurably during
design, as they show the maximum bending moments
and shearing forces needed for sizing structural
members.

 Normal Force

   The normal force at any section of a structure is

                                                  6.1 Types of Internal Forces | 463
       defined as the algebraic sum of the axial forces acting
       on either side of the section.

      Shearing Force

          The shearing force (SF) is defined as the algebraic sum
       of all the transverse forces acting on either side of the
       section of a beam or a frame. The phrase "on either side"
       is important, as it implies that at any particular instance,
       the shearing force can be obtained by summing up the
       transverse forces on the left side of the section or on
       the right side of the section.

      Bending Moment

          The bending moment (BM) is defined as the algebraic
       sum of all the forces' moments acting on either side of
       the section of a beam or a frame.

6.1.2 Sign Convention

So that there is a standard within the industry, a sign convention
is necessary so we agree on what is positive and what is negative.

                                                           6.1 Types of Internal Forces | 465
On the right, shear-up is positive. Notice that both of the following
figures show the identical sign convention.

When you look at the beam as a whole (in the figure below), positive
shear is right side down. When you cut into the beam, for it to be in
static equilibrium, the positive shear must then be up on the right
to be equal and opposite to the overall motion.

466 | 6.1 Types of Internal Forces
 Axial (Normal) Force

   An axial force is regarded as positive if it tends to tier
the member at the section under consideration. Such a
force is regarded as tensile, while the member is said to
be subjected to axial tension. On the other hand, an axial
force is considered negative if it tends to crush the
member at the section being considered. Such force is
regarded as compressive, while the member is said to be
in axial compression.

 Shear Force

   A shear force that tends to move the left of the
section upward or the right side of the section
downward will be regarded as positive. Similarly, a shear
force that has the tendency to move the left side of the

                                                   6.1 Types of Internal Forces | 467
       section downward or the right side upward will be
       considered a negative shear force.

      Bending Moment

          A bending moment is considered positive if it tends to
       cause concavity upward (sagging). If the bending
       moment tends to cause concavity downward (hogging),
       it will be considered a negative bending moment.

   4. Use the equilibrium equations to solve for the unknown internal

   For just this portion, the force from intensity is: Fw = ( 100 lb/ft )

intensity is: Mw = w * 2 ft * 1 ft = Fw * 1 ft = ( 100 lb/ft ) * ( 2 ft) * (1 ft)
= 200 ft-lb

      \sum M_A = - (w * 2 ft) * (1 ft) - V * (2 ft) + M = 0 \\ M = (100

     Key Takeaways

        Basically: The internal forces (and moments) for a 2d
     beam are: shear, normal, and bending moment. There is a
     positive sign convention to use when making a cut along a
     beam to determine the forces inside: on the left, shear
     down, normal out, moment up.

        Application: A bridge that has different loads applied
     (from cars, trucks, lampposts, etc). Use this method to
     calculate the internal loads at a particular point of interest.

        Looking Ahead: In the next section, we'll look at how to
     calculate the internal force across the whole beam and
     display the results graphically.

6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams

6.2.1 What are Shear/Moment Diagrams?

Shear/Moment diagrams are graphical representations of the
internal shear force and bending moment along the whole beam.

      Shearing Force Diagram

          This is a graphical representation of the variation of
       the shearing force on a portion or the entire length of a
       beam or frame. As a convention, the shearing force
       diagram can be drawn above or below the x-centroidal
       axis of the structure, but it must be indicated if it is a
       positive or negative shear force.

      Bending Moment Diagram

          This is a graphical representation of the variation of
       the bending moment on a segment or the entire length
       of a beam or frame. As a convention, the positive
       bending moments are drawn above the x-centroidal axis
       of the structure, while the negative bending moments
       are drawn below the axis.

          Below is a simple example of what shear and moment
       diagrams look like. Afterwards, the relation between the
       load on the beam and the diagrams will be discussed.

474 | 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams
6.2.2 Distributed Loads & Shear/Moment
Diagrams

There is a relationship between distributed loads and shear/
moment diagrams. Simply put:

                                     \frac{dM}{dx}=V(x)
                                    \frac{dV}{dx}=-w(x)
                                \frac{d^2M}{dx^2}=-w(x)
   Or:
                                   \Delta M=\int V(x)dx
                                   \Delta V=\int w(x)dx
   So, if there is a constant distributed load, then the slope of shear
will be linear, and the slope of the moment will be parabolic. If the
distributed load is 0, then the shear will be constant and the slope
of the moment will be linear (as shown in Example 1 in the next
section).

          For the derivation of the relations among w, V, and M,
       consider a simply supported beam subjected to a
       uniformly distributed load throughout its length, as
       shown in the figure below. Let the shear force and
       bending moment at a section located at a distance
       of x from the left support be V and M, respectively, and
       at a section x + dx be V + dV and M + dM, respectively.

                                                         6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams | 475
       The total load acting through the center of the
       infinitesimal length is wdx.

          To compute the bending moment at section x + dx,
       use the following:

             \begin{aligned} M_{x+dx} &amp;= M + Vdx - wdx
          \cdot \frac{dx}{2} \\ &amp;= M + Vdx \quad
          \text{(neglecting the small second order term }
          \frac{wdx^2}{2} \text{)} \end{aligned}
          or

                           \frac{dM}{dx}=V(x) (Equation 6.1)
          Equation 6.1 implies that the first derivative of the
       bending moment with respect to the distance is equal to
       the shearing force. The equation also suggests that the
       slope of the moment diagram at a particular point is
       equal to the shear force at that same point. Equation
       6.1 suggests the following expression:

                         \Delta M=\int V(x)dx (Equation 6.2)
          Equation 6.2 states that the change in moment equals
       the area under the shear diagram. Similarly, the shearing
       force at section x + dx is as follows:

                           V_{x+dx}=V-wdx\\V+dV=V-wdx

476 | 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams
          or
                          \frac{dV}{dx}=-w(x) (Equation 6.3)

          Equation 6.3 implies that the first derivative of the
       shearing force with respect to the distance is equal to
       the intensity of the distributed load. Equation
       6.3 suggests the following expression:

                         \Delta V=\int w(x)dx (Equation 6.4)
          Equation 6.4 states that the change in the shear force
       is equal to the area under the load diagram. Equations
       6.1 and 6.3 suggest the following:

                      \frac{d^2M}{dx^2}=-w(x) (Equation 6.5)
          Equation 6.5 implies that the second derivative of the
       bending moment with respect to the distance is equal to
       the intensity of the distributed load.

diagram. First, you can find the equation for each portion and
integrate using the above equations.

   Second, you could use the method shown in the previous section
to calculate the internal forces at important points (where loads are
applied, the start and end of distributed loads, at reaction points).
Plot these points on the V and M plots at the x locations, then
connect the dots using the appropriate shape slope (more on this at
the bottom of this page).

   Third, you can find the equations by using the equilibrium
equations (so there's no integration/differentiation).

1. Draw a FBD of the

structure

2. Calculate the reactions using

the equilibrium equations

positive sign convention.

Depending on the number of loads, you may need multiple

cuts. Recall the positive convention:

4. For shear, find an equation (expression) of the shear that is x

distance from the origin (often the reaction) for each cut.

5. For moment, find an equation (expression) of the shear that is x

distance from the origin (often the reaction) for each cut.

6. Plot these equations on a plot on top of each other.

The rest of this section will use this method.

need to do this if choosing a cantilever beam and using the free side
for the FBD).

   First, compute the reactions at the support. Since the support
at B is fixed, there will be three reactions at that support, namely
By, Bx, and MB. Applying the conditions of equilibrium suggests the
following:

      \sum F_{x}=0: \quad \underline{B_{x}=0}
      \sum F_{y}=0: \quad-5 lb+B_{y}=0
   \qquad \quad \underline{B_{y}=5 lb}
      \sum M_{B}=0: \quad(5 lb )(3 \mathrm{ft})-M=0
   \qquad \quad \underline{M=15 ft \cdot lb}
   3. Make a cut and add internal forces N V and M using the positive
sign convention. Depending on the number of loads, you may need
multiple cuts
   Only 1 cut needed because only 1 load is added at the end. (If it
were in the middle there would be 2 sections to consider). The value
x could be 0 to 3 ft.

   4. For shear, find an equation (expression) of the shear that is x
distance from the origin (often the reaction) for each cut.

480 | 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams
   x is the distance from the free end of the cantilever beam to the
cut. The shearing force at that section is due to the applied load.
Using the equilibrium equations,

      \sum F_y = -5 lb - V = 0 \\ \qquad \quad \underline{V = - 5 lb}
   \text{ (- indicates V acts in opposite direction)}
   The constant number for shear means that it doesn't change or
vary by x. (If there were a distributed load, x would be part of the
equation).
   The negative sign indicates the shear actually goes the opposite
direction. (This is due to the fact that the sign convention for a
shearing force states that a downward transverse force on the left of
the section under consideration will cause a negative shearing force
on that section.)

   5. For the moment, find an equation (expression) of the shear that is
x distance from the origin (often the reaction) for each cut.

   Here, x is measured from the left. Using sum of the moments
equations, find an expression for M. You could choose to sum the
moments about the end point where the load is applied, or you
could do it at the moving point x. Both take the same effort for this
problem, so let's choose the left hand side where the 5 lb are being
applied.

      \sum M_L = -Vx - M = 0
      \qquad \quad M = + Vx = (-5 lb) * x

                                                         6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams | 481
      \qquad \quad \underline{M = -(5lb)x } \text{ (the negative sign
   indicates the arrow goes the other direction.}

   The obtained expression is valid for the entire beam (the region
0 < x < 3 ft). The negative sign indicates a negative moment, which
was established from the sign convention for the moment, so the
moment actually goes in the opposite direction. The moment due
to the 5 lb force tends to cause the segment of the beam on the
left side of the section to exhibit a downward concavity, and that
corresponds to a negative bending moment, according to the sign
convention for bending moment.

   6. Plot these equations on a plot on top of each other.
   Note that because the shearing force is a constant, it must be of
the same magnitude at any point along the beam. As a convention,
the shearing force diagram is plotted above or below a line
corresponding to the neutral axis of the beam, but a plus sign must
be indicated if it is a positive shearing force, and a minus sign should
be indicated if it is a negative shearing force. A way to check the
answer is to ensure the reaction force brings the problem back to
0. The shear is -5 until the last moment when the reaction force of
+5lb brings the force to 0.
   Since the function for the bending moment is linear, the bending
moment diagram is a straight line. Thus, it is enough to use the
two principal values of bending moments determined at x = 0 ft and

482 | 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams
at x = 3 ft to plot the bending moment diagram. As a convention,
negative bending moment diagrams are plotted below the neutral
axis of the beam, while positive bending moment diagrams are
plotted above the axis of the beam.

   Notice the units are included in the axes.

   Here is a second explanation for how to create shear/moment
diagrams:

Shear Diagram

               6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams | 483
          To create the shear force diagram, we will use the
       following process.

           1. Solve for all external forces acting on the body.
          2. Draw out a free-body diagram of the body

                horizontally. Leave all distributed forces as
                distributed forces and do not replace them with
                the equivalent point load.
          3. Lined up below the free body diagram, draw a
                set of axes. The x-axis will represent the location
                (lined up with the free body diagram above), and
                the y-axis will represent the internal shear force.
          4. Starting at zero at the right side of the plot, you
                will move to the right, pay attention to forces in
                the free body diagram above. As you move right in
                your plot, keep steady except...

                    Jump upwards by the magnitude of the
                        force for any point forces going up.

                    Jump downwards by the magnitude of the
                        force for any point forces going down.

                    For any uniformly distributed forces, you
                        will have a linear slope where the magnitude
                        of the distributed force is the slope of the
                        line (positive slopes for upwards distributed
                        forces, negative slopes for downwards
                        distributed forces).

                    For non-uniformly distributed forces, the
                        shape of the shear diagram plot will be the
                        integral of the force function.

                    You can ignore any moments or horizontal
                        forces applied to the body.

484 | 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams
           By the time you get to the left end of the plot,
        you should always wind up coming back to zero. If
        you don't wind up back at zero, go back and check
        your previous work.

   To read the plot, you
simply need to find the
location of interest from
the free body diagram
above, and read the
corresponding value on the
y-axis from your plot.
Positive numbers
represent an upward
internal shearing force to
the right of the cross
section and a downward

       force on the left, and negative numbers indicate a
       downward internal shearing force to the right of the
       cross section and an upward force on the left. A visual of
       these forces can be seen in the diagram to the right.

          Moment Diagram
          The moment diagram will plot out the internal
       bending moment within a horizontal beam that is
       subjected to multiple forces and moments
       perpendicular to the length of the beam. For practical
       purposes, this diagram is often used in the same
       circumstances as the shear diagram, and generally, both
       diagrams will be created for analysis in these scenarios.
          To create the moment diagram for a shaft, we will use
       the following process.

           1. Solve for all external forces and moments,
                create a free body diagram, and create the shear
                diagram.

          2. Lined up below the shear diagram, draw a set of
                axes. The x-axis will represent the location (lined
                up with the shear diagram and free body diagram
                above), and the y-axis will represent the internal
                bending moment.

          3. Starting at zero on the right side of the plot, you
                will move to the right, pay attention to the shear
                diagram and the moments in the free body
                diagram above. As you move right in your plot, the
                moment diagram will primarily be the integral of
                the shear diagram, except...

486 | 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams
    Jump upwards by the magnitude of the
        moment for any negative (clockwise)
        moments.

    Jump downwards by the magnitude of the
        moment for any positive (counter-
        clockwise) moments.

    You can ignore any forces in the free body
        diagram.

   By the time you get to the left end of the plot,
you should always wind up coming back to zero. If
you don't wind up back at zero, go back and check
your previous work.

                                       6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams | 487
          To read the plot, you
       simply need to take the
       find the location of interest
       from the free body diagram
       above, and read the
       corresponding value on the
       y-axis from your plot.
       Positive internal moments
       would cause the beam to
       bow downwards (think a
       smile shape) negative
       internal moments will
       cause the beam to bow
       upwards (think a frown shape). You can also see the
       positive and negative internal moments in the figure to
       the right.

Example 2

          Draw the shearing force and bending moment
       diagrams for the cantilever beam subjected to a
       uniformly distributed load in its entire length, as shown
       in Figure 4.5a.

          Answer:

                                                         6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams | 489
          Support reactions.
          First, compute the reactions at the support. Since the
       support at B is fixed, there will possibly be three
       reactions at that support, namely By, Bx, and MB, as
       shown in the free-body diagram in Figure 4.4b. Applying
       the conditions of equilibrium suggests the following:

          Shear Force Function
          Let x be the distance of an arbitrary section from the
       free end of the cantilever beam, as shown in Figure 4.5b.
       The shearing force of all the forces acting on the
       segment of the beam to the left of the section, as shown
       in Figure 4.5e, is determined as follows:

490 | 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams
The obtained expression is valid for the entire beam.
The negative sign indicates a negative shearing force,
which was established from the sign convention for a
shearing force. The expression also shows that the
shearing force varies linearly with the length of the
beam.

   Shearing force diagram. Note that because the
expression for the shearing force is linear, its diagram
will consist of straight lines. The shearing forces at x = 0
m and x = 5 m were determined and used for plotting
the shearing force diagram, as shown in Figure 4.5c. As
shown in the diagram, the shearing force varies from
zero at the free end of the beam to 100 kN at the fixed
end. The computed vertical reaction of By at the support
can be regarded as a check for the accuracy of the
analysis and diagram.

   Bending Moment Function
   The expression for the bending moment at a section
of a distance x from the free end of the cantilever beam
is as follows:

The negative sign indicates a negative moment, which
was established from the sign convention for moment.
As seen in Figure 4.5f, the moment due to the

                                                 6.2 Shear/Moment Diagrams | 491
       distributed load tends to cause the segment of the beam
       on the left side of the section to exhibit an upward
       concavity, and that corresponds to a negative bending
       moment, according to the sign convention for bending
       moment.

          Bending moment diagram. Since the function for the
       bending moment is parabolic, the bending moment
       diagram is a curve. In addition to the two principal
       values of bending moment at x = 0 m and at x = 5 m, the
       moments at other intermediate points should be
       determined to correctly draw the bending moment
       diagram. The bending moment diagram of the beam is
       shown in Figure 4.5d.

Though there are exceptions, these rules are generally true:
  · +V means increasing M
  · -V means decreasing M
  · When V = 0, that's max or min M

   How does each plot start/end? Reactions only if no applied load/

        In V, forces `jump' up or down where applied forces are,
            matching the direction they are applied (also reactions)

        In M, moments jump up or down where applied moments
            are, matching the direction.

  · Relationship between graphs
        When there is an increasing slope in M, then Shear should
            be positive
        When there is a decreasing slope in M, then Shear should
            be negative
        When V is positive, M should be increasing
        When V is negative, M should be decreasing
        When intensity is positive, V should be increasing
        When intensity is negative, V should be decreasing
        Inflection points in the M plot (where the slope of the line
            changes from negative to positive & max/min values)
            should be 0 in the V plot
        A zero value in the V plot should produce a max or min
            value in the M plot

The following figure shows the relationship between the derivatives.
Remember that the derivative of x2 (quadratic) = x (linear). The
derivative of x (linear) is a constant number. The derivative of a
constant number is 0. The derivative of the moment is shear, so if
you have the shape of the moment, use this figure to approximate
the shape of shear by going down the plots.

   The reverse is true when going from shear to moment. The
integral of shear is the moment. The integral of 0 is a constant
number. The integral of a constant number is linear. The integral of a
linear function is quadratic. (The integral of quadratic is cubic). This
progression moves up the plots from the bottom to the top.

                  The setup that holds the solar panels at the

               beam S (1.9 m length), find the internal forces
               at point C. Assume the intensity of the solar

          Use equilibrium equations. First, solve for reaction
       forces, then make a cut at C and solve for the internal
       forces.
          5. Analysis

             w=\frac{F}{L}\\F=wL\\F_R=220N/m\cdot
          1.9m\\F_R=418N\\\sum F_X=0=B_X

          B_y\\A_y=418N-470.25N\\A_y=-52.25N
          The answer we got for Ay is negative, which means
       that the arrow should be drawn in the other direction.

          6. Review
          It makes sense that Ay and By are in different
       directions because the resultant force Fr of the solar
       panel on the beam is not between A and B. It also makes
       sense that the moment at C is in the counterclockwise
       direction rather than the clockwise direction when you
       think about the direction of the forces applied to the
       beam.

   The reaction forces make sense as they offset the
applied forces. The shear/moment diagrams returned to
zero, so they are correct too. The moment found at B is
in the moment diagram; it is smaller than the maximum.

          For the V-x graph, from A to B, there is a constant
       shear of 15 N, then from B to C, the shear has the same
       magnitude but a different direction. To plot the M-x
       graph, substitute x in the equation for M and M2 to find
       the peak bending moment. Also, because M is the
       integral of shear force, horizontal plots in shear
       correspond to a linear plot in the M-x graph.

          6. Review
          The answers make sense. The moment, shear, and
       reaction forces are equal in both segments of the beam.
       This is as expected because of the symmetry of the
       beam.

   4. Approach:
   Break the beam into sections as forces change.
   Determine the plotted shape of the shear and
moment of each section.
   Draw the V/M diagrams using these shape diagrams.
   5. Analysis:
   A distributed load creates a linear section across it,
with the magnitude of the shear force increasing across
the load. The maximum shear will be at the end of the
distributed load. With no other forces being applied
except for reactions, section B-C should be constant.
Since the beam is static, the reactions must bring the

                                                                       6.3 Examples | 523
       shear back to zero.

          The moment can be drawn using the knowledge that
       dM = V. Section A-B in the shear diagram is linear;
       integrating a linear function gives a quadratic function,
       thus, section A-B in the moment diagram must be
       curved. Section B-C is constant in shear. Integrating a
       constant function gives a linear function; therefore, the
       moment across this section must be linear, and since
       the shear is negative, the slope of the moment must be
       negative. Finally, because the beam is static, the moment
       must return to zero due to the reaction forces.

          2. Use beam analysis/cutting between forces to
                find equations for the shear/moment diagram.

526 | 6.3 Examples
   5. Analysis
   First, use the sum of forces and the sum of moments
to determine RAy and MA.

      \sum F_x = R_{Ax} = 0
      \sum F_y = -R_{Ay} - 20N - 400N - 11N +500N = 0
      R_{Ay} = 69N
      \sum M_A = - M_A - (20N \cdot 4m) - (400N \cdot
   8.5m) - (11N \cdot 10.3m) + (500 N \cdot 14m) = 0
      M_A = 3406.7Nm
   Next, cut the beam between A and B and analyze the
internal forces.

      \sum F_x = N + 0 = 0 \\ N = 0
      \sum F_y = -69N -V = 0 \\ V= -69N
      \sum M_{cut} = M + (69N \cdot x) - (3406.7Nm) = 0
   \\ M = -69x + 3406.7
   Repeat the analysis of internal forces from A to C.

                                                                       6.3 Examples | 527
             \sum F_x = N + 0 = 0 \\ N = 0
             \sum F_y = -69N - 20N -V = 0 \\ V = -89N
             \sum M_{cut} = M + (69N \cdot x) + (20N
          \cdot{(x-4m)}) - 3406.7Nm = 0 \\ M+89x-3326.7Nm = 0
          \\ M = -89x + 3326.7
          Finally, analyze the beam in the area from C to D.
       Ensure that the value of X used is now taken from point
       D.

             \sum F_x = -N = 0 \\ N = 0

528 | 6.3 Examples
   Since the section does not reach the end of the
distributed load, the slope of the load must be
calculated:

      \frac{4}{5.5} = \frac{m}{14-x} \\ m = \frac{56-4x}{5.5}
   This can be used to find the equivalent point load in
terms of x.

      F_{eq} = \frac{\frac{56-4x}{5.5} \cdot (14-x)}{2} \\
   F_{eq} = \frac{4x^2}{11} - \frac{112x}{11} + \frac{784}{11}
   This point load can be used when summing forces to
find v.

      \sum F_y = 0 = V - F_{eq} + 500 \\ V = F_{eq} - 500
   \\ V = \frac{4x^2}{11} - \frac{112x}{11} + \frac{784}{11} -
   500 \\ V = \frac{4x^2}{11} - \frac{112x}{11} - 428.7
   To save time, rather than use the sum of moments to
determine the equation for moments in this section, the
moment can be found by the integral of V.

      M = \int \frac{4x^2}{11} - \frac{112x}{11} - 428.7 dx \\
   M = \frac{4x^3}{33} - \frac{112x^2}{22} - 428.7x +C
   We know that for this beam to be static, the moment
at x=14m must be 0. This can be used to determine C.

      M(14) = 0 = \frac{4(14)^3}{33} - \frac{112(14)^2}{22} -
   428.7(14) +C \\ C = 6667 \\ Therefore: M_{cd}(x) =
   \frac{4x^3}{33} - \frac{112x^2}{22} - 428.7x + 6667
   With the values for internal forces found between
each change in force, the internal forces can be plotted.

                                                                       6.3 Examples | 529

   6. Review
   There is no force in the x direction; therefore, it
makes sense that the reaction force, RAx, is zero.
Because the moment at A is generated by the person's
weight, RBy should be considerably large. As RBy is larger
than the person's weight, RAy should act downwards and
would be of the same magnitude as the difference

                                                                       6.3 Examples | 537
       between RBy and the person's weight to make the
       system stable.

          For section b, the shear force between A and B is
       equal and opposite to the reaction force RAy. Similarly,
       with the concept of equilibrium, shear is equal and
       opposite to RAx, and the moment in this section is the
       negative of the moment generated at A.

          It also makes sense that the shear between B and C is
       equal to the difference between RBy and RAy, and as
       expected, acting downward, thus it equals the weight of
       the person.

          6. Review
          Negative sign for MA indicates that it should be in the
       other direction, as shown in the final diagram above.
       The shear force remains constant at 200N from A to C,
       then drops to zero at the end where the load is applied.
       The shear force is constant, hence it makes sense that
       the moment is linear.

          1. Problem

                  A Uniform rectangular light frame of mass
               3kg and length 0.8m is suspended from the
               ceiling by two vertical rods. The rods are
               0.2m apart and connected symmetrically to
               the ceiling plate. Also, there are 5 evenly
               spaced identical bulbs, each 0.5kg each
               mounted on the frame. Determine the
               tension in each vertical rod and the internal
               forces at the points where the vertical rod is
               connected to the frame.

   Knowns:

    · Mass of frame () = 3kg
    · Length of frame () = 0.8m
    · Mass of each lightbulb () = 0.5kg

   Unknowns:

    · Tension in each rod (1  2)
    · Internal forces at point D (D, D,  D)
   4. Approach
   Assuming the vertical rods are positioned centrally
between the bulbs, and the internal forces at points C
and D are the same (use any point to get the internal
forces). First, find the tension and then use it in
calculating internal forces.
   5. Analysis
   Weight of frame () =  = 3kg × 9.81m/s2 = 29.43N
   Weight of one bulb () =  = 0.5kg × 9.81m/s2 =

   The bulbs are evenly spaced, so the distance between
2 bulbs (from centre to centre):

equal (1 = 2 ), therefore:

          26.98\,\mathrm{N}
          The tension in each vertical rod is 26.98N.
          To get the internal forces at point D, taking the right
       side of the diagram:

          Since the rods are positioned centrally between the
       bulbs, the distance from point D to the bulb is

7.1 Center of Mass: Single
Objects

To start, let's calculate the center of mass! This is a weighted
function, similar to when we found the location of the resultant
force from multiple distributed loads and forces.

      \bar{x}=\frac{m_1*x_1}{m_1+m_2}+\frac{m_2*x_2}{m_1+m_2}
   When the density is the same throughout a shape, the center of
mass is also the centroid (geometric center).

7.1.1 Center of Mass of Two Particles

          Consider two particles, having one and the same mass
       m, each of which is at a different position on the x-axis
       of a Cartesian coordinate system.

                                                   7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects | 559
          Common sense tells you that the average position of
       the material making up the two particles is midway
       between the two particles. Common sense is right. We
       give the name "center of mass" to the average position
       of the material making up a distribution, and the center
       of mass of a pair of same-mass particles is indeed
       midway between the two particles. How about if one of
       the particles is more massive than the other? One would
       expect the center of mass to be closer to the more
       massive particle, and again, one would be right. To
       determine the position of the center of mass of the
       distribution of matter in such a case, we compute a
       weighted sum of the positions of the particles in the
       distribution, where the weighting factor for a given
       particle is that fraction of the total mass that the
       particle's own mass is. Thus, for two particles on the x
       axis, one of mass m1, at x1, and the other of mass m2, at
       x2,

          The position x of the center of mass is given by
       equation 8-1:

              \bar{x}=\frac{m_1*x_1}{m_1+m_2}+\frac{m_2*x_2}{
                                           m_1+m_2}

560 | 7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects
          Note that each weighting factor is a proper fraction
       and that the sum of the weighting factors is always 1.
       Also note that if, for instance, m1 is greater than m2,
       then the position x1 of particle 1 will count more in the
       sum, thus ensuring that the center of mass is found to
       be closer to the more massive particle (as we know it
       must be). Further note that if m1 = m2, each weighting
       factor is 1/2, as is evident when we substitute m for
       both m1 and m2 in equation 8-1:

             \bar{x}=\frac{m}{m+m}x_1+\frac{m}{m+m}x_2\\\ba
          r{x}=\frac{1}{2}x_1+\frac{1}{2}x_2\\\bar{x}=\frac{x_1+
          x_2}{2}

          The center of mass is found to be midway between
       the two particles, right where common sense tells us it
       has to be.

A second explanation:

          The most common real-life example of a system like
       this is a playground seesaw, or teeter-totter, with
       children of different weights sitting at different
       distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one child sits
       at each end, the heavier child sinks down and the lighter
       child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in
       toward the center, though, the seesaw balances.
       Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note
       that the masses balance each other if and only if m1d1 =
       m2d2.

562 | 7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects
   This idea is not limited just to two-point masses. In
general, if n masses, m1,m2,..., mn are placed on a
number line at points x1, x2,...xn, respectively, then the
center of mass of the system is given by:

      \bar x=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i
   x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^nm_i}

 Example 1:

   Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line
as follows:

    · m1 = 30kg, placed at x1 = -2m
    · m2 = 5kg, placed at x2 = 3m
    · m3 = 10kg, placed at x3 = 6m
    · m4 = 15kg, placed at x4 = -3m
   Solution
   Find the moment of the system with respect to the
origin and find the center of mass of the system.
   First, we need to calculate the moment of the system
(the top part of the fraction):

                                          7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects | 563
             M =\sum_{i=1}^4 m_i *x_i \\\qquad \quad =
          (30kg)*(-2m) + (5kg)*(3m)+(10kg)*(6m)+(15kg)*(-3m)
          \\\qquad\quad = (-60+15+60-45)kg*m \\\qquad\
          quad = -30 kg*m

          Now, to find the center of mass, we need the total
       mass of the system:

             m = \sum_{i=1}^4 m_i = (30+5+10+15) kg = 60kg

          Then we have
          \bar{x} = \frac{M}{m} = \frac{-30 kg*m}{60kg} = -0.5
       m

          The center of mass is located 1/2 m to the left of the
       origin.

7.1.2 Center of Mass in 2D & 3D

When we are looking at multiple objects in 2D or 3D, we perform the
center of mass equation multiple times in the x, y, and z directions.

      \bar x=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^nm_i} \qquad
   \bar y=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^nm_i} \qquad
   \bar z=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i z_i}{\sum_{i=1}^nm_i}

564 | 7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects
   In some sense, one can think about the center of mass
of a single object as its "average position." Let's consider
the simplest case of an "object" consisting of two tiny
particles separated along the x-axis, as seen below:

   If the two particles have equal mass, then it's pretty
clear that the "average position" of the two-particle
system is halfway between them. If the masses of the
two particles are different, would the "average position"
still be halfway between them? Perhaps in some sense
this is true, but we are not looking for a geometric
center; we are looking for the average placement of
mass. If m1 has twice the mass of m2, then when it
comes to the average placement of mass, m1 gets "two
votes." With more of the mass concentrated at the
position x1 than at x2, the center of mass should be
closer to x1 than x2. We achieve the perfect balance by
"weighting" the positions by the fraction of the total
mass that is located there. Accordingly, we define the
center of mass:

      \bar
   x_{cm}=(\frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2})x_1+(\frac{m_2}{m_1+
   m_2})x_2=\frac{m_1x_1+m_2x_2}{M_{system}}

                                          7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects | 565
          If there are more than two particles, we simply add all
       of them into the sum in the numerator. To extend this
       definition of the center of mass into three dimensions,
       we simply need to do the same things in the y and
       z directions. A position vector for the center of mass of
       a system of many particles would then be:

             \vec{r}_{cm}=\bar x_{cm}\underline{\hat{i}}+\bar
          y_{cm}\underline{\hat{ j}}+ \bar
          z_{cm}\underline{\hat{k}}\\=\frac{[m_1 x_1+m_2
          x_2+...]}{M}\underline{\hat{i}}+\frac{[m_1y_1+m_2y_2
          +...]}{M}\underline{\hat{ j}}+\frac{[m_1 z_1+m_2
          z_2+...]}{M}\underline{\hat{k}}\\=\frac{m_1[x_1\
          underline{\hat{i}}+y_1\underline{\hat{ j}}+z_1\
          underline{\hat{k}}]+m_2[x_2\underline{\hat{i}}+y_2\
          underline{\hat{ j}}+z_2\
          underline{\hat{k}}]+...}{M}\\=\frac{m_1\vec r_1+m_2\
          vec r_2+...}{M}

Example 2:

          Suppose three point masses are placed in the x-y plane
       as follows (assume coordinates are given in meters):

            · m1 = 2 kg placed at (-1, 3)m,
            · m2 = 6 kg placed at (1, 1)m, and
            · m3 = 4 kg placed at (2, -2)m.
          Find the center of mass of the system.
          Solution
       First, we calculate the total mass of the system:

             m = \sum_{i=1}^3 m_i = (2 + 6 + 4) kg = 12 kg
          Next, we find the moments with respect to the x- and
       y-axes:

             M_x =\sum_{i=1}^3 m_i *x_i \\\qquad \quad =
          (2kg)*(-1m) + (6kg)*(1m)+(4kg)*(2m) \\\qquad\quad =
          (-2+6+8)kg*m \\\qquad\quad = 12 kg*m

             M_y =\sum_{i=1}^3 m_i *y_i \\\qquad \quad =
          (2kg)*(3m) + (6kg)*(1m)+(4kg)*(-2m) \\\qquad\quad =
          (6+6-8)kg*m \\\qquad\quad = 4 kg*m
          Then we have

             \bar{x} = \frac{M_x}{m} = \frac{12 kgm}{12m} = 1 m
             \bar{y} = \frac{M_y}{m} = \frac{4 kgm}{12m} = 0.333
          m

          The center of mass of the system is: (1, 0.333)m.

7.1.3 The Center of Mass of a Thin Uniform
Rod (Calculus Method)

          Quite often, when the finding of the position of the
       center of mass of a distribution of particles is called for,
       the distribution of particles is the set of particles
       making up a rigid body. The easiest rigid body for which
       to calculate the center of mass is the thin rod because it
       extends in only one dimension. (Here, we discuss an
       ideal thin rod. A physical thin rod must have some
       nonzero diameter. The ideal thin rod, however, is a good
       approximation to the physical thin rod as long as the
       diameter of the rod is small compared to its length.)

          In the simplest case, the calculation of the position of
       the center of mass is trivial. The simplest case involves a
       uniform thin rod. A uniform thin rod is one for which
       the linear mass density µ, the mass per length of the
       rod, has one and the same value at all points on the rod.
       The center of mass of a uniform rod is at the center of
       the rod. So, for instance, the center of mass of a uniform

568 | 7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects
rod that extends along the x-axis from x = 0 to x = L is at
(L/2, 0).

   The linear mass density µ, typically called linear
density when the context is clear, is a measure of how
closely packed the elementary particles making up the
rod are. Where the linear density is high, the particles
are close together.

   To picture what is meant by a non-uniform rod, a rod
whose linear density is a function of position, imagine a
thin rod made of an alloy consisting of lead and
aluminum. Further imagine that the percentage of lead
in the rod varies smoothly from 0% at one end of the
rod to 100% at the other. The linear density of such a
rod would be a function of the position along the length
of the rod. A one-millimeter segment of the rod at one
position would have a different mass than that of a one-
millimeter segment of the rod at a different position.

   People with some exposure to calculus have an easier
time understanding what linear density is than calculus-
deprived individuals do because linear density is just the
ratio of the amount of mass in a rod segment to the
length of the segment, in the limit as the length of the
segment goes to zero. Consider a rod that extends from
0 to L along the x-axis. Now, suppose that ms(x) is the
mass of that segment of the rod extending from 0 to ,x
where x  0 but x < L. Then, the linear density of the rod
at any point x along the rod is just dm8/dx evaluated at
the value of x in question.

7.1.4 The Center of Mass of a Non-Uniform
Rod

          Now that you have a good idea of what we mean by
       linear mass density, we are going to illustrate how one
       determines the position of the center of mass of a non-
       uniform thin rod by means of an example.

570 | 7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects
 Example 3:

   Find the position of the center of mass of a thin rod that
extends from 0 to 0.890 m along the x-axis of a Cartesian
coordinate system and has a linear density given by µ =
0.650 kg/m3

   In order to be able to determine the position of the
center of mass of a rod with a given length and a given
linear density as a function of position, you first need to
be able to find the mass of such a rod. To do that, one
might be tempted to use a method that works only for
the special case of a uniform rod, namely, to try using m
= µL with L being the length of the rod. The problem
with this is that µ varies along the entire length of the
rod. What value would one use for µ? One might be
tempted to evaluate the given µ at x = L and use that,
but that would be acting as if the linear density were
constant at µ = µ(L). It is not. In fact, in the case at hand,
µ(L) is the maximum linear density of the rod; it only has
that value at one point on the rod.

   Instead, using integration, we find the equation:

                              m=\frac{bL^3}{3}
   That can now be used to calculate the mass of a
nonlinear rod. The value of L is given as 0.890 m, and we
defined b to be the constant 0.650 kg/m3, therefore

      m=\frac{0.650\
   frac{kg}{m^3}(0.890m)^3}{3}\\m=0.1527kg

                                           7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects | 571
          That's a value that will come in handy when we
       calculate the position of the center of mass.

          Now, when we calculated the center of mass of a set
       of discrete particles (where a discrete particle is one
       that is by itself, as opposed, for instance, to being part of
       a rigid body) we just carried out a weighted sum in
       which each term was the position of a particle times its
       weighting factor and the weighting factor was that
       fraction, of the total mass, represented by the mass of
       the particle. We carry out a similar procedure for a
       continuous distribution of mass such as that which
       makes up the rod in question.

          Once again, using integration, we find the equation:
                                \bar{x}=\frac{bL^4}{4m}

          Now we substitute variables with values; the mass m
       of the rod that we found earlier, the constant b that we
       defined to simplify the appearance of the linear density
       function, and the given length L of the rod:

             m= \frac{\left( 0.650\frac{kg}{m^3} \right)
          (0.890m)^4}{4(0.1527kg)}\\\bar{x}=0.668m
          This is our final answer for the position of the center
       of mass. Note that it is closer to the denser end of the
       rod, as we would expect.

572 | 7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects
Key Takeaways
   Basically: When there are multiple objects, the center of

mass is the location in the x, y, and z directions between
the objects.

   Application: To calculate the acceleration or use F = ma,
m is the total mass at the center of mass.

   Looking Ahead: The next section will look at how to
calculate the center of mass for a complex object.

                                              7.1 Center of Mass: Single Objects | 573
7.2 Center of Mass:
Composite Shapes

Instead of integrating to find the center of mass, we can split an
object up into recognizable shapes to determine the center of mass.
This is faster than the integration method, and allows for many
different ways to find the answer.

   In this section, the terms `centroid' and `center of mass' are used,
somewhat interchangeably. The centroid is the geometric center.
The center of mass takes into account the density of an object. If the
density is the same throughout an object, then the centroid is the
same as the center of mass. For the rigid beams we will be looking at
in statics, the centroid is at the same location as the center of mass.

7.2.1 Centroid Tables

We use the centroid tables that are listed below to combine the
locations of the centers of mass for each shape. Approximations are
needed as real-life objects are rarely perfectly square or circular, but
if they are symmetric, it makes it easier to approximate.

   The locations of the center of mass (rcm) are as follows. The

where it would be for a square:

                   \underline{\vec r}_{cm} = [3.4cm, 3.4cm, 0].

7.2.2 Composite Shapes

To find the center of mass of an object, you:

 1. Define an origin
2. Split the object up into recognizable shapes
3. Find the center of mass (cm) of each shape from the origin
4. Calculate the mass of each part: \rho = \frac{m}{V} (To find the

      centroid, this step can be skipped and only the area or volume
      is used).
5. Use the weighted cm equations to find the x cm. Repeat for y
      and z.

\bar x=\frac{\sum m_i x_i}{\sum m_i} \qquad \bar
y=\frac{\sum m_i y_i}{\sum m_i} \qquad \bar z=\frac{\sum m_i
z_i}{\sum m_i}

          Start the process by labelling an origin point and axes
       on your shape. It will be important to measure all
       locations from the same point. Next, we must break our
       complex shape down into several simpler shapes. This
       may include areas or volumes (which we will count as
       positive areas or volumes) or holes (which we will count
       as negative areas or volumes). Each of these shapes will

                                             7.2 Center of Mass: Composite Shapes | 581
       have a centroid () or center of mass () listed on the
       diagram.

                For the shape shown at the top, we can break it down
                into a rectangle (1), a right triangle (2), and a circular
                hole (3). Each of these simple shapes is something we
                have listed in the centroid table to the right.

          Once we have identified the different parts, we will
       create a table listing the area or volume of each piece,
       and the  and  centroid coordinates (or , , and 
       coordinates in 3D). It is important to remember that
       each coordinate you list should be relative to the same
       base origin point that you drew earlier. You may need to
       mentally adjust diagrams in the centroid tables so that
       the shape is oriented in the right direction and account
       for the placement of the shape relative to the axes in
       your diagram.

582 | 7.2 Center of Mass: Composite Shapes
For each of the shapes, we need to find the area and the x and y
coordinates of the centroid. Remember to find the centroid
coordinates relative to a single set of axes that is the same for all
shapes.

   Once you have the areas and centroid coordinates for
each shape relative to your origin point, you can find the
 and  coordinates of the centroid for the overall shape
with the following formulas. Remember that areas or
volumes for any shape that is a hole or cutout in the
design will be a negative area in your formula.

                     \bar x=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i
                x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^nm_i} \qquad \bar
      y=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^nm_i}
   This generalized formula to find the centroid's -

                                    7.2 Center of Mass: Composite Shapes | 583
       location is simply Area 1 times \bar x_1 plus Area 2
       times \bar x_2, plus Area 3 times \bar x_3, adding
       up as many shapes as you have in this fashion and then
       dividing by the overall area of your combined shape. The
       equations are the same for the -location of the overall
       centroid, except you will instead be using \bar y
       -values in your equations.

          For centroids in three dimensions, we will simply use
       volumes in place of areas, and we will have a 
       coordinate for our centroid as well as the  and 
       coordinates.

However, to find the center of mass, the density was used to
calculate the mass of each object individually: \rho = \frac{m}{V}.

     Key Takeaways

             Basically, When there are complicated shapes, the
          center of mass can be found by breaking the shape up
          into better-known shapes.

             Application: To calculate the inertia of an object
          rotating about its center of mass, you will need to
          know where the center of mass is.

             Looking Ahead: The next section will look at types
          of inertia.

7.3 Types of Inertia

There are multiple kinds of inertia. In this course, when we talk
about inertia, we usually refer to the mass moment of inertia. For
this course, you need to know the names of three types of moment
of inertia (MOI), when to use each, and the units for each.

   Area moment of inertia is used in structures to determine how
stiff a beam is or how much it will deflect. The unit is m4 or ft4.

   Product moment of inertia is a shaft's resistance to torsion (or
twisting). The unit is m4 or ft4.

The mass moment of inertia is the rotational equivalent of mass.
A really heavy object is hard to move, hence it resists motion. An
object with a really big inertia is hard to rotate, hence it resists
rotation. Inertia is a quantity of how mass is distributed around a
body, such as an ice skater spinning with their arms in or spread
out. The unit is kgm2 or slugft2. We will talk more about the mass
moment of inertia in the next sections.

                                Here is a table summarizing the three

                             types of inertia:

590 | 7.3 Types of Inertia
   A moment integral, as the name implies, is the
general concept using integration to determine the net
moment of a force that is spread over an area or volume.
Because moments are generally a force times a distance,
and because distributed forces are spread out over a
range of distances, we will need to use calculus to
determine the net moment exerted by a distributed
force.

                            \int M = \int f (d) * d

   Beyond the most literal definition of a moment
integral, the term `moment integral' is also generally
applied to the process of integrating distributed areas or
masses that will be resisting some moment about a set
axis.

   Some of the applications of moment integrals include:

   1. Finding point loads that are equivalent to
        distributed loads (the equivalent point load)

   2. Finding the centroid (geometric center) or
        center of mass for 2D and 3D shapes.

   3. Finding the area moment of inertia for a beam
        cross section, which will be one factor in that
        beam's resistance to bending.

   4. Finding the polar area moment of inertia for a
        shaft cross section, which will be one factor in
        that shaft's resistance to torsion.

   5. Finding the mass moment of inertia indicates a
        body's resistance to angular accelerations.

   When looking at moment integrals, there are a
number of different types of moment integrals. These

                                                               7.3 Types of Inertia | 591
       will include moment integrals in one dimension, two
       dimensions, and three dimensions, moment integrals of
       force functions, of areas/volumes, or of mass
       distributions, first-order or second-order moment
       integrals, and rectangular or polar moment integrals.

          Any combination of these different types is possible
       (for example, a first, rectangular, 2D, area moment
       integral or a second, polar, 3D, mass moment integral).
       However, only some combinations will have practical
       applications and will be discussed in detail on future
       pages.

      1D, 2D, and 3D Moment Integrals

          Technically, we can take the moment integral in any
       number of dimensions, but for practical purposes, we
       will never deal with moment integrals beyond 3
       dimensions. The number of dimensions will affect the
       complexity of the calculations (with 3D Moment
       integrals being the most involved than 1D or 2D moment
       integrals), but the nature of the problem will dictate the
       dimensions needed. Often, this is not listed in the type
       of moment integral, requiring you to assume the type
       based on the context of the problem.

       Force, Area/Volume, and Mass Moments Integrals

          The next distinction in moment integrals regards

592 | 7.3 Types of Inertia
what we are integrating. Generally, we can integrate
force functions over some distance, area, or volume, we
can integrate the area or volume function itself, or we
can integrate the mass distribution over the area or
volume. Each of these types of moment integrals has a
different purpose and will start with a different
mathematical function to integrate, but the integration
process beyond that will be very similar.

  First vs. Second Moments Integrals

   For moment integrals, we will always be multiplying
the force function, area or volume function, of the mass
distribution function by a distance, or a distance
squared. First moment integrals just multiply the initial
function by the distance, while second moment
integrals multiply the function by the distance squared.
Again, the type of moment integral we will use depends
upon our application, with things like equivalent point
load, centroids, and center of mass relying on first
moment integrals, and area moments of inertia, polar
moments of inertia, and mass moments of inertia relying
on second moment integrals. As you can probably
deduce from this list, second moment integrals are
often labelled as a `moment of inertia`

  Rectangular vs. Polar Moments Integrals

   Finally, we will talk about rectangular moments

                                                              7.3 Types of Inertia | 593
       integrals versus polar moments integrals. This is a
       difference in how we define the distance in our moment
       integral. Let's start with the distinction in 2D. If our
       distance is measured from some axis (for example the x-
       axis, or the y-axis) then it is a rectangular moment
       integral. If on the other hand the distance is measured
       from some point (such as the origin) then it is a polar
       moment integral.

        In 2D, if we measure the distance from some axis (similar to what
        x and y do here), then we have a rectangular moment integral. If
        we measure the distance from some point (such as r does) then
        we have a polar moment integral.

          This distinction is important for how we will take the
       integral. For rectangular moment integrals, we will move
       left to right or bottom to top. For polar moment
       integrals, we will instead take the integral by radiating
       out from the center point.

594 | 7.3 Types of Inertia
     In three-dimensional problems, the definitions
  change slightly. For rectangular moment integrals, the
  distance will be measured from some plane (such as the
  xy plane, xz plane, or yz plane). Again, we will integrate
  left to right, bottom to top, or now back to front, with
  distances corresponding to the x, y or z coordinates of
  that point. For a polar moment integrals, the distance
  will be measured from some axis (such as the x, y, or z
  axis), and we will integrate by radiating outward from
  that axis.

Key Takeaways

   Basically: There are many types of inertia, including area,
product, and mass. They have different units and represent
different physical quantities of an object.

   Application: A beam's resistance to bending (area moment
of inertia), a shaft's resistance to torsion (product/polar
moment of inertia), and an object's resistance to rotation
(mass moment of inertia).

   Looking Ahead: Area and product moment of inertia will
be covered more in structures. The mass moment of inertia

     is used in statics and dynamics. The next section will look
     at how to calculate the mass moment of inertia.

596 | 7.3 Types of Inertia
7.4 Mass Moment of Inertia

7.4.1 Intro to Mass Moment of Inertia

Mass moment of inertia, or inertia as it will be referred to from here
on, is resistance to rotation. The bigger the inertia, the slower the
rotation. \sum M = I\alpha. Inertia is always positive and has units
of kgm2 or slugft2.

   For an infinitesimal unit of mass, the inertia depends on how far
it is from the axis of rotation.

                                     I = \int_m r^2dm
   As shown in this image, each little dm at a distance r from the axis
of rotation (y) is added up (through integration). If r is bigger, the
inertia is bigger.

   If there is more mass closer to the axis of rotation, the inertia
                                                            7.4 Mass Moment of Inertia | 597
is smaller. A skill that you can develop is your visualization of the
rotation about each axis. As shown in the following figure, rotating
about the different axes will produce different types of rotation.
You can imagine sticking your pencil into an object and twisting
along that axis. In this image, rotation about the y-axis and x-axis
produces different types of rotation. Due to the symmetry, rotation
about the x-axis and z-axis looks identical.

   The red r's in this image show the distance that is being measured
when adding up each little infinitesimal dm. Notice how the r
changes direction from x to y, but looks the same between x and z.

   Equations have been developed for common shapes so that you
don't have to integrate every time you want to find the inertia of an
object. The result is different for each axis, as shown in the following
figure.

598 | 7.4 Mass Moment of Inertia
   `Ixx` can be read as `the inertia if rotating about the x-axis'. Notice
for Ixx and Izz that the height and radius of the cylinder affect the
inertia, whereas for Iyy, only the radius is considered.

   The equations for each of the objects are listed in a table below.
The first is a second explanation of inertia.

          We start by constructing, in our minds, an idealized
       object for which the mass is all concentrated at a single
       location, which is not on the axis of rotation: Imagine a
       massless disk rotating about an axis through the center
       of the disk and perpendicular to its faces.
       Let there be a particle of mass m embedded in the disk
       at a distance r from the axis of rotation. Here's what it
       looks like from a viewpoint on the axis of rotation, some
       distance away from the disk:

                                                           7.4 Mass Moment of Inertia | 599
          where the axis of rotation is marked with an O.
       Because the disk is massless, we call the moment of
       inertia of the construction the moment of inertia of a
       particle with respect to rotation about an axis from
       which the particle is a distance r.

                                            I = mr2
          The equation above is our equation for the moment of
       inertia of a particle of mass m, with respect to an axis of
       rotation from which the particle is a distance r.
          Now, suppose we have two particles embedded in our
       massless disk, one of mass m1 at a distance r1 from the
       axis of rotation and another of mass m2 at a distance r2
       from the axis of rotation.

600 | 7.4 Mass Moment of Inertia
   The moment of inertia of the first one by itself would
be

                                  I1 = m1r12
   and the moment of inertia of the second particle by
itself would be

                                  I2 = m2r22
   The total moment of inertia of the two particles
embedded in the massless disk is simply the sum of the
two individual moments of inertia.

                                   I = I1 + I2
                             I = m1r12 + m2r22

          This concept can be extended to include any number
       of particles. For each additional particle, one simply
       includes another miri2 term in the sum where mi is the
       mass of the additional particle and ri is the distance that
       the additional particle is from the axis of rotation. In the
       case of a rigid object, we subdivide the object into an
       infinite set of infinitesimal mass elements dm. Each
       mass element contributes an amount of moment of
       inertia

                                          dI = r2dm
          to the moment of inertia of the object, where r is the
       distance that the particular mass element is from the
       axis of rotation.

7.4.3 Radius of Gyration

A concept called the radius of gyration (k) converts a shape into
a thin ring. This is used for particularly complex shapes. If a
homework problem says `the radius of gyration k = 15 cm', that
means if the shape were a thin ring, it would have a radius of 15 cm.
You calculate the mass moment of inertia using the ring equation:
I = mk^2
606 | 7.4 Mass Moment of Inertia
                                       \qquad I = mk^2

Source:                                   For example, if the mass of an
https://phys.libretexts.org/@go/page/  object is m=10 kg, the radius of
18431

                                       gyration is 5 m, then the inertia

is:
                      I = mk2 = 10 kg * 5 m * 5 m = 250 kgm2.

To find the radius of gyration:

k=\sqrt{\frac{I}{m}}=\sqrt{\frac{250 kgm^2}{10kg}} = 5 m

Key Takeaways

   Basically: Mass moment of inertia is an object's
resistance to rotation and is impacted by mass and
distance from the axis of rotation.

   Application: The speed at which something rotates,
such as a satellite spinning in space, is impacted by
its inertia. A bigger inertia has a smaller angular
acceleration. A smaller inertia allows for a larger
angular acceleration.

   Looking Ahead: This will be used throughout
dynamics. The next section looks at calculating the

There are two great uses for the parallel axis theorem:
   1. Finding the inertia of a complex object with multiple parts.

2. Rotating an object about an axis other than through the center of
mass (y')

To begin with, the parallel axis theorem is equal to the inertia about
the center of mass (Icm) plus the distance between the axes of
rotation squared times the mass.

      I=I_{cm}+md^2

Example 1:

For a disk, the distance between axes y and y' is d and the
I_{cm} = \frac{1}{2}mr^2.

     I=I_{cm}+md^2 = \frac{1}{2}mr^2+mr^2 = \frac{3}{2}mr^2
   You will need the table of common geometric shapes in the
previous section to find the Icm for each object.

            · I is the moment of inertia of an object with
                respect to an axis from which the center of mass
                of the object is a distance d.

            · ICM is the moment of inertia of the object with
                respect to an axis that is parallel to the first axis
                and passes through the center of mass.

            · m is the mass of the object.
            · d is the distance between the two axes.
          The parallel axis theorem relates the moment of
       inertia ICM of an object, with respect to an axis through
       the center of mass of the object, to the moment of
       inertia I of the same object, with respect to an axis that
       is parallel to the axis through the center of mass and is
       at a distance d from the axis through the center of mass.
          A conceptual statement made by the parallel axis

       theorem is one that you probably could have arrived at
       by means of common sense, namely that the moment of
       inertia of an object with respect to an axis through the
       center of mass is smaller than the moment of inertia
       about any axis parallel to that one. As you know, the
       closer the mass is "packed" to the axis of rotation, the
       smaller the moment of inertia; and; for a given object,
       per definition of the center of mass, the mass is packed
       most closely to the axis of rotation when the axis of
       rotation passes through the center of mass. The PAT is
       visually shown below, as z represents the axis on which
       the objects COM rotates about, z' is the axis it is now
       going to rotate about, and d is the distance between
       these two axis'.

Steps for finding the MMOI of an object

 1. Determine the shape of the object (or shapes, if it a composite
      object).

2. Determine which axis the object is rotating about.
3. Find the center of mass for each individual shape.
4. Find the ICM (inertia about its center of mass) for each shape.
5. Determine the distance from the CM of the shapes to the axis

      of rotation.
6. Use the Parallel Axis Theorem to find the inertia for each

      shape.
 7. Add up all these individuals inertias to find IT.

Example 2:

Find the moment of inertia of a uniform rod with ICM=0.05kgm2,
L=0.08m, and mass=0.250kg, with respect to an axis that is
perpendicular to the rod and passes through at 1/4 of the length of the
rod.

   We know the distance (d) to be L/4 = 0.08m / 4 = 0.02m away
from the z axis. Here we present the solution to the problem:

                                 I=ICM + md2
                                 I=0.05 kgm2 + (0.250kg)(0.02m)2
                                 I=0.0501 kgm2

Organize the known and unknown data in a table to complete as you
go:

   Find the center of mass:
  · For each sphere, the rcm is 0.3m + 1/2 radius = 0.3m + 1/2

      (0.2m) = 0.4m
614 | 7.5 Inertia Intro: Parallel Axis Theorem
  · For the bar, the rcm is at 0.

Find the inertia about the center of mass for each shape separately.
Use the rectangle equation:

   For the sphere:
      I_{cm-sph}=\frac{2}{5}mr^2 =\frac{2}{5}*(40kg)*(0.1m)^2 \\

   \qquad \quad =0.16kgm^2

For the rod,

I_{cm-rod}=\frac{1}{12}ml^2                                   =

\frac{1}{12}*(20kg)*(0.6m)^2\\\qquad \quad = 0.6 kgm^2

              7.5 Inertia Intro: Parallel Axis Theorem | 615
   Next, the parallel axis theorem is needed to change the axis of
rotation from the cm of the sphere to the system cm. The distance
between axes of rotation is 0.3m + 1/2 radius = 0.3m + 1/2 (0.2m) =
0.4m

      I_{o-sph}=I_{cm-sph}+md^2 = 0.16 kgm^2 + (40kg)*(0.4m)^2
   \\\qquad \quad = 6.56kgm^2
   Finally, add up the parts: the 2 spheres and the cm of the rod:

      I_{total} = 2 * I_{o-sph}+I_{cm-rod}\\\qquad \quad = 2*(6.56
   kgm^2) + (0.6 kgm^2)\\\qquad \underline{I_{total} = 13.72

                  A figure skater with a mass of 60 kg is
               about to perform a spin about her long axis
               (z). She is 167 cm tall, and her body can be

   4. Approach

   I'll be using MMOI for circular cylinders, as well as the
sum of moments/torque equaling MMOI times angular
acceleration, as well as acceleration equaling change in
velocity over time.

   5. Analysis

   Part a:

   Step 1: Find the inertia when the arms are hugged to the
body

   Izz1 = 0.5 (60kg) (0.15m)2
   Izz1= 0.675 kg m2

                                                                        7.7 Examples | 631
          Step 2: Find the inertia when the arms are spread out
          Izz2 = 0.5(60kg)(0.3m)2
          Izz2 = 2.7 kg m2

          Step 3: Find the angular acceleration for both cases
          M = I ; therefore, M/I = 

          1 = M / Izz1
          1 = 200 Nm / 0.675 kg m2
          1  296.296 rad/sec2

          2 = M / Izz2
          2 = 200Nm/2.7 kg m2
          2  74.074 rad/sec2

          The acceleration when the skater had her arms close
       to her body was about 296 rad/sec2, while that when
       she had her arms spread out was about 74 rad/sec2.
       Therefore, having her limbs closer to her body will give
       her a much higher angular acceleration!

          As seen in the equation Izz = ½ m r2, her height is
       arbitrary; thus, lowering her height would not change
       the inertia, nor would it change her angular
       acceleration.

632 | 7.7 Examples
   Part b:
    = /t therefore *t = 

   1 = 296.296 s-2(0.5s)
   1 = 148.148 rad/sec

   2 = 74.074 s-2(0.5s)
   2 = 37.037 rad/sec

   Given that these are in radians per second, let's
convert this to rotations per second to make it more
meaningful. To do so, simply divide by 2 since there are
2 radians per rotation. Thus, with her arms in, she can
achieve about 23.6 rotations per second after 0.5
seconds of acceleration, compared to about 5.9
rotations per second with her limbs out. This is on par
with an Olympian, according to this site.

   6. Review
   It makes sense that they spin faster when their limbs
are hugged to their body; we can try this at home with a
swivel chair!

          1. Problem

                  Two rectangular compost containers are

               mass. Container A has a mass of 5 kg with a

               container B is of 8kg, height 2m, and width
               3m. Consider the point which is the center of
               the chain as the origin of the coordinate
               frame to find the center of mass, center of
               gravity, and centroid of the system and the

   4. Approach
   Use equations for the center of mass, the center of
gravity, and the centroid. utilizing the advantage of
symmetry whenever possible.

636 | 7.7 Examples
   5. Analysis
   FINDING CENTER OF MASS
   Calculate the centre of mass of box A. Because it is
symmetrical, you divide the height and width by 2 and
add the distance from O.

      \bar{x_A}=\frac{w_A}{2}+1 = 2 m
      \bar{y_A}=\frac{h_A}{2} = 0.5 m
   Thus, in vector form center of mass of container A is
   {cm_A}=\begin{bmatrix} 2 m\\ 0.5 m\end{bmatrix}
   Calculate the centre of mass of box B. Because it is
symmetrical, you divide the height and width by 2, and
add the distance from O.
      \bar{x_B}=\frac{-w_B}{2}-1 \\=\frac{-3}{2}-1 =-2.5 m
      \bar{y_B}=\frac{h_B}{2} = 1 m
   In vector form,
   {cm_B}=\begin{bmatrix} -2.5 m\\ 1 m\end{bmatrix}
   Calculate the system centre of mass in x:
      cm_{sx} = \frac {{m_A} \cdot \bar{x}_{ax} +m_B\
   cdot \bar{x}_{bx}} {m_A+m_B}\\ = \frac{5kg \cdot2m
   +8kg\cdot(-2.5)m }{5 kg +8kg}\\ = -0.769 m
Calculate the System centre of mass in y:
   cm_{sy} = \frac {{m_A} \cdot \bar{x}_{ay} +m_B\
cdot \bar{x}_{by}} {m_A+m_B}\\ = \frac{5kg \cdot
0.5m +8kg\cdot 1m }{5 kg +8kg}\\ = 0.808m
   In vector format center of mass of the system:
      {cm_S}=\begin{bmatrix}-0.769 m \\0.808 m
   \end{bmatrix}
   FINDING CENTER OF GRAVITY
   The center of gravity of container A and container B is
the same as the center of mass due to the uniform
rectangular shape and orientation.

                                                                        7.7 Examples | 637
          Thus
             cg_{A} =\begin{bmatrix}2 m \\ 0.5 m\end{bmatrix}

          similarly,
          cg_{B} =\begin{bmatrix}-2.5 m \\ 1 m\end{bmatrix}
          Since the system has a uniform gravitational field and
       constant density, the system's centre of gravity is equal
       to that of the centre of mass found above.
          Thus

                       {cg_S}=\begin{bmatrix}-0.769\\0.808 m
                                        \end{bmatrix}

          FINDING CENTROID
          Similar to the center of gravity, the centroid of
       individual containers is also the same as the center of
       mass of the individual containers due to the uniform
       shape of the containers.
          In this specific problem, where the containers are of
       simple uniform rectangular shape, we can consider the
       symmetry and the dimensions of the system to find the
       centroid of the system.

          Since the system has a rectangular shape, the
       centroid would be the geometrical center. The vector

          \overrightarrow{r_S}(blue vector line in the above
       diagram) can be found from the following equation

638 | 7.7 Examples
       derived from the above image.
             \overrightarrow{r_{Sx}} = \frac{t_s}{2}- w_B\\=

          \frac{7m}{2}-3 m\\= 0.5 m
       ; here tS is the total width of the system.

             \overrightarrow{r_{Sy}} =\frac{h_B}{2}\\ = 1m
          In vector form,
          \overrightarrow{r_S}=\begin{bmatrix}0.5m\\1 m
       \end{bmatrix}
          6. Review
          The centre of gravity being the same as the centre of
       mass is due to only looking at this problem in 2D. The
       requirements for the centre of mass and the centre of
       gravity being equal have been fulfilled.

          The answer makes sense because it is close to where
       the torso is, and it has the most mass. It is a little lower
       than the torso, which makes sense as this pose would
       lower the center of gravity.

          x} \cdot m_{cut})}{m_2}
             CM_{cx} = \frac{(0cm \cdot 50.87kg) + (-3cm \cdot

          -22.6kg)}{28.27kg}
             CM_{cx} = 2.4cm

          Both the center of mass of the full circle and the cut
       in the y-direction are 0cm, giving the center of mass of
       the crescent in the y-direction also 0cm.

          The complete center of mass of the crescent is
       therefore:
       CMc = [2.4cm, 0cm]

          6. Review:
          The center of mass of the crescent leans to the side
       with more mass, as one would expect. The mass and

       center of mass found are both in the expected units
       with a reasonable magnitude.

Example 7.6.7: Mass moment of inertia,
Submitted by Michael Oppong-Ampomah

          1. Problem

                  An empty tissue paper roll rolls down an
               angled floor. If the tissue paper roll weighs 2
               lbs, has and inner radius 0.9 inches, total
               diameter 2 inches, and a length of 12 inches,
               then calculate the mass moment of inertia of
               the roll.

          2. Draw

                                                                                7.7 Examples | 653
          3. Knowns and Unknowns
          Knowns:
          w = 2 lbs
          Inner radius r1 = 0.9 in
          Outer radius r2 = 1 in
          h=12 in

          Unknowns:
          Mass moment of inertia
          4. Approach
          Finding the mass of the roll, identifying the axis of

654 | 7.7 Examples
rotation, and applying the corresponding mass moment
of inertia of the cylinder.

      I_{x}= \frac{1}{2} m(r_{1}^2 + r_{2}^2)
      I_{y}= I_{z}= \frac{1}{12} m[3(r_{1}^2 + r_{2}^2)+h^2]
   5. Analysis
   weight of the roll = 2 lb
   mass of the roll,
   m = \frac{2 lb}{32.2 ft/s^2} = 0.062 lb
   Since we used constant of gravity with a unit of
   ft/ s^2 it is important to convert other values from
inches to ft.
      0.9 in = \frac{0.9}{12}=0.075 ft
      1 in =\frac{1}{12} = 0.083 ft
      12 in = 1 ft
   now, I_{x}= \frac{1}{2} m(r_{1}^2 + r_{2}^2)
      I_{x} = \frac{1}{2} 0.062(0.075^2 + 0.083^2) = 0.00039
   \quad lb ft^2
      I_{y}= I_{z}= \frac{1}{12} m[3(r_{1}^2 + r_{2}^2)+h^2]
      I_{y}= I_{z}= \frac{1}{12} 0.062[3(0.075^2 +
   0.083^2)+1^2] =0.0054 \quad lb ft^2
   6. Review
   Although the weight of an empty paper roll is
exaggerated for easier calculation, the answers make
sense. The value of Iy is higher than Ix, which means
more force will be needed for rotation in that axis. From
this, it is important to note that the roll will rotate along

                                                                       7.7 Examples | 655
       the x-axis. Also note that weight is converted to mass,
       and units must be the same.
