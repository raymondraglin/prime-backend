Introduction

R.C. Alderliesten

Introductions into aerospace comprise the introduction into many aerospace related
disciplines, and their interrelations. The major message generally is that an optimum
in aerospace constitutes compromises the related disciplines. Similarly, aerospace
materials and structures represent a field in which structural engineering, material
science and manufacturing contribute equally, making trade-offs and compromises
necessary.
This textbook is written to fill the gap between these general introductions into
aviation and textbooks covering either material science, mechanics of materials or
structural analyses. Where the first are deemed insufficient to cover the basic aspects
of these disciplines, the latter miss the relevant interrelations between the disciplines.
Students are warned prior to reading this book; the field of aerospace structures and
materials is not solely exact science or engineering. Chapters are presented that are
indeed rather scientific or engineering of nature (solid material physics, and structural
analysis) allowing for theories or solutions based on formulas and equations, but
other chapters are more qualitative and philosophical (safety, manufacturability,
availability and costing). Students should be aware that in the long end, decisions
made within the field of aerospace structures and materials are often dictated by
these soft considerations rather than hard core engineering. The main objective of
this textbook therefore, is to create awareness and a critical mind-set to aid the
student when pursuing a study in aerospace engineering.
This book forms an update of a course reader that I wrote many years ago. Publishing
this book has been made possible with the help of many. In particular I would like to
thank my colleague Gillian Saunders-Smits for coordinating and contributing to the
process and suggestions for additions, Hilde Broekhuis for converting the reader text
to the book format, editing and updating the illustrations, Calvin Rans, Urban Avsec
and Katharina Ertman for assisting in finding and creating illustrations, Renée van de

Watering and Cora Bijsterveld for their help with copyright, and the staff of the TU Delft

Open Online Course "Introduction to Aerospace Structures & Materials" on edX whose
critical reading eliminated many small errors. The quality of this textbook is to great
extent a result from their effort and criticism, which I greatly appreciate.

1. Material physics & properties

1.1 Introduction

This chapter will discuss the elementary physics of materials related to the loads
acting on a material and as a consequence their response. The response is related
to physical properties of materials which can substantially differ from one material
to another. This chapter highlights some of the differences in the material properties
that are observed in commonly used structural materials.

Figure 1.1
Illustration of a spring loaded with load P and its subsequent load-elongation diagram (Alderliesten, 2011, 1-1.jpg.
Own Work)

When applying a load P to a spring with length L, it will elongate with , Figure 1.1.
This elongation relates linearly to the applied load P and is often formulated as

                                                                                               (1.1)
where k is called the spring constant. While loading the spring, one may observe that
the diameter of the spring becomes smaller, the longer the spring is stretched. This
loaded spring represents the elastic behaviour of materials in general when loaded
uni-axially; for given load the material will elongate, while the cross-section becomes
slightly smaller.

1.2 Stress-strain

The material behaviour referred to earlier is represented by other parameters than
elongation and load, because the magnitude of the load for a given elongation
(represented by for example a spring constant, k), depends on the shape or geometry
of the material. Different geometries or original lengths of the same material will
thus give different load-displacement curves, which is inconvenient when comparing
materials.
The parameters used to evaluate the material properties are selected based on what
is called the similitude principle. To physically equate the proportional relationship
between load and material response, dimensional aspects should be left out of the
equation.

   Example: Elongation

        Figure 1.2
    Illustration of the geometry influence on the force displacement response (Alderliesten, 2011, 1-2.jpg.
    Own work.)
                                                  Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 5

   Consider the three samples illustrated in Figure 1.2. To elongate the samples (a)
   and (b) equally, the load F applied on sample (b) should be twice as large as on
   sample (a). In the force-displacement diagram this results in a curve for sample
   (b) twice as high as sample (a). For the same applied force F, sample (c) will
   elongate twice as much as sample (a). In the diagram this results in a curve that
   is stretched twice as much as curve (a).
   Although all three samples are made of the same material, the curves appear to
   be different. To exclude the dimensional aspects from the material's response
   to load, the selected parameters should be chosen `dimensionless', i.e.
   independent of dimensions. Based upon curves (a) and (b), the force must be
   divided by the cross section of the sample, resulting in stress , and based
   upon curves (a) and (c) the elongation must be divided by the sample's length,
   resulting in the dimensionless strain .

For this reason the extension of the material is represented by strain, which is the
extension normalized by its initial length according to

                                                                                               (1.2)

Similarly, the effect of geometry is excluded by representing the load application in
terms of stresses

                                                                                               (1.3)

where A is the cross section of the material.
There are two ways to calculate the stress with equation (1.3):

  · Dividing the load by the original or initial cross-section, Ao. The stress is then
      called the engineering stress

  · Dividing the load by the actual cross-section A. The stress is then called the true
      stress

Since the actual cross-section is often not exactly known, the engineering stress is
often taken for stress analysis.

Figure 1.3
Typical stress-strain curve for a metal; initial slope is linear elastic, beyond yielding the material behaviour is plastic
(TU Delft, n.d. 1-3.jpg. Own work)

The stress with equation (1.3) can be plotted against the strain calculated with
equation (1.2), which for many elastic-plastic materials like metals, gives a curve as
illustrated in Figure 1.3.
The initial slope of the curve is linear-elastic, which means that when unloading, the
material will return to its original length and shape. Beyond a certain load, the material
will permanently deform. This transition point in the stress-strain curve is called the
yield point. Because often the yield point is a gradual transition from the linear elastic
curve into the plastic region, it is hard to determine the yield stress exactly in an equal
manner for all materials. For this reason, a common (but arbitrary) approach is to
take the intersection between the stress-strain curve and the 0.2% offset of the linear
elastic slope, illustrated with the dotted line in Figure 1.3.

1.3 Loading modes

The examples so far (i.e. elongation of spring or material) assumed a uni-axial loading
mode in tension. Often compression is assumed to be identical to tension except for
the sign (direction). These two loading modes are illustrated in Figure 1.4 together
with the shear loading and torsional loading mode. Depending on the shape of
material or structure and the load applied, the material may face either one of these
four modes, or a combination of them.

Figure 1.4
Four loading modes: compression, tension, shear and torsion (Alderliesten, 2011, 1-4.jpg. Own Work.)

1.4 Engineering terminology

The stress-strain curve illustrated in Figure 1.3 contains terminology that requires
some explanation. For that purpose, two different curves are being given in Figure 1.5.
Concerning the linear elastic part (initial slope of the curves), the slope may be either
steep (high resistance against deformation) or gentle (representing low resistance
against deformation). The first curve indicates a stiff material, whereas the second
curve indicates a flexible material.
8 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 1.5
Stress-Strain Diagram which shows the difference between stiff and flexible (high or low E-modulus, respectively)
material, soft and rigid (low or high yield stress, resp.) and small and large strain hardening (small or large
difference between ultimate and yield stress, resp.) and weak and strong material (low or high ultimate stress,
resp.) and brittle and ductile material, (low or high plastic strain resp.). (TU Delft, n.d. 1-5.jpg. Own Work)

The yield point (transition from elastic to plastic) may either be located at small values
of the stress (low yield strength) or at high values of stress (high yield strength). The
first transition point indicates a soft material, whereas the second indicates a rigid
material.
After yielding, the curves continue to increase gradually. The hypothetical case where
the material becomes fully plastic after yielding, i.e. the slope continues horizontally, is
often denoted as perfect plastic. In all other cases, there is a slope that is either rather
steep (large strain hardening) or gentle (small strain hardening).
The highest point in the stress strain curve is called the ultimate strength of a material.
If this strength value is very high, it indicates a strong material. If the strength is low, it
indicates a weak material.
Fracture occurs at the end of the curve. The elastic deformation still present causes
spring back. This is illustrated by the dotted lines parallel to the initial elastic slope
                                                  Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 9

of the curve. The remaining deformation is plastic deformation. A small degree of
plastic deformation indicates a brittle material. A high degree of plastic deformation
indicates a ductile material.
Note, that there is a fundamental difference in strength and stiffness (see Figure 1.6).

Figure 1.6
Illustration of the difference between stiffness and strength; the flexibility of the wings relates to stiffness (low
stiffness gives significant wing bending), whereas strength relates to final failure of the structure. Derivative from

1.5 Normal stress

In the case of tension and compression (see Figure 1.4) normal stresses occur in the
material. According to the sign convention, these stresses are either positive (tension)
or negative (compression). Similar to the spring constant, the relation between stress
and strain is characterized by a constant in the linear elastic part of the stress strain
curve.

                                                                                               (1.4)
The constant E is called the modulus of elasticity, or the Young's modulus. The value
of this Young's modulus is a characteristic value for a material; a high value indicates
a stiff material, a low value a flexible material.
10 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 1.7
Illustration of axial elongation and lateral contraction of a rod under uni-axial loading P (Alderliesten, 2011, 1-7.jpg.
Own Work.)

As mentioned in the introduction, the diameter of a spring becomes smaller than its
initial diameter when loaded. A similar contraction can be observed in any material
under axial loading in the linear elastic part of the curve. This transverse contraction
is illustrated in Figure 1.7.
To visualise this contraction in transverse direction, one may as a first qualitative
illustration consider the elongation of rubber. During elongation, rubber will not only
elongate but also become thinner. Elongation in lateral (loading) direction must then
be compensated by transverse contraction.
Quantitatively, this visualisation is incorrect. The exact amount of contraction during
uni-axial loading is determined by the material. The relation between the lateral and
transverse strain is represented by another constant

                                                                                               (1.5)
This constant is called the Poisson's ratio. Both the Young's modulus E and the
Poisson's ratio are considered material constants.

1.6 Shear stress

In the case of shear or torsion loading (see Figure 1.4), shear stresses occur in the
material. The shear stress is defined in a similar way as the normal stress; the force
is divided by the area A to which it is applied, see Figure 1.8.
Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 11

                                       (1.6)

The relation between the shear strain  and the shear stress is characterized by a
relation similar to equation (1.4)

                                       (1.7)

where G is the shear modulus of elasticity and the shear strain (equal to , see
Figure 1.8). For linear elastic materials, there is a relation between E and G, given by

                                       (1.8)

1.7 Bi-axial loading

In the case of elastic bi-axial loading, i.e. loads are being applied in two directions,
the stresses that occur in the material can be calculated using superposition. This
superposition is allowed, because the stress relates linearly to the load that is applied.
If two load systems are applied simultaneously, the stress may thus be
superimposed.

Illustration of a sheet loaded in either x-direction (TU Delft, n.d. 1-9.jpg. Own Work)

For the sheet loaded in x-direction (Figure 1.9), the strains in both directions can be
given by

                                                                                               (1.9)
For the sheet loaded in y-direction, the strains are given by

                                                                                              (1.10)
Superimposing both load cases, as illustrated in Figure 1.10, the stresses in equation
(1.9) and (1.10) can be superimposed. This gives

                                                                                              (1.11)
Equation (1.11) is known as the Hooke's law for a sheet in bi-axial stress condition.

1.8 Stiffness and apparent stiffness

Stiffness, expressed by the Young's modulus, is the material's resistance against
deformation, see Figure 1.5. A higher stiffness (E-modulus) means that a higher force
must be applied to obtain a specified elongation (or strain).
For a uni-axially loaded sheet, the stiffness relates directly to the Young's modulus, E.
In a bi-axially loaded situation however, the apparent stiffness may be different from
the material stiffness. This can be illustrated with the Hooke's law, given by equation
(1.11), and a wide sheet clamped at both sides over its full length and loaded in one
direction, see Figure 1.11.

Figure 1.11
Illustration of a wide sheet rigidly clamped at both ends and loaded in lateral direction (TU Delft, n.d. 1-11.jpg. Own
Work.)

The transverse strain is equal to zero as the clamping prohibits the contraction.
With equation (1.11) this implies that

                                                                                              (1.12)
Substitution of this relation between the longitudinal and transverse strain into the
expression in longitudinal direction, equation (1.11), yields

                                                                                              (1.13)

This means that the apparent Young's modulus is given by

                                                          (1.15)

1.9 Isotropic and anisotropic sheet deformation

An isotropic sheet is a sheet that is considered to have equal properties in any
direction of the sheet. For the tensile (longitudinal and transverse) and the shear
deformation of such a sheet, see Figures 1.13 and 1.14, the equations are obtained by
combining equations (1.7) and (1.11)

                                                                                              (1.16)

The subscripts for the normal stress  and normal strain  indicate the direction of
the stress and strain. For the shear stress and shear strain the first subscript
indicates the axis perpendicular to the face that the shear stress and strain are acting
on, while the second subscript indicates the positive direction of the shear stress and
strain, see Figure 1.12.

2011, 1-12.jpg. Own Work)
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 15
This set of equations can also be written in matrix formulation

                                                                                              (1.17)
An anisotropic sheet has different properties in the different material directions. An
example of an anisotropic sheet can be the fibre reinforced ply. Because the tensile
and shear deformation is dependent on the properties in the particular directions, see
Figure 1.13 and Figure 1.14, equation (1.17) must be extended to

                                                                                              (1.18)
The subscript `xy' for the Poisson's ratio describes the contraction in y-direction for an
extension (direction of load) in x-direction.

Here, one must realise that the excellent stiffness and strength properties often given
for composite materials may be given for the longitudinal direction only. Table 1.1
illustrates the strength and stiffness properties for two thermoset fibre reinforced
composites in the two principal material directions. Indeed, the stiffness and strength
is significant in fibre directions, but perpendicular to the fibres the properties are very
low.

As a consequence, composite (aeronautical) structures are made of alternating
various plies that are oriented in different directions to obtain sufficient strength in
each direction. The amount of fibres in each direction may vary depending on the
loads cases. This design freedom is illustrated by the shaded area in Figure 1.15.
In this figure, several laminate lay-ups are indicated to explain the presentation of
this figure. One of the laminate lay-ups indicated in Figure 1.15 is the quasi-isotropic
laminate. Quasi-isotropy can be defined as the approximation of isotropy by orienting
plies in different directions.

18 R.C. Alderliesten

The consequence of the combination of various orientations in a laminate lay-up
is that the mechanical properties of the laminate are generally an average of the
individual ply properties. This is illustrated in Table 1.2 with the example of E-glass
epoxy from Table 1.1.
The stress-strain relationship for a composite material, i.e. a polymer (matrix)
reinforced by fibres depends on the stress-strain behaviour of the individual
constituents. For a single unidirectional ply this relationship is illustrated in Figure
1.16. From this figure, it can be understood that the stiffness of the ply is a function
of the stiffness of the fibre and the matrix. The ply stiffness depends on the amount
of fibres in the ply, which is described by the fibre volume fraction. For example, with
100% of fibres in the ply, the stiffness will equal the fibre stiffness, while with 0% of
fibres the stiffness will equal the matrix stiffness. This linear relationship is called the
rule of mixtures and is discussed in chapter 3.

Figure 1.16
Illustration of the stress-strain curve for a fibre reinforced polymer (matrix) in relation to the constituent's
stress-strain curve (TU Delft, n.d. 1-16.jpg. Own Work.)

Another observation from Figure 1.16, is that the strain to failure is in most cases not
dependent on both constituents, but rather on the strain to failure of the fibres. Once
the strain reaches the critical strain of the fibres, the fibres will fail, leaving the matrix
with insufficient strength to carry the load, which will subsequently fail.
The earlier mentioned directionality of composite plies is important to consider. The
high strength and stiffness of the composite may be described in fibre direction by the
curve in Figure 1.16. However, perpendicular to the fibres, the strength and stiffness
are described by the curve for the matrix, because there are no fibres in that direction
to carry any load.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 19

The directionality can be illustrated with the example shown in Figure 1.17. The high
strength and stiffness of a composite may drop significantly to the low stiffness and
strength of the (unreinforced) polymer in the direction perpendicular to the fibres. This
means that if sufficient strength and stiffness is required in different directions,
multiple plies should be placed on top of each other, each oriented in a different
direction. However, the consequence is that the strength of that lay-up is no longer
equal to the single ply strength, but rather a function of the individual plies in their
direction of loading. A first estimation of the laminate strength or stiffness can be
made with again assuming a linear relationship (rule of mixtures).

Figure 1.17
Relation between stiffness and strength of a composite ply and the angle or orientation of loading (TU Delft, n.d.
1-17.jpg. Own Work.)

   Example: Laminate lay-up of multiple plies
      Consider a laminate lay-up for vertical tail plane skins consisting of multiple

   plies for which the strength and stiffness of each ply are described by the curves
   in Figure 1.17. The lay-up is given by 60% of the fibres in 0°, 30% of the fibres in
   ±45° and 10% of the fibres in 90°. What is the stiffness of the laminate?
   The modulus of elasticity is given in Figure 1.17. The values are approximately
   240 GPa, 40 GPa, and 5 GPa for respectively 0°, ±45°, and 90°. The average
   stiffness of the laminate is proportional to the relative contribution of each ply.
   This means that
20 R.C. Alderliesten

      where represents the laminate volume content of the plies in a given
   direction.
   Since the vertical tail is primarily loaded in bending, most of the fibres are
   oriented in the span direction. However, for a fuselage a more quasi-isotropic
   lay-up is preferred because of the combined load cases in the fuselage. A typical
   lay-up that may be considered in that case is for example 20% of the fibres in
   0°, 70% of the fibres in ±45° and 10% of the fibres in 90°. The laminate stiffness
   would then be

      Note however, that this laminate has a stiffness in ±45° direction that is at
   least twice as high.

1.10 Toughness

The toughness of a material is often considered important in aeronautical structures
because it represents the resistance of the material against fracture, formation of
damage or impact. This parameter relates directly to the damage tolerance concept
(see chapter 9) applied to ensure structural integrity during the entire operational life
of, for example, an aircraft.
The toughness of a material is defined as resistance against fracture, and it is in
general considered to be represented by the area underneath the stress-strain curve,
see Figure 1.18. This area represents the mechanical deformation energy per unit
volume prior to failure. Evaluating the units related to the area underneath the stress-
strain curve, it can be shown that the unit of toughness is J/m3, which is the energy
[J] per unit volume.

                                                                                              (1.19)
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 21

Aside from the toughness, often different definitions are considered. For example, the
impact toughness is the minimum energy required to fracture a material of specified
dimensions under impact. This energy is not only dependent on the material itself,
but also on the dimensions of the sample being fractured. Therefore, the test to
determine the fracture toughness and the specimen dimensions are prescribed in
testing standards to enable correlation of different materials. The set-up and
specimen are illustrated in Figure 1.19.

Figure 1.18
Three example stress-strain curves with the area underneath the curve shaded; the curve with the largest shaded
area is considered to represent the toughest material. (TU Delft, n.d. 1-18.jpg. Own Work.)

Another important toughness parameter is the fracture toughness. This parameter
represents the resistance of a material against fracture in presence of a crack. There
is an important difference between toughness and fracture toughness. Although the
area underneath the stress-strain curve, see Figure 1.18, qualitatively relates to the
fracture toughness, the relation is not as straightforward as with toughness.
Materials with high fracture toughness usually fracture with significant ductile
deformation, while materials with low fracture toughness fail in a brittle manner. In
general, to fracture a material with high fracture toughness, a lot of energy or load
is required, which implies that these materials are preferred for damage tolerant
designs.

2. Environment & durability

2.1 Introduction

The material properties discussed in the previous chapter are considered to describe
the behaviour of a specific material. However, this does not mean that the properties
are constant under all conditions. Most material properties change for example with
temperature. Increasing or decreasing the temperature will affect material properties
like stiffness and strength.
Another aspect that should be considered is the duration of operation. An aircraft
being operated for instance for 30 years will face degradation of structural and
mechanical behaviour due to environment effects.

bottom right: Jetstar Airways, (2013), CC-BY-SA 2.0.

The influence of the environment in which the structure or component will be
operated is important to consider. For example, an engineer or designer should

                                                  23
24 R.C. Alderliesten

consider that if a structure is required to withstand certain loads during operation,
the material strength may reduce for specific operating conditions. This may be
either high temperatures of the environment, or degradation throughout the life of the
structure due to aggressive environments. An illustration of typical applications and
operationing (temperature) conditions is given in Figure 2.1.
This chapter tries to describe the effect of the environment on the material and
structure, so as to increase awareness of this aspect to future engineers.

2.2 The effect of ambient temperature

The effect of the ambient temperature on the material properties can be illustrated
with the data given in handbooks as for example Metallic Materials Properties
Development and Standardization handbook [1]. In Figure 2.2, an example is given
for the effect of ambient temperature on the ultimate and yield strength of 2024-T3
aluminium sheets in a temperature range below the melting temperature of the alloy (

     = 500-640 °C).
In this figure it is also demonstrated that the duration of exposure to that temperature
may have a considerable effect above certain temperatures. The 2024-T3 aluminium
alloy is widely applied in aeronautical structures. The nominal maximum operational
temperature for this alloy is often specified to be about 135°C. From Figure 2.2 it
is evident that above this temperature, the mechanical properties will drop rapidly,
especially when exposed for longer times.
Metallic materials are not the only materials that show dependency of mechanical
properties on the ambient temperature. In general, all engineering materials exhibit
temperature dependent material behaviour. Especially in polymers one may also
observe a transition in the material response at a temperature below the melting
temperature.

Effect of temperature on ultimate and yield strength for 2024-T3 sheets based on data from Rice et al., (2003).
(Alderliesten, 2011. 2-2.jpg. Own Work.)

The transition in general relates to the transition from a solid state of the material
into a rubbery state. The temperature at which this transition is observed is called the
glass-transition temperature . This refers to the transition glass exhibits at elevated
temperatures, exploited in the glass blowing process. The phenomenon is illustrated
in Figure 2.3 for the modulus of elasticity. However, the effect is also evident for
the strength and strain to failure; increasing the temperature beyond the transition
temperature decreases the strength of the material, while the strain to failure is often
increased.
For structural applications this implies that operational temperature may never
approach the glass transition temperature, otherwise the mechanical properties
would drop significantly risking premature failure of the structure.

2.2.1 Effect of elevated temperature

In general, the effect of increasing the temperature is that most mechanical and
fatigue properties of engineering materials deteriorate. This is also clearly illustrated
in Figure 2.2. This means that it has to be verified that the mechanical properties of
the selected materials remains above the specified levels within the full operational
temperature range.
For the case of 2024-T3, this means that the specified ultimate and yield strength
are minimum values that are lower than the values obtained at room temperature. To
determine the minimum allowable strength of the material, knock-down factors are
applied to the values obtained at room temperature.
For many metallic structures, the reduction of yield strength may not directly implicate
a safety issue, because the ultimate strength may still be considerable. However,
the application of stresses beyond the reduced yield strength may cause permanent
(plastic) deformation.
Another aspect related to elevated temperature, especially high temperatures, is the
creep phenomenon. Creep is a small, but steady ongoing deformation of materials
under the application of constant stress. Although these stresses can be below the
yield strength of the material, the ongoing deformation may still occur. At room
temperature and low temperatures, this phenomenon is usually insignificant. At
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 27

elevated temperatures, especially high temperatures near the melting temperatures,
this phenomenon may cause permanent deformations within limited times of load
application. The deformation rate is thus dependent on the applied load level, the
temperature level, and the mechanical properties of the material.

Figure 2.4

2-4-c.jpg. Own Work.

For certain high temperature applications, see Figure 2.4, the creep phenomenon may
significantly limit the amount of materials that can be applied. For example engine
turbine blades are exposed for a long time (duration of a long distance flight) at
high temperature, while constantly exposed to significant centrifugal loads. These
components are therefore specifically designed against creep. For example, single
crystal alloys (Ni-based alloys) are developed that have significant creep resistance.

2.2.2 Thermal stresses

Aside from the effect the environmental temperature has on the mechanical
properties of the applied structural materials, the designer has to consider thermal
stresses. The material will expand or contract with respectively increasing or
decreasing temperatures. The relation between the temperature and the expansion is
described by the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient.
28 R.C. Alderliesten

                                                                                               (2.1)

which is considered a material property. In equation (2.1) V is the volume and dV/
dT the expansions rate of the volume with the temperature. For isotropic materials,
the coefficient of thermal expansion is identical in all principal material directions.
However, for anisotropic materials, the coefficient is different for the different
directions, like the other mechanical properties.

The different expansion coefficients for different materials, see Table 2.1, implies
that a composite or hybrid structure, i.e. a structure comprising multiple materials,
will face differences in expansion. Beside the mechanical loads and corresponding
stresses that are excerted to the structure, these differences in thermal expansion
may impose additional stresses once free expansion is prohibited.

The significance of this aspect may be illustrated with press releases on the Boeing
787, where it was reported that the aluminium shear ties that fixate the fuselage
frames to the composite skin in the rear fuselage section had to be replaced (Cohen
2010). The initial design did not account for the repeated cooling and warming of
the unpressurized aft fuselage section 48. As result of these temperature cycles, the
shear ties may repeatedly pull away from the skin with potential influence on the
integrity of the structure.
Although this design flaw was detected prior to any 787 delivery, it emphasizes the
importance of accounting for potential additional loading due to thermal stresses.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 29

   Example: Fibre Metal Laminates
      A Fibre Metal Laminate (FML) is a composite material consisting of thin

   aluminium sheets with fibre/epoxy plies in-between. The laminates are cured at
   an elevated curing temperature in a stress-free condition. This means that due
   to the different coefficients of thermal expansion residual stresses occur when
   the laminate is cooling down at the end of the cure cycle. The magnitude of
   these stresses is dependent on temperature and laminate composition.

        Figure 2.5
    Illustration of thermally induced residual stresses in a FML (TU Delft, n.d. 2-5.jpg. Own Work)

2.2.3 Effect of low temperatures

Obviously, the effect of thermally induced residual stresses is also present when
ambient temperatures are decreased to low temperatures. For the Fibre Metal
Laminate Glare for instance, the residual stresses increase further with decreasing
temperatures. This is because the difference with the curing temperature, i.e.

                       is further increasing.
However, in these laminates the mechanical and fatigue properties are becoming
better despite the increasing residual stresses. This is related to the general influence
low temperatures have on metallic materials.
At lower temperatures, the micromechanical response of materials results in higher
resistance against elastic and plastic deformation. A higher resistance against
30 R.C. Alderliesten

deformation relates to an increase in modulus of elasticity and yield strength of
materials.
In addition, the chemical reaction and diffusion rates decrease at lower temperatures.
To some extent this is the consequence of the lower water vapour pressure. Because
there is less water vapour in the air at low temperatures, the chemical reaction with
materials reduces.

A special case of the effect of low temperatures is the transition in fracture and
impact toughness observed in some low carbon steel alloys. This transition relates
to the change in fracture appearance. Where at room temperature, the fracture is
completely ductile (high toughness) the fracture changes to brittle at low
temperatures (low toughness). Examples of this phenomenon are the failures of the
Liberty ships and T2 tankers, shown in Figure 2.6.

2.3 The effect of humidity

In general, a humid environment has a detrimental effect on the structural properties
of both metallic and composite structures. However, the reason for the deterioration
of both material types is different. Metallic materials in a humid environment may
be more affected by corrosion attacks that damage the material and reduce the
effective thickness of the structure or component. However, a composite structure
in a humid environment faces ingress of moisture into the polymer matrix, which
deteriorates both the cohesive strength of the polymer, but also the adhesive strength
of the bond between fibre and matrix. Thus where in metallic materials the strength
relates to reduction of cross-section because corrosion has eaten away the material,
the strength of composites reduces due to the reduction in chemical bonding and
softening of the matrix.
In both cases, time is an important parameter. The longer a structure is exposed
to a humid environment, the more time there is to either corrode a structure, or
for moisture to ingress the composite. In general, the reduction in strength due to
environmental attacks and humidity is dependent on the exposure time.
Here an interesting difference can be observed between the performance of a fibre
reinforced polymer composite and a Fibre Metal Laminate. Because the metallic
sheets do not allow moisture to penetrate the material, the moisture ingress in FMLs
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 31

is in general limited to edges of panels and cut-outs and drilled holes (for riveting for
example). The problem then reduces to a 2-dimentional problem. A fibre reinforced
polymer, or carbon fibre composite material is sensitive to moisture ingress from
all sides, which implies a 3-dimensional problem. Where FMLs required additional
protection (coating) for edges only, the composite structures require specific coating
applied to the structure.

   Example: T2 and Liberty ships
      On 16 January 1943, 24 hours after being released from the shipyard, the

   T2 tanker S.S. Schenectady broke mid ships into 2 pieces in the docks near
   Portland, Oregon. This ship was the first ship of a new series built. Although hull
   fractures had occurred occasionally before, this failure occurred with a brand
   new ship while being in the docks.
   The T2 tankers and Liberty ships where ships that were manufactured quickly,
   within about 5 days, to provide transport to the fleet at a higher rate than
   German submarines could destroy. Where in the years 1930-1937 about 71
   merchants ships were built in the USA, 5777 ships were built between 1939 and
   1945.

      Instead of riveting, welding was applied, which did not only increase the
   speed of production, but also enabled reduction of structural weight. Initially,
   the main reason was considered to be bad welding, but further investigation
   made clear that the steel used for construction appeared to be sensitive to low
   temperature. At certain temperature levels, the impact and fracture toughness
   exhibit a significant transition. The reduction in toughness relates to the
   transition from ductile fracture (evidence of high energy absorption) to brittle
   failure (low energy absorption prior to fracture). This phenomenon is illustrated
   in Figure 2.7.

2.4 Environmental aspects

The discussion in this chapter has been limited up until now to the effect of
temperature and humidity. However, for both aeronautical and space structures
various environments can be distinguished that each have their particular influence
on the mechanical performance of a material or a structure.
The following typical environments may be identified:

  · Air/moisture/salty environment
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 33

  · Space and re-entry
  · Fuel exposure
  · Exposure to hydraulics
  · Exposure to cleaning agents

2.4.1 Air, moisture and/or salty environment

Depending on the type of material, there can be different environments considered
to be harmful or detrimental. In general, the detrimental processes due to aggressive
environments are accelerated with increasing temperatures.
For most metal alloys the combination of moisture and salty environment forms the
aggressive environment that may lead to corrosion. Corrosion is the electrochemical
reaction that metallic atoms have with oxidants in the environment. This rate at which
this process may occur depends on the environment. In a humid environment or
water, corrosion occurs generally faster than in (dry) air. The oxidant may be for
instance oxygen.

(right). Derivative from left: Skeeze, (2008), CC0, and right: Saunders-Smits, (2017), Own Work.)

For fibre reinforced composites usually the combination of humidity with higher
temperatures forms the environment that may lead to material degradation or loss of
structural properties. The earlier mentioned glass transition temperature may reduce
34 R.C. Alderliesten

to lower temperatures under the influence of moisture, with reduction in strength and
stiffness at lower temperatures.

2.4.2 Space and re-entry

Space structures operate under different conditions as for example aircraft
structures. To begin with, the temperature range under which most space structures
operate is significantly larger than for aircraft structures, see Figure 2.1.
But aside from the temperature aspect, the environment and the relevant aspects
to be considered are substantially different as well. Where in aircraft structures,
environmental degradation may be attributed to moisture and oxygen in combination
with temperature effects, typical environments and environmental aspects
considered for space structures are;

  · Radiation/UV exposure
  · Free radicals, atomic Oxygen (O+)
  · Vacuum (outgassing)

Ultraviolet (UV) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength ranging between
10 nm and 400 nm (shorter than that of visible light). A lot of natural and synthetic
polymers deteriorate under UV exposure. Here, fibres that are known to be sensitive
to UV radiation are for example aramid fibres, like Kevlar.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 35

structure's surface (right). Derivative from left: Landis - NASA, (2009) Public Domain, and right: Tschida - NASA
(2005) , Public Domain.

In the outer atmosphere, free radicals, especially atomic oxygen, play an important
role in the degradation of materials and structures. The amount of atomic oxygen
relates to the altitude and the activity of the sun.
Different structural materials respond differently to the exposure to atomic oxygen.
Aluminium for example erodes slowly under atomic oxygen exposure, while gold and
platinum are highly resistant. A lot of polymers are known to be very sensitive and
require the application of special coatings (for example silicon based coatings) and
paints to protect the structure from atomic oxygen erosion.
Especially in vacuum, outgassing is an important topic of concern. Many materials,
like for example polymers, composites, adhesives, are based on dissolvers, or contain
substances that can evaporate from the material. But even metals may release
gasses from cracks or impurities in the material.
In general, the consequence of degassing on the material or structure is that the
mechanical properties of the material may deteriorate in time. Also the released
gasses may condense on other cold surfaces causing trouble to the operation of
certain components, for instance solar cells and telescope lenses.
Also here the temperature may have an acceleration effect; at higher temperatures,
the chemical reaction rate with the material and the vapour pressure increase.
36 R.C. Alderliesten

2.4.3 Exposure to fuel or hydraulics and cleaning agents

Other than air, moisture for aeronautical structures and the environments discussed
in the previous section, environments should be considered that may cause
degradation of structure and corrosion of materials. Especially for aircraft structures,
several additional environmental aspects should be considered, of which some as
listed below;

  · Fuel
  · Hydraulics
  · Cleaning agents

In case of an integral fuel tank, see Figure 2.10, the fuel is kept inside the structure
without use of additional fuel bags. All joints and structural connections are sealed air
and liquid tight, to avoid leakage of the fuel.
This implies for that particular part of the structure, that the structural material is
directly exposed to fuel. In order to avoid any degradation due to the fuel environment,
one should then consider use of materials or coatings resistant to to this type of
environment.
This is especially an aspect to consider for polymers and fibre reinforced composites.
Here, the question will be whether the polymers applied in the structural material
contains dissolvers that may react with the chemicals in the fuel.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 37

Figure 2.10
Illustration of integral fuel tanks, where the structure is directly exposed to kerosene fuel (left: NTSB, 2010, Public
Domain; right: Britton - U.S. Airforce, 2010, Public Domain)

Another environmental aspect often not considered is related to operation and
maintenance of structures. Often the selection of structural materials is thought of
well, considering the environments and circumstances the structure will operate in
with high probability.
However, for maintenance and operation one has to consider the materials applied in
the structure. Use of cleaning agents to clean a dirty structure may impose structural
degradation and impair the integrity of the structure, if the cleaning agents are based
on a chemical composition that reacts with the structural material. One has to specify
the cleaning agents or at least the chemical basis of such agents for particular
structure. Here, the example given in Figure 2.11 (right) illustrates that the
specification works both ways. It reads: "Do not use on glass or aluminium."
Manufacturers of cleaning agents define the restrictions to application of such
cleaning agents.
In general, not only corrosion related to air and moisture, see section 2.4.1, should
be considered in structural design, but also the deterioration due to other chemical
environments. Here, one should consider that the general advantage claimed for
carbon fibre composites is that this structural material does not corrode. However,
depending on the epoxy system applied, it may deteriorate due to other environmental
conditions, like for example UV exposure.

2010, Public Domain ) and an example of cleaning agent inappropriate for aluminium. (right, anon, n.d. Public
Domain)

One type of corrosion should be added to the discussion here; galvanic corrosion.
Galvanic corrosion is the electrochemical reaction process in which one metal may
corrode due to electrical contact with another material or metal, while being in an
environment that contains an electrolyte. This corrosion process forms the basis of
batteries, where one metal corrodes to provide electrical current.
Especially in moisture rich environments, such contact between two materials may be
easily made, which can cause corrosion of one of the metals involved. One example is
given in Figure 2.13, where the aluminium rim corrodes in a wet, humid and potentially
salty environment, due to the electrical connection with the chromium plated brass
spoke.
It should be emphasized here however, that the contact does not necessarily be
between two metals, it may also be between a metal and another material, of which
the electric potential provides sufficient difference with the potential of the metal.
For example, aluminium connected to carbon fibre reinforced composites, may lead
to galvanic corrosion of the aluminium, due to the potential difference of these two
structural materials. See for instance Figure 2.12, where the brass nipple of the spoke
reacts with the aluminium rim.
The method to counteract galvanic corrosion is to isolate the different materials,
avoiding the electrical connectivity, or to assure that the materials are not immersed
in a solution containing an electrolyte.

corrosion between chromium plated brass spoke nipple and aluminium rim (Open University, 2004, Copyright Open
University)

Sometimes, the process is exploited as solution to counteract corrosion. Here, the
example of placing zinc sacrifice material to steel (marine) structures could be
mentioned. Since the zinc is less noble than steel, it will corrode first under a
corrosive attack, protecting thereby the steel structure.

3. Material types

3.1 Introduction

The key difference between the structures and materials discipline and other
disciplines related to flight is that this discipline is about materialisation of concepts
also developed within the other disciplines. To create an aircraft or spacecraft one
must use materials. Materials in that sense can thus be defined as substances,
matters, constituents or elements that are used to build parts, components and
structures.
The properties of materials do not depend on their geometry, but on their composition
only. The relation between the composition and the properties of a material can be
further explored, but for the time being, one may consider the properties as an artefact
of materials.
There is a wide variety of materials available to be used in materialisation of
components and structures. Typical examples of materials are metals (steel,
aluminium, magnesium, etc), wood, ceramics, and polymers. All these materials have
properties which do not depend on their shape, like for example mechanical
properties, electrical properties, physical properties, etc.
However, to materialise an aircraft or spacecraft structure, certain material properties
are required. As a consequence, not all materials available in this world can be used,
or are preferred to be used. Aerospace structures require materials that are solids
with good mechanical properties but with a low density. This class of materials is
often referred to as lightweight materials. Since there are numerous materials that are
lighter than the materials currently used in aerospace structures, a more appropriate
indication would be lightweight structural materials.
The performance of materials should be as high as possible for the lowest possible
weight. This can be phrased alternatively by stating that the performance to weight
ratio should be as high as possible. This leads to the use of specific mechanical

                                                  41
42 R.C. Alderliesten

properties, which are the properties divided by the density or weight of the material.
The use of those specific properties will be further discussed in chapter 8.
For application in aerospace structures, one can distinct the following material
categories:

  · Metal alloys
  · Polymers
  · Composites
  · Ceramics
These categories are briefly discussed in the following sections. But before
discussing these categories individually, one has to be aware that these materials
have been retrieved from resources like ores (metal) and oil (composites and
polymers). Once retrieved, they are transformed into semi-finished products like
sheets, plates, bars, fibres, powder (polymers), etc. The semi-finished products are
further processed into structural elements. For this transformation a huge number
of processes are available that can be grouped into: casting, forming, machining,
and joining processes. Subsequently, the structural elements are assembled into
structures.

Figure 3.1
Illustration of subsequent production steps from raw material resources to structures (Alderliesten, 2011. Own
Work.)
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 43

The properties of structures are directly related to the material properties although
they are not identical: structural properties are often influenced by the shape and
geometry (design) too. However, there is also another aspect to be considered when
optimizing between material and structural shape; not every structure or shape can be
made of any material. Consider for example the Eiffel tower, the Parthenon, or a surf
board. The selected materials (resp. metal, marble and composites) and the shapes
of these artefacts are compatible.
This also implies that if the shape is not adapted to or compatible with the material,
the material properties are not optimally used and exploited.

A similar relationship exists between material and manufacturing process. Metals
can be melted, so casting and welding are available production processes for metals.
These production processes cannot be applied to ceramics or fibre reinforced
composites for instance.

The last relationship to mention is the one between the shape (or structure) and the
manufacturing process. To fabricate a sheet metal wing rib, one may use a forming
process. Replacing the same rib by a machined rib will consequently result in different
details of the wing shape (local radii, thickness, etc). To put it the other way around:
To create a cylindrical shape and a double-curved shape, different manufacturing
processes are needed.

In summary: there is a strong interrelationship between the three entities "material",
"structure or shape" and "manufacturing process". Changing one entity often affects
both others. For the best solutions to structural problems, i.e. to truly optimize the
structure and its performance, one should include all three aspects in the design and
its evaluation. This is illustrated in Figure 3.2 .
44 R.C. Alderliesten

highlighted (Alderliesten, 2011. Own Work.)

3.2 Metal alloys

An alloy is made by adding alloying elements to the purified metal in order to increase
or modify the properties of the pure metal. For example, adding a few percent of
copper and magnesium to aluminium (like in Al-2024) increases the yield strength
and ultimate strength both with a factor of 4 to 6. In general, metal alloys have good
processibility, show plastic behaviour, and are rather cheap.

3.2.1 Typical mechanical properties

Metal alloys typically are isotropic materials exhibiting similar elastic properties in
all directions of the material. Because of this isotropic behaviour, the material
specifications and the specifications of physical and mechanical properties are often
given indifferent of the orientation. Only for specific metals that show anisotropic
behaviour, like for example aluminium-lithium alloys, and for rolled sheet material
sometimes properties are specified in two directions. The orientation dependency for
the rolled products is related to the shape of the grains (severely elongated in rolling
direction) as a result of the rolling process.
                            Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 45

Because metal alloys are ductile materials that yield beyond the yield strength, both
ultimate and yield strength are specified. This value indicates how far the material can
be loaded elastically before permanent plastic deformation may occur.

Table 3.1 gives some mechanical and physical properties of typical steel, aluminium,
titanium and magnesium alloys. It can be observed from the data in this table that
there is some relation between strength and stiffness on the one hand and the density
of the material on the other hand.
Steel exhibits high strength and stiffness, but at the cost of a high density, whereas
magnesium (the lightest alloy in the table) shows the lowest mechanical properties.

3.2.2 Typical applications

Typical applications for metals are structures and components that require high
strength both in tension and in compression, see the examples in Figure 3.3. Example
applications for steel alloys are found in aircraft (landing gear components), train
components and rails, bridges, towers and cranes.

Aluminium alloys are for instance applied in the main fuselage and wing structure of
most aircraft, train structures, and car and engine components.

In aeronautical structures, titanium is applied in applications that require performance
at elevated temperatures, like for example in the Concorde and military fighters. Most
magnesium alloys are not applied in aircraft for flammability risks.
46 R.C. Alderliesten
In general, metal alloys are applied in components and products that are produced in
high volumes. Examples here are the cars and cans.
Steel is also often applied as reinforcement material in for example civil applications.
The application of steel cables in suspension bridges is an evident example. But also
concrete is reinforced with steel cables to increase the strength of the structure.
Especially in case of high buildings the steel reinforcement is applied to pre-stress
the structure, i.e. the steel reinforcement is put in tension (because of the excellent
tensile properties), which by equilibrium puts the concrete in compression (for which
concrete is known to perform excellent).

              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 47

3.3 Polymers

In general, polymers are not considered for structural applications. The polymers
have relative low strength and stiffness and can therefore not be used as structural
material. However, they are applied as structural adhesives to join other materials, and
they are applied with additional reinforcement in composites.

3.3.1 Typical mechanical properties

Compared to rigid materials like metals, polymers exhibit significant lower stiffness
and strength. Here, it should be noted that the stiffness of many polymers is not
constant during loading. Whereas metals exhibit linear stress-strain behaviour during
elastic deformation of the material, as illustrated in Figure 1.5, the stiffness of
polymers often change with the amount of strain, see Figure 3.4. In case of such
non-linear behaviour, the initial slope of the material is taken to determine the elastic
modulus.

Although the strength and stiffness are generally very low, the elongation at failure
can be quite high. Some rubbers, for example, may strain up to 500% before failure
occurs.

Figure 3.4
Qualitative illustration of the non-linear stress-strain behaviour of polymers (Alderliesten, 2011. 3-4.jpg. Own Work.)

In chapter 2, it has been explained that the temperature has an influence on the
mechanical properties of materials. Although this is in general the case for all
materials, it is quite significant for polymers. Depending on the temperature, materials
48 R.C. Alderliesten

may either behave like brittle materials or like elastic materials. Especially at low
temperature, many polymers show brittle behaviour.
With increasing the temperature a gradual transition can be observed from brittle
to elastic and rubbery behaviour, while further increasing to high temperatures the
material may become viscous or even liquid like.
This transition to the viscous state is important for polymers, because it implies
a significant reduction in the mechanical properties. A well known transition for
polymers is the so-called glass transition temperature.

Figure 3.5
Transition in modulus of elasticity at the glass transition temperature, below the melting temperature (Alderliesten,
2011, 3-5.jpg. Own Work.)

Some polymers exhibit different mechanical behaviour, depending on the rate they are
strained. Glass fibres for example, exhibit higher strengths when loaded at very high
rates. This can be beneficial in case of impact for example.

3.3.2 Typical applications

Because of the wide variety of polymers that exist, the number of applications is
numerous. Some main categories can be distinguished:

  · Elastomers
  · Plastics
  · Fibres
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 49
Some well known examples of polymer applications are illustrated in Figure 3.6.
Rubbers are elastomers that are typically applied in tires, sealing, coatings and liners.
They are in general characterized by their flexibility and the large strain to failures.
Plastics can be divided into two main categories:

  · Thermoplastic
  · Thermoset

Figure 3.6
Typical applications of polymers. Derivative from Top left: Saunders-Smits (2018), 3-6-b.jpg. Own Work.; Top right:
Yogipurnama, (2017), CC0; Bottom left: Anon., (2017), CC0; Bottom middle: Pexels, (2016), CC0; Bottom right: Hans,
(2013), CC0.

Thermoplastic polymers melt when heated to certain temperatures and return to their
glassy state when cooled again. These materials are often associated with weak Van
der Waals forces. This means that the material can be melted above their melting
temperature and moulded into components. The process is reversible, as reheating
will melt the material again.
50 R.C. Alderliesten

Thermoset materials however, are cured irreversibly, which means that once the
chains link during curing the process cannot be reversed. These materials usually do
not melt at high temperatures, but may decompose or burn when heated too high.
The difference between these two materials is considered important, especially when
addressing recyclability of the materials. Thermoplastic materials can be recycled
relatively easy by heating above the melting temperature, while thermoset materials
are in general not easy to recycle.
Example applications of thermoset materials are the old bakelite telephones and
the epoxies used in fibre reinforced composites. Here, it should be mentioned that
current developments seem to aim to replace, for certain composite applications, the
thermoset matrix material by thermoplastic matrices.
Examples of fibre types are natural fibres, synthetic fibres and nylon. Application of
these types of fibres in a fibre reinforced composite, implies that different polymers
are combined into a structural material. The fibre is made of another polymer than the
matrix material.

3.4 Ceramic materials

Ceramics are not suitable for structures. They are too brittle and have poor processing
features. However, they are applied in some space applications, for instance for
thermal protection of the metallic or composite structure. Ceramics often consist of
(metal) oxides and metals, in which ionic bonds between the different atoms provide
the material structure.

3.4.1 Typical mechanical properties

In general, ceramics are hard and brittle materials that have very limited toughness
due to the lack of ductility (small failure strain). In certain cases a high strength and
stiffness can be achieved, but that depends on the composition of the material and
the level of porosity.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 51

The reason why certain ceramics are considered for heat protection is that they
are capable to sustain very high temperatures. Even at those temperature levels the
bonds between the atoms remain very strong. This strong bond also implies that
ceramics are often very resistant to wear.

3.4.1 Typical applications

A variety of typical applications for ceramics can be mentioned here. To start with the
glass application, glass is applied in window panes, lenses, but also in fibres. Glass
fibres are very stable fibres that have high mechanical properties both in tension and
compression. At high strain rate levels, the glass often provides a higher strength than
when quasi-statically loaded to failure.
Another example of ceramics is clay. Porcelain and bricks are well known examples
of these ceramics. In civil applications not only bricks, but also cement and lime are
being applied as ceramic applications.
Other examples are cutting tools and abrasive materials due to its high wear
resistance, armour reinforcement because of its high puncture resistance, and in case
of glass fibres, due to its high impact resistance. The previously mentioned high
heat resistance (1600 - 1700 °C) results in many applications in engine components
and heat protection systems for, for example, the Space Shuttle. A selection of
applications are illustrated in Figure 3.9.

   Example: Space Shuttle Columbia
      A known application of ceramic materials is the thermal protection tiles on

   the Space Shuttle. The importance of this protection is illustrated with the
   tragic accident on February 1, 2003. During its launch a piece of foam became
   detached from the tank and hit the leading edge of the wing causing damage
   to the ceramic skin. Although during lift-off and mission no apparent problems
   were observed, the Shuttle disintegrated during re-entry. Analysis revealed that
   during re-entry hot gasses could enter the wing structure through the damage
   affecting the structure behind the ceramic tiles.

      In this accident the crew of 7 people were all killed.

3.5 Composite materials

Composite materials are, as the name already indicates, materials that are composed
of different materials. A more accurate description or definition is given by:
Composites are engineering materials, in which two or more distinct and structurally
complementary substances with different physical or chemical properties are
combined, to produce structural or functional properties not present in any individual
component.
An example of a composite is the fibre reinforced polymer composite, which consists
of two distinct and complement materials, namely fibres and polymer. The function of
the fibres is to reinforce the polymer providing strength and stiffness to the material
and, by doing so, to carry the main portion of load. The function of the polymer is
to support the fibres and to transfer the load to and from the fibres in shear. This is
indicated in Figure 3.10.
Products and components made of fibre composites are fabricated with specific
processes like filament winding, lay-up and curing, and press forming, discussed in
the next chapter.

Figure 3.10
Illustration of a fibre reinforced polymer composite ply, and the related stress-strain behaviour of constituents and
lamina (Alderliesten, 2011, 3-10.jpg. Own Work.)
54 R.C. Alderliesten

3.5.1 Typical mechanical properties

As is evident from Figure 3.10, the stress-strain behaviour of the fibre reinforced
polymer composite is determined by the constituents of which it is composed. The
stiffness of the lamina is a function of the stiffness of the polymer and the fibre,
which can be estimated by the rule of mixtures, discussed in section 3.6. However,
whereas the stiffness may be directly related to stiffness and volume content of each
constituent in the lamina, the strain to failure is solely determined by the strain to
failure of the fibres. Once the fibres fail, the strength of the remaining polymer is too
low to carry the load.
One should pay attention to the definition given here for `composites', because this
definition states that any type of engineering structural material that satisfies this
definition is considered to be a `composite'. These days, people use the wording
`composites' often to indicate only one specific type of composites, namely the one
constituted of carbon fibres and polymer. However, one should be aware that this is
an inaccurate use of the definition of composites.
To illustrate the meaning of the definition of composites, another example of a
composite is given by the category of hybrid materials, such as for example Fibre
Metal Laminates (Vlot and Gunnink, 2001), see Figure (3.11). These structural
materials consist of alternating metal and composite layers combining the benefit of
each constituent material, while compensating each other's disadvantages.

In general, fibre reinforced polymers are characterized by their high specific
properties. The strength and stiffness to weight ratio is considerable. However, most
composites behave elastic until failure, without showing any ductile behaviour.
Despite the often very high strength and stiffness, this limits the toughness of these
materials.

Due to the high directionality (fibre orientation) these materials enable tailoring to
specific load applications (beams, cables, columns), but require multiple orientations
to cope with bi-axial load applications.

3.5.2 Typical applications

Typical applications are illustrated in Figure 3.12. Wind turbine blades are commonly
made of glass fibre composites. Other applications are sail planes and pressure tanks
and vessels.

Carbon fibre composites are often applied in automotive and aerospace structures
for their high stiffness. A well known application in sailboats is for example the mast.
But also (motor) bikes are made of carbon fibre composites since the stiffness and
rigidity of the frame is important in such design. Similarly certain sport equipment is
made of these materials.
56 R.C. Alderliesten
Aramid and Kevlar based composites often find applications in armour and bullet
proof protection systems, like bullet proof vests and cockpit doors that should resist
terrorists. Also heat and flame resistant products are often made from aramid fibre
reinforced composites.

Typical applications of the composite Fibre Metal Laminate (FML) concept are
primarily found in aerospace applications. The reason is that these materials are
specifically developed for their high strength and fracture toughness, which increases
the damage tolerance of primary fuselage and wing structures, necessary for
maintaining structural integrity. The FML Glare is currently applied as upper fuselage
skin material and impact resistant empennage leading edges on the Airbus A380. The
material is also applied as high damage tolerant butt strap joint material in the Airbus
A340 fuselage.

3.6 Rule of mixtures

A simple method to estimate the composite ply properties of a composite material is
the so-called rule of mixtures. This rule is a mean to estimate the lamina properties
based on the properties of the individual constituents, i.e. fibre and matrix system.
However, one should be aware that the method by no means is considered accurate.

                                                                                               (3.1)
where M indicates the mass of the constituent, V the volume and the density.
This equation can be written as

                                                                                               (3.2)
where indicates the volume fraction of the constituent in the fibre reinforced
laminate. This linear relationship is illustrated for the density of the laminate in Figure
3.13.

Figure 3.13
Rules of mixtures to estimate the composite ply properties based on the matrix and fibre properties relative to their
volume content (Alderliesten, 2011, 3-13.jpg. Own Work.)

Similarly, this rule of mixtures relationship is illustrated in Figure 3.14 for a carbon fibre
composite with various lay-up configurations. Here, it should be clear that the high
fibre volume may improve the properties, but that the different orientations reduce the
overall laminate properties significantly. The grey shaded area in this figure illustrates
the common fibre volume fractions typically applied in composites.

3.7 Requirements for structural materials

One could assemble a list of requirements for the engineering materials considered.
Comparison between these material requirements and, for example, structural
requirements would reveal a large overlap. However, here one should be careful: there
are significant differences between these two.
Several requirements for structures are also mentioned for materials: high strength,
high stiffness, low weight, durability, and costs. Nonetheless, one should keep in mind
that for compliance to structural requirements the geometry of the structure could be
changed.
For example, to increase the stiffness of a structure, one can select either a material
with a higher stiffness, and/or create a stiffer geometry (shape/design). But, changing
the stiffness of the material, represented by its Young's modulus, is not possible.
Likewise the density is a material constant. Other properties like the strength and the
durability can be changed by (slightly) changing its composition (another alloy) or
condition (temper).
In addition to these requirements, more requirements can be mentioned here that
relate to the relation illustrated in Figure 3.2.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 59

The manufacturability or workshop properties of materials relate materials to
manufacturing aspects. To manufacture an aircraft, it is very important to have
materials that have good workshop properties. For instance, aluminium alloys have
good manufacturability, but titanium alloys don't. That means that processes like
forming and machining (drilling, milling) are easy for aluminium alloys, but difficult
for titanium alloys. In composites, glass and carbon fibre reinforced composites have
good/adequate workshop properties, but aramid (Kevlar) fibre reinforced composites
are very difficult to cut by machining operations, due to the very tough aramid fibres.

To emphasise the importance of the manufacturing aspects in relation to materials
requirements, one should also consider that several manufacturing processes are
relatively easy for one material, but impossible for other. For example, for
manufacturing of a spar or stringer, extrusion and machining processes are available
for metals, which are all inapplicable for fibre reinforced composites. Selection of the
appropriate materials then relates to the available production processes.

Physical properties like electrical conductivity and the coefficient of thermal
expansion (CTE) are important for specific features of the operation performance.
The electrical conductivity of aluminium alloys make it easy to create a (safe) Faraday
cage of the aircraft fuselage. For composites this is more difficult; sometimes extra
strips or conductive meshes are required for this protection against lightning strike.
In this respect, the CTE is also important because aircraft operate between +80°C
(a hot day on the airport) and -60°C (at cruise altitude). Large differences in values
of CTE of applied materials could cause extra problems, like the thermal stresses
explained in the previous chapter.

Therefore, meeting the requirements should be achieved both on a structural level and
material level. Once dominant material requirements are met, discrepancies could
be solved on a structural level. For example, the earlier mentioned differences in
CTE could induce thermal stresses in a structure. This cannot always be solved by
changing one of the applied materials. The structural design solution, i.e. type of joint,
direct contact between materials or separation by intermediate layers, could solve
those specific issues.
4. Manufacturing

4.1 Introduction

The previous chapter provided a brief description of the different material categories
relevant for the aeronautical industry, together with some characteristics and typical
applications. As mentioned there, the performance of a structure is to be evaluated
by means of trade-off between material aspects (discussed in previous chapter),
structural aspects (discussed in the next chapters), and manufacturing aspects.
This means that despite being dealt with in individual chapters in this book, these
aspects relate directly to each other. Considering material aspects together with
structural aspects, but without addressing the manufacturing aspects will never lead
to optimized structures.

Figure 4.1
Illustration of the topic of interest in this chapter (Alderliesten, 2011. 4-1.jpg. Own Work.)

This chapter provides an overview of manufacturing techniques adopted in industry
for manufacturing structures, components and products made of the materials
presented in the previous chapter. The discussion on how manufacturing aspects
are dealt with in practice is given in chapter 1. This chapter limits itself primarily to

                                                  61
62 R.C. Alderliesten

the manufacturing aspects of metallic and composite materials, because they are
considered most relevant for the aerospace industry.

4.2 Metals

In general, three different manufacturing categories can be identified for metallic
materials to create a component or product

  · Casting
  · Machining
  · Forming

4.2.1 Casting

Casting is a production process in which liquid is poured into a mould containing
the shape of the product. The shape of the cavity inside the mould defines the outer
shape of the product. Although the principle is very old (it has been applied for
over 5000 years), it is still often used for manufacturing complex parts. There are
more materials that can be casted, like for example polymers, concrete and clays.
The metals are heated above the melting temperature to provide a liquid that is
subsequently poured into the mould. After cooling the part, the part is often retrieved
by breaking the mould. An illustration of metal casting and of a typical product is given
in Figure 4.2.

                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 63

4.2.2 Machining

Machining is a solid state cutting and milling processes. This means that the process
is applied to materials in their solid state at room temperature, which means that
heating or melting of the material is not necessary. However, machining often required
the use of a cooling agent, because cutting and milling create in itself heating of the
material. The principle is illustrated in Figure 4.3. This figure illustrates the milling and
cutting process. The first is a process that removes chips of material (milling, drilling,
grinding, etc), while the latter is a does not remove chips, but separates (shearing)
materials.

Machining is commonly used to produce large components for which small
geometrical tolerances are required. Geometrical tolerances are defined as the
maximum variation that is allowed in form or positioning of the product or
component. Because the material can be fixed into its position in its solid state,
machining can be performed with great accuracy, thus enabling small geometrical
tolerances.

There are several types of tolerances possible:

  · Form control

  · Flatness

  · Positioning

  · Perpendicular or parallel

Although the machining process usually requires large and expensive equipment, the
process is considered to be inexpensive for large quantities or large components,
because it is relatively easy to automate. Especially high-speed machining enables
production of components at high speeds with high accuracy and small tolerances
in a relative short amount of time. Even thin-walled components can be easily
manufactured with high accuracy.
64 R.C. Alderliesten

4.2.3 Forming

The category of forming, of which an example (sheet bending) of the principle is
provided in Figure 4.3, can be further divided into forming of bulk material and forming
of sheet material. Examples of the first sub-category are

  · Extrusion
  · Forging
Examples for the second sub-category are
  · Bending
  · Deep drawing
  · Roll bending
The forming principles of these processes are illustrated in Figure 4.4.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 65

Figure 4.4
Illustration of the forming principles of bulk material (left) and sheet material (right). (TU Delft, 2018, 4-4.jpg. Own
Work.)

An important aspect to forming is that in order to change the shape of the material
permanently, the material is plastically deformed. However, before plastic
deformation occurs, the material deforms elastic until it reaches the yield strength
of the material, see chapter 1. The elastic deformation is reversible, which means
that after the maximum deformation is reached and the forces are removed a small
portion of the imposed deformation will be eliminated.
Consider sheet bending as illustrated in Figure 4.5. At the maximum bending
deformation, the material has first gone through elastic deformation and
subsequently plastic deformation. Thus once the bending force is removed, the
material will spring back corresponding to the elastic deformation.
66 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 4.5
Illustration of spring back in sheet forming and relation to strength. TU Delft (2018 ), 4-5.jpg, Own Work.

There are two important aspects to this spring back. First, the amount of spring back
is dependent on the level of the imposed stress. As illustrated in Figure 4.5, the spring
back will be higher for higher yield strength, because higher yield strength implies
more elastic deformation.
Here, one may observe the relation between material and manufacturing aspect in
relation to the structural performance; often a high yield strength is preferred for a
structure, to avoid permanent deformations at maximum operational loads. However,
from a manufacturing perspective, high yield strength implies large spring back that
needs to be accounted for.
That relates to the second aspect of spring back: tolerances. The final shape of the
product is obtained after the forming forces are removed and elastic spring back
has occurred. If small tolerances are required, this implies that the spring back must
be known as accurate as possible. For the example of bending over a single line
as illustrated in Figure 4.5, this may be very well achievable, but if the deformation
is applied to double-curved shapes (3-dimensional), this becomes a complex
calculation.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 67

4.2.4 Forging

Forging is a forming process applied to bulk material. Special attention is given here
to the production process. The interdependency between the material, manufacturing
and geometrical aspects, illustrated in Figure 4.1, is clearly visible in the forging
process.
Forging is a process where bulk material is deformed into another shape by applying
compressive forces to the material. This process is be applied at elevated
temperature. Obviously, at higher temperatures materials are easier to deform,
because their resistance to deformation is lower.
The mould used to form the material into its new shape, defines with its inner contour
the shape of the product. However, small tolerances cannot be achieved with this
process, because the work applied to the material induces internal stresses. Together
with little elastic deformation (see previous section), these residual stresses will find
equilibrium while settling to its final shape after unloading. Because the level of detail
achievable with forging is limited, machining is commonly applied after the forging
process, to achieve the required geometry with the desired accuracy and tolerances.
However, this requires some additional considerations, because if internal residual
stresses have obtained equilibrium after the forging process, this may imply that once
material is removed with machining the equilibrium has changed and subsequently
the shape. Therefore, either thorough analysis of the formation of residual stresses
is required to predict potential `spring back' after machining, or machining has to
be applied carefully by removing in a symmetric manner and in small amounts. An
example of a forged rid is illustrated in Figure 4.6.

Figure 4.6
A forged rib of a control surface (Saunders-Smits, 2018, 4-6.jpg. Own Work.)
68 R.C. Alderliesten

The example visualized in Figure 4.6 illustrates another relation shown in Figure 4.1,
because the selection of the production steps in manufacturing a component, may
imply that the residual stresses, that are in equilibrium in the product in its final shape,
may or may not be significant. The lower the residual stresses in the final product, the
less issues they may induce on the structural performance.

4.3 Composites

In manufacturing of composite structures, several production techniques can be
identified that can be classified in three groups:

  · Placement of fibres in dry condition
  · Placement of fibres in wet condition
  · Placement of fibres after pre-impregnation

4.3.1 Filament winding

Filament winding is a production technique that can be applied by placing the fibres
either in dry or wet condition on a mould with a given geometry. Because of the
rotational movement during winding, typical products are products containing a
cylindrical geometry, like for example pressure vessels. Open geometries such as,
for example, bath tubs cannot be made using filament winding. Products made using
filament winding often have a textile appearance.
Characteristic for the filament winding process is that the placement of fibres is
bound by the initial orientation and friction, with no free variable orientations possible.
The mould used to define the shape of the product over which the fibres are wound is
called a mandrel. There are two options that can be applied for the mandrel:

  · Removable mandrel; the mandrel should be solvable, collapsible or tapered in
      order to be removed

  · Used as liner; the mandrel becomes part of the final product and serves for
      example as liquid and gas tight inner liner.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 69

The windings that are possible are given by:
  · Hoop
  · Helical
  · Polar

4.3.2 Pultrusion

Pultrusion is a process equivalent to extrusion, see Figure 4.4, but where the material
is pulled through the mandrel rather than pushed. The material is pulled trough a
mandrel that defines the shape of the product. Although the reinforcement with fibres
is possible and commonly applied, there are limitations to the way fibres can be
positioned in the product. This limitation is related to the process. The reinforcements
that are possible are

  · Rovings, strands or unidirectional material
  · Chopped strands (fibre mats)
  · Woven fibres
The first category is used the most. In any case, whatever category is selected,
a certain amount of continuous fibres is necessary to provide the strength in
longitudinal direction for pulling. For the matrix material thermoset polymers are
applied, such as polyesters and vinyl esters.

4.3.3 Lay-up

Lay-up is a manufacturing process that can either be applied manually, or fully
automated. Manual lay-up is often used for small quantities of a product. Because of
the relative low quantities of aerospace components (except for single aisle aircraft,
most commercial aircraft are manufactured at a rate that is closer to prototyping
than full scale industrial production) manual lay-up is often applied. However, with
the introduction of composite fuselage structures (Boeing 787 and Airbus A350)
the need for automation of the production process increases. This is especially the
case, because circular shaped barrel components cannot easily be made with manual
lay-up. The automated lay-up process is typically referred to as tape laying or fibre
placement.
Comparing tape laying with manual lay-up, some benefits and drawbacks can be
identified. Because automation implies numerical control, the placement usually is
more accurate and more repeatable than manual lay-up. As a consequence the
difference between identical parts is less for tape laying. For fibre reinforced
composites, the improved accuracy in placement of fibres results often in better
mechanical properties.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 71

However, the apparent drawback is that it requires an expensive tape laying machine,
which makes the automated process even more expensive. As a consequence, only
large volumes or high end products, like for example space technology, justify the high
investments.

In general, components made by lay-up can be very large but are limited by the time
needed for impregnation and curing and the size of the autoclave. An autoclave is
a pressure oven in which components can be cured at elevated temperature and
pressure. For example, the fuselage barrels of the Boeing 787 require, because of their
diameter, a very large autoclave.

Lay-up can be applied both using dry lay-up, which is then followed by impregnation
and subsequent curing, and wet lay-up, which is only followed by curing.

A typical variant of lay-up is prepregging. This process uses pre-impregnated material
(i.e. fibres that are impregnated with resin and subsequently consolidated as tape or
prepreg), which is positioned on a mould either by manual or automated lay-up. After
lay-up, the component is placed underneath a bag that is put in vacuum to remove the
air from the component, before it is cured in, for instance, an autoclave. This lay-up
variant enables manufacturing components with high quality, but in return implies a
rather expensive process.

A quicker and cheaper process uses a spray up technique. Instead of long continuous
fibres short chopped fibres (10-40 mm) are applied that are sprayed onto the mould.
As a consequence, the fibres are positioned in a random orientation, which provides
in-plane isotropic properties.

The disadvantage of this process is that it results in components with low mechanical
properties compared to lay-up using continuous fibres, and the quality depends on
craftsmanship. This implies that repeatability of this process is low from one worker
to another.

4.3.4 Resin transfer moulding (RTM)

Resin transfer moulding is a manufacturing process where dry fibres are placed
in a stiff and rigid mould, which is subsequently closed. With the use of pressure
difference (i.e. high pressure at the entrance of the mould and low pressure at its exit)
resin is drawn through the mould cavity impregnating the dry fibres. After this process
72 R.C. Alderliesten
step is completed, the impregnated component can be cured. The principle of the
RTM process is illustrated in Figure 4.9.

Figure 4.9
Principle of resin transfer moulding and vacuum infusion. (TU Delft, 2018, 4-9.jpg. Own Work.)

An alternative process, but closely related to RTM is vacuum infusion. In that process,
dry fibres are also placed in a stiff and rigid mould, but the mould is closed with a
flexible film. Putting the dry fibres underneath the film under vacuum will compress
the material and pull the resin through the dry fibres in the mould.
The third variant is the vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding (VARTM). This
process is in general similar to RTM, but the pressure differential is not only created by
applying pressures higher than 1 bar at the injection side, but also by applying vacuum
at the exit side.
                         Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 73

The difference between the pressures used in the three processes is summarized in
Table 4.1. Typical examples of applications manufactured with vacuum infusion are
given in Figure 4.10.

4.4 Thermoset versus thermoplastic

With respect to composites manufacturing, some additional remarks shall be made.
Traditionally, composite applications for aerospace structures were manufactured
using thermoset resins, like for example epoxy and polyesters. However, the
introduction of thermoplastic polymers as matrix material for composite structures
has implications on the production aspects.

A qualitative comparison between the characteristics of thermoset and thermoplastic
components and their manufacturing is given in Table 4.2.

In general, the advantage of thermoplastic composites is that they enable rapid
manufacturing, producing components that can be recycled (melting the material
again), welded (locally melting the material and cooling after components are pressed
against each other), and that the process does not depend on chemical reactions.
Compared to thermoset resins an important disadvantage is the required high
temperatures and pressures, the limited storage life and out-gassing characteristics.

Aspects that must be considered before selecting the application of thermoplastic
resins is that the melt processing used to produce thermoplastic composites limits
the viscosity that can be achieved. A dimensional limitation due to the viscosity
requirements can be illustrated using the example of wind turbine blades. Because
these blades are very large and long, it is impossible to push the resin through the
full length of the components even when applying high pressures. Therefore, the
melt process of thermoplastic composites is considered an unsuitable process for
manufacturing wind turbine blades.

5.1 Introduction

To be able to design and analyse aircraft or spacecraft structures, one first has to
become familiar with the structural elements and their functions. In this chapter the
different structural elements that can be observed in aeronautical structures and their
functions are discussed. This explanation is primarily qualitative of nature, but will
be further explored in the chapter 6 and 7, where loads acting upon these structural
elements are discussed and the stresses that they induce.

5.2 Airframe

The aircraft consists of numerous different elements and components that each fulfill
their own function. However, not all elements of an aircraft are considered to be
structural elements or fulfill a load bearing function. To distinguish elements that are
considered to be part of the structure of an aircraft or spacecraft from other elements,
these elements are often referred to as airframe.
There are several definitions that can be given for the airframe. An airframe is

  · the aircraft or spacecraft without installed equipment and furnishing
  · the skin and framework (skeleton) that provide aerodynamic shapes
  · the load bearing parts that take up forces during normal flight, manoeuvres,

      take-off, landing etcetera.
  · the parts that together protect the contents from the environment

                                                  75
76 R.C. Alderliesten
The reason that these different definitions exist can be attributed to the different
types of airframes or structures that can be identified. For example the Fokker Spin,
illustrated in Figure 5.1, is completely different in appearance than the military aircraft
that are operated these days, see for example the illustration in Figure 5.2 of a Sukhoi
SU-25.
Defining airframe as the parts that protect the contents from the environment may
be considered applicable for the fuselage and wing structure of a commercial aircraft,
but is hardly applicable to the Fokker Spin, where the pilot is only protected from the
environment by elements that are not part of the airframe.

Within the airframe a more detailed distinction is made between structural elements
that fulfil a critical or a non-critical function. Elements that fulfil a critical function are
elements that in case of damage or failure could lead to failure of the entire aircraft or
spacecraft. These structural elements are referred to as primary structures. Structural
elements that fulfil non-critical functions are elements that carry only aerodynamic
and inertial loads generated on or in that type of structure. These structural elements
are called secondary structures.

5.3 Structural concepts

In the past century, different structural concepts have been developed and explored
that form the basis of current structural design in both aviation and space. In this
section these concepts will be described briefly.
78 R.C. Alderliesten

5.3.1 Truss structures

The first structural concept applied in aircraft structures was the truss structure. This
structural concept was widely applied at the time in, for example, (railway) bridge
structures. Truss structures are made of bars, tubes and wires (wire-bracing of a
structure). A famous example of wire-bracing of a structure is the Fokker Spin shown
in Figure 5.1.
The aircraft in the first decades of aviation were built with truss structures in which the
bars, tubes and wires carried all loads. The skin or fabric coverage did not contribute
to the load bearing function.
The elements of the truss structure transfer the loads primarily via tension and
compression. Structural rigidity is obtained with the diagonal function, i.e. wires or
rods placed under 45°. In Figure 5.4 the diagonal function in the truss structure is
illustrated. The concept can be applied in three-dimensions to sustain bending and
torsional loading.
The diagonal function can be performed by either wires (only in tension), rods and
tubes (tension and compression) and sheet material. The latter solution has led to
another structural concept that will be discussed next.

Figure 5.4
Illustration of truss structure concept: diagonal function with wire-bracing (a-c), with rods (d), and with sheet (e-h).
(TU Delft, n.d., 5-4.jpg. Own Work.)

Although truss structures were the first structural concept introduced in airframes,
this does not automatically mean that the concept has become outdated. In some
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 79

modern applications, the introduction of tailored truss structures has led to significant
weight savings.

Figure 5.5

tubes, (Rawal 2001), and right: deployable truss concept for space applications. Derivative from NASA (2001,
2010), Public Domain.

Such an example is illustrated in Figure 5.5, where the ribs in the centre fuselage
section of the Space Shuttle have been constructed partly from a truss structure
using boron-aluminium tubes leading to a 45% weight saving over the original
baseline design. Truss structures also enable deployment concepts which are of
interest for space applications.

5.3.2 Shell structures

With the introduction of metal in aircraft structures a different structural concept
was introduced. This concept relates to the application of sheet material in a truss
structure to fulfil the diagonal function. In this truss configuration, the sheet performs
the diagonal function in shear, whereas the wires and rods only perform that function
in tension and compression. For this reason, sheet material is very efficient to
reinforce such structure. However, with the introduction of sheet material in the
structure, it is no longer considered a truss structure, but rather a thin-walled shell
structure.
Four functions that can be performed by sheet material are illustrated in Figure 5.6.
In addition to tension and compression (also with tubes and wires), sheet material
can carry load in shear (diagonal function), but can also seal a structure from its
80 R.C. Alderliesten

environment. This is particularly of interest for the pressurization of a structure
(including the ability to carry membrane stresses) and for the application of integral
fuel tanks.

Figure 5.6
Four functions of sheet: tension, compression, diagonal/shear, sealing (air/fuel tight). (Alderliesten, 2011, 5-6.jpg.
Own Work.)

To fully exploit the benefits of sheet material, it may be necessary to reinforce the
sheet with other elements. Without any additional reinforcement, sheet material can
easily carry tensile loads up to its ultimate strength. However, a sheet in compression
will bulge out without being able to carry significant compressive loads, see Figure
5.7 (a). Only when the sheet is reinforced or geometrically stiffened, as illustrated in
Figure 5.7 (b,c), it is able to carry more compressive load.
Apparently, the sheet stiffness cannot be used when it bulges, but when the sheet is
formed into a profile its obtained stiffness can be used in compression. This means
that stiffness in the structural context is not only a material property, but also a
geometrical property. Figure 5.7 (c) illustrates that the sheet of example (a) can be
stiffened by another sheet that is formed into a profile, where the combination of
the two sheets becomes a load carrying structure in which the flat sheet carries a
significant part of the applied load.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 81

Figure 5.7
Stiffness of sheet material versus geometrical stiffness. (Alderliesten, 2011, 5-7.jpg. Own Work.)

The combination of a flat or slightly curved sheet with stiffeners is called a shell
structure. There are multiple stiffener geometries that can be used to reinforce a shell
structure. The difference between a sheet reinforced with so-called hat stiffeners and
a sheet reinforced with an L-shaped stiffener is illustrated in Figure 5.8. The stability
of the hat-stiffener is higher than the L-stiffener, where at certain compressive loads
the flange will bulge out, similar to the flat sheet in Figure 5.7 (a), but only at the
unsupported edge.

Figure 5.8
Effect of stiffener geometry on deformation induced by panel compression. (Alderliesten, 2011, 5-8.jpg. Own Work.)

For this reason the shape of the stiffener is considered in structural design. Heavy
loaded structures, such as, for example, the upper wing panels (upward wing bending
causes compression in the upper shell structure) hat-stiffeners are often applied.
In shell structures that carry less compressive loads (lower wing panels), often L-
82 R.C. Alderliesten
shape or Z-shape stiffeners are applied. An additional advantage is that these stringer
shapes enable inspection from all sides, while hat stiffeners cannot be inspected
internally.
Another design consideration is the distance between the stiffeners. A single stiffener
attached to a flat shell (Figure 5.9) has only a limited and local effect on the stability
of the shell structure. Depending on the stiffener geometry an effective width can
be determined. Based upon this effective width, spacing between stiffeners must be
chosen in the design.

Figure 5.9
Effect of stiffener spacing on stability of panel under compression. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-9.jpg. Own Work.)

Where initially a beam structure was designed as truss structure, where bending was
taken up by normal forces in the upper and lower tubes and the diagonal function
performed by the diagonally placed elements, the introduction of sheet material has
led to more efficient beam concepts. The sheet performing the diagonal function is
called the web plate, whereas the elements taking up the (bending) loads by normal
forces are called the girders. This beam concept is illustrated in Figure 5.10.

An illustration of the application of the beam concept in a fuselage structure is given
in Figure 5.11. Here the frames, clips and stringers all utilize the characteristic beam
concept with web plate and girders.

Frames and stringers based upon the beam concept. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-11.jpg. Own Work.)

5.3.3 Sandwich structures

An alternative shell structure is the sandwich structure. The sandwich structure
contains a low density core in-between two face sheets. This concept basically
exploits the same concept as the beam based on web plate and girders. Where the
normal forces are carried by the face sheets, the diagonal shear function is provided
by the core in-between the facings. However, the sandwich structure carries the loads
in two directions. This similarity in concept is illustrated in Figure 5.12.
84 R.C. Alderliesten

Sandwich structures are in fact bonded structures because of the adhesion between
face sheets and core. There are several core concepts that could be applied. The
honeycomb core structure illustrated in Figure 5.13, could be made from either metals
or polymers. In composite sandwich structures, polymer honeycombs are being used,
while in the past (see Bréguet Atlantic example on the next page) aluminium
sandwiches structures used aluminium honeycomb cores. The advantage of
honeycomb cores is the low weight due to the high percentage of empty volume.

Figure 5.12
Illustration of similarity of concept between beam and sandwich; the girders and face sheets carry the normal
forces, while the web plate and core provide the diagonal function. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-12.jpg. Own Work.)

Alternative core solutions are based on the application of balsawood or foams. The
foam cores can either be made of polymers or metals.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 85

Figure 5.13
Illustration of sandwich concept utilizing the honeycomb core. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-13.jpg. Own Work.)

The advantage of the sandwich concept is the inherent high bending stiffness. For
this reason, sandwich structures are often applied as floor concept in passenger and
cargo areas of aircraft. To illustrate the benefit in bending stiffness and strength, in
Figure 5.15 for a given sandwich lay-up the relative increase in bending stiffness,
strength and weight is shown. With adding low density core material, the weight is
only slightly increased, while the bending stiffness may increase order of magnitudes.

   Example: Sandwich panel concept
   The sandwich structure may be considered an excellent structural concept,
   because it requires no additional stiffening elements providing a smooth
   surface. However, examples from the (recent) past have also put the emphasis
   on the drawback of this concept.In 1970 the Bréguet Atlantic, shown in Figure
   5.14 (a) revealed substantial corrosion issues related to moisture absorbed by
   the sandwich structure. One may assume that the sandwich structure is a
   closed system, but nonetheless, moisture is being picked up by the sandwich
86 R.C. Alderliesten

   structure, and the moisture remains subsequentially trapped inside, see the X-
   ray photo in Figure 5.14 (b).
   To illustrate that this is not a particular problem related to metallic sandwich
   structures, but to sandwich structures in general, another example is shown in
   Figure 5.14 (c). On March 6, 2005, an Airbus A310-308 operated by Air Transat
   designated Flight 961 had to perform an emergency landing after it lost in-flight
   a composite sandwich rudder of several meters length.Subsequent
   investigation revealed that moisture absorbed by the sandwich panel trapped
   between core and face sheets caused rapid delamination of the face sheets
   from the core, as a result of volumetric increase of the frozen moisture.

    Figure 5.14
    Illustration of detrimental environmental influence on sandwich concept: corrosion in metallic
    sandwich (a,b) and rapid delamination in composite sandwich (c). Derivative from top left: Bidini,

    Copyright TSB, Use Permitted.

In general, the sandwich concept is an excellent structural concept. However, one
should bear in mind that there are several drawbacks related to this concept. First of
all, details like the mechanical joints to other structural elements are usually complex
and expensive. Simple riveting or use of bolts is not possible, because the soft core
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 87

is not able to carry the bearing load induced by bolts, causing delamination between
facing and core. The high clamping forces often required for bolted joints is also not
possible, because the out of plane stiffness of the sandwich structure is only related
to the local stiffness of the face sheet and therefore low.
The second drawback is related to durability and aging of sandwich structures. As
explained in the example earlier, the environmental aspect of moisture absorption by
the sandwich panels is significant. Experience with for example composite sandwich
landing gear doors on Airbus aircraft has revealed that over a few years the weight
of such panel may increase by a kilogramme due to the high amount of moisture
absorption. Aside from the effect of increased weight on the aircraft performance; it
may also impair the structural integrity of the aircraft, similar to the example of the Air
Transat aircraft discussed before.

Effect of core thickness on bending stiffness. (Alderliesten, 2011, 5-15.jpg. Own Work.)

5.3.4 Integrally stiffened structures

The stiffened shell structures can be manufactured by attaching the stiffening
elements to the face sheet; this can be done by either using mechanically fastening
(riveting, bolting) or by bonding. Another method of manufacturing stiffened shell
structures is by taking a thick plate and machining away the material between the
stiffeners. This is illustrated in Figure 5.16.
88 R.C. Alderliesten

The advantage of the integral concept is the relative low cost of production.
Machining, or nowadays high-speed machining, is performed automated and
computer controlled, which enables high volume production at relatively low
production costs. A second manufacturing benefit of integral structures is the low
amount of parts. This reduces the logistic burden in a production facility.
Obviously, this concept leads to a high amount of scrap material. However, that does
not add to the manufacturing costs, because nowadays, the metal suppliers are pre-
milling such integral components before shipping them to the aircraft manufacturer.
The highest amount of scrap metal remains at the metal supplier who can insert that
material directly back into their production line.
Another advantage is that with machining the thickness can be tailored continuously,
which leads to optimized structures with respect to weight. However, a drawback
related to machining is that only simple blade stiffeners can be applied. Complex
stiffener concepts cannot be manufactured due to the accessibility of the milling
heads.

Figure 5.16
Creating an integrally stiffened panel by machining a thick plate. (Alderliesten, 2011, 5-16.jpg. Own Work.)

The difference between the earlier methods of creating a stiffened panel and an
integrally stiffened panel is that the latter consists of a single component. Or to put
it the other way around, the earlier mentioned concepts of riveting or bonding such
panels are build-up structures.
This means that in case of damage or cracks in the structure, the build-up structure
contains natural barriers that stop or retard the crack until a new crack has initiated in
the subsequent elements. In case of an integral structure, there is no natural barrier,
which means that the crack will grow continuously through the panel. As a result, the
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 89

integral structure is considered less damage tolerant (i.e. lower ability to withstand
damage and damage growth) than the build-up structure.
Because this concept is most cost-effective for thick reinforced plates, like for
example lower wing panels, the integral machined panel concept is mostly used on
larger aircraft.

5.4 Fuselage structures

The fuselage structure of pressurized aircraft is in fact a thin-walled pressure vessel,
exploiting the stiffened shell concept. In a fuselage structure different elements can
be identified that together provide strength and geometrical rigidity. These elements
are:

  · Fuselage skin
  · Frames
  · Stringers
  · Bulkheads
  · Splices and joints

The longitudinal stiffness of the structure is created in part by the closed cylindrical
shell structure, but to great extent by the application of stringers to the skin panels.
Another concept to create that rigidity is by combining stringers into longerons (i.e.
heavy longitudinal stiffeners that carry large loads). This concept then has only few
longitudinal stiffeners that have a larger cross section. An illustration of such concept
is given in Figure 5.17.
90 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 5.17
Longitudinal stiffness created with longerons. (Anon., n.d., Public Domain)

Pressurized fuselages require the application of bulkheads at the front and rear end of
the fuselage to create an air tight pressure vessel and to maintain the forces related
to the pressurization.

5.5 Wing structures

Wing structures contain similar stiffened shell concepts as explained in section 5.3,
but due to the different functions to be fulfilled, the elements have a different
appearance. In general, wing structures can be divided into:

  · Wing skin panels
  · Ribs
  · Spars
where the assembly of spars and skin require some further elaboration.
A first glance at wing structures reveals that, despite the use of similar elements, a
certain design freedom results in different structural appearances. This is illustrated
in Figure 5.18 where four structural wing lay-outs are compared.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 91

Some wings contain straight spars from wing root (wing-fuselage connection) to wing
tip, while other wings contain kinks in the spars. Such a kink in the spar most often
has to be achieved by connecting two spar elements at that particular location.

Figure 5.18
Comparison of four wing structural lay-outs. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-18.jpg. Own Work.)

Another aspect that strikes the eye is the orientation of the ribs in the wing structure.
Where some wings contain ribs that are placed in flight direction, other wings contain
ribs that are placed more or less perpendicular to the spars and wingspan direction.
In general, wing structures are characterised by the significant length the structural
elements may have; the wing skin panels and the spars are generally made out of
single components if possible. To get an indication of the length of large wings
structures, in Figure 5.19 a photo of the A380 wing structure is shown. Because of
the length aspect and the logistics related to that, some aircraft have wing structures
that are sectioned into, for example, inboard and outboard wings, or centre wings and
outer wings, like for example the C-130 Hercules illustrated in Figure 5.19.
92 R.C. Alderliesten

CC-BY-SA 3.0; and right: SAP - U.S. Air Force, (2007), Public Domain.

Despite the advantages of sectioning large structures with respect to manufacturing
and assembly, a potential disadvantage may be related to the highly loaded joints as
a result. For the C-130 Hercules, this joint, often referred to as the rainbow fitting, is a
well-known point of concern.

5.5.1 Ribs

The ribs in wing structures provide several functions. First of all, they maintain the
aerodynamic profile of wing. Because the aerodynamic profile of the wing is defined
in flight direction, this may be an important reason to place the ribs in flight direction.
However, aside from the manufacturing challenges to place the ribs under such
angles with the spars that are positioned in wing span direction; there is another
obvious reason why placing ribs perpendicular to the spars is preferred.
The length of the ribs is shorter when placed perpendicular to the spars and wing
span direction, than when placed in flight direction. The rib placement may be chosen
such to minimise weight.
The second function of ribs is to transfer the aerodynamic and fuel loads acting on
skin to the rest of the wing structure. The aerodynamic loads are related to the under-
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 93
pressure above the upper skin, while the fuel loads act directly on the lower wing
skins. These loads are brought into the structures via the ribs.
Thirdly, the ribs provide stability against panel crushing and buckling. This is illustrated
in Figure 5.20; without any ribs, the upward bending of the wing would crush the upper
and lower wing panels. With ribs at certain length, the upward bending would cause
buckling to the upper wing skin, but keep the lower wing skin at distance of the upper
wing skin. With the optimal rib spacing, both crushing and buckling are prevented and
the shape of the wing is preserved.
A fourth function of the rib that can be identified is the introduction of local loads.
Aside from aerodynamic and fuel loads, the wing structure is locally loaded by the
landing gear during landing, taxiing and take-off, and, during flight, the engines, flaps
and ailerons will locally apply loads to the structure as well. These loads are locally
introduced into the structure by the ribs.
A fifth function is the sealing function in case integral fuel tanks are used in the wing
structure. The ribs prevent the surge and splashing by sectioning the fuel tanks in
individual bays.

Figure 5.20
Illustration of the rib function; stability against crushing and buckling. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-20.jpg. Own Work.)
94 R.C. Alderliesten

Especially the local loads introduced into the wing by the ribs imply that different
loads are to be carried by individual ribs. As a consequence, different design concepts
or design philosophies may be chosen for individual ribs in the wing structure. This
is illustrated with the centre wing box of the C-130 Hercules in Figure 5.19; where,
depending on the location in the wing box, different rib designs have been applied.

In general, the selection of rib type and related manufacturing method depends on;

  · Loads

  · Design philosophy

  · Available equipment and experience

  · Costs

The loads relate to the functions of a particular rib, i.e. does it only provide stability
against buckling and crushing, or are significant loads being introduced locally by, for
example, the landing gear? The design philosophy determines the magnitude of the
stresses that are allowed in rib structures.

The available equipment and experience is an important aspect in this case. If certain
equipment or machines are not available, it is most likely that the rib design that
requires this equipment will not be chosen. To some extent it relates to the fourth
aspect, costs, if sufficient benefits can be identified, that particular type can still be
selected and costs related to acquiring the equipment has to be accounted for.

In case the design loads on the rib are relatively low, one may select the rib type that
is manufactured by forming sheet or plate material into a rib. The additional stiffness
may be added by adding stiffening profiles to that rib.

In case the loads are relatively high, i.e. near landing gears, a more rigid and stiff
design is required. This may be achieved by forging and machining a rib from thick
plate material.

A distinct difference between the two rib types is the difference near radii. In case of
forming plate material, the minimum bending radius is dictated by the properties of
the material. Smaller radii will lead to failure during bending. In case of machining,
similar inner radii with smaller outer radii can be achieved by milling, which provide a
(geometrically) stiffer connection with the surrounding structure.

5.5.2 Spars

The main function of the spars in a wing structure is to carry the wing bending loads.
As explained in section 5.3.2, the spars are beams designed to carry bending by
girders carrying the normal forces and web plates that carry the shear forces, see also
Figure 5.21.

Figure 5.21
Forces in the wing structure as result of upward wing bending. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-21.jpg. Own Work.)

The upward bending illustrated in the lower left part of Figure 5.21, requires some
additional attention. Zooming in a bit closer, it is evident that the elements in the wing
deform as illustrated in Figure 5.22. To carry the bending loads and to resist against
this deformation, the diagonal elements are very important. And as explained before,
the diagonal function can also be carried by sheet material, or web plates in this
matter.
As a result, the basic form of spars is often the I-beam, in which the girders pick up
the normal forces and the web plate the shear forces.
Although the deflection near the wing root is significant smaller than near the wing
tip, the loads near the wing root are significantly larger. The equilibrium between the
normal forces in both girders of the spar near the wing tip and the upward bending
moment, results in relatively small forces. Near the wing root, equilibrium must be
provided with the upward bending moment of the complete wing. This results in very
high forces near the wing root.
As a result the spar, the girders, and web plate, must be thicker near the wing root than
near the wing tip. However, extrusion of an I-beam (see chapter 4 for the extrusion
96 R.C. Alderliesten
process) can only be performed on constant cross-sections. A spar with varying
cross-section along the wing span cannot be extruded.

Figure 5.22
Deformation related to the upward wing bending. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-22.jpg. Own Work.)

Design concepts to deal with this manufacturing aspect are based on building up
the spar from different elements. Either the girders are separately manufactured and
connected to a web plate by riveting for example, or a spar with constant thickness
is extruded and subsequently reinforced by bonding additional sheet material to web
plate and girders. This is illustrated in Figure 5.23.

Figure 5.23
Build-up concepts to increase the cross sectional area of the spar towards the wing root. (TU Delft, 2018, 5-23.jpg.

                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 97
Similar to the discussion of the wing ribs, it can be concluded that depending on the
function of particular spars, the loads it has to carry, the design philosophy and the
available manufacturing equipment, different spar types can be selected, see Figure
5.24.
This also implies that the spar caps (girders) can be manufactured by extrusion and
or machining, or by forming sheet material, see Figure 5.25. The forming concept has
less geometrical stiffness compared to the extruded concept.

Illustration of the different spar types. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-24.jpg. Own Work.)

5.6 Torsion box

The wing is in general loaded by bending and torsional moments. It has been
explained that the bending moment can be easily carried by the spars. However, if
a wing contains only a single spar, it will not be able to carry the torsional moment,
because an I-beam has low resistance against torsion.
In case the wing is equipped with two spars, torsional moments can be carried
by differential bending. Differential bending means that torsional deformation is
translated to an upward bending of the rear spar and a downward bending of the front
spar. In this case, the spar is carrying bending loads for which it is designed.

Figure 5.26
Torsional moment in case of single (left) and two spars (right). (Alderliesten, 2011, 5-26.jpg. Own Work.)

However, despite that the resistance to the differential bending is well provided by the
spars, torsional moments can be carried more efficiently by a cylinder or closed box,
see Figure 5.27. This will be discussed in chapter 6 in more detail. In fact, the cross
section does not necessarily need to be cylindrical; any cross section may do, as long
as it remains a closed cross section.
A historical example of a single spar wing structure that uses the cylindrical torsion
tube is the Blackburn Duncanson, see Figure 5.27.
                                                Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 99

(right). Derivative from left: Alderliesten, 2011, 5-27-a.jpg, Own Work; and Aeroplane, n.d., 5-27-b.jpg, Own Work.)

The torsional resistance of a closed box structure can be exploited in a wing structure,
especially, because the cross section does not need to be circular. This is illustrated
in Figure 5.28. Compared to the two spar differential bending concept, the torsion box
contains thicker skins. The functions of these skins are to take up the aerodynamic
forces and to contribute to the torsion box. In that case they partially take over the
bending function of spar caps.
As a consequence the spar caps may have smaller cross sections than in case of the
two spar concept. The web plates of the spar will be thicker similar to the wing skins;
they contribute to the torsion box and add to the bending resistance.
The stringers in this concept reinforce the upper and lower wing skin and by doing so,
also partially contribute to the function the spar caps have in the two spar concept.
100 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 5.28
Illustration of the different structural elements in a torsion box. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-28.jpg. Own Work.)

The advantages of the torsion box over the two spar concept is that a completely
unsupported and load bearing structure can be achieved that does not require
support or struts. At given wing span, the wing can be thinner in case a torsion
box concept is applied, or similarly, at given wing thickness the wing can be longer.
Additionally, by designing the torsion box carefully, the torsion stiffness and the
bending stiffness can be engineered separately.
In general, the torsion box concept results in lower structural weight compared to the
two spar concept.

5.7 Structural details

Considering the fuselage and wing structures, the elements and their functions have
been discussed. However, by creating a three-dimensional structure one will realise
that the intersections between the different structural elements require additional
considerations. Four examples are discussed here; stringer joggling, stringer
couplings at the location where two fuselage barrels are joined, stringer frame
intersections, and stringer rib intersections.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 101

Figure 5.29
Illustration of stringer joggling. (Alderliesten, 2011, 5-29.jpg. Own Work.)

Because the loads are not constant throughout the fuselage structure, the required
thickness of fuselage skin panels will vary. The outer surface of the fuselage must
be undisturbed for aerodynamic reasons, which implies that thickness steps in the
fuselage skin are provided at the inner side of the panel. This can be achieved by either
milling thickness step out of thicker sheet material, or by adding additional layers, or
so called doublers. These doublers can be riveted or bonded to the skin structure.
The stringers that are attached to the skin have to follow these thickness steps. A
common method is to joggle the stringers. Joggling of a stringer implies a shear
deformation of the stringer, as illustrated in Figure 5.29.
A fuselage structure is built up from different panels that are connected by
longitudinal and circumferential joints. This implies that the panels are manufactured
including stringers, but that once the panels are joined in assembly, the stringers
can be connected to each other. This is illustrated in Figure 5.30. The joint between
the fuselage skin panels is created by adding splice plates at the inner side of the
structure, to obtain an aerodynamically smooth surface outside.
These splice plates also cause thickness steps that have to be accounted for by the
stringers that are attached to the fuselage skin. When a stringer coupling is used to
connect the stringers of both panels, the design of the coupling needs to account for
the thickness step.
102 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 5.30
Illustration of stringer connection at the joint between two fuselage barrels. (TU Delft, n.d., 5-30.jpg. Own Work.)

Another intersection between stiffening elements that has to be considered is the
intersection between stringer and frame. To create the three-dimensional geometry
here, there are in general two concepts to provide the intersection. In both cases, the
stringers are continuous and not interrupted to have the optimal longitudinal stiffness
of the panel.
In the first concept, the frame is locally interrupted to provide an opening for the
stringer. This method implies a local weakening of the frame and reduction in bending
resistance of the beam. The other concept positions the frame above (floating) the
stringers and provides the connection between frame and fuselage skin by
castellation or clips. An illustration of both concepts is given in Figure 5.31.
Similarly to the frame stringer intersection, intersections between stringers and ribs
have to be created in wing structures. Figure 5.32 illustrates that for this case there
are in general three possible solutions to enable the intersection;

  · Both the rib and stringer are uninterrupted
  · The stringer is interrupted
  · The rib is interrupted
The selection of the most appropriate concept depends on the loads that act locally
upon the structure and the manufacturability of the concept.

5.8 Typical spacecraft structures

When looking at the spacecraft, one has to take into account that space despite
being the operational environment of the spacecraft, does not solely determine the
structural design. In fact, the main structural items that can be observed in the
spacecraft are dimensioned to sustain all loads related to launch. This means that the
forces provided by thrust at the lower end of the launch vehicle have to be transferred
106 R.C. Alderliesten

through the structure, including the spacecraft structure. To accomplish this load
transfer through the spacecraft structure, two categories of spacecraft structures can
be distinguished

  · Strutted structures
  · Central cylindrical shell structures
Both types of structures will be briefly discussed in this section.

5.8.1 Strutted structure

Part of the launch vehicle is the payload adaptor that is discussed in section 5.9.4.
One may assume that the load provided by thrust to be transferred through the
spacecraft structure is inserted in to the structure by the adaptor.
One way to create the necessary load paths through the structure is by using struts.
These struts basically are a form of truss structure, discussed in section 5.2.1, where
the struts are loaded primarily in compression in their longitudinal axis. An example of
a truss structure is given in Figure 5.34.

Figure 5.34
Example of a spacecraft utilizing a truss structure. (ESA, 2012, Copyright ESA, Use Permitted.)

An important dimensioning aspect then will be the stability of the trusses, see chapter
8. The trusses should not bulge out in compression, but remain stable to be able to
transfer the load to the remaining structure. However, because the primary function of
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 107
the trusses is to sustain this particular load case, they can be optimized for this case
with particular material and shape solutions, like, for example, the struts in the Space
Shuttle ribs mentioned in section 5.2.1.

5.8.2 Central cylindrical shell structure

The central cylindrical shell structure configuration distinguishes itself from other
structures, because it has a major central thrust-load-bearing member in the form of
a cone of a cylinder (Wertz & Larson, 1999). All load provided by thrust and inserted
via the adaptor is transferred through a central cylinder that is primarily dimensioned
for this load case.
All systems within the spacecraft are attached at strong points directly to the cylinder
or they are attached by combinations of struts, platforms and shear webs. An
example is illustrated in Figure 5.35.

5.9 Typical launch vehicle structures

In this section the four main structural parts of the launch vehicle are discussed: the
payload fairing, the stage structures, the thrust structures and the adaptors.

5.9.1 Payload fairings

The payload fairing is an important part of the launch vehicle. It protects the payload
during launch and ascent against the aggressive environment, i.e. aerodynamic
heating and pressure. Once the launch vehicle is outside the atmosphere, the fairings
are disposed, exposing the payload to the environment. The consequence of the
fairing disposal is that the to be accelerated mass will decrease, which increases the
efficiency of the thrust.

5.9.2 Stage structures

Rocket launchers typically consist of multiple stages, which each contain a rocket
propulsion system with several subsystems within the structure. These stages can
either be placed in sequence, i.e. on top of each other, or in parallel. The main stage
forms the core of the launcher, while booster stages are often placed in parallel
to increase the thrust during the initial part of the ascent. The booster stages are
illustrated in Figure 5.33.
Different design concepts could be chosen for the stage structure. The two most
important design concepts can be characterized by whether the fuel tanks are part of
the load bearing structure, or not.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 109

Figure 5.36

structure (right). Derivative from NASA, (n.d.), Public Domain.

The exploded view in Figure 5.36 illustrates the assembly of the structural
components in case the fuel tanks are part of the load bearing structure. The
structural components are connected with interface structures to transfer the load
from one component to another. The skin concept is usually referred to as semi-
monocoque, i.e. load bearing skin containing internal stiffeners, as explained earlier.
The design concept in which the fuel tanks are not part of the primary structure
contains an external skin that is separated from the internal tanks by longerons and
circular stiffeners, this is illustrated in the right part of Figure 5.36

5.9.3 Thrust structures

The thrust structure is an important part of the launcher as all loads introduced by
the propulsion system is transferred via this structure into the main stages of the
110 R.C. Alderliesten

launcher. The high loads (Ariane 5 about 15000 kN at take-off ~ 1500 tons) are
introduced rather concentrated and must be distributed into the stage structure via a
conical structure, as illustrated in Figure 5.37.

Figure 5.37
Illustrations of ARES V thrust structures (left -NASA, 2007, Public Domain) and section of the Ariane 5 HM60
conical thrust structure (engine mounted on top of cone) (right - TU Delft, n.d., 5-37.jpg, Own Work)

5.9.4 Adaptors

A similar function of transferring loads, as mentioned for the conical structure that is
part of the thrust structure, has to be fulfilled by the adaptors. This part is located in
the upper part of the structure and has the primary function to transfer the loads from
the stages into the spacecraft or satellite located in the payload area under the fairing.
Hence similar conical shapes can be observed, as illustrated in Figure 5.38, where
instead of the load distributed to a wider area, the loads are rather concentrated
into the primary structure of the spacecraft, especially when the spacecraft applies a
central cylindrical shell design, see section 5.8.2.

6. Aircraft & spacecraft loads

6.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter, typical aircraft and spacecraft structures have been
discussed. The structural elements belonging to the airframe fulfil primarily load
bearing functions. After reviewing the structural elements and their characteristics, it
is time to consider the loads acting on these structures and elements.
This chapter will review typical loads and load cases for both aircraft and spacecraft.
These loads can be divided into concentrated and distributed loads, which each can
be divided into static or dynamic loads. These characteristics together with the typical
load paths will be discussed in this chapter.

6.2 Externally loaded airframe

To assess the flight performance, an aircraft in horizontal steady flight is typically
illustrated with the principle forces that act on such aircraft; lift in equilibrium with
weight, and thrust in equilibrium with drag, see for example Figure 6.1. These
equilibriums change for various manoeuvres, but are commonly based on the major
forces.
However, although sufficient for representing the forces and equilibriums when
describing aircraft performance, this presentation becomes insufficient when
considering structures and loads acting on those structures. For example, the
presentation of Figure 6.1 may be more accurately presented by the illustration in
Figure 6.2.

Figure 6.2
Concentrated and distributed forces acting on an aircraft in flight. Derivative from Mr_worker, (2014), Public
Domain.

The presentation of Figure 6.1 for instance, provides equilibrium for the complete
aircraft, but it does not provide a realistic presentation for the wing structure. For the
wing, Figure 6.1 is insufficient as it does not show the forces acting on the wing. In
fact, it assumes (equilibrium of) all forces are acting on the centre of gravity. Here, a
presentation like in Figure 6.2 seems to give a better picture; the lift generated by the
wing is partly compensated for by the weight of the wing and engines, while the thrust
is to an even lesser extent compensated by the drag of the wing. The resultants are
of course acting on the centre of gravity creating equilibrium with the fuselage and
empennage of the aircraft.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 115

In general, the airframe is loaded by a combination of loads, or load cases, which
may be attributed to aircraft manoeuvres, gusts, cabin pressure, landing, etc. The
loads act on the structure either by concentrated or distributed forces. For example,
the thrust is illustrated in Figure 6.2 as a concentrated load, while the wing lift is
represented as distributed force acting on the wing. In fact, the engines apply the
thrust to the wing via few bolts (concentrated loads), while the lift is a force resulting
from pressure multiplied with the area it acts on (distributed force). The consequence
of concentrated or distributed loading acting on a structure is illustrated with the
example of a beam in bending.

   Example: Bending of a beam
      Consider the beam illustrated in Figure 6.3 rigidly clamped at one side and

   loaded at the other side by a concentrated load at the end of the beam or a
   distributed load decreasing towards the tip of the beam. If both load cases
   represent the same total force P in vertical direction, then the deflection of the
   beam for the concentrated and distributed case can be given by

                                                      and
      respectively, where P is the total vertical load, the length of the beam, E the
   Young's modulus and I the area moment of inertia.

    Beam bending induced by a concentrated force (left) and a distributed force (right). (Alderliesten,
    2011, 6-3.jpg. Own Work.)
116 R.C. Alderliesten

6.3 Load path

To understand the meaning of loads acting on a given structure, first the load path
must be understood. A load path is a physical trajectory that links the location of
applied force and forces elsewhere that provide equilibrium with the applied force.
However, this trajectory should be able to carry and transfer the loads. This is
illustrated with the point force acting at a certain location in space, as illustrated in
Figure 6.4

Figure 6.4
Different load paths for a point force acting in space. (Alderliesten, 2011, 6-4.jpg. Own Work.)

For the case where the force is applied downward in vertical direction, there are
several solutions to provide equilibrium. A simple cable or rod may be sufficient to
be connected between the point force and the wall. In this case the cable or rod
represents the load path and it is loaded in tension. For the second case in Figure
6.4, however, the cable may not be sufficient, because the point force would cause
the cable to rotate. As a result, equilibrium would not be obtained and thus the cable
cannot provide the load path.
The solution in that case may be to connect the point force with a beam to the wall.
The beam would resist bending and equilibrium would be obtained not only with a
horizontal force at the wall in opposite direction of the applied point force, but as will
be explained later in this chapter, also by a set of forces in vertical direction.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 117

6.3.1 Cathedral structures

An illustrative example of load paths is given by looking at old cathedrals. These
thin-walled and often tall structures are dimensioned to carry the weight of its own
structure in compression. However, because of the thin walls and the tall structure,
the addition of the roof structure on top of the walls would result in resultant forces
pushing the walls away from each other. Because the walls can only carry load in the
plane of its structure, this would lead to collapse of the building. There are two basic
methods to avoid this type of failure (see Figure 6.5)

  · Using tensile elements to provide equilibrium in the roof structure (inside)
  · Using buttresses to provide a load path through the cathedral structure (outside)

Figure 6.5
Two concepts to sustain the loads from the roof structure's weight. (Alderliesten, 2011, 6-5.jpg. Own Work.)

Because the materials and corresponding production techniques were not yet
sufficiently developed to manufacture elements that could be loaded in tension, the
designers of these structures used buttresses. The design of buttresses is based on
the concept that the resultant force induced by the roof structure can be directed
further downward by adding additional forces directed downward. These additional
forces are applied by the weight of the buttress structure.
118 R.C. Alderliesten
Comparing the different churches and cathedrals, one may observe differences in
the design of the buttresses. The weight of the buttresses necessary to provide a
resultant force path to the ground can be obtained with three solutions:

  · Creating wide buttresses or long flying buttresses to achieve sufficient distance
      from the central structure to be in line with the load path for the lateral forces

  · Creating very thick buttresses to create sufficient weight to provide a resultant
      load path within the buttress

  · Creating very tall buttresses with long decorated peaks of which the weight
      provides a resultant load path through the relatively thin buttresses.

6.3.2 Bending of beam structures

Consider the deflection of a beam as illustrated in Figure 6.7. The vertical load applied
at the free end of the beam will cause a deflection. Looking at the left hand side
illustration in that figure, the load path obviously consists of normal forces at the
upper and lower surfaces (or girders) and shear forces in the web plate, see section
5.3.2.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 119

For both cases (a) and (c) in Figure 6.7, the load path is in equilibrium with the applied
force in the centre of the cross section. However, for case (b) the shear forces in the
web plate are not aligned with the applied force. The distance between the centre of
the web plate, see Figure 6.8 (a), and the centre of the cross section will induce a
resulting moment. This moment is in fact a torsional moment, which will rotate the
beam together with the vertical deflection.

Figure 6.7
Bending of a beam with different cross sections. (Alderliesten, 2011, 6-7.jpg. Own Work).

Concerning the load in the elements of the beam, it has been mentioned before that
the forces at the clamped side of the beam are high. The magnitude of these forces
depends on the applied load at the other end and the length L of the beam. The longer
the beam, the higher the normal forces in the girders at the root.
This equilibrium can be illustrated with Figure 6.8 (b); the applied load multiplied with
the length L must be in equilibrium with the product of normal forces and height H.
This means that at the end of the beam the normal forces are zero and they linearly
build up towards the root. Taking a section of the girder at any location of the beam, as
indicated by the square in Figure 6.8 (b), and looking at its force equilibrium, it can be
observed that equilibrium is provided by the increase of normal forces and the shear
forces that the web plate applies to the girder.
Here, it is evident that the shear forces in the web are constant throughout the web
plate. Cutting away a part of the web plate, see Figure 6.8 (c), means that the normal
forces in the girders are not increasing in the area where the web plate is removed.
Only due to the constant shear forces that the web plate applies to the girders,
the normal forces increase. Without the shear forces, the normal forces would be
constant.

6.4 Loads and load paths in an airframe

It has been discussed a few times, that due to the lift generated by the wing, the wing
will bend upward. All lift generated by the wings will be in equilibrium with the weight
of the wing and the fuselage. But if the aircraft is considered as two beams that cross,
then the lift will provide an upward bending of the wing beam, while the weight of
the fuselage beam will cause a downward bending over the wing. This deformation is
illustrated in Figure 6.9. Both the lift generated by the wings and the weight of wing
and fuselage are considered to be distributed forces acting on the structure.

Figure 6.9
Upward wing bending and downward fuselage bending. (Alderliesten, 2011, 6-9.jpg. Own Work.)
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 121

Examples of concentrated loads are the forces applied to the aircraft by the landing
gears, see Figure 6.10. If the aircraft stands on the platform, the forces introduced by
the landing gears are in equilibrium with the total weight of the aircraft.

Figure 6.10
Concentrated forces applied to the airframe by the landing gears. Derivative from Lampel, (2013), CC-BY-SA3.0.

The load path that can be identified in this case starts at the local load introduction of
the landing gear, via the rib at that location into the wing structure. Here, the normal
forces are carried via the skins, while the shear forces are carried by the web plate of
the spars. Although Figure 6.10 only illustrates the load path from the main landing
gear towards the fuselage, also part of the load should provide equilibrium with the
weight of the wing (and engines) towards the wing tip.
Let's consider the aircraft as it is standing on the platform. Wind may apply a load on
the vertical tail plane as illustrated in Figure 6.11. If the vertical tail plane is considered
to be clamped at the fuselage, the deformation may be represented by a beam under
bending, as illustrated in the right hand side of the figure. Notice that as the wind
applies to the complete surface of the vertical tail plane is considered a distributed
load. Because the frontal surface decreases towards the tail tip, the forces most likely
will reduce towards the tip.
122 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 6.11

Thus the forces are in equilibrium by forces at the root of the vertical tail. However,
if the fuselage is considered to be a cylinder which is `clamped' at the location of
the wing, then the bending moment on the vertical tail will rotate the fuselage, as
illustrated in Figure 6.12.

Figure 6.12
Rotation of the fuselage (a) with as result shear deformation of the skin panels (b). (Alderliesten, 2011, 6-12.jpg.
Own Work.)

Zooming in further onto the fuselage structure, the fuselage skin panels will deform in
shear due to the torsion of the fuselage.
The fuselage was assumed to be `clamped' in the area of the wing. If the aircraft
is standing on the platform, the bending moment on the vertical tail and torsional
moment on the fuselage will be in equilibrium with the main landing gear. The reaction
forces introduced by the landing gear will be different in magnitude, where the
difference between these forces will be providing the equilibrium.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 123

Figure 6.13
Upward bending and rotation of the wing. Derivative from: Ienac, (2006), Public Domain.

A similar discussion may apply to the bending and rotation of the wing in flight. First,
the wing may be considered clamped at the root and bending is carried by the upper
and lower wing skins in respectively compression and tension forces. The torsional
loading will be carried by shear in the torsion box, i.e. both wing skins and both web
plates of the spars.
In cruise, the loads will be similar for both wings, which imply that the forces acting
on the centre wing box in the fuselage will be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.
Here, the example of the cathedral structure may explain more specifically how load
should be introduced into a structure. Consider the A400M shown in Figure 6.14. The
connection between the wing structure and the fuselage structure could be designed
in different ways. Two possible solutions are illustrated in Figure 6.15.

transport aircraft (right). Derivative of Sapp - U.S. Air Force, (2006, 2011), Public Domain.

Figure 6.15
Illustration of two solutions to connect the wing structure to the fuselage structure. (Alderliesten, 2011, 6-15.jpg.
Own Work.)

The first solution, Figure 6.15 (a), is not preferred, because it will not only introduce the
lift generated by the wing into the fuselage structure, but also all bending deformation
as result of that lift. Locally the frames of the fuselage will be highly loaded by tension
and torsional forces, which can only be achieved by designing very large and thick
frames. But even then, it may be disputable whether the design would suffice.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 125

The second solution, Figure 6.15 (b), is the preferred solution and in fact the solution
applied on the A400M and other aircraft. The centre wing box is designed such
that the normal forces introduced by the upper and lower wing skin due to wing
bending are carried by the upper and lower skin of the centre wing box. Only the lift
is introduced into the fuselage structure as vertical force by four attachment points
(lugs).
In that respect, this example may be compared to the example of the cathedral
structure. The roof due to its weight introduces forces that push the walls away from
each other. The solution applied in the past was to guide all these forces through the
structure towards the ground using buttresses.
However, a leaner solution resulting in significant less weight would be to provide
equilibrium inside the roof for the forces acting outward, and to guide only the vertical
component of the weight into the remaining structure, see the left hand side of Figure
6.5.

6.5 Complex load cases

In this section two more complicated load cases for aircraft structures will be
discussed: fuselage loads and dynamic loads.

6.5.1 Fuselage loads

In general, one has to be aware that the many possible load cases acting on the
structure either as concentrated loads, or as distributed loads, provide a complex
picture of areas on the structure that are dictated by different load cases and damage
scenarios.
This is illustrated in Figure 6.16. Static ground loads can be significant near the
landing gears, but will be less restrictive in other areas. The earlier mentioned
downward bending of the fuselage over the wing due to its weight will imply
longitudinal tension in the upper part of the fuselage. Together with the
circumferential tension as a result of pressurization (which also adds to the
longitudinal tension, see next chapter), this will make tension and fatigue dominant
126 R.C. Alderliesten

load cases for the upper fuselage. The lower fuselage however, will be predominantly
facing compression loads due to the fuselage bending, with as consequence
dominant criteria on stability.

Figure 6.16
Illustration of the dominant load cases and design criteria in the fuselage structure. (TU Delft, 2018, 6-16.jpg. Own
Work.)

The aft side fuselage shells will face shear and fatigue loads, introduced by the loads
introduced by the empennage. One example of the bending of the vertical tail plane
has been discussed at the beginning of this section.

6.5.2 Dynamic loads

The discussion of loads and load paths in this chapter has been limited implicitly to
quasi-static loading, i.e. an external load is applied to the structure and equilibrium
must be provided. However, in an aircraft not all loads are quasi-static. Some loading
appears to be very dynamic of nature. Although fatigue, discussed in chapter 10,
relates to cyclic loading, it relates in most cases still to quasi-static loading. For
example, the pressurization cycle (equivalent to a single flight) may be analyzed as
a single load cycle in an almost constant fatigue loading spectrum over the year.
Nonetheless, the load cycle itself is considered quasi-static.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 127

Sometimes interaction of aerodynamic forces, structural elastic reactions, and inertia
of components may induce oscillations of aircraft components. These oscillations
may be quite significant and severe. One example of these oscillations may be flutter,
which may lead to destruction of components if not anticipated for.
Another example is buffeting caused by airflow separation from one component onto
another. A well known example here is the buffeting issues related to the two vertical
tails of the F18 Hornet.
Because the oscillations may increase if natural frequencies of the structure are
approached, the design has to take into account the damping properties of the
structure or component. In addition, the design should account for natural
frequencies and attempt to keep the natural frequencies outside the range of potential
frequencies of oscillations. An example of this approach is discussed for spacecraft
structures in chapter 8.

6.6 Load and load cases for spacecraft structures

Spacecraft in general face different types of loading compared to aircraft. A
distinction has to be made between the loads related to handling and pretesting, the
loads related to launching and the loads occurring once the structure is in orbit.
The load cases considered prior to launching are the handling and transportation
loads as well as the vibration and acoustic test loads.
The static and dynamic loads during launching can be categorized by:

  · Quasi-static
  · Sine vibration
  · Acoustic noise and random vibration
  · Shock loads

The consequence of these loads for design is discussed in detail in chapter 8. In orbit
the spacecraft will experience shock loads, structurally transmitted loads, internal
pressure and thermal stress. These are generally much lower than launch loads and
are not discussed in detail in this book.

The steady state loads can be directed either in axial direction of the launching vehicle
or perpendicular to that direction (lateral direction). The main load case acting in axial
direction is the thrust generated by the engine of the launching vehicle. Wind gust and
vehicle manoeuvres are generally oriented in lateral direction.
One important distinction one has to make here is the primary axis of the spacecraft
(satellite, etc) with respect to the primary axis of the launching vehicle. The
explanation of axial loads and lateral loads may seem obvious for the case illustrated
in Figure 6.17, but when designing a spacecraft, it depends on the orientation of the
spacecraft with respect to the launching vehicle, see Figure 6.18.

The upper case in the right hand side of Figure 6.18 has its primary axis perpendicular
to the maximum acceleration, whereas the lower case has its primary axis parallel

scenarios.
7. Translating loads to stresses

7.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter, the loads acting on an aircraft or spacecraft structure have
been discussed. These loads are generally considered to act at certain locations
on the structure either by concentrated loads or by distributed loads. These loads
induce deformations in the structure that correlate to stresses within the structure.
To understand this, one should reconsider the example of the tensile test in chapter
1, where the load acting on the specimen induces an elongation (deformation) of the
specimen, which corresponds to the stress in the specimen, calculated with the load
divided by the cross section.
In this chapter, some cases are dealt with to explain how loads acting on an aircraft
or spacecraft structure will induce deformation, but also lead to stresses within the
structure. These stresses must be known, to be able to assess whether the materials
used in the structure are capable to sustain the loads. Here, the stresses calculated
from the loads acting on the structure should be compared with the stress-strain
response of the materials to identify whether sufficient strain is present, and whether
the material's stiffness will be sufficient to limit deformations to acceptable levels.

7.2 Pressurization of a fuselage structure

As commercial aircraft commonly operate at altitudes of 10000 meters, aircraft
fuselages are pressurised to ensure that crew and passengers can breath normally. In
this section the stresses induced into the structure as a result are explained.

 7.2.1 Stresses in cylindrical pressure vessel

  The circumferential and longitudinal stresses in a pressure vessel can be derived
  from equilibrium within the vessel. To calculate the circumferential stress, one first
  considers the upper half of a pressure vessel with unit length as illustrated in Figure
  7.1.

   Figure 7.1
   Equilibrium between radial pressure distribution and circumferential stress per unit vessel length. (TU Delft, n.d.,
   7-1.jpg. Own Work.)

  There should be equilibrium in vertical direction between the circumferential stress
         and the vertical component of the pressure p acting at the inner surface of the

  vessel. Per unit length1 of the vessel, this equilibrium can be described with
                                                                                                  (7.1)

  Goniometric analysis of the pressure difference (i.e. inside - outside) acting on an
  element implies that the vertical components of the radial pressure per unit length
  is given by

                                                                                                  (7.2)

1. Per unit length means that the parameter L describing the length of the pressure vessel is set equal to 1. It
      therefore can be neglected in equations (7.1) and (7.2). One should be aware however, that the correct relation
      between load and stress is given by a cross sectional area (length x thickness) rather than just thickness.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 133
Combining equation (7.1) and equation (7.2) then implies that:

                                                                                               (7.3)
To calculate the stress in longitudinal direction, the pressure vessel should be
considered as illustrated in Figure 7.2. The pressure acting on the circular surface
should be in equilibrium with the longitudinal stress acting at the circumference of the
vessel.

Figure 7.2
Illustration of equilibrium of the internal pressure and the longitudinal stress. (Alderliesten, 2011, 7-2.jpg. Own
Work.)

The equilibrium is given by:
                                                                                               (7.4)

Thus, the circumferential and longitudinal stresses in a pressure vessel can be
described with:

                                                                                               (7.5)
Following from chapter 1 and equation (1.11), the Hooke's law for the bi-axial stress
condition (plane stress) in a pressure vessel is then described by:
134 R.C. Alderliesten

                                                                                               (7.6)

Equation (7.5) implies that the circumferential stress is twice the longitudinal stress.
Combining equation (7.5) and equation (7.6) this results in:

                                                                                               (7.7)

For a metallic pressure vessel the Poisson's ratio is about 0.3, which means that
with equation (7.7) the circumferential strain is about 4.25 times larger than the
longitudinal strain.

7.2.2 Connection between cylinder and spherical end sections

Consider a metallic pressure vessel as indicated in Figure 7.3. In this figure several
locations of interest can be identified: the weld lines between the individual metal
plates and the transition from a tubular shape to the spherical end sections.

Figure 7.3
Illustration of a pressure vessel containing weld lines. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-3.jpg. Own Work.)

To address the strength of the weld lines in the tubular section, the longitudinal
stress should be considered, because that is the stress perpendicular to the weld
line pulling the welded components apart. Because the circumferential stress is twice
the longitudinal stress, the weld lines should be oriented in circumferential direction,
rather than longitudinal direction. Otherwise, the stress loading of the weld would be
twice the stress loading of the weld in Figure 7.3 under the same pressurization.
                                                 Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 135

   Figure 7.4
   Illustration of a spherical pressure vessel. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-4.jpg. Own Work.)

  To calculate the stress in the spherical end sections, first a pressurized sphere is
  considered, see Figure 7.4. In this vessel the stresses in both directions are equal to2:

                                                                                                  (7.8)
  With the Hooke's law for bi-axial loaded plates, see equation (1.11), this implies for the
  strains in both directions:

                                                                                                  (7.9)
  To create the welded connection between the tubular section and the spherical
  sections in Figure 7.3, one should consider the question whether the thickness of both
  sections should be equal or not. In general, discontinuities in circumferential strain
  as illustrated in Figure 7.5 should be avoided, because they would lead to unwanted
  deformations, or even damage and/or failure. With the equations for strain given for
  both sections with respectively equation (7.7) and equation (7.9) , potential strain
  discontinuities can be assessed.

   Figure 7.5
   Illustration of the transition between tubular and spherical section without strain discontinuity (left) and with strain
   discontinuities (centre and right). (TU Delft, n.d., 7-5.jpg. Own Work.)

2. A similar derivation as presented in section 7.2.1 can be given for this case, except that it will be somewhat more
      complex. The analysis should be 3D instead of the 2D in Figure 7.1.
136 R.C. Alderliesten

To derive the ratio between the thicknesses of both sections the circumferential strain

should be equal to the strain in the spherical section, thus  :

                                                                 (7.10)

This results in the following relation:

                                                                 (7.11)

In case the radii of both sections are identical this means that the thickness of the
cylindrical section is 2.5 times the thickness of the spherical section.

7.2.3 Pressurization of an aircraft cabin structure

Of course, the example of a pressure vessel analyzed in the previous section is
a simplified case compared to an aircraft fuselage structure under pressurization.
Therefore, some remarks have to be made in addition to the previous analysis.

First of all, the thickness of the fuselage shells is not constant throughout the
fuselage. Local reinforcement, especially near cut-outs such as doors and windows,
will locally redistribute the stresses and change the deformation of the pressured shell
structure.

In addition, it was already discussed in chapter 5 and 6 that the fuselage shell
is reinforced by stringers and frames to maintain the aerodynamic shape under
all operating conditions. Especially the frames have a significant impact on the
deformation of the pressurized fuselage and as a consequence on the circumferential
stresses. The contribution of the frames to the response of the fuselage to
pressurization is illustrated in Figure 7.6.
                    Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 137

Figure 7.6
Illustration of frame contribution to the fuselage response to pressurization; a pillowing effect occurs due to limited
deformation near the frames. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-6.jpg. Own Work.)

Because failure of the fuselage shell structure under pressurization may imply a
disastrous occurrence similar to an exploding balloon, this type of fracture should be
avoided at all times. First, the maximum pressurization load is defined to limit the
static load that may occur, while secondly, damage retardant features are applied in
the fuselage to stop cracks that may occur during over-pressurization.

Limit load cannot be defined for fuselage pressurization according to the formal
definition, i.e. once in the lifetime of the aircraft, because the pressurization occurs
every flight. For that reason, a larger safety factor is applied to the maximum
pressurization load, often a factor 2 is applied.

In case of pressurization loads, the pressure differential is considered to induce the
longitudinal and circumferential stress in the fuselage. This pressure differential is the
difference between the inside pressure of the aircraft and the outside pressure. The
design pressure differential is thus defined as:

                    (7.12)

where  is the pressure inside the fuselage and the pressure at an altitude

h. For the cabin pressure often a pressure is taken at an altitude between 2400 and

3000 m, rather than the pressure at sea level. This pressure is considered to be still

comfortable for the passengers, while it reduces the design pressure differential for a

cruise altitude h.

This can be illustrated as follows. If a safety factor of 2 is applied, the maximum
pressure differential is equal to 2 . Assume that this maximum pressure differential
is equal to 45 kPa. In case the maximum cruise altitude is set to be 9050 m, then a
138 R.C. Alderliesten

cabin altitude of 2440 m could be used. However, if an aircraft altitude of 10350 m is
required; this implies a cabin altitude of 3050 m, thus a lower cabin pressure.

7.3 Torsional loading of a fuselage structure

Another load case that may act on an aircraft fuselage is torsional loading. As
explained in chapter 6, this may occur if the vertical tail of an aircraft is laterally loaded
by gust wind, or by forces induced by the rudder. Aside from bending of the vertical
tail, this load case will induce rotation of the rear fuselage section.
This section will discuss in more detail the torsional loading of a cylindrical fuselage
section and the implications of such load case to the stresses within that structure.
If a torsional moment is applied to a cylindrical shell, stresses occur within that shell
structure. To understand the nature of these stresses, one should first consider the
shell to be non-continuous as illustrated in Figure 7.7. It is rather evident that the
torsional moment will induce the deformation as shown at the left hand side of
this figure. To prevent this deformation and to keep the longitudinal edges of the
cylindrical shell positioned opposite to each other forces must be applied to these
longitudinal edges in the opposite direction as the deformation.

Figure 7.7
Illustration of a cylindrical shell loaded by torsion; in the case the shell is not continuous it deforms as shown left.
To prevent that deformation shear stresses must occur. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-7.jpg. Own Work.)
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 139

These forces must be in equilibrium within the shell structures, which implies a shear
stress acting in opposite direction as the applied moment, because these shear
stresses should create equilibrium with the applied moment.

Figure 7.8
Illustration of the force-couple systems and torsional moments acting on a cylindrical shell. (Alderliesten, 2011,
7-8.jpg. Own Work.)

To identify these shear stresses and their direction, one may also look at the
deformation of a cylinder deformed under a torsional moment. A rectangular section
on such cylinder will deform into a parallelogram, as illustrated in Figure 7.8.

If equilibrium is satisfied in the example shown in Figure 7.8 this means that

                                                                                (7.13)

Figure 7.9
Illustration of the resulting shear stresses as a result of the torsional moments acting on a cylindrical shell. .
(Alderliesten, 2011, 7-9.jpg. Own Work.)
140 R.C. Alderliesten

Thus a torsional deformation induces shear stress according to equation (1.7), see
Figure 7.9

                                                                 (7.14)

If the shear stress acting in the shell with thickness t at a distance r from the centre of
the cylinder over the complete circumference of the cylinder is in equilibrium with the
torsional moment (see right hand side of Figure 7.9), this means that

                                                                 (7.15)

Defining the shear flow q as  , this equation can be written as

                                                                 (7.16)

In other words, in case a thin walled structure like the fuselage shell structure is

loaded by a torsional moment  then the shear flow in that shell is solely

determined by the enclosed area A. This relationship appears to be independent of the

shape of the enclosed area. Thus whether the area is a cylinder as in the example of a

fuselage, or a wing box structure, as long as the area is equal, the shear flow q will be

the same according to

                                                                 (7.17)

This can be illustrated with a wing box as illustrated in Figure 7.10. Dividing the
contour of the wing box structure in small elements, then for each element the
fractional moment is given by

                                                                                              (7.18)

Superimposing all fractions together, one evidently gets equation (7.17).

Figure 7.10

        Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 141

Figure 7.11
Arbitrary enclosed areas for thin walled structures under torsional moment MT. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-11.jpg. Own Work.)

Thus all structures illustrated in Figure 7.11 have the same shear flow under torsional

moment  independent of the cross sectional shape. This closed section is

therefore often called a torsion box, because it resists torsional deformation

efficiently.With the above discussion, it can be concluded that a torsional moment is

resisted by shear stresses within the thin walled shell structure. However, in case a

cut-out is created within such structure, for example a door or window in an aircraft

fuselage, the torsional box will not function well at the location of the cut-out. This is

illustrated in Figure 7.12. For this reason cut-outs must be reinforced locally around

the cut-out to provide the resistance against shear deformation that was provided by

the removed shell structure. This is often created by locally increasing the thickness

with doublers and stiff frames and stringers providing rigid corners.

Cut-out in cylindrical shell under torsion must be reinforced to provide resistance against shear deformation. (TU

7.4 Bending of a wing structure

It was explained in chapter 5 that wing bending is taken up primarily by the spars in
that wing structure. In this section the function of the spar and its structural elements
is explained in more detail and a structural analysis is performed

7.4.1 Shear deformation

First an elementary spar is considered as illustrated in the left hand side of Figure
7.13. The loads acting on that spar structure impose a diamond shaped deformation
that is resisted by the sheets, see section 5.5.2. Assuming that the bars or the girders
are stiff and rigid prohibiting any (bending) deformation, then the girders exercise
shear stresses on the sheets and in return (for equilibrium) the sheets induce shear
stresses on the girders, see Figure 7.14
The consequence is that if the sheets are being removed, the frames will not be
capably of resisting the deformation, which corresponds to the explanation in section
5.3.2.

Figure 7.13
Elementary spar constructed from rigid girders and sheets (left) will deform if sheets are removed (right). . (TU
Delft, n.d., 7-13.jpg. Own Work.)
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 143

Figure 7.14
Illustration of shear stresses in the girders induced by the sheets (left) and the equilibrium shear stresses in the
sheets (right). (TU Delft, n.d., 7-14.jpg. Own Work.)

The resistance to shear deformation is in fact the resistance to tension and
compression under 45 degrees. To relate the shear deformation to the tensional
and compressive deformation, the relationship between E, , G should be used, see
section 1.6.
At certain levels of the applied forces F, the shear stress in the sheets will reach a
critical level resulting in pleat or wrinkle formation within the sheets. These pleats are
often referred to as shear buckling of the sheets. However, one should not consider
this as failure, because the diagonal function is still maintained by the sheets. In other
words, the structure still functions well, and if the loads are removed the pleats will
usually disappear (i.e. when the buckling is elastic).

7.4.2 Stress analysis: breaking-up structural elements

To analyse a spar structure and to calculate the stresses induced by the applied
load, the spar must be broken-up into individual elements. An example for a single
spar element structure loaded by force F is given in Figure 7.15. For this example,
equilibrium must be satisfied, which is used to calculate the reaction forces in the
structural elements.
144 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 7.15
Single spar element loaded by force F (left) broken up into individual spars and sheet with reaction forces (right).
(TU Delft, n.d., 7-15.jpg. Own Work.)

For example, equilibrium in horizontal direction yields when:  (7.19)
while equilibrium in vertical direction is satisfied when:     (7.20)

The relation between the horizontal and vertical forces is given by the moment
equilibrium.

Assume that the spar element in Figure 7.15 has a height h and a width w, then
equilibrium of moments about location 2 implies that:

                                                                                              (7.21)

Subsequently, the equilibrium in each element can be evaluated. For example, the
upper horizontal spar element is loaded at the right hand side by a force F, which can
only be kept in equilibrium by the shear forces induced by the sheet over the length w
of the spar element. This means that the normal stress at the right hand side of the
element is equal to the applied force F and gradually decreases to zero to the left side
of the element. Thus the shear stress in the sheet is in equilibrium with the normal
forces in the frames.

An important remark must be made. Considering loading of elements, then tension
and compression imply a physical difference, which easily can be related to a sign
convention; tension is positive and compression negative. However, for shear
deformation there is physically no difference between both deformations, see Figure
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 145

7.16. This means that for the analysis of spar bending a sign convention must be
agreed upon like for instance illustrated in Figure 7.16.
Be aware however, that despite tension and compression are easily captured by
respectively a positive and a negative sign, this assumes that both cases are identical
but opposite of sign. However, physically tension may be considered being different
from compression. Consider for example the presence of a crack. Under tension the
crack would open and all load has to bypass the crack, while in compression the crack
closes, enabling the load to be transferred through the crack.

Figure 7.16
A sign convention for shear is needed to analyse the spar deformation. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-16.jpg. Own Work.)

From the above explanation it is evident that the in case of bending, the shear function
of spar webs is essential. However, the webs have to be supported on the upper and
lower side by caps or girders in order to realize equilibrium. In this configuration, the
webs transfer (external) transverse forces into shear-flows, while the caps transfer
shear-flows in normal forces.

7.5 Case study: bending of wing spar

To illustrate the previous explanation, this section discusses the approach for a
simplified wing spar loaded in bending, illustrated in Figure 7.17.
146 R.C. Alderliesten

7.5.1 Normal and shear forces

The general approach to this problem is to first check the global equilibrium of the
problem. This means that the reaction forces at the spar root, i.e. at the clamping area
(see Figure 7.18), should provide equilibrium with the external forces .

Figure 7.17                                                                             (7.22)

Global equilibrium implies in (horizontal) x-direction that

And in y-direction

Equilibrium of moments results in point A

Figure 7.18
Global equilibrium between external forces and reaction forces. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-18.jpg. Own Work.)

Once global equilibrium is obtained, the problem may be dealt with in detail. The
problem is then sectioned into separate shear webs with the related caps. Because
the load is applied at the end of the spar, while reaction forces apply to the clamped
side of the spar, the analysis will be performed from the spar end in the direction of
the spar root.

Figure 7.19
The problem of Figure 7.18 broken up into separate sections. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-19.jpg. Own Work.)

First, vertical equilibrium must be provided between the external load and the shear
web. Subsequently, the horizontal equilibrium and equilibrium of moments can be
formulated
148 R.C. Alderliesten

                                                       (7.25)

Here, is the shear flow in web plate 1.

Similarly, the equilibrium can be formulated for the second shear web and upper and
lower caps:

                                                       (7.26)

And for the third shear web and upper and lower caps:

                                                       (7.27)

From this analysis it can be observed that the transverse shear force is building up

towards the spar root. At the first shear web near the wing tip, the transverse shear

force is equal to , while at the second shear web, the transverse shear force

is equal to  etc. As a consequence, the transverse shear force at location n (or

shear web n) can be generalized as

                                                       (7.28)

The relation between the transverse shear force and the shear flow in the web plate
can be derived from equations (7.25) to (7.27) according to:

                                                       (7.29)

Thus, the shear flow in each web is described by:
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 149

                                                                                              (7.30)
Similarly, it follows that the normal forces in the upper and lower caps at the location
of the vertical stiffener is given by

                                                                                              (7.31)

As explained in section 6.3.2, the constant shear flow in the shear webs results in
an increase in normal forces in the spar caps, because the caps transfer the shear
flow into normal forces. Thus equation (7.31) describes the normal forces at the
location of the vertical stiffener, the normal forces in-between the stringers require
some additional analysis.

Figure 7.20

Consider the upper spar cap in web plate 2 as illustrated in Figure 7.20. Equilibrium
for the side of the spar cap indicated by `A' can be given by

                                                                                              (7.32)
Similarly, equilibrium for the side indicated with `B' is obtained with

                                                                                              (7.33)
With equations (7.30) and (7.31) both equations (7.32) and (7.33) result in

                                                                                              (7.34)
This equation illustrates that the normal forces increase linearly from outboard to
inboard.

7.5.2 Bending moments

The bending moments at location x in web 2 of the spar can be derived from equation
(7.34)
150 R.C. Alderliesten

                                                                                                        (7.35)

For web 2 in the spar one can thus obtain that

                                                                                                        (7.36)

Which is valid on every location x on the spar. Thus equation (7.36) can be generalized
as

                                                                                                        (7.37)

7.5.3 Bending of wing spar

Thus once a spar is loaded in bending by external forces the transverse shear
forces are known with equation (7.30) and the normal forces in the spar caps are
known as

                                                                                              (7.38)

This enables the determination of the transverse shear force and moment diagram as
illustrated in Figure 7.21.

Figure 7.21

                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 151
In case of a wing structure, where not only the lift is considered as distributed forces
rather than concentrated forces, but in addition also the weight of fuselage and
engines is considered, the transverse shear and moment diagrams will look similar to
Figure 7.22.

Figure 7.22
Transverse shear force and moment diagram of aircraft wing. (TU Delft, n.d., 7-22.jpg. Own Work.)

It should be noted, that the transverse shear line linearly increases or decreases due
to the distributed forces, which implies for the moment line a non-linear increase or
decrease.
The shear stress in the webs is given by

                                                                                              (7.39)
While the normal stress in the spar caps is given by

                                                                                              (7.40)
Here, the parameters are called the moment of resistance W in a spar.
8. Considering strength & stiffness

8.1 Introduction

With the previous chapter in mind, one may understand material behaviour in general,
one may know the structural elements of which aeronautical structures are made of,
and one may even know about how loads can be transferred through a structure.
However, this knowledge may still leave a gap of understanding what aspects are
needed to be considered when designing structures and especially materializing
them, i.e. selecting appropriate materials for the structure.
To give an impression of aspects to be considered when selecting a material and
structural design for a particular application, this chapter will discuss and explain
aspects and criteria that relate to material performance in a structural design with a
focus on strength and stiffness.

8.2 Structural performance

The performance of a structure can be expressed in many different aspects. For
example, one may consider the strength at which the structure ultimately fails an
important measure for its performance, but if the most dominant requirement is
whether the structure under certain loads is limited in deflection, then it may not be
the most important performance aspect.
Especially for aeronautical structures weight is considered an important structural
aspect. Lightweight design has become an expertise in itself, which seems to aim for
structural designs with the lowest possible weight.

                                                 153
154 R.C. Alderliesten

Here, one must pay attention to the header above this section, because when
discussing weight as structural performance parameter, one should not confuse that
with weight or density of structural materials. Although the density of a material will
play a certain role in the final structural weight, both categories of weight do not
directly relate. Or to put it differently, selecting a material with low density or weight,
does not automatically lead to a structure with low weight.
Aside from manufacturing aspects to be considered, the structural performance is a
function of

  · Properties of materials used in the structural design
  · Geometrical features and dimensional aspects of that particular structure
This is illustrated in Figure 8.1. One should be aware, however, that these two
categories are not independent of each other.

Figure 8.1
Illustration of the optimization considered in this chapter. (Alderliesten, 2011, 8-1.jpg. Own Work.)

For example, an all aluminium aircraft can be designed and manufactured in different
ways, where the structural performance is a function of the aluminium alloy properties
and the structural geometry. Although balsawood has a significant lower density
(and thus weight) than aluminium, designing and constructing an aircraft from that
material will lead in the end to a completely different design, in which the geometrical
aspects most likely will counteract the benefit of the lower material weight.
Obviously, the strength of balsa wood is significant lower than aluminium which to
some extent will play a role in the design, but it is obvious that other aspects like
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 155

durability and environmental considerations (moisture absorption and subsequent
reduction of properties) will also play a role in the selection of materials.
A statement that a certain material has been selected for its low material weight,
as reason to obtain low structural weight, testifies therefore for not understanding
the concept of structural performance. This will be demonstrated in this chapter with
respect to strength and stiffness.

8.3 Selecting the appropriate criterion

The optimization of a structural design may lead to different kind of solutions
depending on the parameters to which has been optimized. For example, for the same
structural application one may obtain different design concepts and even made of
different materials, if the concept is optimized for its lowest weight or for lowest
manufacturing or operational cost.
But for clarity, the current chapter will primarily focus on the optimization with respect
to weight, i.e. the identification of the relevant criteria for the evaluation of mechanical
properties of materials. It has been mentioned before (chapter 3) that the strength-to-
weight ratio of materials is often considered to select the best material for a structure.

8.3.1 Assessment of material or geometry

First of all, one has to be aware that the lowest weight to be achieved is structural
weight and not material weight. This means that if one aims to optimize a structure to
the lowest possible weight, not only the material properties and related density have
to be assessed, but also the geometrical aspects. This is illustrated in Figure 8.2.
Although this seems to be straightforward, it often leads to confusion. With the
introduction of another material in a certain application, the geometry or shape is
sometimes also changed. The comparison between old and new design is then
often directly related to the introduction of the new material. However, as may be
understood from Figure 8.2, one has to distinct between the effect of shape and the
effect of the material properties.
156 R.C. Alderliesten
However, this distinction is not always easy to make. The example of the steel and
aluminium bicycles in section 8.3.3 illustrates that the introduction of a new material
is not always possible with the same geometry; small diameter tubes made of
aluminium will not provide enough stiffness to the bicycle frame.

8.3.2 Specific tensile strength

The specific strength is usually defined as the ratio between strength and density
 . This ratio relates to another parameter often used in design and construction: the

breaking length. The breaking length provides in fact a physical interpretation of the
specific strength. Consider a hanging bar, illustrated in Figure 8.3 with a length L, a
cross-section A, a failure strength and a density .
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 157

Figure 8.3
Hanging bar with cross-section A. (Alderliesten, 2011, 8-3.jpg. Own Work.)

The weight W in [N] is given by:
                                                                                               (8.1)

where g is the gravitational acceleration. The stress in the upper cross-section is
                                                                                               (8.2)

The length of the bar in Figure 8.3 can be extended as far as the upper cross-section
can carry the load. The length at which the upper cross-section reaches its failure
strength is defined as the breaking length.

                                                                                               (8.3)
The unit for the breaking length is usually [km]. A correlation between several
materials, their specific strength and the breaking length is given in Table 8.1.

Example: Specific strength of a simple tension bar

   Consider a tension bar to transfer load of 1000 kN from point A to point B
over a length of 2 m. Which material (steel or aluminium) provides the lightest
solution?

Failure strength   Steel       Aluminium
Yield strength     800 N/mm2   450 N/mm2
Density            550 N/mm2   280 N/mm2
                   7.8 kg/dm3  2.8 kg/dm3

   If permanent (plastic) deformation is not allowed, then the maximum allowed
stress equals the yield strength of the materials. The minimum required cross-
section is obtained by dividing the load of 1000 kN by the yield strength,

                                                                           mm2

   and,
                                                                           mm2
Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 159

   The weight that corresponds to these bars is obtained by multiplying the
volume with the density.

                                                                                          kg
                                                                                         kg
   Thus the aluminium solution is 42% lighter than the steel solution.
   This could have been evaluated alternatively by directly comparing the
performance/weight ratio.

Because the length L is equal for both cases (thus geometrical aspects are

the same, see Figure 8.2), the ratio  should be considered. This yields

70.5*106 Nmm/kg for steel and 100*106 Nmm/kg for aluminium. Thus

aluminium has the highest specific strength for this case.

The correlation between specific strength and breaking length in Table 8.1 clearly
does not provide the reason why aluminium is so often applied in aircraft structures.
This is because the specific strength, or more precisely formulated, the specific
tensile strength is not the only parameter determining the material to be applied.
Depending on the application and the load cases, different parameters have to be
considered.

Figure 8.4

Thin sheet loaded in tension. (Alderliesten, 2011, 8-3.jpg. Own Work.)

Consider a thin sheet loaded in tension as illustrated in Figure 8.4 made of either AISI 301 steel or magnesium

AZ31-H24 (see Table 8.1). The specific tensile properties of both materials are fairly close to each other. The
specific modulus of elasticity for these alloys is respectively 2.5 and 2.4 Nmm kg-1.

In particular, the structures applied in aircraft and spacecraft are considered to be
thin-walled, i.e. the thickness is relatively small compared to the other dimensions.
To illustrate the significance of the specific properties of materials in relation to the
application in airframes, two metals are compared.

8.3.3 Specific buckling strength

Thus, concerning the tensile load applied to the sheet, there is no preference for either
one of the two metals. However, if compression is considered as load case, sheet
buckling has to be considered. The critical buckling strength of a sheet is given by

                                                 (8.4)

The buckling load is then defined as             (8.5)
Thus, the required thickness is calculated with

                                                 (8.6)
                        Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 161

Keeping the buckling load and panel length identical for both metals it is evident that
the thickness of the magnesium AZ31-H24 is about 1.6 times the thickness required
for AISI301 steel. However, this implies that the weight of the magnesium sheet is
about 2.8 times lower than the steel sheet.

In other words, to compare the specific properties for the case of compression

buckling, one has to search the highest value for         . Table 8.2 gives the values for

this parameter for the materials in Table 8.1

8.4 Geometrical aspects

The comparison of material properties or, as discussed in the previous section, the
specific material properties may indicate the applicability of certain materials for
specific structural configurations and load cases. However, one has to be aware that
one still has the opportunity to tailor the structure in its geometry, as discussed in
section 8.3.1.
To illustrate this aspect, Table 8.3 compares four cross-sections for a beam loaded in
bending. The comparison shows that significant weight reductions can be achieved
by changing the cross section of the beam, while keeping the material the same. In
162 R.C. Alderliesten

fact, this is the reason why the aluminium bicycle frames are made of tubes with a
larger diameter than the conventional steel frames, see the example in this section.

                                                              Table 8.3

In Table 8.4 it is illustrated that when comparing several materials for their specific
stiffness that these materials do not always rank highest for all cases. For example,
bone material has a lower specific stiffness compared to aluminium, but when the
sheet stability is considered, the value for aluminium is lower. This illustrates that the
comparison of the materials should account not only for the geometry, but also for
the representative loading scenario.

Example: Steel and aluminium bicycle frames
   For many years bicycle frames were made of steel tubes with circular cross

section. These tubes were jointed by either lugs or welding. Because of the
high strength and stiffness of the steel alloys used, tubes could be used with a
relatively small circular cross section. The small circular tubes could be joined
easily with lugs, in which the tubes were then brazed to the lug. The alternative
joining method is TIG welding which is a straightforward process for steels.

   Aluminium, although having better strength-to-weight ratio than steel was not
applied, because the applied aluminium alloys could not be welded. With the
introduction of weldable aluminium alloys, the introduction of aluminium frames
was initially not successful because of fatigue failures. Aluminium usually has a
lower fatigue limit than steel, see explanation in chapter 10.

   Once reliable and weldable aluminium frames were introduced, many
aluminium bikes were sold for their low weight compared to steel bikes.
Although the aluminium has a lower stiffness than steel., rigid frames could be
achieved by changing the cross-sectional area and shape compared to the steel
164 R.C. Alderliesten

   tubes. Aluminium frames are therefore easily recognized because of the larger
   tube cross-sections, see Figure 8.5.

8.5 Structural aspects

The geometrical aspects discussed in the previous section are important to be
considered. The transition in using different materials often comes together with the
application of different design concepts. An illustration is provided in Figure 8.6, where
the wood, linen and steel trusses of the early aircraft are compared with the stiffened
aluminium shell structure of current commercial aircraft. The concept of load bearing
shell structures could only be applied when materials were considered that can be
loaded as such.

                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 165

Although this seems a very straightforward aspect, often the comparison of material
technologies is performed solely by addressing the material properties. For example,
the fact that carbon composites in general have lower densities than aerospace
aluminium alloys is used to explain that these fibre reinforced materials will result in
lighter structures.

However, even if similar structures are being considered - for example load bearing
shell structures - still the comparison may need attention. Comparing aluminium with
carbon fibre composites in a load bearing shell structure, will not automatically lead
to similar details design solutions. Where aluminium stringers for example can easily
be extruded into preferred shapes, the manufacturing technology for composites may
require stiffeners with different geometries.

In addition, the difference between aluminium and carbon fibre composites may lead
to different selection of shell concept, i.e. shell containing stiffeners and sandwich
panel (discussed in chapter 5). The reasons for selecting either one of the two may be
completely different for both material technologies.

But even when these aspects are considered, one has to be careful with comparing
the materials purely on material properties as determined in a material test. The
question here may be what strength of the material should be considered when
comparing different technologies. Comparison based on ultimate strength, i.e. ,
often leads to irrelevant weight estimates, because this parameter is in general not
directly decisive for design.

Aluminium structure are required not to permanently deform under the maximum
occurring loads, which implies that the yield strength often dictates the minimum
thicknesses rather than the ultimate strength.

The restriction on strength that can be exploited in composites is even more severe,
the maximum allowable strain that may occur in the structure is limited at about
0.35%. This implies a significant reduction in strength to design with.
166 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 8.7
Comparison of strength values for different materials (left); high strength linear elastic composites may be limited
relatively more than ductile aluminium. The aluminium properties relate to isotropic behaviour, while composite
properties often relate to uni-directional composites (right).(Alderliesten, 2011, 8-7.jpg. Own Work.)

Comparing aluminium with carbon fibre composites therefore should be based on
equivalent static or fatigue loads. As illustrated here, the static strength comparison
may be based on the yield strength in aluminium and about a third of the panel
strength (i.e. lay-up of individual plies in the required orientations, not the uni-axial ply
strength, see Figure 8.7) in composites.
The actual composite panel lay-up that must be considered depends on the
application one has in mind to compare the materials for. As illustrated in Figure 8.8,
the composite panel lay-up for a vertical tail will be different from the lay-up needed
for fuselage shell panels. But even there, the orientation in the upper fuselage (loaded
primarily in tension) may be expected to be different form the side shells (loaded
primarily in shear). Some typical values for comparison are provided in Table 8.5.

The panel lay-up for composite materials is different for the various applications on an aircraft; where empennage
structures often allow significant directionality of composites leading to large weight savings, fuselage structures
require almost quasi-isotropic laminate lay-ups. (TU Delft, n.d., 8-8.jpg. Own Work.)

8.6 Typical mission requirements for space
structures

The design of the structural components in space structures usually starts with the
determination of the mission requirements. However, when it comes to the typical
missions for spacecraft and launchers, it is obvious that in general the mass should
be minimized as much as possible, while the stiffness and the strength should be as
high as possible.
In addition, for the launchers yields that they should be able to accommodate the
payload and the equipment, and that their mission should be fulfilled with high
reliability. The costs of a launching failure are extremely high (estimated at about 180
million Euros for the Ariane 5).
170 R.C. Alderliesten

In general, these high demands to the structure imply that structural solutions and
materials are often considered that are too expensive and complex for aeronautical
structures. Nonetheless, even for spacecraft and launch vehicle structures the
requirements are to reduce costs, and to search for the design solution which has
proven to have the best manufacturability and accessibility.

8.7 Material selection criteria

The selection of materials for space applications is an important topic. The stiffness
of the structure, and therefore also the materials used, is an important parameter to
design against the resonance that may occur during launch of the vehicle.
Oscillations can be either damped or excited, see for example Figure 8.9. These
oscillations or vibrations are very important in space structures, because during
launch significant vibrations may occur. Examples of vibration problems in
aeronautical applications are flutter of main and tail wings.

Figure 8.9
Illustration of the oscillations that are damped (left), not damped (centre) and divergent (right). (TU Delft, n.d.,
8-9.jpg. Own Work.)

Therefore, limiting the natural frequencies of spacecraft is essential to avoid
resonance between launch vehicle and spacecraft. In general low dynamic coupling
results in lower loads for spacecraft. To dimension the primary structure of a
spacecraft (such as a satellite for instance), the first step therefore is to assure that
the lowest natural frequency present in the space craft structure is well above the
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 171

specified minimum frequency by the launcher's user manual (Wertz & Larson, 1999).
Once this has been achieved, the structure will be further designed and tailored for all
the quasi-static loads that will occur. In this order these steps will be discussed in the
following sections.

8.8 Structural sizing for natural frequency

The discussion of structural sizing for natural frequencies, will be explained here using
simple examples. Consider the concentrated mass at the end of a clamped beam as
illustrated in Figure 8.10. If resonance may occur in both axial and lateral direction, i.e.
in x- and y-direction, then loading of the beam may be considered respectively by axial
loading of a spring (see introduction of chapter 1) and bending of a beam.
For both cases a `spring constant' k may be determined. For axial direction, the
constant k is a function of the stiffness of the spring (represented by EA) and the
length of the spring, as is illustrated by Figure 8.12.

                                                                                               (8.7)

Figure 8.10
Schematic of a concentrated mass at the end of a clamped beam (left) and the simplification of the case to a single
degree of freedom case (right). (Alderliesten, 2011, 8-10.jpg. Own Work.)

In lateral direction, the constant k is related to the bending stiffness of the spring
(represented by EI) and the length of the spring

                                                                                               (8.8)
172 R.C. Alderliesten
The axially loaded configuration, described by equation (8.7), can therefore be related
to the case illustrated in Figure 8.11. According to chapter 1, the elongation and strain
for this case can be described by

                                                                                               (8.9)
Similarly, the deflection for the laterally loaded case can be given by

                                                                                              (8.10)

freedom case (right). (Alderliesten, 2011, 8-11.jpg. Own Work.)

Figure 8.12
Illustration of the beam loaded in lateral direction (left) and the simplification of the case to a single degree of
freedom case (right). (Alderliesten, 2011, 8-12.jpg. Own Work.)

The natural frequency in [Hz] is defined as

                                             (8.11)
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 173

where k is the spring constant and m the mass. If this equation represents the lowest
natural frequency that is allowed in the structure, this means for the axial direction
that

                                                                                              (8.12)
and for the lateral direction that

                                                                                              (8.13)

8.9 Structural sizing for quasi-static loads

Once the requirements concerning natural frequency are being met, the structure can
be designed for quasi-static loads. These loads are directly related to the acceleration
of the mass during launch and ascent.
In axial direction, the load is given by the acceleration of the mass in axial (launch)
direction with

                                                                                              (8.14)

Figure 8.13
Schematic of a concentrated mass at the end of a clamped beam subjected to axial and lateral accelerations.
(Alderliesten, 2011, 8-13.jpg. Own Work.)

With the cross section of A this gives in axial direction
                                                                                              (8.15)

For the lateral loads, the bending moment applied by the mass is considered:
174 R.C. Alderliesten

                                                                               (8.16)

Where I is the area moment of inertia for bending, y the distance from the neutral line
to the outer surface of the beam, and M the moment given by:

                                                                                              (8.17)

The allowable stress is the maximum stress that the structure should be capable
to sustain without any damage or failure. This maximum stress is calculated by
superimposing the stresses due to axial and lateral accelerations, which should be
lower than the allowable stress.

                                                                                              (8.18)

The allowable stress is the ultimate stress divided by a safety factor.

Another load case that has to be considered is the buckling load applied to the
structure by the axial accelerations during ascend. In this case the bending stiffness
EI of the beam becomes an important parameter. The Euler buckling load can be
calculated with

                                                                               (8.19)

which implies that the loads due to axial accelerations should be limited to:  (8.20)
More on initial sizing of spacecraft can be found in Wertz & Larson (1999).

Example: Calculating the wall thickness of a satellite launched on ARIANE 5

Consider the ARIANE 5 launch vehicle illustrated in Figure 8.14. The Launch

Vehicle User Guide for the ARIANE 5 lists the following requirements on the

minimum natural frequencies that a payload that is send into space by this

launch vehicle must meet: In longitudinal (launch) direction >                 and in

lateral direction >    .

The following information on the satellite that is being launched is given:

· Payload mass,

· Structure made of aluminium with
Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 175

· Maximum axial acceleration is (launch load)

· Maximum lateral acceleration is  with

   The satellite may be modelled as a cylinder with dimensions as listed in
Figure 8.14 with its entire mass modelled as a point mass on top. The structural
mass of the cylinder may be ignored. This type of modelling is suitable as most
satellites consist of some sort of cylinder (known as a "bus") with most of the
mass, the payload of the satellite itself, on top.

   Figure 8.14

   What is the minimum required wall thickness of the structure? To find the
answer to this we must calculate the required thickness based on both
frequency requirements and select the larger of the two thicknesses found.

   In launch direction, the natural frequency should comply with:

   where m=2500 kg and k is given by

   This implies for A that:
176 R.C. Alderliesten

With                   this means that the minimum thickness required to meet the

natural frequency requirement in launch direction:       .

In lateral direction, the natural frequency must be:

where again m = 2500 kg but the lateral stiffness k is given by:

This implies for the area moment of inertia that:

using:

results in a minimum required wall thickness to meet the natural frequency

requirement in lateral direction,        .

The larger of the two calculated thickness is governing as that is the lower

limit at which both requirements are met. Hence,         .

   With the thickness determined for the lowest natural frequency, the quasi-
static loads can now be evaluated, starting with the allowable stress
requirement.

where m=2500 kg,          and                         .

The axial stress is thus              .

Now to calculate the lateral stress:

The area moment of inertia I for a thin walled cylinder is given by:
                            Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 177

   resulting in              The lateral acceleration was               and the
maximum distance            . The lateral stress is thus                      .

The total stress is the sum of the two:

which is                    . Of course one has to consider that

                    divided by the safety factor. With

and a safety factor n = 2,               which is much greater than the

total stress found, so the first quasi static load requirement is met.

To evaluate whether the second quasi-static load requirement is also met:

The load in launch direction is which makes that                        and

          , which means that the second quasi static load requirement

has also been met.
9. Design & certification

9.1 Introduction

With the information presented and discussed in the previous chapters, one may
be able to understand the material behaviour in a structure, and one may even be
able to calculate based on given load cases the stresses in the various structural
components, but that is in itself not sufficient to design, manufacture and operate an
aircraft or spacecraft.
Aspects as safety, not easily captured in equations and formulas, must be addressed
in certification procedures, to be communicated with airworthiness authorities.
Structural design must comply with requirements and specifications, which are often
non-negotiable, but sometimes have to be weighted against other criteria or
requirements. This chapter describes some of the relevant aspects that relate to
material selection, selection of structural design approaches, and certification
procedures.

9.2 Safety, regulations and specifications

In chapter 5 the functions of a structure have been explained in general when
discussing and defining the airframe, and in detail for the various structural elements.
To be able to fulfil their functions, structural elements in aircraft and spacecraft must
comply with a number of requirements. Several requirements directly relate to the
functions to be fulfilled. For example, if an element should be able to carry a certain
amount of load, then a requirement may be that any degradation to the element

                                                 179
180 R.C. Alderliesten

during service should never lead to strength below the minimum strength to carry that
load.

However, there are also a number of requirements that do not directly relate to
the functions of that particular element, but they may follow from specifications or
requirements of the complete structure to which the element belongs. This section
will discuss a number of requirements relevant for aircraft and spacecraft structures.

9.2.1 Safety

Safety is considered an extremely important aspect in aviation. Governmental
organisations on national and international level have compiled an extensive set of
regulations for all aspects concerning aviation. With each accident or even incident
reported in the news, the questions on safety are being raised again; is it safe to fly?
Can safety be improved?

These discussions are to some extent interesting, because one of the characteristics
of safety is that it is not an aspect easily measured. This is illustrated in Figure 9.1 with
a comparison between the number of fatalities of different transportation modes. In
general, safety could be associated with the lowest fatality rate. However, to evaluate
safety of different transportation modes, or even different flights/missions within only
aviation, this fatality rate is considered against a certain parameter. This could be
the number of journeys, the number of hours, the distance, or even a combination of
these. From the comparison in Figure 9.1 it is evident that safety seems to depend
on the way of presentation. In addition to this, there is a psychological aspect
contributing to the society's perception on safety. Even if the probability of dying
within the air transportation mode is substantially lower than any other mode, and
even if the presentation in Figure 9.1 would have resulted in the lowest fatality rate
for air transport, then still people may perceive flying as less safe. This is simply
related to the fact that with one aviation accident often many fatalities are involved,
which receives great attention from the media, while the many car accidents with
one or two fatalities per occurrence hardly receive any attention. As a consequence,
people are very aware of aviation accidents, but to lesser extent of accidents in other
transportation modes.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 181

Figure 9.1
Comparison between number of fatalities in different transportation modes relative to respectively journeys, hours
and kilometres. (Ford, 2000 and Beck et al., 2007 as listed on Wikipedia - Aviation safety.)

Another drawback of presenting safety by accident rates as illustrated in Figure 9.1
is that this presentation does not distinct between the different routes, operators,
distances or type and age of aircraft. Furthermore, the occurrences of accidents
in the various transportation modes exhibit large fluctuations, especially in air
transportation.
This implies that with the introduction of a new aircraft type into service, a safety level
has to be established for that particular aircraft type. But even then, one has to be
aware that the operator and the location and routes on which the aircraft is operating
may influence the statistics.
The above discussion is based on civil aviation in general and not particularly related
to safety of vehicle structures, i.e. structural integrity. Roughly 70% of the accidents
is related to human factors rather than structural failures. However, similar
considerations may apply. For example, a known factor applied in design of aircraft
and spacecraft structures is the so-called safety factor. This factor reduces the load,
the number of flights, or another relevant parameter to a level that the probability
of failure or accident is reduced to an acceptable level. But what is considered
acceptable is not easily measured or defined.

9.2.2 Safety regulations

Structural safety is the joint responsibility of different parties involved. It is not solely
the responsibility of the aircraft manufacturer, the operator or the airworthiness
authorities. In Figure 9.2 these three parties are presented with their main
responsibilities with respect to assuring structural safety. In general, if one of these
parties does not comply with its responsibilities, one may assume structural safety to
be at risk.

9.3 Requirements for aeronautical structures

Depending on the application or structure and its usage, a variety of requirements
can be formulated that have to be met. However, concerning the structure, the
requirements relate in general to three aspects:

  · Strength
  · Loads
  · Life time
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 183

The strength should not be limited solely to the material strength (i.e. ), but should
be considered the resistance to failure. This could be failure of the structure with or
without the presence of damage.

Although listed second, the aspect of loads and load cases should be considered the
most important and most difficult aspect. The strength of a material or structure can
assessed relatively easy. One may either perform tests or perform an analysis based
on the known mechanical properties of the material.

However, to evaluate whether the integrity of the structure can be maintained
throughout all potential usage scenarios, one must know the loads related to these
scenarios in advance. This implies that the forces acting upon the structure should be
known in advance, which is practically impossible.
Often the loads are predicted based upon experience and measurements on earlier
aircraft with similar configuration and usage. With the development of analysis
techniques based on computational fluid dynamics, loads can be evaluated based on
the aerodynamic shape of the aircraft.

Either way, the determination of relevant loads and load cases relates to the events
that can be identified during the operational life of the structure. This means that
estimation of loads relates to risks, i.e. the probability that certain events may occur
and what risks are considered acceptable or not.

The third aspect concerns the topic of structural integrity and durability. The
assessment of structural strength and potential load cases could be considered
quasi-static. This maximum loads can be estimated and the structural strength to
meet these loads can be achieved.

However, most engineering materials applied in aeronautical structures are affected
by the environment when exposed sufficiently long, as discussed in chapter 2. In
addition, the repetition of loads throughout the operational life may impose additional
degradation of the structure, known as fatigue. This topic is discussed in more detail
in chapter 10.
Time, however, can be defined in various units. For example, the life of the aircraft can
be defined in years, flight hours, or flights. Depending on the component or structure,
different units for time may be considered. For example, the pressurization of the
fuselage during the flight relates to each flight. The loads related to the pressurization
therefore are recorded against the number of flights. However, the usage of the
engines is often expressed in flight hours, because the engine components are loaded
continuously during the time the engines are operated.
184 R.C. Alderliesten

The accurate recording of usage during operational life is important to evaluate
whether the aircraft in reality is loaded more or less severe than the loads and load
cases considered during the design and certification of the aircraft. Heavier usage of
the aircraft than anticipated in design may impair the structural integrity before the
end of life has been reached.
For the operator the recording against the number of flight hours is relatively easy,
as it relates directly to the planning of flights, i.e. each flight in general has a specific
duration. However, for certain components the number of flights should be known to
assess the actual life.

9.4 Structural design philosophies

Throughout the evolution of flight, structural design philosophies have changed based
on experience. Unfortunately, this experience relates to incidents and accidents.
Initially, the strength of aeronautical structures was evaluated based on quasi-static
loads. The estimation of relevant loads was based on experience and engineering
judgements. As a consequence, the load estimation was fairly inaccurate.

Figure 9.3
Illustration of a typical static strength tests on early aircraft. (Fokker, n.d., Public Domain.)
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 185

An excellent illustration of the evaluation and experimental assessment of strength of
an aircraft structure is given in Figure 9.3. Here a maximum static load is considered
that is represented in the tests by the number of persons on the wing. Interestingly in
this case the main load on the wing is related to upward bending, while the people in
the experiment apply a downward bending of the wing.

9.4.1 Safe life

The strength assessment example of Figure 9.3 implies the assumption that
throughout time the structure will remain as it is, i.e. the structural integrity is not
affected by either corrosion, accidental damages, fatigue, etc.
The first design philosophy that assumes that the structural integrity is maintained
during operational life and that any degradation or strength reduction due to fatigue
or corrosion is often denoted as `safe life'. It can therefore be defined as:
Safe-life of a structure is the number of flights, landings, or flight hours, during which
there is a low probability that the strength will degrade below its design strength.
This design philosophy can also be described as safety by retirement. The aircraft
or structure is retired at the end of life before structural degradation may impair the
structural integrity. This concept is illustrated in Figure 9.4.
As a consequence of the rapid introduction of new aircraft until the 50s of the previous
century, this design principle could be considered sufficiently safe. The aircraft were
often replaced before the anticipated end of life was reached. However, due to
economic reasons aircraft lives were fully used and occasionally extended, increasing
the risk of failure during operational life.

Figure 9.4
Illustration of the Safe life principle; strength reduction is considered beyond end of life. (TU Delft, n.d., 9-4.jpg. Own
Work.)
186 R.C. Alderliesten

The design philosophy also lead to failure as result of higher loads than anticipated
in design and the use of stronger materials with usually poor fatigue properties, crack
growth and residual strength. Well known examples are the two Comet aircraft that
exploded at cruising altitude in 1954.

9.4.2 Fail safe

Educated by the accidents and incidents, the design philosophy was modified. The
structural robustness was increased by adding redundancy to the structure. The
design philosophy is referred to as `fail safe' and can be defined as:
Fail-safe is the attribute of the structure that permits it to retain required residual
strength for a period of un-repaired use after failure or partial failure of a principal
structural element.
The objective of this design philosophy is that failure of a primary member by fatigue
or otherwise does not endanger flight safety. As a consequence, emphasis was put on
`multiple structural member concept'. The redundancy in structural members allowed
failure or partial failure of one member, redistributing the load to other intact structural
members, preventing complete failure of the structure. This design philosophy can
also be described as safety by design.
The strength evaluation implies therefore that various damage scenarios have to be
considered for which the static strength evaluation is performed. In this philosophy,
each individual structural item or member is adequately designed according to the
safe life concept.

   Example: Comet aircraft accidents in 1954
      The aircraft accidents occurred after only 1286 and 903 flights. Investigation

   of the accidents revealed that cracks initiated near the automated direction
   finder (ADF) window linking up via rivets to adjacent windows, see Figure 9.5.
   The fuselage was designed with high strength aluminium with poor fatigue
   characteristics (high notch sensitivity) while relatively high stresses were
   allowed.
                                          Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 187

   For certification, a full scale fatigue tests was performed, which only shows
the initiation of fatigue cracks after 16000 flights. Subsequent investigation of
the fatigue performance of aluminium alloys revealed that the static pressure
tests performed before the fatigue load spectrum was applied induced a
favourable response of the full scale test article. The static and fatigue test were
combined on one aircraft for economic reasons.

   The effect of the high load induced by two times caused local plasticity
near windows and notches, with favourable redistribution of stresses. As a
consequence, the full scale fatigue test was un-conservative, i.e. the measure
life was longer than the actual life of the aircraft.
Repetition of the full scale fatigue test on a Comet aircraft taken out of service
without the static pressurization load revealed initiation of fatigue cracks near
escape hatches after 3036 flights.

188 R.C. Alderliesten

The main advantages of this design philosophy compared to the safe life philosophy
are related to safety and economics. The damage could be detected within a given
amount of time before full failure occurred, which implies an increase in safety. In
the safe life philosophy a structure or component had to be replaced once reaching
end of life indifferent of the integrity of the component. In the fail safe philosophy, a
structural member could be kept in service until partial failure occurred or damage
was observed.
Although the fail safe design philosophy implied an increase in safety, still incidents
and accidents occurred induced by structural failures. Evaluating these failures
revealed that not all failure modes were anticipated in the static strength evaluation.
In addition, the redundancy in the structure obtained by multiple elements did not
consider particle failure of multiple elements.
For example the lug illustrated in Figure 9.6 has been considered for decades as the
typical illustration of the fail safe concept. However, once one of the lug elements
contains a crack, its stiffness reduces, redistributing the load to the other lug
members. As a consequence, all members of the lug start cracking simultaneously.
The occurrence of multiple cracks in adjacent components or elements is called
Multiple Site Damage (MSD). In case of MSD, the fail safe design philosophy becomes
ineffective.

Typical illustration of fail safe redundancy in a lug. (TU Delft, n.d. 9-6.jpg. Own Work.)

9.4.3 Damage Tolerance and durability

Since 1978 the aviation requirements (FAR/JAR) adopt the damage tolerance
philosophy. This philosophy can be defined as:
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 189

The ability of the structure to sustain anticipated loads in the presence of fatigue,
corrosion or accidental damage until such damage is detected through inspections or
malfunctions and is repaired.
The damage tolerance design philosophy is not considered a replacement of the safe
life and fail safe philosophy, but rather an advanced concept that combines these two
into a new philosophy.
The main advantages of the philosophy are twofold. First, it is assumed that defects,
flaws and imperfections are present in the structure directly after manufacturing.
These flaws and defects may increase during operational life inducing degradation of
the load bearing capability of the structure.
Second, the damage (fatigue corrosion, impact) may be present in the structure and
even grow until detected during prescribed inspections and subsequently repairs. This
repair assumes that the structure is restored to its original strength.
The damage tolerance design philosophy can also be described as safety by
inspection. The determination and execution of regular inspections forms an inherent
part of the aircraft design.

   Example: Aloha airlines accident in 1988

      In 1988 a Boeing 737 operated by Aloha airlines lost a large portion of the
   upper fuselage during flight. Fortunately, all passengers were tied to the chairs
   with their belts limiting fatalities to one flight attendant.
   The investigation of the accident revealed that the riveted lap joints were
   susceptible to corrosion and contained multiple cracks (MSD). The operators
   were informed by the aircraft manufacturer about the susceptibility to fatigue
   and corrosion, especially for warm, humid and maritime air environment near
   Hawaii, but the operator did not perform sufficient inspections.

      This example could be taken as an example that even the damage tolerance
   philosophy does not guarantee flight safety. Although part of design, inspection
   and repair have to be performed in order to limit structural failures.
190 R.C. Alderliesten

        Figure 9.7
    Photos of the damage to the fuselage of the Aloha airlines aircraft. Derivative of NTSB, (1989), Public
    Domain.

The damage tolerance design philosophy as currently applied to aeronautical
structures is closely tied to the durability concept. Durability can be defined as:
The ability of the structure to sustain degradation from sources as fatigue, corrosion,
accidental damage and environmental deterioration to the extent that they can be
controlled by economically acceptable maintenance and inspection programs.
The combination of the damage tolerance concept and the effect of environment
on structural integrity implies that the damage scenarios considered in the strength
evaluation should account for the superposition of cases, i.e. fatigue in metals
together with corrosion, fatigue delamination in composites together with reduced
resistance due to moisture absorption.

9.5 Design approach

The approach applied in designing aeronautical structures is to identify all critical
structural locations for which detailed evaluation must be provided. For each of these
locations it must be determined whether inspection is possible or not. This approach
is illustrated in Figure 9.8. Currently, only the landing gears and attachments are
certified according to the safe life design philosophy, because these components are
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 191
considered practically impossible to inspect with inspection intervals sufficiently long
to comply with durability requirements.
The strength justification of the structural elements is to great extent based on
experimental substantiation. In fact, the requirements specify that it must be shown
with sufficient tests (supported by analysis) that the probability of failure is negligible.
Figure 9.9 illustrates that the aircraft manufacturer performs many generic tests that
are not specifically for an aircraft, but applicable to any of the aircraft it considers
developing. The data from these tests form the basis for the strength evaluation.
Throughout the development of the aircraft, more detailed and complex tests are
performed to evaluate and justify the behaviour of the actual structures. Near the end
of the development, component tests and full scale fatigue tests can provide the basis
for certification.

10. Fatigue & durability

10.1 Introduction

The topic of fatigue and durability is an important topic especially for aeronautical
structures that are designed to be operated for several decades while assuring the
structural integrity. Based upon the discussion in chapter 2, one can imagine that the
material properties will change over time due to ageing of the material. Of course
this can be accounted for by setting the appropriate allowables based upon the virgin
material strength reduced by knock-down factors.
However, although that represents a considerable part of the durability aspect, it will
be insufficient for assuring structural integrity. The development of different design
philosophies, presented in chapter 9, has proven that structural safety can only be
assured with a coherent approach for the design and manufacturing phase, and
subsequent operational life.
An important aspect in this sense is the occurrence of fatigue and fatigue damage
in structures that are repetitively loaded in service under various loading and
environmental conditions. It will be explained in this chapter that fatigue cannot be
treated independent of environmental aspects, part of the durability assessment.
Therefore, fatigue and durability are discussed in relation to each other in this chapter.
There are some remarks to be made here before stepping into the details. First,
fatigue as a damage phenomenon has been discovered primarily in metallic
structures (steel in train applications, aluminium in aircraft applications). What has
been understood is that from the decades of experience and research is that repetitive
(tensile) loading may lead to initiation and propagation of cracks that at some point
in time may lead to component failure. It has also been understood how this aspect
should be treated in design, which has led to the development of methods for
designing against fatigue.

                                                 193
194 R.C. Alderliesten

What seems to be not well understood is that the relation between repetitive or cyclic
loading and initiation or formation of damage applies to all engineering materials and
material categories, but that the nature of damage and thus the relevant cyclic load
cases may be different from one material category to another. This will be further
explained in section 10.4.6.
Another aspect requires more awareness is that designing against fatigue is not an
additional task one should perform in the detail design phase. Designing against
fatigue follows from the correct mind set of an engineer and should be incorporated
already in the early conceptual and preliminary design. If fatigue has not been
considered in the early design phases, the design work in the detail design phase will
be merely repairing a fatigue sensitive structure.

10.2 Stress and strain concentrations

10.2.1 Definition

Figure 10.1
Illustration of evenly distributed stresses in a homogeneous material. (TU Delft, n.d., 10-1.jpg. Own Work.)

Following from the definitions provided in chapter 1, the stress in a material or
component is basically calculated by dividing the applied force by the area. Or in
equation form:
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 195

                                                                                              (10.1)

This is considered correct if the material is homogeneous and in undisturbed in shape
or geometry. This concept is illustrated in Figure 10.1. Independent on where a cross-
section is considered, the stresses will be equal and evenly distributed through the
material. These stresses can be calculated with equation (10.1) .
However, if the geometry or the shape is changed, or if a cut, damage or crack is
created in the material, then this forms a disturbance for the stress field. The load that
has to be transferred through the material, illustrated in Figure 10.2 with stress lines,
has to bypass the cut or damage.

Figure 10.2
Comparison between evenly distributed stress field (left) and a disturbed stress field (right). (TU Delft, n.d., 10-2.jpg.
Own Work.)

Assuming that equation (10.1) is still valid, one should at the location of the
disturbance calculate the stress by dividing the applied load F by the reduced cross
section. Because the cross-sectional area is reduced while the load remains the same,
this implies that the stress at the location of the disturbance is higher than in the
undisturbed stress field. This higher stress is generally denoted as the nominal stress
and is defined by

                                                           (10.2)

This would suggest that if the failure of a disturbed or cracked component has to

be predicted, one may assume that once the nominal stress  equals ultimate

strength of the material, failure would occur. However, before this equilibrium has

been reached, the material or component will fail.

This phenomenon is related to the fact that a concentration of stress is present at the
tip of the notch. This is illustrated with the higher density of stress lines at the notch
tip in Figure 10.2. The undisturbed and evenly distributed stress field has to bypass
196 R.C. Alderliesten

the notch, which at the location of the end of the notch creates a high concentration
of stress. This phenomenon is indicated with the term stress concentration.

To evaluate the stress concentration, a stress concentration factor  has been
defined

                                                                     (10.3)

Here the peak stress is the highest stress right at the edge or tip of the notch and the

nominal stress         is calculated with equation (10.2).

Figure 10.3
Example of a flat sheet containing a hole loaded by a far field stress. (Alderliesten, 2011, 10-3.jpg. Own Work.)

Consider a flat panel with width W containing a circular hole with diameter D, see
Figure 10.3, the nominal stress can be calculated with

                                                                                              (10.4)

The stress concentration factor can then be calculated with equation (10.3). The
only question at this point will be whether the peak stress is known. Because people
in the past did not have the availability of dedicated software that can be used to
calculate stresses at specific locations for any geometry under load, like with for
example Finite Element Software, theoretical solutions were mathematically derived.
These theoretical solutions were derived for the case of notches in sheets with
infinite dimensions, because mathematically the boundary constraints for this case
are exactly known.

For the finite geometries, subsequently correction factors were determined based
upon calculations or experimental data. These solutions were combined in
handbooks, like for example Peterson's Stress concentration factor (Pilkey, W.D.,
1997).
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 197

A well-known general solution for an elliptical hold in an infinite sheet illustrated in
Figure 10.4 is given by:

                                                                                              (10.5)

This means that the stress concentration factor for a circular hole in an infinite sheet
is equal to = 3. This value is indifferent from the hole diameter. The relation
between the peak stress at the notch and the nominal stress in the remaining cross-
section section remains 3, independent what hole diameter is considered.

Figure 10.4
Illustration of an elliptical hole in an axially loaded infinite sheet. (Alderliesten, 2011, 10-4.jpg. Own Work.)

An important remark has to be made. When introducing the stress concentration

factor and the peak stress at the notch edge, it was argued that the component

would fail before the nominal stress  would have reached the ultimate strength

of the material.

Implicitly, this explanation and subsequent derivation may lead to the assumption that

failure would thus occur when the peak stress     reaches the ultimate strength.

This is correct for materials that remain (approximately) linear elastic until failure, like

for example fibre reinforced polymer composites.

However, metallic materials usually plastically deform beyond the yield strength. In
that case the behaviour will be different. This is illustrated in Figure 10.5. The stiffness
of material reduces significantly beyond yielding (evident from the tangent slope
198 R.C. Alderliesten

compared to the linear elastic slope, represented by the Young's modulus E). As a
result of this local stiffness reduction, stress will be redistributed to the remaining
material.

Figure 10.5
Effect of elastic-plastic material behaviour on the stress concentration. (TU Delft, n.d., 10-5.jpg. Own Work.)

The example given on the next page, illustrates that linear elastic materials have
significant higher notch sensitivities than ductile materials. As a result, the failure
strength of a notched component made of linear elastic materials is usually lower
than that of equivalent elastic-plastic materials.
On the other hand, as will be discussed later in this chapter, composites are usually
less sensitive to fatigue loads. In other words, comparing aerospace aluminium alloys
with carbon fibre composites, one may conclude that stress concentrations are
detrimental for static loads on composites and detrimental for fatigue loads in
aluminium alloys.

10.2.2 Saint Venant's principle

An important principle for structural analysis is the principle of Saint Venant. This
principle states that the effect of a local disturbance, due to for example a notch,
remains limited to the direct neighbourhood of the location of that notch, see Figure
10.6.
          Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 199

Figure 10.6
Illustration of Saint Venant's principle: Stress disturbance due to a notch remains limited to the direct
neighbourhood of the notch.(Alderliesten, 2011, 10-6.jpg. Own Work.)

Example: Effect of plasticity on

Consider a straight sample containing a hole, as illustrated in Figure 10.5.

If the material behaviour would be linear elastic until failure, like for example

carbon fibre composite, this sample would fail when  , which means

that the gross strength of failure is equal to

For a sheet with infinite dimensions, this means that the failure strength is

equal to  . For isotropic carbon fibre composite the failure strength can

be about 500 MPa, which means that failure of the sample would occur at 166

MPa.

If the material behaviour would be elastic-plastic like for example aluminium

   For a sheet with infinite dimensions, this means that the failure strength is
equal to about 0.9 . With the failure strength of aluminium 2024-T3 of about
450 MPa, this implies failure would occur at about 405 MPa.
200 R.C. Alderliesten

   Do consider however that the density of aluminium 2024-T3 is about 2.7 g/cm3
   (providing a specific failure strength of 150 kN*m/kg), while the carbon fibre
   composite would be about 1.5 g/cm3 (thus a specific strength of 110 kN*m/kg)

The benefit of this principle is that the stress analysis of a loaded structure can be
divided into a

  · global stress analysis (considering the structure as a whole)
  · local stress analysis of all details (containing notches)

This approach is justified by the Saint Venant's principle; a structure faces the same
stresses due to applied loading indifferent of the presence of a notch at a certain
location, except for the location of the notch itself.

10.2.3 Stress distribution around a hole

For the sake of simplicity, the stress concentration factor has been introduced
while limiting the discussion to the stress in the net section (nominal stress) and the
stress at the notch edge (peak stress). However, it is obvious that the disturbance in
stress created by the presence of the notch is somewhat more complex. The peak
stress described by is only at the location in the net section. Away from the hole
edge or along the contour of the notch, the stresses reduce and may even become
negative.
           Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 201

Figure 10.7
Illustrations of the tangential stress distribution around a hole in an infinite sheet; tensile peak stress at = 0, 
changes to compressive stress at = ± ½ (left); drop in stress away from the hole is more severe than along the
notch contour.(Alderliesten, 2011, 10-7.jpg. Own Work.)

This is illustrated in Figure 10.7. In this figure a peak stress of 3S is present at

both sides of the hole, while a compressive stress is present at the locations given

by         . This compressive stress may be understood when considering the

stress lines similar to the ones illustrated in Figure 10.2. These stresses may be

decomposed in stresses in horizontal and vertical direction, where the horizontal

component just above and below the hole induce a compressive stress.

Another aspect that can be observed in Figure 10.7 is that the stress drops quickly

moving away from the hole, while the drop along the contour is significantly less.

This implies there is a certain area along the notch contour that may be considered

relatively high stressed (in the order of 0.9 ), where potentially fatigue cracks may

initiate.

10.2.4 Superposition principle

According to the definition given in section 10.2.1, the stress concentration factor
    is linearly dependent on the stress. Because stresses may be superimposed,

the stress concentration factor coming from a complex set of stresses may
be derived by addressing the different stress systems separately and subsequently
superimposing the (peak) stresses at the notch.
202 R.C. Alderliesten
This is illustrated for a bi-axially loaded infinite sheet containing a hole in Figure 10.8.
To calculate the stress concentration factor both stress systems and may be
considered separately. For the stresses in direction a peak stress of 3 may be
observed at the hole edge as indicated in the figure. However, looking at the stress
then a compressive stress equal to is present at that location (see Figure 10.7).
The actual peak stress at the considered location is therefore less than 3 .
In other words, the stress concentration factor for uni-axially loaded sheet containing
a hole is higher than the same sheet bi-axially loaded in tension. If the sheet would be
bi-axially loaded by a tensile stress and a compressive stress (thus opposite to
the sign in Figure 10.8), the stress concentration factor would be higher than the uni-
axially loaded case.

10.3 Reinforcement or weakening?

10.3.1 Train axles

The significance of the theory on stress concentrations can be illustrated with the
example of train axles. Train axles are heavily loaded components that due to the
high rotational speed are repetitively loaded in (reversed) bending. One could consider
reducing the load by reinforcing the axle. Reinforcement implies that the axle
becomes stronger, but after quite an amount of train axle failure in the 19th century
people became aware that reinforcing may imply a weakening.

   Example: Versailles railway accident
      On the 5 October 1842 a disastrous accident occurred near Versailles. This is

   the first major train accident reported in history. The accident occurred due to
   a fatigue failure of a locomotive front axle, causing collision and derailing of the
   locomotives. In the subsequent fire about 60 people died.

      The investigation into the cause of this accident was performed by Rankine.
   He recognized distinctive characteristics of fatigue failure and the danger of
   stress concentrations that locally raise the stress.
   The Versailles accident and the subsequent railroad accidents led to intensive
   investigations of train axle, coupling and rails failures due to fatigue. Almost
   within a decade after 1842 over hundreds of broken axles had been reported.

      It is important to realise the significance of this accident and the magnitude
   of fatalities. About the same number of fatalities occurred in the two Comet
   accidents in 1954 a century later, see chapter 9. These two accidents still are
204 R.C. Alderliesten

   considered a major milestone in the history of aviation and the initiator of the
   investigations into the fatigue phenomena.

This phenomenon can be illustrated with Figure 10.10. The evenly distributed stress
in the section of the axle with diameter d has to change into a lower evenly distributed
stress in the section of the axle with diameter D. This disturbance of the
homogeneous stress field in the radius of the thickness step causes a concentration
of stress with a peak stress at the radius contour.

The radius becomes therefore important; a small radius induces a high stress
concentration, while a large radius reduces the stress concentration significantly.
Often this implies some engineering, because very large radii are not always possible.

10.3.2 Repairs

The example discussed in the previous section should be seriously considered,
because it relates to a general problem. If a structure in general is reinforced with
additional material or structure, the influence of the geometry may induce unwanted
concentration of stress.
This may also be the case when for example an aircraft structure is reinforced with
doublers or when such structure is repaired with patch repairs. The thickness step
related to the doubler or patch implies a location for stress concentrations. This may
be even more important when considering the higher stiffness of the reinforced area.
This is illustrated with examples in Figure 10.11. Especially the illustration in this
figure highlights using similar stress lines as in Figure 10.2, that the stiffer area of the
patch repair attracts more load than originally would be present at that location in the
structure. The patch may successfully reinforce the damage it originally repaired, but
the higher stress with the thickness step induced stress concentration may shift the
critical areas to the edge of the patch repair.
A solution to prevent a failure at this location may be to taper the edge, as illustrated
with the bonded Glare repairs on the C-5 Galaxy (right hand side of Figure 10.11).

10.4 Fatigue

10.4.1 Definition

It has been mentioned in the introduction to this chapter that fatigue as phenomenon
has been well understood for metallic materials and structure, see Schijve (2001).
However, despite this knowledge and understanding, there seems to be
misperception with respect to the phenomenon of fatigue when considering different
material types, like for example fibre reinforced composites. The misperception is
illustrated with the statement often put forward, that composites do not suffer from
fatigue.
If that statement is made, it may refer to two cases:

  · When cyclic loading composites in tension, similarly to common loading of
      metallic materials, composites hardly show evidence of damage initiation and
      growth, where fatigue cracks may initiate and propagate in metals.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 207

  · When designing a composite structure, addressing the static strength
      requirements usually is sufficient to cover fatigue.

The first aspect may be true, but in return there may be repetitive load cases that do
not cause any fatigue damage in metallic materials, that do initiate and propagate
damage in composites. As example, certain compressive load cycles severely
damage composite structures when applied many times, which do not cause any
fatigue damage in metallic materials.

The second aspect, relates partly to the discussion of the stress concentration factor;
linear elastic material is very sensitive to notches, which is not the case for metallic
materials. Therefore metallic materials can be more efficiently loaded up to their static
strength. In addition, reduction due to environmental impact (see chapter 2), further
restricts the static allowables of a composite design. When these restrictions are
accounted for, the corresponding load spectra do not cause fatigue issues in the
structure.

However, the statement and the above mentioned considerations may never refer to
the conclusion that composites do not face damage phenomena under any repetitive
or cyclic load spectra. In general, it can be stated that all engineering materials in one
way or another suffer from fatigue. Only the phenomena appear to be different leading
to different failure mechanics under different loading conditions.

To do justice to the generic aspect of fatigue, fatigue can therefore be defined as:

Damage phenomenon induced by a large number of load cycles below the ultimate
strength of material or structure causing permanent deterioration of material or
structure resulting in a reduction in load bearing capability.

For aeronautical structures, the load cycles mentioned in this definition are often
related to number of flights, ranging from approximately constant amplitude (fuselage
pressurization every flight) to arbitrary spectrum loading (wing loading during take-
off, landing, and turbulence). This is illustrated with an arbitrary flight load spectrum
shown in Figure 10.12. In this example the maximum load in the whole spectrum is
called nominal or limit load. This is the load case that is considered to occur only
once in a lifetime. At this load failure may not occur. Ultimate load, used for strength
justification is usually calculated as 1.5 times the nominal or limit load.
208 R.C. Alderliesten

10.4.2 Fatigue assessment

It was noticed by the researchers investigating fatigue after the railroad failures that
fatigue appears to be predominantly influenced by the amplitude of the load cycles.
Wohler, who performed an extensive research at the time on fatigue loading of train
axles, concluded that the
"Material can be induced to fail by many repetitions of stresses, all of which are lower
than the static strength. The stress amplitudes are decisive for the destruction of the
cohesion of the material. The maximum stress is of influence only in so far as the
higher it is, the lower are the stress amplitudes which lead to failure"
For this reason, the fatigue characteristics are traditionally represented by so called
Wohler curves, or S-N curves, see for example Figure 10.13.
                   Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 209

Figure 10.13
Illustration of a Wohler curve (stress amplitude is decisive). (TU Delft, n.d., 10-13.jpg. Own Work.)

One should carefully pay attention to the S-N curve as illustrated in Figure 10.13.

In this figure, three curves are given for three different mean stress levels. It is

illustrated that the lower the mean stress  the higher the curve. This relates to

the conclusion of Wohler; the stress amplitude is decisive and thus plotted on the

vertical axis, but there is an effect of maximum stress. The lower the mean stress for

given stress amplitude, the lower the maximum stress  . This will increase the

fatigue life (equivalent to shifting the curve to the right), which is equivalent to shifting

the curve upward.

To understand this, one has to consider the stress cycle. The relation between the

amplitude stress and the mean stress        on the one hand, and the minimum

stress  and maximum stress  on the other hand is given by:

                                                                                                       (10.6)

Note that the assessment of fatigue using S-N curves is solely based on evaluating
fatigue under constant amplitude loading, i.e. all load cycles have the same mean
stress and stress amplitude. As earlier mentioned, except for pressurization of
fuselages all flight load spectra are random of nature and thus to be considered as
variable amplitude loading.

In general, two asymptotes can be identified in the Wohler curve

  · Upper asymptote, related to the maximum stress reaching the ultimate strength
210 R.C. Alderliesten

· Lower asymptote, defined as fatigue limit

The lower asymptote is an important parameter, when evaluating fatigue for specific

materials or structures. Especially, when high cycle fatigue is considered, i.e. fatigue
with a very large number of cycles (order 105 or higher). The fatigue limit is defined

as the stress amplitude (usually given for a mean stress of  ), below which

fatigue failure do not occur. This does not mean that nucleation of microscopic

fatigue damage does not occur, but that even if such damage does occur that it will

never propagate to macroscopic lengths causing failure.

One way to design against fatigue is to limit the operational load spectra to stress
amplitudes below the fatigue limit. This approach formed the basis for the Safe-Life
concept discussed in chapter 9.

10.4.3 Variable amplitude loading

The assessment of flight load spectra, or variable amplitude fatigue loading, is in
general performed using the constant amplitude data as represented in Wohler
curves, see Figure 10.13. The most well-known method widely applied to do
approximate the variable amplitude behaviour (and also well known to be very
inaccurate) is the Miner rule.

This rule is a linear damage accumulation rule that sums the damage fractions of
each individual load cycle in the load spectrum until the total damage fraction reaches
the value 1. The material or structure is then considered failed.
The damage fraction of for example the ith load cycle in the spectrum is calculated
with

                                                                                              (10.7)

where is the fatigue life determined with the constant amplitude S-N data, see
Figure 10.13. If the load spectrum contains more of the same load cycle, this relation
is written as:

                                                                                              (10.8)

Failure of the component then will be assumed to occur at:
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 211

                                                                                              (10.9)

Again, one should note that this simple rule ignores several aspects that play a role
in the fatigue phenomenon. As a consequence, this rule is often inaccurate. The
engineering approach to account for that is to calibrate the rule to specific materials
and load spectra. This calibration, or more correct empirical correction, may lead to
values smaller or larger than 1.

10.4.4 Notched materials and structures

The above discussion has been presented assuming there are no notches present
in the material or structure. The fatigue limit mentioned in section 10.4.2 is then
considered to be a material parameter. However, following from the discussion of
stress concentrations at the beginning of this chapter, it is obvious that fatigue may
occur sooner at a notch where a peak stress is present.

The effect of a stress concentration, described by the factor , on the fatigue
behaviour can be illustrated with the S-N curve as given in Figure 10.14. The upper
asymptote, related to , is not affected for metallic materials, because of the
plasticity redistributing the stress, see Figure 10.5. Only a small, often negligible,
reduction will occur. Be aware that this is not the case for linear elastic materials, like
composite materials. For these materials the upper limit will reduce by a factor .

For both metallic and composite materials, there is a significant effect on the fatigue
limit. Because of the higher peak stress at the notch, fatigue damage may initiate
sooner than would be expected based on the undisturbed stress field data. In general,
the fatigue limit reduces by a factor for notched structures.

For small notches and large stress concentration factors , this reduction may be
less severe for metallic materials. Again the plasticity provides an advantage over
linear elastic materials. High values for implies theoretically high values for the
peak stress. However, similar to the discussion on Figure 10.5, the peak stress is
levelled off beyond the yield strength of the material. As a consequence, the real peak
stress is lower.

Following from the definition given by equation (10.3) , this implies a lower stress
concentration. The actual stress concentration due to plasticity is therefore described
by a notch factor , which is lower than the stress concentration factor . Again,
212 R.C. Alderliesten

note that this only the case for ductile (thus elastic-plastic) materials and not for
linear elastic materials, like composites. Composites are considered to be very notch
sensitive.

10.4.5 Designing against fatigue

The fatigue behaviour represented by the S-N curves is considered up until failure.
It was already mentioned that below the fatigue limit, microscopic damage may
occur but will not lead to failure. The fatigue life governed by the S-N curve, consists
for 80-90% of formation of a fatigue damage of about few millimetres (nucleation
of microscopic damage up to macroscopic lengths). Only a few percent of the life
consist of a crack that propagates to a larger length causing final failure.
The Safe-Life concept implies designing against fatigue using fatigue life data (S-
N curves). To justify such design, large safety factors are required with respect to
available fatigue data. The experimental life (proven by tests) must be about 3 to
4 times the life that the aircraft is certified for. This is related to the fact that the
experimental data shows considerable scatter, especially at lower stress amplitude
cycles.
Although the S-N curves are presented like in Figure 10.13 and Figure 10.14, one
has to be aware that these curves represent average or minimum data. Performing
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 213

individual tests near the fatigue limit for example, may result in fatigue lives that
deviate by a factor 10 from the curve.

Because of the large margin of safety applied using the Safe-Life concept, the
thickness of fatigue critical parts is often significant larger than required for static
strength. Especially, for metallic materials this is the case.

Designing against fatigue then aims to increase fatigue lives or to increase allowable
fatigue stresses for given operational life. This implies lowering stress concentrations
and avoidance of damage initiators in the design, but also selection of materials that
are less fatigue sensitive (higher fatigue limits). However, this can be achieved also by
applying a damage tolerance philosophy rather than a Safe-Life concept.

10.4.6 Some fatigue characteristics

It has been mentioned a few times in this chapter that fatigue is a generic damage
formation phenomenon related to cyclic loading. The appearance of the damage may
be different from one material type to another. For example, in metallic materials, the
cyclic (tensile) loading may initiate and propagate cracks, whereas in fibre reinforced
composites, delaminations and transverse shear cracks may occur.

The type of loading for formation of these damage types is often different. As said,
cracks in metals are often driven by tensile load cycles applied in plane of the material.
The delaminations in composites are often induced by cyclic compression, shear or
bending loads.

Looking at these materials on a microscopic level, one may see some qualitative
commonalities that play a role in the nucleation of damage. In metals and alloys,
often the inclusions in the material cause stress concentrations at microscopic level,
because the mechanical properties of inclusion and surrounding material are
different, see Figure 10.15. However, this difference in mechanical properties is also
present for longitudinal fibres and matrix in composites. Qualitatively, both cases
imply stress concentrations that may case tensile cracks in metals and transverse
shear cracks and delaminations in composites.

both cases stress concentrations are present at micro level. Derivative from left: Antiproton (2017), CC0 and right:

Despite the qualitative microscopic correlation in Figure 10.15, fatigue appears to be
different in metals and composites. The fatigue damage of both cases in this figure
are nucleated by different loads on a macroscopic level; metal are most sensitive
to tension-tension loading, while composites are most sensitive to compression-
tension or compression-bending loading. Some illustrations of typical fatigue failure
mechanisms on a macroscopic level are illustrated in Figure 10.16.

10.5 Damage tolerance

10.5.1 Definition

There are different definitions for damage tolerance. Following from the discussion in
chapter 9, damage tolerance represent a design philosophy where structural integrity
is assured even in presence of potential damages by a combination of built-in design
features and inspection and maintenance procedures. This definition is very relevant
for the aeronautical field of structural design.
However, sometimes a more strict or limited definition is used that relates to the
former definition, but omits the aspect of possible inspection and maintenance. This
definition relates to the material's response to potential damage cases. Traditionally,
this definition included fatigue cracks and environmental damages, but also impact
damages. Interestingly enough, with the introduction of composites in primary aircraft
structures, people seem to further limit this definition to impact damages alone. This
is probably related to the fact that composites are considered not to suffer from
fatigue, which has been discussed before.
However, it is recommended to consider all relevant damage scenarios even when
addressing damage tolerance as a material aspect only. This aspect is considered
in the definition of residual strength, which considers the remaining load bearing
capability of material or structure in presence of potential damage. In the last section
of this chapter, this aspect will be briefly addressed for a material or structure
containing a fatigue crack.

10.5.1 Limitations of stress concentration concept

The stress concentration factor captures the effect of disturbance in the stress
field due to the presence of a notch. However, when addressing the residual strength
(or damage tolerance) of a material or structure, there is a limitation to the concept.
This can be illustrated with the description of equation (10.5). The stress
concentration is directly related not only to the size of notch, but also the radius at the
critical location.
216 R.C. Alderliesten

Consider that a fatigue crack has initiated at the edge of a hole and propagated
a few millimetres, he question what the residual strength is cannot be answered
using the stress concentration factor. Because a crack has a sharp tip, which may be
considered to have a infinitely small radius. With equation (10.5) this implies that the
stress concentration factor becomes infinite, indifferent from the size of the crack.
However, it does not require a lot of fantasy to understand that a structure with a
small crack is capable to carry a higher load than the same structure containing a long
crack.
In other words, to assess the residual strength another parameter is needed than
the stress concentration factor . What can be learned from equation (10.5) is that
apparently, a crack with a sharp tip induces a singularity in the stress field right at the
tip. To mathematically derive a relevant parameter describing this stress singularity
first a crack is considered in a sheet with infinite dimensions. This case is considered
for similar reasons as explained for the stress concentration factor: the boundary
conditions are exactly known.
The stress field including the singularity can be mathematically derived for this case.
Although not necessary to reproduce in this course, for illustration the stress field is
given here

                                                                                            (10.10)

It can be observed that these equations have a component in the equation that
describes the location measured with respect to the crack tip. The other part in the
equations has a similar appearance for each equation. It is this part of the equation
that is taken as parameter, indicated by K.

                                                                                            (10.11)
This parameter is called the stress intensity factor (not to be confused with stress
concentration factor). In this relation the crack length is evidently related to the
dimensions of the crack (which was no longer described with ). In addition, the
applied stress levels have an influence on the stress intensity.
Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 217

Figure 10.17
Three different opening modes of a crack; tensile mode I, shear mode II, and transverse shear mode III.
(Alderliesten, 2011, 10-17.jpg. Own Work.)

When considering cracks, different opening modes can be identified, see for example
Figure 10.17. These opening modes imply different behaviour. Obviously, fatigue
cracks in metallic materials and structures under cyclic tensile loading predominantly
focus on the tensile mode I.

The stress intensity factor K for a crack opening in mode I, is indicated with
(subscript denotes the opening mode). The residual strength of a material containing
a crack is evidently then related to the critical value of this . This critical parameter,

    , is called the fracture toughness, previously discussed in chapter 1. This fracture
toughness is considered a material specific material. Materials with high fracture
toughness are clearly capable to sustain high loads in presence of cracks, or
considerable loads in presence of very long cracks, see equation (10.11).

Thus, if the fracture toughness is given by:

                                                                                                         (10.12)

The sensitivity of materials to cracks can be illustrated with Table 10.2, assuming

that the critical stress is related to the material's yield strength by                                  .

From the comparison it can be observed that despite steel having the highest fracture

toughness of these four materials, the critical crack length is the smallest. Evidently,

the influence of ductility plays an important role here. Ductile alloys, having low yield

strength, are usually less sensitive for cracks.

11.1 Introduction

In previous chapters various aircraft and spacecraft structures have been discussed
briefly with respect to their shape and functions. The analysis of general load paths
and the way loads locally are translated into have been identified.
However, all these structures are constructed from parts that each often are build-up
from smaller elements. All these elements and parts are jointed together to form the
complete structure. These structural elements have been identified previously; sheets,
stringers, ribs, frames, web plates, girders, clips, etc.

220 R.C. Alderliesten

There are quite a few joining techniques currently applied in engineering; only few
of them are considered applicable in aerospace engineering. The most commonly
applied joining techniques in aerospace are:

  · Mechanically fastening (includes riveting and bolting)
  · Welding
  · Adhesive bonding

The three major joining techniques can be classified by the loading mode of the joint;
the joint may either transfer load in tension, or in shear, see Figure 11.1. Although in
principle each joining technique could be designed as either tensile or shear joint, the
tensile load transfer is avoided for adhesive bonding.
This chapter provides general characteristics of each of these joining techniques.
These characteristics may be used to identify the advantages and disadvantages
of one joining technique over the other. Here, care must be taken, because the
advantages and disadvantages are relative; what may be considered in one structure
as advantage may imply a disadvantage in another structure. These considerations
will be discussed in the next chapter.

11.2 Mechanically fastened joints

Different mechanical fasteners are used in engineering. The four major types are
illustrated in Figure 11.2. The traditional nails often applied in wooden constructions,
are considered inapplicable in aerospace, and will therefore not be discussed here.
The three remaining fastener types are threaded fasteners, blind fasteners and rivets.
Threaded fasteners are commonly referred to as bolts.

   Example: Mechanically fastened joints in metals
      Aeronautical structures contain numerous mechanically fastened joints.

   These joints are designed to transfer load by either tension or shear. Typical
   shear joints are for example illustrated in Figure 11.3.

      The wing spar connection is bolted to the web plate of the spar close to the
   girders. The normal load in the girders must be introduced into the connection,
   where the bolts primarily transfer load in shear. The stepped configuration
   intends to slowly increase the stiffness of the connection to transfer load from
   girders and web plate gradually into the connection.

      The lap joint and butt joint are typical shear joints applied in thin walled
   structures. The thickness step in the lap joint is oriented longitudinally in the
   fuselage structure, which implies no aerodynamic problem. The circumferential
   shear joint have to be smooth for aerodynamic reasons. Therefore, the butt joint
   is applied.

      Figure 11.4 illustrates typical tensile joints in aeronautical structures. The load
   into the horizontal stabilizer is introduced through the lower skin sheets into the
   ribs and spars. The joint exhibits a lot of tensile joints through several additional
   skin doublers. The channel fitting is a typical design feature to introduce tensile
   load by the bolt gradually into the skin sheets. The gradual reduction of the
   fitting's cross section by tapering the flanges implies stiffness reduction. The
   rivets in the fitting are typical shear joints.

11.2.1 Rivets

Riveting is generally applicable for joining sheet material in which the joint transfer the
load from one sheet to the other in shear. Because the rivet is being forced into its
final shape during installation, access from both sides is needed. In case access can
be provided at only one side, blind rivets are used.
Riveting is a reliable joining method because it has been applied for many decades
(lot of experience), but also because the joint can be well inspected and repaired. In
case a riveted joint must be repaired rivets can be drilled out and replaced by a slightly
larger rivet.
Riveting is often considered for its low cost; both the rivets and the installation per
unit are fairly cheap. For rivet installation, only pneumatic hammers or rivet guns
are necessary tooling to apply the riveting force, while bucking bars are needed
to counteract the applied force. An alternative method for riveting with pneumatic
hammers is the application of squeezing. The rivet is then pressed into its final shape
by a force controlled machine. This method for rivet installation provides better quality
and places rivets in a more reproducible manner.
224 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 11.5
Illustration of the riveting principle: rivet placement (1), riveting squeeze force (2), rivet deformation (3) and final
result (4).(TU Delft, n.d., 11-5.jpg. Own Work.)

Riveting is considered a permanent joining method. In case of repair the rivet could be
drilled out and replaced by an oversized rivet (rivet with larger diameter), but this can
only be done very few times. Each removal implies application of a larger rivet, which
can only be done a limited amount of times. Another reason why riveting is considered
permanent is that during operational loading the rivet cannot vibrate loose. Although
the residual compressive stress may reduce over time, the rivet remains fixated in the
hole.
Because the rivet is forced into the hole, it will fill the hole completely. During riveting,
the shaft of the rivet will expand (see chapter 1), applying radial pressure to the
sheet edges. As a consequence, the stress concentration factor induced by the holes,
see chapter 10, is reduced by radial expansion of the rivet. The riveting principle is
illustrated in Figure 11.5.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 225

Figure 11.6
Difference in stress concentration due to load transfer induced by bearing pressure only (open hole) and load
transfer by bearing and radial compression (filled hole). (TU Delft, n.d., 11-6.jpg. Own Work.)

The remaining residual stress is considered favourable for the load transfer, and
therefore also for the fatigue properties of the riveted joint. The reason can be
explained with the two cases illustrated in Figure 11.6. The open hole configuration
could represent a bolted joint in which the bolt is placed free from the sheet edges,
often denoted as clearance fit. The load applied by the bolt to the sheet edges is called
bearing pressure. This bearing load must be in equilibrium with far field stresses
further away in the sheet. As a consequence, all stress is concentrated near the hole
edges, implicating a large stress concentration.
The filled hole represents a rivet that has been squeezed into the hole applying radial
expansion to the sheet edges. Subsequent loading of the joint, would not only apply
bearing pressure to the sheet edges, but would also reduce the radial compressive
forces at the back side of the hole. As a consequence, the load around the hole edges
to be in equilibrium with the far field stresses in the sheet is significantly less. In other
words, riveting reduces the stress concentration factor Kt at the hole edge by radial
expansion of the rivet shaft.
226 R.C. Alderliesten

11.2.2 Threaded fasteners

The threaded fasteners have a wider range of application. First of all, they can be
applied both in shear joints and tension joints, and in joints that comprise a
combination of both loading modes. In addition, bolts can be applied not only to sheet
material, but also to a wider variety of structural components.
A general characteristic is that threaded fasteners, often called bolt, allow
disassembly after being assembled. In other words, they are not permanent but can
be removed and re-installed again. Where a rivet after being drilled out is discarded
and replaced, bolts can be used again.
Another characteristic of threaded fasteners is the wider range of materials that can
be selected to manufacture the bolt. Rivets must be deformable during installation,
which limits the type of materials from which it can be manufactured. For threaded
fasteners, this limitation is not present, and as a result there is more freedom to select
the appropriate bolt material.

Figure 11.7
Definition of the bolt dimensions. (TU Delft, n.d., 11-7.jpg. Own Work.)

Therefore high strength joints are often bolted joints. The strength of bolts can be
tailored by selecting the right material, the appropriate heat treatments, and
convenient case hardening technique. The dimensions of the bolt can be chosen
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 227
depending on the to-be-jointed components. An illustration of dimension definition is
given in Figure 11.7.

11.2.3 Load transfer mechanisms

In mechanically fastened joints multiple load transfer mechanisms act together to
provide the load path through the joint. Figure 11.8 illustrates the primary and
secondary loads that act in a single sided shear joint.

Figure 11.8
Illustration of the primary and secondary loads in mechanically fastened joints. (TU Delft, n.d., 11-8.jpg. Own Work.)

To evaluate a mechanically fastened joint, the individual load paths must be identified.
In a single row joint, as illustrated in Figure 11.9 all load is transferred form one sheet
to another by either bearing pressure on the sheet edges, or by friction between the
sheets. The magnitude of friction depends on the clamping force that is provided by
the bolts.
228 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 11.9
Illustration of a single sided shear joint (a) and double sided shear joint (b). (TU Delft, n.d., 11-9.jpg. Own Work.)

In case of a multiple row joint, for example three rows as illustrated in Figure 11.8, all
load is distributed over the three rows. This implies that the load in the upper sheet
in Figure 11.8 is partly transferred to the lower sheet at the first rivet row, by bearing
and friction, while the remainder of the load continues through the upper sheet to the
second and third rivet row. This part of the load must then go around the rivets in the
first row, which is called by-pass load.
Secondary loads to be considered are the interference loads, which are created by
rivets that expanded in the holes during riveting, or by bolts with an oversized shank
diameter that have been forced into an undersized hole. These loads add to the
bearing pressure as illustrated in Figure 11.6.
The main difference between the two shear joints in Figure 11.9 relates to symmetry.
The single sided shear joint is an asymmetric joint, whereas the double-sided joint
can be a symmetric joint. In case of a symmetric joint, equal load is transferred over
both interfaces, which implies that the deformation of the joint remains symmetric. In
an asymmetric joint, the load transfers through one interface, creating an asymmetric
step in the load path. This load step induces an asymmetric deformation in addition
to the longitudinal deformation induced by the applied load, which is called secondary
bending, see Figure 11.10.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 229

Figure 11.10
Illustration of secondary bending in a single sided shear joint; the deformation relates to the load step correlated to
the neutral line through the joint. (TU Delft, n.d., 11-10.jpg. Own Work.)

   Example: Effect of secondary bending
      Consider load transferred by bearing in the joint in Figure 11.11. The bearing

   pressure is defined as:

      where F is the load transferred by bearing, D is the diameter of the hole and
   t the sheet thickness. The bearing pressure, or bearing stress, has the units [N/
   mm2] or [MPa]. This strength is considered characteristic for sheet materials, as
   it describes when sheets will deform and fail under bearing pressure.

      In a symmetric joint, in absence of secondary bending, the bearing pressure
   is treated as a homogeneous stress distribution through the thickness of the
   sheet. Secondary bending implies a variation of stresses through the thickness
   of the sheet as illustrated in Figure 11.11. The superposition of two stress
   distributions implies that maximum stress is reached at one side first.
   Considering fatigue, it also implies that at one side the stress cycles are greater
230 R.C. Alderliesten
   and higher than at the other side. The detrimental influence of secondary
   bending on the fatigue life is illustrated with the S-N curves in Figure 11.12.

11.2.4 Failure modes

The strength of mechanically fastened joints relates to both the fastener (type and
material) and the jointed sheets. The joint can fail in different ways, which are
identified as the joint failure modes, illustrated in Figure 11.13.

One failure mode relates to rivet failure; the shear load in the rivet exceeds the ultimate
shear strength of the rivet material, causing shear failure of the rivet. In general, this
failure mode should be avoided in aeronautical structures. Once the load on a riveted
joint causes rivet failure, it can be expected that subsequent redistribution of load
over the other rivets will cause failure of these rivets as well. As a consequence, the
complete riveted joint may fail catastrophically.

The shear failure load on a rivet can be calculated for a single shear joint (see Figure
11.9) with

                                                                                              (11.1)

Where D is the diameter and is the failure shear strength of the material. For a
double sided shear joint the load will be twice as high, because the load transfer takes
place at two distinct interfaces.

The preferred failure modes relate to sheet failure. The three sheet failure modes in
riveted joints are net-section failure, bearing failure and shear-out (or tear out) failure,
see Figure 11.13. The net-section failure relates to load exceeding the ultimate tensile
strength of the sheet in the cross-section between the rivets. For a single rivet that
can be written as

                                                                                              (11.2)
where W is the width, t the sheet thickness, and the failure strength of the material.
232 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 11.13
Four major failure modes for mechanically fastened joints. (Alderliesten, 2011, 11-13.jpg. Own Work.)

The second failure mode related to sheet failure is the bearing strength failure. The
bearing strength failure can be calculated with (see example on the effect of
secondary bending)

                                                                                              (11.3)
However, considering bearing strength in riveted joints, often the permanent
deformation is considered for determining the nominal allowable load. Based on
experience the maximum permanent deformation allowed is set to be 2% ovalisation
of the hole, which is equal to 0.02D. The bearing pressure at which this deformation
occurs is defined as . Thus the nominal load should satisfy

                                                                                              (11.4)
The ultimate load is then obtained by multiplying both sides of the equation with the
safety factor of 1.5, which yields

                                                                                              (11.5)
The last sheet failure mode is shear out of the sheet under the bearing pressure. This
failure mode relates to the edge distance, i.e. the amount of material between the rivet
and the edge of the sheet, see Figure 11.14.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 233

Figure 11.14
Small edge distance (a) will cause shear out failure, which can be avoided with greater edge distances (b). (TU Delft,
n.d., 11-14.jpg. Own Work.)

Of course, the maximum load that a mechanically fastened joint can sustain is the
smallest of the four failure loads.

11.3 Mechanically fastening in composites

Most of the discussion in the previous section applies to composite structures.
However, several additional aspects should be considered. It was explained in chapter
1 that the orthotropic nature of composite panels implies that the strength depends
on the orientation of the fibres within the panel.
This can be explained considering a single ply of fibre reinforced composite, illustrated
in Figure 11.15. The longitudinal plies are strong in fibre direction, but the shear
strength of the matrix material between the fibre is insufficient to resist the shear-
out failure. Transverse plies have insufficient resistance against the bearing pressure,
most likely causing net-section failure.
234 R.C. Alderliesten

Figure 11.15
Relation between fibre orientation and failure mode; longitudinal plies are weak against shear-out, while transverse
plies are weak against net-section failure and bearing. (Alderliesten, 2011, 11-15.jpg. Own Work.)

This implies that the composite laminates that are jointed together require plies
oriented in several directions to create sufficient resistance against either of the three
failure modes. Because the shear-out failure mode is induced by shear stresses
between the fibres, see Figure 11.15 (c), often fibre layers are added oriented in ±45°
orientation, because of their shear strength contribution.
To create sufficient bearing strength in composite panels, sufficient layers in 0°, 90°,
and ±45° are needed. This implies that the thickness near the edges of composite
panels often must increase to create sufficient quasi-isotropic thickness as is
illustrated in Figure 11.16. As alternative, to limit the thickness increase often metallic
inserts are added, because of their isotropic nature. Rather than applying multiple
fibre layers in a quasi-isotropic lay-up (see definition in chapter 1), a single isotropic
metal layer will suffice.

metallic inserts (b), and replacing layers with metallic inserts (c). (Alderliesten, 2011, 11-16.jpg. Own Work.)

11.4 Mechanically fastening in sandwich
composites

Figure 11.17
Application of inserts in the sandwich core to create sufficient bearing strength.(TU Delft, n.d., 11-17.jpg. Own
Work.)

The application of mechanically fastening in composite sandwich panels is
somewhat more complex compared to monolithic composite panels, discussed in the
236 R.C. Alderliesten

previous section. The complication is related to the characteristics of facing and core
material; where the facings transfer all normal loads, the core only transfers the shear
load. This means that the mechanical fastener in a sandwich panel has to transfer
its load by bearing mainly to the two face sheets of the sandwich, as is illustrated in
Figure 11.17 and 11.18

Figure 11.18
Reduction of sandwich panel to monolithic composite edges to create sufficient bearing strength. (Alderliesten,
2011, 11-18.jpg. Own Work.)

11.5 Welded joints

In this section the welding of joints is discussed for both metallic and composite
structures.

11.5.1 Metallic structures

Welding is an attractive joining technique, because a good weld is almost as good as
the parent material. In general, welding provides a so-called integral structure. After
welding, the structural component can no longer identified as separate components.
For aeronautical purposes where fatigue and damage tolerance is of importance, this
has a drawback. As illustrated in Figure 11.19, a crack propagating in the skin sheet,
will sense no natural barrier against growth into the welded stringer, whereas the
riveted and adhesive bonded joint provides a natural barrier for the propagating crack.
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 237

Figure 11.19
Comparison between mechanically fastened, bonded and integral structures; integral structures do not provide
barriers against cracking. (Alderliesten, 2011, 11-19.jpg. Own Work.)

There are two major welding techniques applied in aerospace structures:
  · Laser beam welding
  · Friction stir welding

In both cases heat is added to the material, but the principle differs significantly. In
case of laser beam welding, the laser beam is the heat source that very locally heats
the material to melting temperature levels. Because of the welding rate and the local
rapid rate of heating and cooling, only a small area is affected by the heat treatments,
the so-called heat affected zone.
Friction stir welding is a different process. It is not based on heating material to
melting temperature, but it is a process in which the material remains in its solid state.
A cylindrical tool with shoulder is rotated and pressed with great force into the sheets.
The friction between tool and sheet material generates sufficient amount of heat to
soften the material and to allow mixing of the plasticized flow. Because of the limited
amount of heat and the temperature levels, a smaller area of the weld is affected by
the heat treatment. In addition, friction stir welding does not require addition of weld
material, only the parent sheet materials are mixed during the process.
Whereas laser beam welding can only be applied to certain aluminium alloys because
of the applied heat treatments, friction stir welding can be applied to more alloys
including the high strength aeronautical alloys. It even has been proven that dissimilar
alloys can be welded with friction stir welding.
238 R.C. Alderliesten

11.5.2 Composite structures

In composite structures welding can only be performed with thermoplastic
composites. The principle of welding is that the matrix material locally is heated above
the glass transition temperature to bond parts together.
The following welding techniques are currently available:

  · Resistance welding
  · Induction welding
  · Ultrasonic welding

Figure 11.20
Examples of welding in thermoplastics; welding of ribs to the skin of flaps. (TU Delft, n.d., 11-20.jpg. Own Work.)

Resistance welding uses the principle of adding electrically resistive material between
the surfaces that are welded together. By applying an electrical current through this
material, the resistance generated heats up the material at the location of welding. An
example application of resistance welding is given in Figure 11.20.

11.6 Adhesive bonding

Adhesive bonding is a permanent joining technique that can only be loaded in shear.
Although, adhesive joints exhibit some tensile strength, loading in tension is generally
not accepted and avoided. Adhesive bonding is characterised by the high durability.
The absence of holes with corresponding stress concentrations makes these joints
                                              Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials 239

rather insensitive to fatigue, resulting in fatigue lives of order of magnitude greater
than mechanically fastened joints. In addition, because the material is not weakened
during the bonding process, the adhesive joint is generally stronger than the
adherents, i.e. the materials bonded together.

A distinction can be made between hot bonding and cold bonding. The quality of cold
bonding is generally lower than hot bonding, because of the adhesives that can be
used. As a result, for bonding structural components hot bonding is generally applied.
Because of the higher temperature and often higher required pressure autoclaves are
necessary.

Because adhesive bonded joints cannot be inspected for their quality (How do you
measure the quality of adhesive after curing?), the process is controlled in detail to
guarantee reproducible adhesive joints. Once given process conditions have proven
to give bonded joints with sufficient strength, the process can be repeated.

However, the reproducibility of high quality adhesive joints is not yet considered
sufficient to assure that such joints will not fail prematurely or at lower stress levels
than the failure strength. In addition, the measurement techniques to evaluate the
adhesive joint strength non-destructively (without damaging the joint) are non-
existent. Therefore, adhesive bonded joints are not allowed in primary structures as
single load path solution. Adhesive bonding in these critical structures must always
be accompanied with other load transfer paths, such as mechanical fasteners.
Bonded stringers contain therefore always rivets at the stringer run-out; the adhesive
joint is considered insufficient.

11.6.1 Metallic structures

To create a high quality adhesive bonded joint, the adherents must be pre-treated to
provide a good chemical bond. In aluminium structures, the pre-treatment consists
of anodising and priming the surfaces before bonding is applied. The anodisation
process makes the adhesive joint resistant to corrosion (particularly bond line
corrosion), while the primer creates the proper surface to bond the adhesive. These
pre-treatment processes require monitoring of the process conditions in order
to assure that the pre-treatment layers are applied according to the requirements.

Traditionally, these pre-treatment solutions contain chromates (chromate acid
anodising), because of their excellence performance with respect to corrosion
240 R.C. Alderliesten

resistance. However, because of their detrimental impact on environment, these
processes are required to become chromate free. This implies that currently a lot of
research is being performed to identify alternative pre-treatment processes that have
less impact on the environment, but are as good as the traditional chromate based
solutions.

11.6.2 Composite structures

In composite structures the adhesive bonding can be applied in multiple ways. The
reason is that the adhesive bonding process requires a curing step. This curing step
implied an addition to the metallic production processes, but can be efficiently used in
manufacturing of composites, because these materials already require a curing step.
As a consequence, cured composite stringers may be bonded to a composite skin
panel that still has to be cured together with the adhesive joint. This combination is
often referred to as co-bonding. Alternatively, the skin has been cured in a previous
step and the stringers are cured while bonded to the skin at the same time. This
combination is commonly referred to as co-curing.
In order to bond two skin panels together, other solutions may be applied that the
overlap joint commonly used for metallic panels. The layered structure of the
composite skin panel may be utilised to provide a more efficient overlap joint without
the geometric step related to the overlap of panels. This solution is often called scarf
joint, as illustrated in Figure 11.21. For example, each layer in the laminate may be
terminated at a certain position to provide an overlap with the layer of the other panel.
This stepped scarf joint is illustrated in Figure 11.21 (b).

Figure 11.21
Illustration of bonding in composites: scarf joint (a) and stepped scarf joint (b). (Alderlieste 2011, 11-21.jpg. Own
Work.)

11.6.3 Adhesive joint strength

The adhesive joint strength relates to the stress distribution throughout the adhesive
joint. Although the adhesive joint creates an area of load transfer, rather than locations
of load transfer (with rivets in a riveted joint for example), the stresses are not
homogeneous.
Consider for example a simple overlap joint as illustrated in Figure 11.22. The primary
mode of load transfer is via shear. The adhesive layer will deform by shear as
illustrated in the figure. However, because the load is gradually transferred from one
sheet to the other, the reduction of stress towards the end of the sheet implies a
reduction of strain (or elongation). This is illustrated in the figure by the vertical marks
in the sheets. Because the adhesive must deform in a compatible way with the sheets,
it implies that peak stress levels occur at the edges of the joint. The shear stress
exhibits a so-called bathtub shape.
However, because the two sheets in Figure 11.22 are not aligned, application of
a tensile load on the joint will cause the joint to straighten itself. This causes a
bending deformation of the sheets with additional tensile stresses in the adhesive,
as illustrated in Figure 11.10. These tensile stresses are considered most critical
concerning the overall joint strength. Estimating the joint strength therefore implies
that not only the shear stresses are to be considered, but also peel stresses as result
of these secondary deformation modes.

Introduction to Aerospace Structures and Materials

Dr.ir. R.C. (René) Alderliesten

This book provides an introduction to the discipline of aerospace structures
and materials. It is the first book to date that includes all relevant aspects of
this discipline within a single monologue. These aspects range from materials,
manufacturing and processing techniques, to structures, design principles
and structural performance, including aspects like durability and safety. With
the purpose of introducing students into the basics of the entire discipline, the
book presents the subjects broadly and loosely connected, adopting either
a formal description or an informal walk around type of presentation. A key
lessons conveyed within this book is the interplay between the exact science
and engineering topics, like solid material physics and structural analysis, and
the soft topics that are not easily captured by equations and formulas. Safety,
manufacturability, availability and costing are some of these topics that are
presented in this book to explain decisions and design solutions within this
discipline.
