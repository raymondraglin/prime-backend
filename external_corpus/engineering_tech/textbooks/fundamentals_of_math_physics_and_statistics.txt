ABOUT THIS PROJECT

The development of this textbook was made possible by the support of the U.S. Department of
Education, which in January 2021 awarded the three-year funded project: OERTransport: Enabling
Transportation Planning Professional Advancement (P116T200033) to the University of Texas-
Arlington (UTA) in consortium with California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) and the
University of South Florida (USF).
This open textbook is part of the OERTransport collection of six transportation planning OER
textbooks and their respective graduate course implementation at each of the three collaborating
universities. The creation of each textbook benefitted from an independent industry advisory board's
review and the savvy contributions of each institution's OER librarians. For more information on
OERTransport: https://oertransportlab.uta.edu/
The contents of this textbook were developed under an Open Textbooks Pilot grant from the Fund
for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), U.S. Department of Education. However,
those contents do not necessarily represent the policy of the Department of Education, and no
endorsement by the Federal Government should be assumed.

PREFACE

This textbook and OER material cover tools and basic knowledge required to master the prerequisite
essentials of physics, mathematics, and statistics applied in transportation engineering. To our
knowledge, no such textbook currently exists to build the KSTs (Knowledge, Skills, Tools) for college
freshmen' remedial courses required by most transportation engineering graduate programs that
admit non-engineers (e.g., PHYS 141, MATH 142, STAT 321 at California Polytechnic State
University, San Luis Obispo). The textbook modules are intended for students with undergraduate
degrees in planning and other less technical fields who are interested in pursuing transportation
careers where background engineering knowledge is required.

CHAPTER 1: TRIGONOMETRY FUNCTIONS AND GEOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS

This chapter will discuss the basic geometric and trigonometric functions and measurements
because they are important in transportation engineering for the functional design of facilities,
including roadways, railroads, and intersection sight distance.

                                                 Learning Objectives

   At the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to do the following:
           Recognize, rearrange, and simplify trigonometric functions.
           Apply properties of triangles to solve for sides and angles.
           Identify transportation engineering topics where the properties of triangles and trigonometric
              functions are used.
           Identify topics in the introductory transportation engineering courses that build on the concepts
              discussed in this chapter.

RELEVANCE TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING COURSEWORK
This section will explain horizontal straight road sections, curves, and spiral transition sections that
connect them.

Horizontal Profile

        Transportation engineers apply the trigonometric functions discussed here in the process of
        designing roads, and in particular, their horizontal profiles. The horizontal profile describes
        the horizontal straight road sections, curves, and spiral transition sections (see Figure 1) that
        connect them. The curves' geometric design elements depend on principles discussed in the
        following sections of this chapter: "Radians & Degrees", "Solving Similar Triangles",
        "Introduction to the Trigonometric Ratios", "The Trig Functions & Right Triangle Trig Ratios",
        "Solving for a Side in a Right Triangle Using the Trigonometric Ratios", and "The Inverse
        Trigonometric Functions". For details of the design process (discussed in the Fundamentals of
        Transportation Engineering course) please review the above section titled "Elements of Simple
        Circular Curves".

                                                                                    FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 7

         Stopping Sight Distance on Horizontal Curves

        The stopping sight distance (SSD) is the minimum distance a driver needs to perceive an
        unusual situation, such as a deer crossing the road, and stop to avoid a collision. Along
        horizontal curves, the driver's line of sight may be obstructed by trees or other roadside
        objects (see Figure 2). The formula for computing the minimum required SSD on horizontal
        curves near sight obstructions is derived using the principles discussed in the following
        sections: "Radians & Degrees", "Solving Similar Triangles", "Introduction to the Trigonometric
        Ratios", "The Trig Functions & Right Triangle Trig Ratios", "Solving for a Side in a Right
        Triangle Using the Trigonometric Ratios", and "The Inverse Trigonometric Functions".

         Sight Triangles at Intersections

        When approaching an intersection, drivers should be able to see it from a distance to be able to
        stop in time before colliding with other approaching vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. This
        distance is computed by first constructing "sight triangles" similar to the one shown in Figure 3.
        The sight triangle computations are made using the principle of similar triangles (see the section
        titled "Solving Similar Triangles" above).

                                                                                    FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 9

   Key Takeaways

           Transportation engineers apply trigonometric functions to design roads and railroad tracks,
              particularly their horizontal profiles. Knowledge of these functions is critical to ensuring that on
              segments with horizontal curvature (or bend around the corner), road users have adequate sight
              distance available to negotiate the curve on the travel way safely.

           The knowledge of trigonometry is also critical to solving intersection sight triangles and
              estimating Intersection Sight Distance (ISD) required to safely navigate the intersections.

CHAPTER 2: POLYNOMIAL, EXPONENTIAL, AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS

Because polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions have several applications in transport
engineering, this chapter will explain the functions. The exponential functions are used to model
economic and population growth and to estimate the compound interest formula. Simplifying
polynomial expressions and solving corresponding equations is helpful in the design of
transportation facilities and understanding the relationship(s) between flow, speed, and density on
roadway segments. Logarithmic functions are also sometimes used to model the relationship between
traffic speed and density on a roadway segment, where the speed decreases as the density increases.
Understanding the properties of these functions also provide a foundation to learn differential and
integral calculus for these functions (See Chapter 4).

                                                 Learning Objectives

   At the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to do the following:
           Generate graphs and charts from exponential and logarithmic functions.
           Solve the exponential and logarithmic equations.
           Visualize polynomial functions on a graph or chart.
           Set up and solve polynomial equations.
           Identify topics in the introductory transportation engineering courses that build on the concepts
              discussed in this chapter.

GENERATE GRAPHS AND CHARTS FROM EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC
FUNCTIONS
This section will explain exponential growth functions, exponential and logarithmic functions,
exponential graphs, graphing exponential growth and decay, and introduce you to logarithms with
videos to help your comprehension. Also, short problems to check your understanding are included.

RELEVANCE TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING COURSEWORK
This section explains the relevance of engineering economics, traffic assignment, vertical curve
design, and traffic flow to transportation engineering coursework.

24 AHMED FARID
     Engineering Economics

    Engineering economics is the application of economic analysis methods to quantify benefits
    and costs to assist in the decision-making process. The decisions are related to transportation
    engineering alternative designs (e.g., constructing a stop-controlled intersection or a
    roundabout), prioritization of transportation projects, and maintenance budgets, among others.
    In engineering economics, the time value of money (present value of money and future value
    of money) and interest rate, also known as the discount rate, need to be considered to provide
    meaningful Benefit-Cost B/C analysis. The analysis includes the compound interest formula
    and the exponential growth of money. Exponential functions are also used to model the
    depreciation of assets. Relevant exponential functions are described in the section titled
    "Generate Graphs and Charts from Exponential and Logarithmic Functions" of this chapter.

     Traffic Assignment

    In the 4-step travel demand modeling process, traffic assignment is typically the last step, which
    is used to estimate the number of trips on each route of the roadway network. A critical part of
    traffic assignment is the Link Performance Function for each route, which defines travel time
    as a function of the number of users on a route. Travel time increases exponentially as traffic
    volume increases and is defined based on functional forms discussed in "Generate Graphs and
    Charts from Exponential and Logarithmic Functions".

     Vertical Curve Design

    In highway engineering, one of the fundamental design elements is the vertical profile (i.e.,
    the upgrades, the downgrades, and the curves that connect consecutive roadway sections with
    different grades, also known as the vertical curves). The vertical curve's elevation is defined
    as a quadratic equation, a special type of polynomial function (see "Solve the Exponential and
    Logarithmic Equations" above).

     Relationship among Traffic Flow, Speed, and Density

    In traffic flow theory for uninterrupted flow facilities (such as freeways), the fundamental
    relationship relates speed and density on the segment with the flow rate past a point on the
    road segment. The decrease in speed as segment density increases may be modeled using
    linear, polynomial, or logarithmic functions. The nature of speed-density functions may be
    used to model relationships between the flow rate and density and/or the flow rate and speed.
    Polynomial and Logarithmic functions discussed in this chapter are critical to this analysis.

Key Takeaways

        Exponential functions are useful for transportation practitioners in applying the compound
          interest formula and modeling asset depreciation and population growth rate in engineering
          economics.

        Exponential functions are also used in defining link performance functions in traffic assignment to

                                                                             FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 25
              model travel time as a function of road users on a network route
           Logarithmic functions are sometimes used to define speed as a function of roadway segment

              density.
           Polynomial functions are used in several applications, including the equation of parabolic curves

              connecting two consecutive grades on a roadway segment.
           Speed-flow and flow-density relationships on roadway segments are often also defined as

              polynomial functions.

CHAPTER 3: SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS

The ability to solve systems of multiple equations is a critical component of an introductory
transportation course. Systems of equations are helpful in several key transportation analyses,
including travel demand estimation (e.g., traffic assignment), design (e.g., roadway alignment), and
operations (e.g., speed-density relationships). This chapter highlights how to solve systems of
equations with two variables, three variables, and when no solution occurs. It will also explain how to
use Microsoft Excel to solve system equations.

RELEVANCE TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING COURSEWORK
This section explains the relevance of traffic assignment and operation along with highway design to
transportation engineering coursework.

34 AHMED FARID
     Traffic Assignment

    In travel demand modeling process, the last step is the traffic assignment for routes, which
    involves estimating the number of trips made on each route on the roadway network. Two
    commonly applied traffic assignment approaches, which involve solving a system of equations,
    are the user equilibrium (UE) and system optimal (SO) assignments. For simple UE problems
    helpful in conceptual understanding of these approaches, the system of equations is typically
    linear. The number of variables to solve for depends on the number of routes being considered
    for traffic assignment. The reader is referred to the above section titled "Solving Systems of
    Equations with Two Variables" for solving a system of linear equations with two variables
    and the section titled "Systems of Equations in Microsoft Excel" for solving a system of linear
    equations with three variables. For solving a system with more than three variables one requires
    use of computer-based tools which are discussed in "Systems of Equations in Microsoft Excel".

     Highway Design

    Analysis and design of roadway (or railway) elements, particularly horizontal alignment and
    vertical profiles, often require solving a system of equations. These equations are set up based
    on the geometric constraints of the design. For example, the roadway elevation at a certain
    location may be fixed due to an intersecting element. These constraints are used to set up
    system of simultaneous equations that require the use of methods discussed in the three
    previous sections in this chapter for solving them.

     Traffic Operations

    The relationships between highway speed, lane density (a measure of congestion), and traffic
    flow (number of vehicles past a point) are governed by a universal relationship of uninterrupted
    flow, i.e., flow rate is a multiple of speed and density. In addition, different segments are
    characterized by certain relationships between any of the variable pairs (i.e., speed-density;
    speed-flow; or flow-density). These relationships help set up equations for key parameters for
    roadway segments such as capacity flow rate, jam density, and free flow speed.

Key Takeaways

        There are two main approaches to traffic assignment in the travel demand modeling process: user
          equilibrium (UE) and system optimal (SO). Both of these approaches involve solving a system of
          equations to determine the number of trips that will be made on each route.

        In highway design equations that help ensure that the final design meets all necessary requirements
          and constraints need to be solved using the methods described in the chapter.

        In traffic operations, different segments of roadways with uninterrupted flow may have different
          relationships between speed, flow, and density, and these relationships can be used to set up
          equations for important parameters such as capacity flow rate, jam density, and free flow speed.

                                                                             FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 35

CHAPTER 4: CALCULUS - INTERPRETATION AND METHODS FOR
INTEGRATION AND DIFFERENTIATION

This chapter discusses the interpretation of derivatives that helps to understand the origin of formulas
for estimating values for roadway elevation along the vertical curve. Understanding derivatives as
a rate of change can also help with traffic operations (e.g., capacity as a maximum flow point) and
transportation economics (e.g., marginal costs and congestion pricing). Integrals are used to estimate
the area under a given curve. This property of integrals is used in estimating earthwork volumes and
quantifying aggregate delays at intersections or roadway segments with incidents.

                                                 Learning Objectives

   At the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to do the following:
           Interpret derivatives as the rate of change.
           Differentiate various functions with single variables.
           Familiarize oneself with the rules and processes (e.g., chain rule, multiplication rule) of derivation.
           Use the integration method for estimating the area under a curve.
           Describe the process of integration and differentiation in correspondence with each other.
           Identify topics in the introductory transportation engineering courses that build on the concepts
              discussed in this chapter.

INTERPRET DERIVATIVES AS THE RATE OF CHANGE
In this section, you will learn about derivatives, tangent slopes, tangent lines, quotient rule, chain
rule and power rule by watching the videos. Also, short problems to check your understanding are
included.

RELEVANCE TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING COURSEWORK
This section explains the relevance of designing vertical curves, estimating congestion pricing
schedules, traffic operations and roadway capacity, and estimating aggregate delays in transportation
engineering coursework.

         Design of Vertical Curves

        In roadway design, one grade or slope is connected with the next grade (For example, an
        upgrade of 3% and a downgrade of 2%) using a parabolic curve defined by a quadratic equation.
        First-order derivatives of these equations are used to define the highest or lowest point on
        these curves. If the road is being transitioned from an uphill to a downhill (or vice versa),
        then the highest point (or lowest point) also represents the point at which the slope is zero.
        Furthermore, the second derivative of the quadratic equation is a constant, i.e., independent
        of one's location on the curve. It provides for a smooth transition at a constant rate between
        the two grades. In this chapter, the sections titled "Interpret Derivatives as the Rate of Change"
        and "Differentiate Various Functions with Single Variables" provided the details on materials
        relevant to differentiating polynomials.

         Estimating Congestion Pricing Schedules

        The idea of congestion pricing is to direct roadway users to use transportation network
        elements (i.e., routes) that would minimize costs (in the form of travel times) for all road users.
        Developing a fundamental understanding of this idea requires the first-order differential of the

                                                                                  FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 57
        function for the costs incurred by all road users to be set to zero. In this chapter, the sections
        titled "Interpret Derivatives as the Rate of Change" and "Differentiate Various Functions with
        Single Variables" provide the details on the relevant materials.

         Traffic Operations and Roadway Capacity

        Roadway capacity is defined as the maximum flow rate across a point on the roadway segment.
        It is defined based on the maxima of speed-flow or speed-density relationships. The maxima is
        found by setting the first derivative of a speed-density (or speed-flow) relationship to zero. In
        this chapter, the sections titled "Interpret Derivatives as the Rate of Change" and "Differentiate
        Various Functions with Single Variables" provide the relevant background for this application.

         Earthwork Volumes

        Roadway construction often requires earthwork, i.e., the addition or removal of material from
        the sites. The design process yields the roadway elevation and cross-section along a segment.
        These point locations are then used to estimate the aggregate earthwork volume using the
        principles described in the section titled "Use the Integration Method for Estimating the Area
        Under a Curve" of this chapter.

         Estimating Aggregate Delays

        The estimation of aggregate delays requires the estimation of the area under the curve for the
        input-output diagrams. These diagrams have time on the x-axis and the number of road users
        entering/exiting a roadway location on the y-axis. The time of entrance for a road user defies
        the input curve, while the time of exit defines the output curve. The area between the two curves
        defines the aggregate delay for the roadway entity under consideration (i.e., an intersection or
        roadway segment). The above section titled "Use the Integration Method for Estimating the
        Area Under a Curve" provides the details needed for this chapter.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

   Key Takeaways

           The interpretation of first-order derivative as a rate of change and definition of maxima or minima
              of function as points where this derivative is equal to zero is critical to several transport
              applications. It is used in roadway design for a smooth transition between grades, minimization of
              total user costs via congestion pricing, and estimating roadway capacity based on speed-flow or
              flow-density relationships.

           Integration of a function over a defined interval may be interpreted as the area under the curve.
              This interpretation is used to estimate the volume of earthwork required, which is a common
              aspect of roadway construction. This information is important for anticipating the resources and
              equipment needed for planning and budgeting purposes. The same interpretation of integral as
              area under the curve is used to estimate the area under the input-output diagrams in traffic
              operations to estimate aggregate delay on intersections and roadway locations as well

CHAPTER 5: MOTION AND FORCES

This chapter discusses the basic elements of accelerated motion and motion at constant speed to help
estimate braking distance and safe travel speeds. Concepts of motion along a straight line are also
helpful in estimating headways and flow rates on the facilities. Accelerated motion along a circular
path provides a conceptual understanding of roadway superelevation (or banking; also see Chapter 6).
This chapter also describes forces acting on static objects. An understanding of friction forces and
normal reactions is critical to transportation infrastructure design. The gravity model is useful as
a prerequisite to understanding the dynamics of travel demand (trip distribution between traffic
analysis zones (TAZs)).

                                                 Learning Objectives

   At the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to do the following:
           Describe the gravity model.
           Estimate the friction force and Normal Reaction on a static object.
           Describe the motion of an object in the graphic form through the time-space diagram.
           Use kinematic equations to solve for displacement, time, velocity, and acceleration of an object.
           Describe the motion of an object along a circular path.
           Identify topics in the introductory transportation engineering courses that build on the concepts
              discussed in this chapter.

UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS

         Physical Quantities and Units

        We define a physical quantity either by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is
        calculated from other measurements. For example, we define distance and time by specifying
        methods for measuring them, whereas we define average speed by stating that it is calculated
        as distance traveled divided by time of travel.
        Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized
        values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in
        units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for distance runners). Without standardized units,
        it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a
        meaningful way.

                                                                                  FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 63
There are two major systems of units used in the world: SI units (also known as the metric
system) and English units (also known as the customary or imperial system). English units
were historically used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used in
the United States. Virtually every other country in the world now uses SI units as the standard;
the metric system is also the standard system agreed upon by scientists and mathematicians.
The acronym "SI" is derived from the French Systme International.

SI Units of Time, Length, and Mass

SI units are part of the metric system. Metric systems have the advantage that conversions of
units involve base-10 number system. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in
a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the system of U.S. customary units, the
relationships are not as simple--there are 12 inches in a foot, 5280 feet in a mile, and so on.

Length     Mass           Time
Meter (m)  Kilogram (kg)  Second (s)

It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. Let us consider a simple
example of how to convert units. Let us say that we want to convert 80 meters (m) to kilometers
(km). The first thing to do is to list the units that you have and the units that you want to convert
to. In this case, we have units in meters, and we want to convert to kilometers.

Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion
factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there
are 12 inches in 1 foot, 100 centimeters in 1 meter, 60 seconds in 1 minute, and so on. In this
case, we know that there are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.

Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply
them by the conversion factor so that the units cancel out, as shown:

        Note that the "m" unit cancels, leaving only the desired "km" unit. You can use this method to
        convert between any types of units.

         Displacement

        Position:

        To describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to describe its position--where it is
        at any particular time. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient
        reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of
        an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch
        would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to the Earth as a whole,
        while a professor's position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby
        white board. (See Figure 1). In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but

64 AHMED FARID
are in motion relative to the Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for
example, we use the airplane, not the Earth, as the reference frame. (See Figure 2).

Figure 1: A professor paces left and right while lecturing. Her position relative to the blackboard is given

by x. The               displacement of the professor relative to the blackboard is represented by an arrow

pointing to the right.

                        FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 65
                          Figure 2: A passenger moves from his seat to the back of the plane. His location relative to the
                          airplane is given by x. The -4 m displacement of the passenger relative to the plane is represented
                          by an arrow toward the rear of the plane. Notice that the arrow representing his displacement is
                          twice as long as the arrow representing the displacement of the professor (he moves twice as far)
                          in Figure 1.

        Displacement:

        If an object moves relative to a reference frame (for example, if a professor moves to the right
        relative to a white board or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane), then the object's
        position changes. This change in position is known as displacement. The word "displacement"
        implies that an object has moved or has been displaced.

        Displacement is the change in position of an object:

        Where is displacement, is the final position, and is the initial position.

        The Greek letter (delta) means "change in" whatever quantity follows it; thus, means
        change in position. Always solve for displacement by subtracting initial position from final
        position .

        Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter (m), but sometimes kilometers, miles, feet,
        and other units of length are used. Keep in mind that when units other than the meter are used
        in a problem, you may need to convert them into meters to complete the calculation.

        Note that displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude. The professor's displacement is
        2.0 m to the right, and the airline passenger's displacement is 4.0 m toward the rear. In one-
        dimensional motion, direction can be specified with a plus or minus sign. When you begin a

66 AHMED FARID
problem, you should select which direction is positive (usually that will be to the right or up,

but you are free to select positive as being any direction). The professor's initial position is

and her final position is  . Thus, her displacement is

In this coordinate system, motion to the right is positive, whereas motion to the left is negative.

Similarly, the airplane passenger's initial position is  and his final position is

so his displacement is

    His displacement is negative because his motion is toward the rear of the plane, or in the
    negative x direction in our coordinate system.

    Distance

    Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is not. Distance is defined
    to be the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions. Note that the distance
    between two positions is different from the distance traveled between them. Distance traveled
    is the total length of the path traveled between two positions. Distance has no direction and,
    thus, no sign. For example, the distance the professor walks is 2.0 m. The distance the airplane
    passenger walks is 4.0 m.

Vectors, Scalars, and Coordinate Systems

What is the difference between distance and displacement? Whereas displacement is defined
by both direction and magnitude, distance is defined only by magnitude. Displacement is an
example of a vector quantity. Distance is an example of a scalar quantity. A vector is any
quantity with both magnitude and direction. Other examples of vectors include a velocity of 90
km/h east and a force of 500 newtons straight down.

The direction of a vector in one-dimensional motion is given simply by a plus (+) or minus (-)
sign. Vectors are represented graphically by arrows. An arrow used to represent a vector has
a length proportional to the vector's magnitude (e.g., the larger the magnitude, the longer the
length of the vector) and points in the same direction as the vector.

                                                                     FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 67
Some physical quantities, like distance, either have no direction or none is specified. A scalar

is any quantity that has a magnitude, but no direction. For example, a  temperature, the

250 kilocalories (250 Calories) of energy in a candy bar, a 90 km/h speed limit, a person's 1.8

m height, and a distance of 2.0 m are all scalars - quantities with no specified direction. Note,

however, that a scalar can be negative, such as  temperature. In this case, the minus sign

indicates a point on a scale rather than a direction. Scalars are never represented by arrows.

Coordinate Systems for One-Dimensional Motion

To describe the direction of a vector quantity, you must designate a coordinate system within
the reference frame. For one-dimensional motion, this is a simple coordinate system consisting
of a one-dimensional coordinate line. In general, when describing horizontal motion, motion
to the right is usually considered positive, and motion to the left is considered negative. With
vertical motion, motion up is usually positive, and motion down is negative. In some cases,
however, as with the jet in Figure 3 below, it can be more convenient to switch the positive and
negative directions. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of falling objects, it can be
useful to define downwards as the positive direction. If people in a race are running to the left,
it is useful to define left as the positive direction. It does not matter as long as the system is clear
and consistent. Once you assign a positive direction and start solving a problem, you cannot
change it.

                   Figure 3: It is usually convenient to consider motion upward or to the right as positive (+) and motion
                   downward or to the left as negative (-)

TIME, VELOCITY, SPEED, AND ACCELERATION

In this section, you will learn about time, velocity, speed and acceleration along with motion graphs
and motion diagrams by reading each description. Also, short problems to check your understanding
are included.

         Describe the Motion of an Object in the Graphic Form through the Time-Space Diagram
                  Time, Velocity, and Speed, Acceleration

                In physics, the definition of time is simple -- time is change, or the interval over which
                change occurs. It is impossible to know that time has passed unless something changes.
                The amount of time or change is calibrated by comparison with a standard. The SI unit
                for time is the second, abbreviated s. We might, for example, observe that a certain
                pendulum makes one full swing every 0.75 s. We could then use the pendulum to measure
                time by counting its swings or, of course, by connecting the pendulum to a clock
                mechanism that registers time on a dial. This allows us to not only measure the amount
                of time, but also to determine a sequence of events.

                How does time relate to motion? We are usually interested in elapsed time for a
                particular motion, such as how long it takes an airplane passenger to get from his seat to
                the back of the plane. To find elapsed time, we note the time at the beginning and end of
                the motion and subtract the two. For example, a lecture may start at 11:00 A.M. and end
                at 11:50 A.M., so that the elapsed time would be 50 min. Elapsed time t is the difference
                between the ending time and beginning time,

                Where is the change in time or elapsed time, is the time at the end of the motion,
                and is the time at the beginning of the motion. (As usual, the delta symbol, , means
                the change in the quantity that follows it.)

                Velocity:

                Your notion of velocity is probably the same as its scientific definition. You know that if
                you have a large displacement in a small amount of time you have a large velocity, and
                that velocity has units of distance divided by time, such as miles per hour or kilometers
                per hour.

                Average velocity is displacement (change in position divided by the time of travel,

                Where is the average (indicated by the bar over the v) velocity, is the change in
                position (or displacement), and and are the final and beginning positions at times

                    and , respectively. If the starting time is taken to be zero, the average velocity is
                simply

                                                                                  FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 69
                Notice that this definition indicates that velocity is a vector because displacement is a
                vector. It has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit for velocity is meters per second
                or m/s, but many other units, such as km/h, mi/h (also written as mph), and cm/s, are in
                common use. Suppose, for example, an airplane passenger took 5 seconds to move -4 m
                (the minus sign indicates that displacement is toward the back of the plane). His average
                velocity would be

                The minus sign indicates the average velocity is also toward the rear of the plane.
                The average velocity of an object does not tell us anything about what happens to it
                between the starting point and ending point, however. For example, we cannot tell from
                average velocity whether the airplane passenger stops momentarily or backs up before he
                goes to the back of the plane. To get more details, we must consider smaller segments of
                the trip over smaller time intervals.

                               Figure 4: A more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the back of
                               the plane, showing smaller segments of his trip.

                The smaller the time intervals considered in a motion, the more detailed the information.
                When we carry this process to its logical conclusion, we are left with an infinitesimally
                small interval. Over such an interval, the average velocity becomes the instantaneous
                velocity or the velocity at a specific instant. A car's speedometer, for example, shows the
                magnitude (but not the direction) of the instantaneous velocity of the car. (Police give
                tickets based on instantaneous velocity, but when calculating how long it will take to get
                from one place to another on a road trip, you need to use average velocity.) Instantaneous
                velocity v is the average velocity at a specific instant in time (or over an infinitesimally
                small-time interval).
                Speed:

70 AHMED FARID
In everyday language, most people use the terms "speed" and "velocity" interchangeably.
In physics, however, they do not have the same meaning and they are distinct concepts.
One major difference is that speed has no direction. Thus, speed is a scalar. Just as we
need to distinguish between instantaneous velocity and average velocity, we also need to
distinguish between instantaneous speed and average speed.
Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity. For example, suppose
the airplane passenger at one instant had an instantaneous velocity of -3.0 m/s (the minus
meaning toward the rear of the plane). At that same time, his instantaneous speed was
3.0 m/s. Or suppose that at one time during a shopping trip your instantaneous velocity
is 40 km/h due north. Your instantaneous speed at that instant would be 40 km/h--the
same magnitude but without a direction. Average speed, however, is vastly different from
average velocity. Average speed is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time.
We have noted that distance traveled can be greater than displacement. So average speed
can be greater than average velocity, which is displacement divided by time. For example,
if you drive to a store and return home in half an hour, and your car's odometer shows
the total distance traveled was 6 km, then your average speed was 12 km/h. Your average
velocity, however, was zero, because your displacement for the round trip is zero.
(Displacement is change in position and, thus, is zero for a round trip.) Thus, average
speed is not simply the magnitude of average velocity.

Figure 5: During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance traveled is 6 km. The average speed is
12 km/h. The displacement for the round trip is zero since there was no net change in position. Thus, the
average velocity is zero.

Another way of visualizing the motion of an object is to use a graph. A plot of position or
of velocity as a function of time can be extremely useful. For example, for this trip to the
store, the position, velocity, and speed-vs.-time graphs are displayed in Figures 6-8. (Note
that these graphs depict a very simplified model of the trip. We are assuming that speed is
constant during the trip, which is unrealistic given that we will probably stop at the store.
But for simplicity's sake, we will model it with no stops or changes in speed. We are also
assuming that the route between the store and the house is a perfectly straight line.)

72 AHMED FARID
Acceleration:

In everyday conversation, to accelerate means to speed up. The accelerator in a car can in
fact cause it to speed up. The greater the acceleration, the greater the change in velocity
over a given time. The formal definition of acceleration is consistent with these notions,
but more inclusive.

Average Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes,

Where is average acceleration, v is velocity, and t is time.

Because acceleration is velocity in m/s divided by time in s, the SI units for acceleration

are  meters per second squared or meters per second per second, which means by

how many meters per second the velocity changes every second.

Recall that velocity is a vector--it has both magnitude and direction. This means that a
change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or speed), but it can also be a change in
direction. For example, if a car turns a corner at constant speed, it is accelerating because
its direction is changing. The quicker you turn, the greater the acceleration. So, there is an
acceleration when velocity changes either in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed)
or in direction, or both.

Keep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, it
is not always in the direction of motion. When an object's acceleration is in the same
direction of its motion, the object will speed up. However, when an object's acceleration
is opposite to the direction of its motion, the object will slow down. Speeding up and
slowing down should not be confused with a positive and negative acceleration.

Instantaneous Acceleration

Instantaneous acceleration a, or the acceleration at a specific instant in time, is obtained

by the same process as discussed for instantaneous velocity, that is by considering an

infinitesimally small interval of time. How do we find instantaneous acceleration using

only algebra? The answer is that we choose an average acceleration that is representative

of the motion. Figure 9 shows graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for

two quite different motions. In (a) the acceleration varies slightly and the average over

the entire interval is nearly the same as the instantaneous acceleration at any time. In

this case, we should treat this motion as if it had a constant acceleration equal to the

average (in this case about  . In (b) the acceleration varies drastically over time.

In such situations it is best to consider smaller time intervals and choose an average

acceleration for each. For example, we could consider motion over the time intervals

from 0 to 1.0 s and from 1.0 to 3.0 s as separate motions with accelerations of

                             , respectively.

                    Here acceleration varies only slightly and is always in the same direction since it is positive. The average
                    over the interval is nearly the same as the acceleration at any given time. (b) Here the acceleration varies,

                    it bumps along. It is necessary to consider small time intervals (such as from 0 to 1.0 s) with constant or
                    nearly constant acceleration in such a situation.

USE KINEMATIC EQUATIONS TO SOLVE FOR DISPLACEMENT, TIME, VELOCITY AND
ACCELERATION OF AN OBJECT

In this section, you will learn how to use kinematic equations to solve for displacement, time,
velocity and acceleration of an object by reading each description. Also, short problems to check your
understanding are included.

         Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension

        We might know that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving away from a stop sign,
        the greater the displacement in a given time. But we have not developed a specific equation that
        relates acceleration and displacement. In this section, we develop some convenient equations
        for kinematic relationships.

Notation: t, x, v, a

First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to be zero, as

if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great simplification. Since elapsed time is

                                                       the final time on the stopwatch. When

initial time is taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of position and

velocity. That is, is the initial position and , is the initial velocity. We put no subscripts on the

final values. The is, t is the final time, x is the final position, and v is final velocity. This gives a simpler

expression for elapsed time - now,  . It also simplifies the expression for displacement,

which is now          . Also, it simplifies the expression for change in velocity, which is

now                   . To summarize, using the simplified notation, with the initial time taken to

be zero,

                      FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 75
Where the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript denotes a final value in
whatever motion is under consideration.

We now make the important assumption that acceleration is constant. This assumption allows
us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the
average and instantaneous accelerations are equal. That is,

So, we use the symbol a for acceleration at all times. Assuming acceleration to be constant does
not seriously limit the situations we can study nor degrade the accuracy of our treatment.
For one thing, acceleration is constant in a considerable number of situations. Furthermore, in
many other situations we can accurately describe motion by assuming a constant acceleration
equal to the average acceleration for that motion. Finally, in motions where acceleration
changes drastically, such as a car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, the
motion can be considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant acceleration.

Solving for Displacement (     ) and the Final Position (x) from Average Velocity when
Acceleration (a) is Constant.

To get our first two new equations, we start with the definition of average velocity:

Substituting the simplified notation for           yields

Solving for x yields
Where the average velocity is, with constant a

The equation    reflects the fact that, when acceleration is constant, v is just the simple

average of the initial and final velocities. For example, if you steadily increase your velocity

(that is, with constant acceleration) from 30 to 60 km/h, then your average velocity during

this steady increase is 45 km/h. Using the equation        , we see that

                                                .

The equation    gives insight into the relationship between displacement, average

velocity, and time. It shows, for example, that displacement is a linear function of average

velocity. (By linear function, we mean that displacement depends on rather than on raised

to some other power, such as . When graphed, linear functions look like straight lines with a

90 km/h than if we average 45 km/h.

Solving for Final Velocity:

We can derive another useful equation by manipulating the definition of acceleration.

Substituting the simplified notation for  gives us (constant a)

Solving for v yields (constant a)

In addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation                        gives us insight into

the relationships among velocity, acceleration, and time. From it we can see, for example that

 Final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and how long it lasts

 If the acceleration is zero, then the final velocity equals the initial velocity  , as

expected (i.e., velocity is constant)

 If a is negative, then the final velocity is less than the initial velocity.

Solving for Final Position when Velocity is Not Constant
We can combine the equations above to find a third equation that allows us to calculate the final
position of an object experiencing constant acceleration. We start with

Adding to each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives

Since           for constant acceleration, then

Now we substitute this expression for into the equation for displacement,                ,

yielding (constant a)

What else can we learn by examining the equation                         ? We see that:

 Displacement depends on the square of the elapsed time when acceleration is not zero.
 If acceleration is zero, then the initial velocity equals average velocity

Solving for Final Velocity when Velocity is not Constant

A fourth useful equation can be obtained from another algebraic manipulation of previous
equations.

If we solve            , we get

Substituting this and  into                       , we get (constant a)

An examination of the equation                    can produce further insights into the
general relationships among physical quantities:

               The final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and the distance over which it
                  acts

               For a fixed deceleration, a car that is going twice as fast does not simply stop in twice the
                  distance - it takes much further to stop. (This is why we have reduced speed zones near
                  schools).

Weight ( or W)        type
Tension ( or T)
Normal force ( or N)  Long   Force from gravity acting on an object with mass. Sometime called force of gravity.
Friction ( or f)      range  Pulls towards the Earth (down) always.

                      Contact Force of something pulling on an object. Can be caused by a string, rope, chain, cord, cable, or wire. Pulls along the direction of the rope on the object.

                      Contact Force between two objects when they touch. Pushes perpendicularly to the object's surface.

                      Contact Force resisting sliding between surfaces. Pushes parallel to the contact surface and in the opposite direction of sliding.

How to make a free body diagram:

     1. Start by identifying the contact forces. Let us look for what the object is touching by
         outlining the object (see Figure 11). Draw a dot where something touches the outline;
         where there is a dot, there must be at least one contact force. Draw the force vectors at
         the contact points to represent how they push or pull on the object (including correct
         direction).

             Figure 11: Contact force identification for a block of cheese resting on a ramp.

             2. After we have identified the contact forces, draw a dot to represent the object we are
                  interested in (see Figure 12 in example). We only want to find the forces acting on our
                  object and not forces the object exerts on other objects.

             3. Draw a coordinate system and label the positive directions. If the object is on an
                  incline, then align the axes with the incline.

             4. Draw the contact forces on the dot with an arrow pointing away from the dot. Make
                  sure the arrow lengths are relatively proportional to each other. Label all forces.

             5. Draw and label our long-range forces. This will usually be weight unless there is
                  electric charge or magnetism involved.

             6. Draw and label your acceleration vector off to the side of the dot - not touching the

80 AHMED FARID
dot. If there is no acceleration, then write  .

Here is an example of a free body diagram for a block of cheese resting on a table (See Figure
12). Gravity pulls down on the cheese's mass with weight (W) and the table pushes up on the
cheese with a normal force (N). Since there are no ropes and the cheese is not trying to slide,
there is no tension or friction.

           Figure 12: The free body diagram for a block of cheese resting on a table has normal force N up, weight W down,
           and no acceleration.

    Common mistakes and misconceptions
          1. Sometimes people draw the forces of the object acting on other things. We only want to
              draw the forces pushing or pulling on our object. Only focus on what is happening to
              the object of interest.
          2. Sometimes people forget the directions of the different types of forces. Weight is always
              down, friction is always parallel to the contact surface, normal force is always
              perpendicular to the contact surface, and tension only pulls.

ESTIMATE THE FRICTION FORCE AND NORMAL REACTION ON A STATIC OBJECT
In this section, you will learn how estimate the friction force and normal reaction on a static object
and learn about kinetic and static friction forces by reading each description along with watching the
videos. Also, short problems to check your understanding are included.

         Normal Force

        If the force supporting a load is perpendicular to the surface of contact between the load and
        its support, this force is defined to be a normal force and is given the symbol N (different from
        newton). The word normal means perpendicular to a surface.

         Friction

        Friction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in contact. One of the simpler
        characteristics of friction is that it is parallel to the contact surface between systems and always
        in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each other. If
        two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them
        is called kinetic friction. For example, friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice. But when
        objects are stationary, static friction can act between them; the static friction is usually greater
        than the kinetic friction between the objects.
        As seen in Table 1 below, the coefficients of kinetic friction are less than their static
        counterparts. The equations explained below include the dependence of friction on materials
        and the normal force.

FORCES AND NEWTON'S LAWS
In this section, you will learn about Newton's three laws of motion along with laws of gravitation
by reading each description along with watching the videos. Also, short problems to check your
understanding are included.

         Newton's 3 Laws of Motion
                  Newton's First Law of Motion

                There exists an inertial frame of reference such that a body at rest remains at rest, or,
                if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external
                force.

                The first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one frame of reference which
                we call an inertial reference frame, relative to which the motion of an object not subject
                to forces is a straight line at a constant speed. An inertial reference frame is any reference

84 AHMED FARID
frame that is not itself accelerating. A car traveling at constant velocity is an inertial
reference frame. A car slowing down for a stoplight, or speeding up after the light turns
green, will be accelerating and is not an inertial reference frame. Finally, when the car
goes around a turn, which is due to an acceleration changing the direction of the velocity
vector, it is not an inertial reference frame. Note that Newton's laws of motion are only
valid for inertial reference frames.

Rather than contradicting our experience, Newton's first law of motion states that there
must be a cause (which is a net external force) for there to be any change in velocity
(either a change in magnitude or direction) in an inertial reference frame. An object
sliding across a table or floor slows down due to the net force of friction acting on the
object.

The idea of cause and effect is crucial in accurately describing what happens in various
situations. For example, consider what happens to an object sliding along a rough
horizontal surface. The object quickly grinds to a halt. If we spray the surface with talcum
powder to make the surface smoother, the object slides farther. If we make the surface
even smoother by rubbing lubricating oil on it, the object slides farther yet. Extrapolating
to a frictionless surface, we can imagine the object sliding in a straight line indefinitely.
Friction is thus the cause of the slowing (consistent with Newton's first law). The object
would not slow down at all if friction were completely eliminated. Consider an air hockey
table. When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction
slows it to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it creates a nearly frictionless
surface, and the puck glides long distances without slowing down. Additionally, if we
know enough about the friction, we can accurately predict how quickly the object will
slow down. Friction is an external force.

Mass: The property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant
velocity is called inertia. Newton's first law is often called the law of inertia. As we
know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. It is obviously more
difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball, for example.
The inertia of an object is measured by its mass.

An object with a small mass will exhibit less inertia and be more affected by other objects.
An object with a large mass will exhibit greater inertia and be less affected by other
objects. This inertial mass of an object is a measure of how difficult it is to alter the
uniform motion of the object by an external force.

Roughly speaking, mass is a measure of the amount of "stuff" (or matter) in something.
The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined by the numbers of atoms and
molecules of several types it contains. Unlike weight, mass does not vary with location.
The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon. In
practice, it is exceedingly difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in
an object, so masses are not often determined in this manner. Operationally, the masses
of objects are determined by comparison with the standard kilogram.

Newton's Second Law of Motion

Newton's second law of motion is closely related to Newton's first law of motion. It
mathematically states the cause-and-effect relationship between force and changes in
motion. Newton's second law of motion is more quantitative and is used extensively
to calculate what happens in situations involving a force. Before we can write down
Newton's second law as a simple equation giving the exact relationship of force, mass, and
acceleration, we need to sharpen some ideas that have already been mentioned.

First, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a change in motion is
equivalent to a change in velocity. A change in velocity means, by definition, that there
is an acceleration. Newton's first law says that a net external force causes a change in
motion; thus, we see that a net external force causes acceleration.

Another question immediately arises. What do we mean by an external force? An intuitive
notion of external is correct--an external force acts from outside the system of interest.
An internal force acts between elements of the system. Only external forces affect the
motion of a system, according to Newton's first law.

To obtain an equation for Newton's Second Law, we first write the relationship of
acceleration and net external force as the proportionality

Where the symbol means "proportional to," and           is the net external force. This

proportionality states acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force. Now,

it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of

the system. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration

produced by a given force. This proportionality is written as  , where m is the mass

of the system. Combining the two proportionalities just given yield's Newton's Second

Law of Motion.

                Newton's Second Law of Motion: The acceleration of a system is directly proportional
                to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system, and inversely
                proportional to its mass. In equation form, Newton's Second Law of Motion is:

86 AHMED FARID
Often written as:

Units of Force:            is used to define the units of force in terms of the three basic

units for mass, length, and time. The SI unit of force is called the newton (abbreviated N)

and is the force needed to accelerate a 1-kg system at the rate of  . That is, since

                           .

Weight and the Gravitational Force: When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward
the center of Earth. Newton's second law states that a net force on an object is responsible
for its acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on a falling object is the
gravitational force, commonly called its weight w.

Since the object experiences only the downward force of gravity,                                          . We know

that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is     . Substituting these into

Newton's Second Law gives     . Since                    on Earth, the weight of a

1.0 kg object on Earth is 9.81N, as we see:                                                               .

When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in free-fall. That is,
the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity. In the real world, when objects
fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in free-fall because there is always some
upward force from the air acting on the object.

Common misconceptions: Mass vs. Weight: It is important to be aware that weight and
mass are very different physical quantities, although they are closely related. Mass is the
quantity of matter (how much "stuff") and does not vary in classical physics, whereas
weight is the gravitational force and does vary depending on gravity. It is tempting to
equate the two, since most of our examples take place on Earth, where the weight of an
object only varies a little with the location of the object.

                  Newton's Third Law of Motion

                Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force
                that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.
                This law represents a certain symmetry in nature: Forces always occur in pairs, and one
                body cannot exert a force on another without experiencing a force itself. We sometimes
                refer to this law loosely as "action-reaction," where the force exerted is the action and the
                force experienced as a consequence is the reaction. Newton's third law has practical uses
                in analyzing the origin of forces and understanding which forces are external to a system.
                You might think that two equal and opposite forces would cancel, but they do not because
                they act on different systems.
                Other examples of Newton's third law are easy to find. As a professor paces in front of
                a whiteboard, she exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force
                forward on the professor that causes her to accelerate forward. Similarly, a car accelerates
                because the ground pushes forward on the drive wheels in reaction to the drive wheels
                pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward
                when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks backward.
                In another example, rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at high velocity.
                This means the rocket exerts a large backward force on the gas in the rocket combustion
                chamber, and the gas therefore exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket.
                This reaction force is called thrust. It is a common misconception that rockets propel
                themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them. They actually work
                better in a vacuum, where they can more readily expel the exhaust gases. Helicopters
                similarly create lift by pushing air down, thereby experiencing an upward reaction force.
                Birds and airplanes also fly by exerting force on air in a direction opposite to that of
                whatever force they need.

         Laws of Gravitation

                  Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation

                The gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it depends only
                on the masses involved and the distance between them. Stated in modern language,
                Newton's universal law of gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts

                  Rotation Angle and Angular Velocity

                We begin the study of uniform circular motion by defining two angular quantities
                needed to describe rotational motion.
                Rotation Angle
                When objects rotate about some axis - for example, when the CD in Figure 13 below
                rotates about its center - each point in the object follows a circular arc. Consider a line
                from the center of the CD to its edge. Each pit used to record sound along this line moves
                through the same angle in the same amount of time. The rotation angle is the amount of

90 AHMED FARID
rotation and is analogous to linear distance. We define the rotation angle  to be the
ratio of the arc length to the radius of curvature:

Figure 13: All points on a CD travel in circular arcs. The pits along a line from the center to the edge all move
through the same angle

  The arc length is the distance traveled along a circular path as shown in Figure 14
  below. Note that r is the radius of curvature of the circular path.

                                                             FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 91
                 Figure 14: The radius of a circle is rotated through an angle  . The arc length
                        is described on the circumference.

      We know that for one complete revolution, the arc length is the circumference of a circle
      of radius r. The circumference of a circle is . Thus, for one complete revolution the
      rotation angle is

      This result is the basis for defining the units used to measure rotation angles,            to be
      radians (rad), defined so that

      A comparison of some useful angles expressed in both degrees and radians is shown in

      Angular Velocity

92 AHMED FARID
How fast is an object rotating? We define angular velocity   as the rate of change of an
angle. In symbols, this is

Where an angular rotation takes place in a time . The greater the rotation angle in
a given amount of time, the greater the angular velocity. The units for angular velocity are
radians per second (rad/s).

Angular velocity is analogous to linear velocity v. To get the precise relationship
between angular and linear velocity, we again consider a pit on the rotating CD. This pit
moves an arc length in a time , and so it has a linear velocity

From  we see that          . Substituting this into the expression for v gives

We write this relationship in two different ways and gain two different insights:

The first relationship in  states that the linear velocity v is

proportional to the distance from the center of rotation, thus, it is the largest for a point

on the rim (larges r), as you might expect. We can also call this linear speed v of a point

on the rim the tangential speed. The second relationship in                        can be

illustrated by considering the tire of a moving car. Note that the speed of a point on the

rim of the tire is the same as the speed v of the car. See Figure 15 below. So, the faster the

car moves, the faster the tire spins - large v means a large , because  . Similarly,

a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity ( ) will produce a greater linear

speed (v) for the car.

            of the tire relative to the axle is v, the same as if the car were jacked up. Thus, the car moves forward at linear velocity

                          , where r is the tire radius. A larger angular velocity for the tire means a greater velocity for the car.

Circular Motion and Centripetal Acceleration
         Centripetal Force and Acceleration Intuition
         Visual Understanding of Centripetal Acceleration Formula
         Centripetal Acceleration

        We know from kinematics that acceleration is a change in velocity, either in its
        magnitude or in its direction, or both. In uniform circular motion, the direction of the
        velocity changes constantly, so there is always an associated acceleration, even though the
        magnitude of the velocity might be constant. You experience this acceleration yourself
        when you turn a corner in your car. (If you hold the wheel steady during a turn and move
        at constant speed, you are in uniform circular motion.) What you notice is a sideways
        acceleration because you and the car are changing direction. The sharper the curve and
        the greater your speed, the more noticeable this acceleration will become. In this section
        we examine the direction and magnitude of that acceleration.
        Figure 16 below shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed. The
        direction of the instantaneous velocity is shown at two points along the path.
        Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, which points directly toward the
        center of rotation (the center of the circular path). This pointing is shown with the vector
        diagram in the figure. We call the acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular
        motion (resulting from a net external force) the centripetal acceleration ( ); centripetal
        means "toward the center" or "center seeking."

                                                                     FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 95
Figure 16: The directions of the velocity of an object at two different points are shown, and the change in velocity

is seen to point directly toward the center of curvature. (See small inset). Because  , the

acceleration is also toward the center; is called centripetal acceleration. (Because  is exceedingly small, the
arc length is equal to the chord length for small time differences).

The direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of curvature, but what is
its magnitude? Note that the triangle formed by the velocity vectors and the one formed
by the radii r and are similar. Both the triangles ABC and PQR are isosceles triangles
(two equal sides). The two equal sides of the velocity vector triangle are the speeds

                  . Using the properties of two similar triangles, we obtain

Acceleration is , and so we first solve this expression for :
Then we divide this by , yielding

96 AHMED FARID
Finally, noting that          , and that  , the linear or tangential speed, we see that

the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is

Which is the acceleration of an object in a circle of radius r at a speed v. So, centripetal
acceleration is greater at high speeds and in sharp curves (smaller radius), as you have
noticed when driving a car. But it is a bit surprising that is proportional to speed
squared, implying, for example, that it is four times as hard to take a curve at 100 km/h
than at 50 km/h. A sharp corner has a small radius, so that is greater for tighter turns,
as you have probably noticed.

It is also useful to express in terms of angular velocity. Substituting  into

the above expression, we find                     . We can express the magnitude of

centripetal acceleration using either of the two equations:

Recall that the direction of  is toward the center. You may use whichever expression is
more convenient.

Centripetal Forces
         Centripetal Force Problem Solving
         Centripetal Force

        Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal or radial acceleration. Just a
        few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earth's gravity on
        the Moon, friction between roller skates and a rink floor, a banked roadway's force on a
        car, and forces on the tube of a spinning centrifuge.
        Any net force causing circular motion is called a centripetal force. The direction of a
        centripetal force is toward the center of curvature, the same as the direction of centripetal
        acceleration. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the net force is mass times

                                                                     FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 97
acceleration:               . For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is the
centripetal acceleration -        . Thus, the magnitude of centripetal force is

By using the expressions for centripetal acceleration  ;                                                                         , we

get two expressions for the centripetal force in terms of mass, velocity, angular

velocity, and radius of curvature:

You may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient. Centripetal
force is always perpendicular to the path and pointing to the center of curvature,
because is perpendicular to the velocity and pointing to the center of curvature.

Note that if you solve the first expression for r, you get

This implies that for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force causes a small
radius of curvature - that is, a tight curve.

                     Figure 17: The frictional force supplies the centripetal force and is numerically equal to it. Centripetal
                     force is perpendicular to velocity and causes uniform circular motion. The larger the , the smaller the
                     radius of curvature r and the sharper the curve.

1. What coefficient of friction do car tires need on a flat curve?

(a) Calculate the centripetal force exerted on a 900 kg car that negotiates a 500 m radius curve

as          .

(b) Assuming an unbanked curve, find the minimum statis coefficient of friction, between the

tires and the road, static friction being the reason that keeps the car from slipping (See Figure

19 below).

               FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 99
             Figure 19

Answer: (a)

(b) Figure 19 shows the forces acting on the car on an unbanked (level ground) curve. Friction is to the left, keeping the

car from slipping, and because it is the only horizontal force acting on the car, the friction is the centripetal force in

this case. We know that the maximum static friction (at which the tires roll but do not slip) is                            is

the static coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. The normal force equals the car's weight on level ground, so

that         . Thus the centripetal force in this situation is

Now we have a relationship between centripetal force and the coefficient of friction. Using the first expression for
from the equation

   We solve this for , noting that mass cancels, and obtain
   Substituting the knowns,

100 AHMED FARID
Let us now consider banked curves, where the slope of the road helps you negotiate the curve. See Figure
20 below. The greater the angle , the faster you can take the curve. Racetracks for bikes as well as cars, for
example, often have steeply banked curves. In an "ideally banked curve," the angle is such that you can
negotiate the curve at a certain speed without the aid of friction between the tires and the road. We will
derive an expression for for an ideally banked curve and consider an example related to it.

Figure 20: The car on this banked curve is moving away and turning to the left.

For ideal banking, the net external force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence of friction.
The components of the normal force N in the horizontal and vertical directions must equal the centripetal
force and the weight of the car, respectively. In cases in which forces are not parallel, it is most convenient
to consider components along perpendicular axes - in this case, the vertical and horizontal directions.

Figure 20 above shows a free-body diagram for a car on a frictionless banked curve. If the angle is ideal

for the speed and radius, then the net external force will equal the necessary centripetal force. The only two

external forces acting on the car are its weight w and the normal force of the road N. (A frictionless surface

can only exert a force perpendicular to the surface - that is, a normal force). These two forces must add to

give a net external force that is horizontal toward the center of curvature and has magnitude  .

Because this is the crucial force and it is horizontal, we use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal

FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 101
axes. Only the normal force has a horizontal component, and so this must equal the centripetal force - that
is,

Because the car does not leave the surface of the road, the net vertical force must be zero, meaning that the
vertical components of the two external forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. From
the figure, we see that the vertical component of the normal force is N cos , and the only other vertical
force is the car's weight. These must be equal in magnitude; thus,

Now we can combine the last two equations to eliminate N and get an expression for , as desired. Solving

the second equation for                         , and substituting this into the first yields

m g \tan (\theta)=\frac{m v^2}{r}

Taking the inverse tangent gives

This expression can be understood by considering how depends on v and r. A large will be obtained for
a large v and a small r. That is, roads must be steeps banked for high speeds and sharp curves. Friction
helps, because it allows you to take the curve at greater or lower speed than if the curve is frictionless. Note
that does not depend on the mass of the vehicle

Example 2

1. What is the ideal speed to take a steeply banked tight curve? Curves on some test tracks and

racecourses, such as the Daytona International Speedway in Florida, are very steeply banked.

This banking, with the aid of tire friction and very stable car configurations, allows the curves

to be taken at very high speed. To illustrate, calculate the speed at which a 100 m radius curve

banked at                should be driven if the road is frictionless.

Frames of Reference
         Fictitious Forces
         Fictitious Forces and Non-Inertial Frames: The Coriolis Force

        What do taking off in a jet airplane, turning a corner in a car, riding a merry-go-round,
        and the circular motion of a tropical cyclone have in common? Each exhibits fictitious
        forces--unreal forces that arise from motion and may seem real, because the observer's
        frame of reference is accelerating or rotating.
When taking off in a jet, most people would agree it feels as if you are being pushed back into
the seat as the airplane accelerates down the runway. Yet a physicist would say that you tend to
remain stationary while the seat pushes forward on you, and there is no real force backward on
you. An even more common experience occurs when you make a tight curve in your car--say, to
the right. You feel as if you are thrown (that is, forced) toward the left relative to the car. Again,
a physicist would say that you are going in a straight line, but the car moves to the right, and
there is no real force on you to the left. Recall Newton's first law.

                      Figure 21: (a) The car driver feels herself forced to the left relative to the car when she
                      makes a right turn. This is a fictitious force arising from the use of the car as a frame of
                      reference. (b) In the Earth's frame of reference, the driver moves in a straight line,
                      obeying Newton's first law, and the car moves to the right. There is no real force to the
                      left on the driver relative to Earth. There is a real force to the right on the car to make it
                      turn.

        We can reconcile these points of view by examining the frames of reference used. Let
        us concentrate on people in a car. Passengers instinctively use the car as a frame of
        reference, while a physicist uses Earth. The physicist chooses Earth because it is very
        nearly an inertial frame of reference--one in which all forces are real (that is, in which all

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 103
forces have an identifiable physical origin). The car is a non-inertial frame of reference
because it is accelerated to the side. The force to the left sensed by car passengers is a
fictitious force having no physical origin. There is nothing real pushing them left--the
car, as well as the driver, is actually accelerating to the right.

Let us now take a mental ride on a merry-go-round--specifically, a rapidly rotating
playground merry-go-round. You take the merry-go-round to be your frame of reference
because you rotate together. In that non-inertial frame, you feel a fictitious force, named
centrifugal force (not to be confused with centripetal force), trying to throw you off. You
must hang on tightly to counteract the centrifugal force. In Earth's frame of reference,
there is no force trying to throw you off. Rather you must hang on to make yourself go in
a circle because otherwise you would go in a straight line, right off the merry-go-round.

Figure 22: (a) A rider on a merry-go-round feels as if he is being thrown off. This fictitious force is called the

centrifugal force--it explains the rider's motion in the rotating frame of reference. (b) In an inertial frame of

reference and according to Newton's laws, it is his inertia that carries him off and not a real force (the unshaded

rider has        and heads in a straight line). A real force,  , is needed to cause a circular

path.

This inertial effect, carrying you away from the center of rotation if there is no centripetal
force to cause circular motion, is put to good use in centrifuges (See Figure 23). A
centrifuge spins a sample very rapidly. Viewed from the rotating frame of reference, the
fictitious centrifugal force throws particles outward, hastening their sedimentation. The
greater the angular velocity, the greater the centrifugal force. But what really happens is
that the inertia of the particles carries them along a line tangent to the circle while the test
tube is forced in a circular path by a centripetal force.

104 AHMED FARID
 Figure 23: Centrifuges use inertia to perform their task. Particles in the fluid sediment come out because
 their inertia carries them away from the center of rotation. The large angular velocity of the centrifuge
 quickens the sedimentation. Ultimately, the particles will come into contact with the test tube walls,
 which will then supply the centripetal force needed to make them move in a circle of constant radius.

Let us now consider what happens if something moves in a frame of reference that
rotates. For example, what if you slide a ball directly away from the center of the merry-
go-round, as shown in Figure 24 below? The ball follows a straight path relative to Earth
(assuming negligible friction) and a path curved to the right on the merry-go-round's
surface. A person standing next to the merry-go-round sees the ball moving straight and
the merry-go-round rotating underneath it. In the merry-go-round's frame of reference,
we explain the apparent curve to the right by using a fictitious force, called the Coriolis
force, which causes the ball to curve to the right. The fictitious Coriolis force can be
used by anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow curved paths and
allows us to apply Newton's Laws in non-inertial frames of reference.

               Figure 24: Looking down on the counterclockwise rotation of a merry-go-round, we see that a ball slid straight

               Both points rotate to the shaded positions (A' and B') shown in the time that the ball follows the curved path in the
               rotating frame and a straight path in Earth's frame.

RELEVANCE TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING COURSEWORK

This section explains the relevance of trip distribution, superelevation, stopping sight distance, time
and space headways to transportation engineering coursework.

         Trip Distribution

        In travel demand modeling, one of the major steps (typically Step 2 of the 4-step process)
        involves estimating the number of trips made from one designated traffic analysis zone (TAZ)
        to another. This step is termed the trip distribution step. There are multiple trip distribution
        computational techniques, or "models," and the gravity model, derived from the physics gravity
        model (see the above section titled "Laws of Gravitation"), is one of the most useful models. In
        the physics gravity model, the greater the masses of two objects and the shorter the distance
        between them, the greater the gravitational pull. In the trip distribution step, the total number
        of trips produced at the origin zone and attracted at the destination zone are analogous to the
        object masses. Furthermore, just like the gravity model from Physics, the number of trips is also
        inversely proportional to an exponent of the distance between zones.

         Superelevation

        The above section titled "Circular Motion and Centripetal Acceleration" describes the basics of
        circular motion. This understanding and the discussion on the balancing of forces in Chapter 6
        are critical to the cross-section design of the road segments with horizontal curves.

         Stopping Sight Distance

        The stopping sight distance, SSD, is the distance needed for a driver to perceive an unusual
        situation and stop to avoid crashing into an object or another road user. The SSD is estimated
        based on the time needed for the driver to detect and recognize the situation, also known
        as perception-reaction time (PRT), and the distance needed to brake to a complete stop, also
        known as the braking distance. These distances are estimated using the principles of kinematics
        for motion at constant speeds (see the above section titled " 1.1 Describe the Motion of an
        Object in the Graphic Form through the Time-Space Diagram"), with accelerated motion (see
        sections "Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension" and "What are the
        Kinematic Formulas?"), and traveling along a grade (see the section titled "Forces and Newton's
        Laws").

         Time and Space Headways

        The time headway is the time difference between the front bumper of one vehicle and that of
        another traveling behind it, passing the same point on a roadway segment. Space headway is
        the physical distance between the front bumper of a vehicle and that of another behind it. The
        relationship between time and space headways is based on kinematic relationships discussed
        in the sections titled "Time, Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration" and " Use Kinematic Equations
        to Solve for Displacement, Time, Velocity and Acceleration of an Object". The time headway
        may be used to estimate the traffic flow rate at points of the roadway segments. It is defined as
        the number of vehicles passing a point on the road per unit of time (in the units of vehicles/
        hour). The space headway may be used to estimate the density of the traffic stream on a roadway

                                                                                FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 107
        segment. It is the number of vehicles observed per unit distance on a roadway stretch (vehicles/
        mile).

   Key Takeaways

           The gravity model from physics described in the chapter provides the foundational understanding
              of the trip distribution modeling between traffic analysis zones (TAZs). The gravity model is based
              on the idea that the number of trips between two zones is related to the size of the zones (i.e., total
              trips produced/attracted at a zone based on characteristics such as population or employment) and
              the distance between them.

           To ensure safe travel, the SSD (Stopping Sight Distance) is estimated based on the design speed
              appropriate for the roadway segments. Principles of kinematics for motion discussed in this
              chapter are used to derive formulas for estimating SSD appropriate for the context.

           The idea of motion at constant speed also relates to the time and space headways between vehicles
              and is useful for estimating flow rate past a point and density on roadway segments.

CHAPTER 6: BASIC DYNAMICS AND STATIC EQUILIBRIUM

This chapter explains momentum and collision concepts to support an understanding of how speed
plays a critical role in the safety of road users, particularly Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), i.e.,
pedestrians and bicyclists. Balancing forces on stationary objects is crucial for designing banking or
superelevation (slope along the cross-section of the road) of road segments with horizontal curvature.

                                                 Learning Objectives

   At the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to do the following:
           Balance forces on a stationary object in equilibrium.

         Linear Momentum

                The scientific definition of linear momentum is consistent with most people's intuitive
                understanding of momentum: a large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a
                smaller, slower object. Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system's mass
                multiplied by its velocity. In symbols, linear momentum is expressed as
                Momentum is directly proportional to the object's mass and also its velocity. Thus, the
                greater an object's mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. Momentum
                p is a vector having the same direction as the velocity v. The SI unit for momentum is

   Example 1

   (a) Calculate the momentum of a 110-kg football player running at 8.00 m/s.
   (b) Compare the player's momentum with the momentum of a hard-thrown 0.410-kg football that has a
   speed of 25.0 m/s.

Momentum and Newton's Second Law

The importance of momentum, unlike the importance of energy, was recognized early
in the development of classical physics. Momentum was deemed so important that it
was called the "quantity of motion." Newton actually stated his second law of motion in
terms of momentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system
divided by the time over which it changes. Using symbols, this law is

Where                      is the net external force,  is the change in momentum, and is the

change in time.

This statement of Newton's Second Law of Motion includes the more familiar
                  as a special case. We can derive this form as follows. First, note that the

change in momentum is given by

If the mass of the system is constant, then

So that for constant mass, Newton's Second Law of Motion becomes

             Because       , we get the familiar equation  when the mass of the system
             is constant.

Example 2

During the 2007 French Open, Venus Williams hit the fastest recorded serve in a premier women's match,
reaching a speed of 58 m/s (209 km/h). What is the average force exerted on the 0.057-kg tennis ball by
Venus Williams' racquet, assuming that the ball's speed just after impact is 58 m/s, that the initial horizontal
component of the velocity before impact is negligible, and that the ball remained in contact with the
racquet for 5.0 ms (milliseconds)?

Answer:

Now the magnitude of the net external force can be determined by using

                                                                            FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 119
Impulse

The effect of a force on an object depends on how long it acts, as well as how great the
force is. In the Example 2 above, a large force acting for a brief time had a significant
effect on the momentum of the tennis ball. A small force could cause the same change in
momentum, but it would have to act for a much longer time. For example, if the ball were
thrown upward, the gravitational force (which is much smaller than the tennis racquet's
force) would eventually reverse the momentum of the ball. Quantitatively, the effect we
are talking about is the change in momentum .

By rearranging the equation                to be

We can see how the change in momentum equals the average net external force multiplied

by the time this force acts. The quantity         is given the name impulse. Impulse if

the same as the change in momentum.

Example 3

1. Making connections - illustrations of force exerted:

A 1.2-kg block slides across a horizontal, frictionless surface with a constant speed of 3.0 m/s before
striking a fixed barrier and coming to a stop. In Figure 1, the force exerted by the barrier is assumed to be a
constant 15 N during the 0.24-s collision. The impulse can be calculated using the area under the curve.

                                Figure 1: This is a graph showing the force exerted by a fixed barrier on a block versus time.
120 AHMED FARID
Note that the initial momentum of the block is

We are assuming that the initial velocity is -3.0 m/s. We have established that the force exerted by the barrier is in the
positive direction, so the initial velocity of the block must be in the negative direction. Since the final momentum of the
block is zero, the impulse is equal to the change in momentum of the block.
Suppose that, instead of striking a fixed barrier, the block is instead stopped by a spring. Consider the force exerted by
the spring over the time interval from the beginning of the collision until the block comes to rest.
In this case, the impulse can be calculated again using the area under the curve (the area of a triangle):

Again, this is equal to the difference between the initial and final momentum of the block, so the impulse is equal to the
change in momentum.
2. Calculating Magnitudes of Impulses - Two Billiard Balls Striking a Rigid Wall:
Two identical billiard balls strike a rigid wall with the same speed and are reflected without any change of speed. The

first strikes perpendicular to the wall. The second ball strikes the wall at an angle of 30">30 from the perpendicular
and bounces off at an angle of 30">30 from perpendicular to the wall.

          (a) Determine the direction of force on the wall due to each ball.
          (b) Calculate the ratio of the magnitudes of impulses on the two balls by the wall.
Answer:
Strategy for A: In order to determine the force on the wall, consider the force on the ball due to the wall using
Newton's second law and then apply Newton's third law to determine the direction. Assume the x-axis to be normal to
the wall and to be positive in the initial direction of motion. Choose the y-axis to be along the wall in the plane of the
second ball's motion. The momentum direction and the velocity direction are the same.
Solution for A: The first ball bounces directly into the wall and exerts a force on it in the +x direction. Therefore, the
wall exerts a force on the ball in the -x direction. The second ball continues with the same momentum component in
the y direction, but reverses its x-component of momentum, as seen by sketching a diagram of the angles involved and
keeping in mind the proportionality between velocity and momentum.
These changes mean the change in momentum for both balls are in the -x direction, so the force of the wall on each
ball is along the -x direction.
Strategy for B: Calculate the change in momentum for each ball, which is equal to the impulse imparted to the ball.
Solution for B: Let  be the speed of each ball before and after collision with the wall, and  the mass of each ball.
Choose the x-axis and y-axis as previously described and consider the change in momentum of the first ball which
strikes perpendicular to the wall.

                                                                            FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 121
   Impulse is the change in momentum vector. Therefore, the x-component of impulse is equal to -2 and the y-
   component of impulse is equal to zero.
   Now consider the change in momentum of the second ball.

   It should be noted here that while changes sign after the collision, does not. Therefore, the x-component of

  impulse is equal to -2mucos30">-2cos30 and the y-component of impulse is equal to zero. The ratio of the

   magnitudes of the impulse imparted to the balls is
   3. Making connections - baseball:
   In most real-life collisions, the forces acting on an object are not constant. For example, when a bat strikes a baseball,
   the force is small at the beginning of the collision since only a small portion of the ball is initially in contact with the
   bat. As the collision continues, the ball deforms so that a greater fraction of the ball is in contact with the bat, resulting
   in a greater force. As the ball begins to leave the bat, the force drops to zero. Although the changing force is difficult to
   precisely calculate at each instant, the average force can be estimated very well in most cases.
   Suppose that a 150-g baseball experiences an average force of 480 N in a direction opposite the initial 32 m/s speed of
   the baseball over a time interval of 0.017 s. What is the final velocity of the baseball after the collision?

                  Conservation of Momentum

                Momentum is an important quantity because it is conserved. Yet it was not conserved
                in the examples in Impulse and Linear Momentum and Force, where large changes
                in momentum were produced by forces acting on the system of interest. Under what
                circumstances is momentum conserved?
                The answer to this question entails considering a sufficiently large system. It is always
                possible to find a larger system in which total momentum is constant, even if momentum
                changes for components of the system. If a football player runs into the goalpost in the
                end zone, there will be a force on him that causes him to bounce backward. However, the
                Earth also recoils --conserving momentum--because of the force applied to it through
                the goalpost. Because Earth is many orders of magnitude more massive than the player,

122 AHMED FARID
its recoil is immeasurably small and can be neglected in any practical sense, but it is real,
nevertheless.

Consider what happens if the masses of two colliding objects are more similar than the
masses of a football player and Earth - for example, one car bumping into another, as
shown in Figure 2. Both cars are coating in the same direction when the lead car (labeled

    ) is bumped by the trailing car (labeled ). The only unbalanced force on each car
is the force of the collision. (Assume that the effects due to friction are negligible). Car
1 slows down as a result of the collision, losing some momentum, while car 2 speeds up
and gains some momentum. We shall now show that the total momentum of the two-car
system remains constant.

Figure 2: A car of mass moving with a velocity of bumps into another car of mass and velocity that it is

following. As a result, the first car slows down to a velocity of and the second speeds up to a velocity of . The

momentum of each car is changed, but the total momentum  of the two cars is the same before and after the

collision (if you assume friction to be negligible)

Using the definition of impulse, the change in momentum of car 1 is given by

,

where is the force on car 1 due to car 2, and is the time the force acts (the duration
of the collision). Intuitively, it seems obvious that the collision time is the same for both
cars, but it is only true for objects traveling at ordinary speeds. This assumption must be
modified for objects travelling near the speed of light, without affecting the result that
momentum is conserved.

Similarly, the change in momentum of car 2 is

,

   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 123
Where is the force on car 2 due to car 1, and we assume the duration of the collision

                 is the same for both cars. We know from Newton's third law that  , and so

Thus, the changes in momentum are equal and opposite, and

Because the changes in momentum add to zero, the total momentum of the two-car
system is constant. That is,

                              ,

Where                             are the momenta of cars 1 and 2 after the collision. (We often use

primes to denote the final state.)

This result--that momentum is conserved--has validity far beyond the preceding one-
dimensional case. It can be similarly shown that total momentum is conserved for any
isolated system, with any number of objects in it. In equation form, the conservation of
momentum principle for an isolated system is written

Or

Where is the total momentum (the sum of the momenta of the individual objects in

the system) and                   is the total momentum some time later. (The total momentum can

be shown to be the momentum of the center of mass of the system.) An isolated system

is defined to be one for which the net external force is zero

Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

Elastic Collisions in One Dimension

Let us consider several types of two-object collisions. These collisions are the easiest
to analyze, and they illustrate many of the physical principles involved in collisions.
The conservation of momentum principle is particularly useful here, and it can be used
whenever the net external force on a system is zero.

We start with the elastic collision of two objects moving along the same line--a one-
dimensional problem. An elastic collision is one that also conserves internal kinetic
energy. Internal kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the objects in the
system. Figure 3 below illustrates an elastic collision in which internal kinetic energy and
momentum are conserved.

124 AHMED FARID
                Truly elastic collisions can only be achieved with subatomic particles, such as electrons
                striking nuclei. Macroscopic collisions can be very nearly, but not quite, elastic--some
                kinetic energy is always converted into other forms of energy such as heat transfer due
                to friction and sound. One macroscopic collision that is nearly elastic is that of two
                steel blocks on ice. Another nearly elastic collision is that between two carts with spring
                bumpers on an air track. Icy surfaces and air tracks are nearly frictionless, more readily
                allowing nearly elastic collisions on them.

Figure 3: An elastic one-dimensional two-object collision. Momentum and internal kinetic energy are conserved.

                Now, to solve problems involving one-dimensional elastic collisions between two objects
                we can use the equations for conservation of momentum and conservation of internal

                                                                                FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 125
       kinetic energy. First, the equation for conservation of momentum for two objects in a
       one-dimensional collision is

       Or

       Where the primes (`) indicate values after the collision. By definition, an elastic collision
       conserves internal kinetic energy, and so the sum of kinetic energies before the collision
       equals the sum after the collision. Thus,

             Expresses the equation for conservation of internal kinetic energy in a one-dimensional
             collision.

Answer: For this problem, note that       and use conservation of momentum.

Thus,

Using conservation of internal kinetic energy and that     ,

Substituting this expression into the second equation (internal kinetic energy equation) eliminates the

this example, they are               and                      . Both solutions may or may not be

meaningful. In this case, the first solution is the same as the initial condition. The first solution thus

represents the situation before the collision is discarded. The second solution                             is

negative, meaning that the first object bounces backward. When this negative value of is used to find the

velocity of the second object after the collision, we get

Inelastic Collisions in One Dimension

We have seen that in an elastic collision, internal kinetic energy is conserved. An inelastic
collision is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes (it is not conserved). This
lack of conservation means that the forces between colliding objects may remove or add
internal kinetic energy. Work done by internal forces may change the forms of energy
within a system. For inelastic collisions, such as when colliding objects stick together, this
internal work may transform some internal kinetic energy into heat transfer. Or it may
convert stored energy into internal kinetic energy, such as when exploding bolts separate
a satellite from its launch vehicle.

Figure 4 below shows an example of an inelastic collision. Two objects that have equal

masses head toward one another at equal speeds and then stick together. Their total

internal kinetic energy is initially  . The two objects come to rest

after sticking together, conserving momentum. But the internal kinetic energy is zero

after the collision. A collision in which the objects stick together is something called a

perfectly inelastic collision because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than does

any other type of inelastic collision. In fact, such a collision reduces internal kinetic

energy to the minimum it can have while still conserving momentum.

Perfectly inelastic collision - a collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes
called "perfectly inelastic."

           objects stick together (a perfectly inelastic collision), and so their final velocity is zero. The internal kinetic energy of
           the system changes in any inelastic collision and is reduced to zero in this example.

Example 5

Calculating final velocity and energy release - two carts collide:

In the collision pictured below in Figure 5, two carts collide inelastically. Cart 1 (denoted carries a

spring which is initially compressed. During the collision, the spring releases its potential energy and

converts it to internal kinetic energy. The mass of cart 1 and the spring is  , and the cart and the

spring together have an initial velocity of  . Cart 2 (denoted                has a mass of 0.500 kg and an

initial velocity of -0.500m/s. After the collision, cart 1 is observed to recoil with a velocity of -4.00m/s.

(a) What is the final velocity of cart 2?

(b) How much energy was released by the spring (assuming all of it was converted into internal
kinetic energy)?

Collisions of Point Masses in Two Dimensions

In the previous two sections, we considered only one-dimensional collisions; during
such collisions, the incoming and outgoing velocities are all along the same line. But
what about collisions, such as those between billiard balls, in which objects scatter to
the side? These are two-dimensional collisions, and we shall see that their study is an
extension of the one-dimensional analysis already presented. The approach taken (similar
to the approach in discussing two-dimensional kinematics and dynamics) is to choose
a convenient coordinate system and resolve the motion into components along
perpendicular axes. Resolving the motion yields a pair of one-dimensional problems to
be solved simultaneously.

One complication arising in two-dimensional collisions is that the objects might rotate
before or after their collision. For example, if two ice skaters hook arms as they pass by
one another, they will spin in circles. To avoid rotation, we consider only the scattering
of point masses - that is, structureless particles that cannot rotate or spin.

We start by assuming that                      , so that momentum p is conserved. The simplest

collision is one in which one of the particles is initially at rest. See Figure 4 below.

The best choice for a coordinate system is one with an axis parallel to the velocity

of the incoming particle, as shown in Figure 6. Because momentum is conserved, the

components of momentum along the x- and y- axes  will also be conserved,

but with the chosen coordinate system, is initially zero and is the momentum

of the incoming particle. Both facts simplify the analysis. (Even with the simplifying

assumptions of point masses, one particle initially at rest, and a convenient coordinate

system, we still gain new insights into nature from the analysis of two-dimensional

collisions.)

130 AHMED FARID
Figure 6: A two-dimensional collision with the coordinate system chosen so that is initially at rest and is parallel to the x
-axis. This coordinate system is sometimes called the laboratory coordinate system, because many scattering experiments have a
target that is stationary in the laboratory, while particles are scattered from it to determine the particles that make-up the target
and how they are bound together. The particles may not be observed directly, but their initial and final velocities are.

           Along the x-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

Where the subscripts denote the particles and axes, and the primes denote the situation
after the collision. In terms of masses and velocities, this equation is

But because particle 2 is initially at rest, this equation becomes

The components of the velocities along the x-axis have the form     . Because particle

1 initially moves along the x-axis, we find  .

Conservation of momentum along the x-axis gives the following equation:

Where  are shown in Figure 4.

Along the y-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

       FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 131
Or

But is zero, because particle 1 initially moves along the x-axis. Because particle 2 is
initially at rest, is also zero. The equation for conservation of momentum along the
y-axis becomes

The components of the velocities along the y-axis have the form          . Thus, the
conservation of momentum along the y-axis gives the following equation:

Making Connections: Real World Connections

We have seen, in one-dimensional collisions when momentum is conserved, that the
center-of-mass velocity of the system remains unchanged as a result of the collision. If
you calculate the momentum and center-of-mass velocity before the collision, you will
get the same answer as if you calculate both quantities after the collision. This logic also
works for two-dimensional collisions.

For example, consider two cars of equal mass. Car A is driving east (+x-direction) with
a speed of 40 m/s. Car B is driving north (+y-direction) with a speed of 80 m/s. What is
the velocity of the center-of-mass of this system before and after an inelastic collision, in
which the cars move together as one mass after the collision?

Since both cars have equal mass, the center-of-mass velocity components are just the
average of the components of the individual velocities before the collision. The x-
component of the center of mass velocity is 20 m/s, and the y-component is 40 m/s.

Using momentum conservation for the collision in both the x-component and y-
component yields similar answers:

                Since the two masses move together after the collision, the velocity of this combined
                object is equal to the center-of-mass velocity. Thus, the center-of-mass velocity before
                and after the collision is identical, even in two-dimensional collisions, when momentum
                is conserved.

         The First Condition for Equilibrium

        The first condition necessary to achieve equilibrium is that the net external force on the system
        must be zero. Expressed as an equation, this is simply

        Note that if net F is zero, then the net external force in any direction is zero. For example,
        the net external forces along the typical x- and y-axes are zero. This is written as

                                            .

         The Second Condition for Equilibrium

        The second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium involves avoiding accelerated rotation
        (maintaining a constant angular velocity). A rotating body or system can be in equilibrium if its
        rate of rotation is constant and remains unchanged by the forces acting on it. The magnitude,
        direction, and point of application of the force are incorporated into the definition of the
        physical quantity called torque.
        Torque is the rotational equivalent of a force. It is a measure of the effectiveness of a force in

134 AHMED FARID
changing or accelerating a rotation (changing the angular velocity over a period of time). In
equation form, the magnitude of torque is defined to be

Where is the symbol for torque, r is the distance from the pivot point to the point where the
force is applied, F is the magnitude of the force, and is the angle between the force and the
vector directed from the point of application to the pivot point.

      Figure 7: A force applied to an object can produce a torque, which
      depends on the location of the pivot point. The three factors

                           for pivot point A on a body are shown here - r is the
      distance from the chosen pivot point to the point where the force F is
      applied, and is the angle between F and the vector directed from
      the point of application to the pivot point. If the object can rotate
      around point A, it will rotate counterclockwise. This means that
      torque is counterclockwise relative to pivot A.

The perpendicular lever arm is the shortest distance from the pivot point to the line along

which F acts; it is shown as a dashed line in Figure 7. Note that the line segment that defines the

distance is perpendicular to F, as its name implies. It is sometimes easier to find or visualize

than to find both r and . In such cases, it may be more convenient to use         rather

than  for torque, but both are equally valid.

The SI unit of torque is newtons time meters, usually written as                  . For example, if you

push perpendicular to the door with a force of 40 N at a distance of 0.800 m from the hinges,

you exert a torque of                               relative to the hinges. If you

reduce the force to 20 N, the torque is reduced to  , and so on.

Now, the second condition necessary to achieve equilibrium is that the net external torque on a system

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 135
must be zero. An external torque is one that is created by an external force. You can choose

the point around which the torque is calculated. The point can be the physical pivot point of

a system or any other point in space--but it must be the same point for all torques. If the

second condition (net external torque on a system is zero) is satisfied for one choice of pivot

point, it will also hold true for any other choice of pivot point in or out of the system of

interest. (This is true only in an inertial frame of reference.) The second condition necessary to

achieve equilibrium is stated in equation form as  where net means total. Torques,

which are in opposite directions are assigned opposite signs. A common convention is to call

counterclockwise (ccw) torques positive and clockwise (cw) torques negative.

When two children balance a seesaw as shown in Figure 8, they satisfy the two conditions for
equilibrium. Most people have perfect intuition about seesaws, knowing that the lighter child
must sit farther from the pivot and that a heavier child can keep a lighter one off the ground
indefinitely.

                  Figure 8: Two children balancing a seesaw satisfy both conditions for equilibrium. The lighter child sits farther
                  from the pivot to create a torque equal in magnitude to that of the heavier child.

   Example 6

   The two children shown in Figure 8 above are balanced on a seesaw of negligible mass. (This assumption is
   made to keep the example simple). The first child has a mass of 26.0 kg and sits 1.60 m from the pivot. (a) If
   the second child has a mass of 32.0 kg, how far is she from the pivot? (b) What is the supporting force
   exerted by the pivot?
   Strategy:

136 AHMED FARID
Both conditions for equilibrium must be satisfied. In part (a), we are asked for a distance; thus, the second
condition (regarding torques) must be used, since the first (regarding only forces) has no distances in it. To
apply the second condition for equilibrium, we first identify the system of interest to be the seesaw plus the
two children. We take the supporting pivot to be the point about which the torques are calculated. We then
identify all external forces acting on the system.

Solution (a)

The three external forces acting on the system are the weights of the two children and the supporting force
of the pivot. Let us examine the torque produced by each. Torque is defined to be

Here        , so that                   for all three forces. That means  for all three. The torques

exerted by the three forces are first,

Second,

And third,

= 0
Note that a minus sign has been inserted into the second question because this torque is clockwise and is
therefore negative by convention. Since act directly on the pivot point, the distance is zero. A force
acting on the pivot cannot cause a rotation, just as pushing directly on the hinges of a door will not cause it
to rotate. Now, the second condition for equilibrium is that the sum of the torques on both children is zero.
Therefore

Or

Weight is mass times the acceleration due to gravity. Entering mg for w, we get

Solve this for the unknown :

The quantities on the right side of the equation are known; thus, is

                                                                            FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 137
   As expected, the heavier child must sit closer to the pivot (1.30 m versus 1.60 m) to balance the seesaw.
   Solution (b)
   This part asks for a force . The easiest way to find it is to use the first condition for equilibrium, which is

   The forces are all vertical, so that means we are dealing with a one-dimension problem along the vertical
   axis; hence, the condition can be written as

   Where we again call the vertical axis the y-axis. Choosing upward to be the positive direction, and using
   plus and minus signs to indicate the directions of the forces, we see that

   This equation yields what might have been guessed at the beginning:

   So, the pivot supplies a supporting force equal to the total weight of the system:

   Entering known values gives

   Discussion:
   The two results make intuitive sense. The heavier child sits closer to the pivot. The pivot supports the
   weight of the two children. Part (b) can also be solved using the second condition for equilibrium, since
   both distances are known, but only if the pivot point is chosen to be somewhere other than the location of
   the seesaw's actual pivot!
   Several aspects of the preceding example have broad implications. First, the choice of the pivot as the point
   around which torques are calculated simplified the problem. Since is exerted on the pivot point, its lever
   arm is zero. Hence, the torque exerted by the supporting force is zero relative to that pivot point. The
   second condition for equilibrium holds for any choice of pivot point, and so we choose the pivot point to
   simplify the solution of the problem.
   Second, the acceleration due to gravity canceled in this problem, and we were left with a ratio of masses.
   This will not always be the case. Always enter the correct forces - do not jump ahead to enter some ratio of
   masses.
   Third, the weight of each child is distributed over an area of the seesaw, yet we treated the weights as if

138 AHMED FARID
each force were exerted at a single point. This is not an approximation - the distances  are the
distances to points directly below the center of gravity of each child.

Finally, not that the concept of torque has an importance beyond static equilibrium. Torque plays the same
role in rotational motion that force plays in linear motion.

Stability

A system is said to be in stable equilibrium if, when displaced from equilibrium, it experiences
a net force or torque in a direction opposite to the direction of the displacement. For example,
a marble at the bottom of a bowl will experience a restoring force when displaced from its
equilibrium position. This force moves it back toward the equilibrium position. Most systems
are in stable equilibrium, especially for small displacements. For another example of stable
equilibrium, see the pencil in Figure 9.

                                   Figure 9: This pencil is in the condition of equilibrium. The net
                                   force on the pencil is zero and the total torque about any pivot is
                                   zero.

A system is in unstable equilibrium if, when displaced, it experiences a net force or torque
in the same direction as the displacement from equilibrium. A system in unstable equilibrium
accelerates away from its equilibrium position if displaced even slightly. An obvious example
is a ball resting on top of a hill. Once displaced, it accelerates away from the crest. See Figures
10-13 for examples of unstable equilibrium.

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 139
                                             Figure 10: If the pencil is displaced slightly to the side
                                             (counterclockwise), it is no longer in equilibrium. Its weight
                                             produces a clockwise torque that returns the pencil to its
                                             equilibrium position.

                                        Figure 11: If the pencil is displaced too far, the torque caused by its weight
                                        changes to counterclockwise and causes the displacement to increase.

140 AHMED FARID
Figure 12: This figure shows unstable equilibrium, although both
conditions for equilibrium are satisfied.

                                           by its weight that is in the same direction as the displacement,
                                           causing the displacement to increase.

        A system is in neutral equilibrium if its equilibrium is independent of displacements from its
        original position. A marble on a flat horizontal surface is an example. Combinations of these
        situations are possible. For example, a marble on a saddle is stable for displacements toward
        the front or back of the saddle and unstable for displacements to the side. Figures 14-15 show
        another example of neutral equilibrium.

142 AHMED FARID
     Figure 14: Here we see neutral equilibrium. The cg of a sphere on a
     flat surface lies directly above the point of support, independent of
     the position on the surface. The sphere is therefore in equilibrium in
     any location, and if displaced, it will remain put.

Figure 15: Because it has a circular cross section, the pencil is in neutral
equilibrium for displacements perpendicular to its length.

RELEVANCE TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING COURSEWORK
This section explains the relevance of traffic safety and superelevation to transportation engineering
coursework.

         Traffic Safety

        Avoiding collisions (or crashes) and in case collisions do occur minimization of harm to human
        beings involved are of critical importance in transportation engineering practice. Practitioners
        and researchers recommend use of term "crashes" or "collisions" instead of "accidents" so that
        they are thought of as preventable events instead of inevitable incidents with no possible
        avoidance/mitigation measures. Crashes are classified according to their severity from
        property-damage-only (PDO) to fatal, and the crash severity is highly correlated with the
        impact speed, and hence the momentum. Mitigation measures, such as guardrails, traffic signs
        with breakaway poles, crash attenuators, air bags, seat belts, and child seats are all implemented
        to reduce the severities of crashes according to the momentum principles, described in the

144 AHMED FARID
        section titled "Use of Momentum Preservation to Describe the Post-Collision Movement of
        Objects."

         Superelevation

        Superelevation, i.e., raising of outer edge of the pavement relative to the inner edge, is provided
        to support higher speed travel along a horizontal curve. The banking helps provide the required
        inward force to keep vehicle on a circular motion. Figure 14 illustrates a superelevated curved
        segment of racetrack, where the relative elevation of the outer edge is more pronounced
        (compared to public roadways) due to significantly higher speeds of race cars. The formula for
        estimating the required superelevation for a given design speed is based on the principles of
        balancing forces described in the above section titled "Balance Forces on a Stationary Object in
        Equilibrium."

Figure 16: Superelevated segment of a racetrack with raised outer edge

   Key Takeaways

           Transportation engineers and safety professionals recognize that crashes and collisions are not
              "accidents" in the sense that these events are not inevitable, can be prevented, and their impacts can
              be mitigated. One key aspect of crash impact mitigation is to reduce the severity of collisions that
              do occur, especially those involving VRUs. The speed-momentum relationships discussed in this
              chapter are essential to developing this understanding.

           Superelevation or banking refers to the raised outer edge of a roadway segment on a horizontal

                                                                                FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 145
              curve. It is provided to counteract the tendency of a vehicle to roll outward on a curve. With a
              gravitational force component pulling the vehicle inward, the superelevation helps keep the vehicle
              on a circular path providing stability and control for negotiating circular curve segments at higher
              speeds.

CHAPTER 7: WAVES AND DOPPLER EFFECT

This chapter discusses the propagation of sound waves because it is critical to understanding and
mitigating the noise pollution resulting from transportation projects. A related concept, i.e., the
Doppler Effect, is helpful in understanding the use of radar guns for traffic speed enforcement and
spot speed studies.

                                                 Learning Objectives

   At the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to do the following:
           Define a wave and its basic properties (e.g., Period, Wavelength, and Frequency).
           List different wave types.
           Describe the movement of sound waves.
           Describe Doppler Effect and its implications.
           Identify topics in the introductory transportation engineering courses that build on the Physics
              concept discussed in this course.

WAVE PROPERTIES

What do we mean when we say something is a wave? The most intuitive and easiest wave to imagine
is the familiar water wave. More precisely, a wave is a disturbance that propagates or moves from
the place it was created. For water waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, perhaps
created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the surface repeatedly. For sound
waves, the disturbance is a change in air pressure, perhaps created by the oscillating cone inside a
speaker. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances, including disturbance of Earth's
surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily understood
using an analogy with water waves. Visualizing water waves is useful because there is more to it than
just a mental image. Water waves exhibit characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude,
period, frequency, and energy. All wave characteristics can be described by a small set of underlying
principles.

         Wave Movement

        A wave is a disturbance that propagates or moves from the place it was created. The simplest
        waves repeat themselves for several cycles and are associated with simple harmonic motion.
        Let us start by considering the simplified water wave in Figure 1 below. The wave is an up
        and down disturbance of the water surface. It causes a sea gull to move up and down in simple
        harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs (peaks and valleys) pass under the bird. The

150 AHMED FARID
time for one complete up and down motion is the wave's period . The wave's frequency
         . The wave itself moves to the right in the figure. This movement of the wave is actually

the disturbance moving to the right, not the water itself (or the bird would move to the right).
We define wave velocity to be the speed at which the disturbance moves. Wave velocity is
sometimes also called the propagation velocity or propagation speed because the disturbance
propagates from one location to another.

Figure 1: An idealized ocean wave passes under a seagull that bobs up and down in simple harmonic motion. The wave has wavelength ,
which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The up and down disturbance of the surface propagates parallel to the
surface at a speed .

        The water wave in Figure 1 also has a length associated with it, called its wavelength , the
        distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave. ( is the distance parallel to the direction
        of propagation.) The speed of propagation is the distance the wave travels in a given time,
        which is one wavelength in the time of one period. In equation form, that is

Or

This fundamental relationship holds for all types of waves. For water waves,  is the speed of
a surface wave; for sound, is the speed of sound; and for visible light,      is the speed of
light, for example.

Applying the Science Practices: Different Types of Waves

Consider a spring fixed to a wall with a mass connected to its end. This fixed point on the wall
exerts a force on the complete spring-and-mass system, and this implies that the momentum
of the complete system is not conserved. Now, consider energy. Since the system is fixed to
a point on the wall, it does not do any work; hence, the total work done is conserved, which
means that the energy is conserved. Consequently, we have an oscillator in which energy

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 151
        is conserved but momentum is not. Now, consider a system of two masses connected to
        each other by a spring. This type of system also forms an oscillator. Since there is no fixed
        point, momentum is conserved as the forces acting on the two masses are equal and opposite.
        Energy for such a system will be conserved because there are no external forces acting on
        the spring-two-masses system. It is clear from above that, for momentum to be conserved,
        momentum needs to be carried by waves. This is a typical example of a mechanical oscillator
        producing mechanical waves, which need a medium in which to propagate. Sound waves are
        also examples of mechanical waves. Some types of waves can travel in the absence of a medium
        of propagation. Such waves: they are called "electromagnetic waves." Light waves are examples
        of electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are created by the vibration of electric charge.
        which This vibration creates a wave with both electric and magnetic field components.
        Traverse and Longitudinal Waves
        A simple wave consists of a periodic disturbance that propagates from one place to another. The
        wave in Figure 2 below propagates in the horizontal direction while the surface is disturbed in
        the vertical direction. Such a wave is called a transverse wave or shear wave; in such a wave,
        the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In contrast, in a longitudinal
        wave or compressional wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation. Figure
        3 below shows an example of a longitudinal wave. The size of the disturbance is its amplitude
        X and is completely independent of the speed of propagation .

   Figure 2: In this example of a transverse wave, the wave propagates horizontally, and the disturbance in the cord is in the vertical
   direction.

152 AHMED FARID
Figure 3: In this example of a longitudinal wave, the wave propagates horizontally, and the disturbance in the cord is also in the horizontal
direction.

       Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. (Water waves are actually
       a combination of transverse and longitudinal. The simplified water wave illustrated in Figure 1
       shows no longitudinal motion of the bird.) The waves on the strings of musical instruments are
       transverse--so are electromagnetic waves, such as visible light.
       Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic variations in
       pressure that are transmitted in fluids. Fluids do not have appreciable shear strength, and thus
       the sound waves in them must be longitudinal or compressional. Sound in solids can be both
       longitudinal and transverse.
       Earthquake waves under Earth's surface also have both longitudinal and transverse components
       (called compressional or P-waves and shear or S-waves, respectively). These components have
       important individual characteristics--they propagate at different speeds, for example.
       Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water.

Energy in Waves: Intensity

All waves carry energy. The energy of some waves can be directly observed. Earthquakes can
shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls.

Loud sounds pulverize nerve cells in the inner ear, causing permanent hearing loss. Ultrasound
is used for deep-heat treatment of muscle strains. A laser beam can burn away a malignancy.
Water waves chew up beaches.

The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude earthquakes
produce large ground displacements. Loud sounds have higher pressure amplitudes and come
from larger-amplitude source vibrations than soft sounds. Large ocean breakers churn up the
shore more than small ones. More quantitatively, a wave is a displacement that is resisted by a
restoring force.

The energy effects of a wave depend on time as well as amplitude. For example, the longer
deep-heat ultrasound is applied, the more energy it transfers. Waves can also be concentrated
or spread out. Sunlight, for example, can be focused to burn wood. Earthquakes spread out, so
they do less damage the farther they get from the source. In both cases, changing the area the
waves cover has important effects. All these pertinent factors are included in the definition of
intensity I as power per unit area:

Where P is the power carried by the wave through area A. The definition of intensity is valis

for any energy in transit, including that carried by waves. The SI unit for intensity is watts

per square meter  . For example, infrared and visible energy from the Sun impinge on

Earth at an intensity of 1300  just above the atmosphere. There are other intensity-

154 AHMED FARID
related units in use, too. The most common is the decibel. For example, a 90-decibel sound level

corresponds to an intensity of  . (This quantity is not much power per unit area

considering that 90 decibels is a relatively high sound level. Decibels will be discussed in some

detail in a later chapter.)

DESCRIBE THE MOVEMENT OF SOUND WAVES IN THE ENVIRONMENT

In this section, you will learn how to understand the physics, speed, wavelength, intensity, and level of
sound by reading each description along with watching the videos included. Also, short problems to
check your understanding are included.

         Physics of Hearing: Sound

        Sound can be used as a familiar illustration of waves. Because hearing is one of our most
        important senses, it is interesting to see how the physical properties of sound correspond to
        our perceptions of it. Hearing is the perception of sound, just as vision is the perception of
        visible light. The physical phenomenon of sound is defined to be a disturbance of matter that is
        transmitted from its source outward. Sound is a wave. The amplitude of a sound wave decreases
        with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave is spread over a larger and larger
        area. But it is also absorbed by objects, such as the eardrum.

A vibrating string produces a sound wave as illustrated in Figures 4, 5, and 6. As the string
oscillates back and forth, it transfers energy to the air, mostly as thermal energy created by
turbulence. But a small part of the string's energy goes into compressing and expanding the
surrounding air, creating slightly higher and lower local pressures. These compressions (high
pressure regions) and rarefactions (low pressure regions) move out as longitudinal pressure
waves having the same frequency as the string--they are the disturbance that is a sound wave.
(Sound waves in air and most fluids are longitudinal because fluids have almost no shear
strength. In solids, sound waves can be both transverse and longitudinal.) Figure 6 shows a
graph of gauge pressure versus distance from the vibrating string.

Figure 4: A vibrating string moving to the right compresses the air in front of it and
expands the air behind it.

                                       Figure 5: As the string moves to the left, it creates another compression and
                                       rarefaction as the ones on the right move away from the string.

                                   Figure 6: After many vibrations, these are a series of compressions and
                                   rarefactions moving out from the string as a sound wave. The graph shows gauge
                                   pressure versus distance from the source. Pressures vary only slightly from
                                   atmospheric for ordinary sounds.

                  Speed of Sound, Frequency, and Wavelength

                Sound, like all waves, travels at a certain speed and has the properties of frequency
                and wavelength. You can observe direct evidence of the speed of sound while watching
                a fireworks display. The flash of an explosion is seen well before its sound is heard,
                implying both that sound travels at a finite speed and that it is much slower than light.
                You can also directly sense the frequency of a sound. Perception of frequency is called
                pitch. The wavelength of sound is not directly sensed, but indirect evidence is found in

156 AHMED FARID
the correlation of the size of musical instruments with their pitch. Small instruments,
such as a piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while large instruments, such as a
tuba, typically make low-pitch sounds. High pitch means small wavelength, and the size
of a musical instrument is directly related to the wavelengths of sound it produces. So,
a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds. Similar arguments hold that a large
instrument creates long-wavelength sounds.

The relationship of the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for
all waves:

Where is the speed of sound, f is its frequency, and "> is its wavelength. The
wavelength of a sound is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave - for
example, between adjacent compressions as illustrated in Figure 7. The frequency is the
same as that of the source and is the number of waves that pass a point per unit of time.

Figure 7: A sound wave emanates from a source vibrating at a frequency f">, propagates at  , and has a

wavelength 

The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another.

However, the frequency usually remains the same because it is like a driven oscillation

and has the frequency of the original source. If changes and f remains the same, then

the wavelength "> must change. That is, because           , the higher the speed of a

sound, the greater its wavelength for a given frequency.

Sound Intensity and Sound Level

In a quiet forest, you can sometimes hear a single leaf fall to the ground. After settling into
bed, you may hear your blood pulsing through your ears. But when a passing motorist
has his stereo turned up, you cannot even hear what the person next to you in your car
is saying. We are all very familiar with the loudness of sounds and aware that they are
related to how energetically the source is vibrating. In cartoons depicting a screaming
person (or an animal making a loud noise), the cartoonist often shows a gaping mouth
with a vibrating uvula, the hanging tissue at the back of the mouth, to suggest a loud
sound coming from the throat (see Figure 8 below). High noise exposure is hazardous to
hearing, and it is common for musicians to have hearing losses that are sufficiently severe
that they interfere with the musicians' abilities to perform. The relevant physical quantity
is sound intensity, a concept that is valid for all sounds whether or not they are in the
audible range.

Intensity is defined to be the power per unit area carried by a wave. Power is the rate at

which energy is transferred by the wave. In equation form intensity                                       , where P

is the power through an area A.

158 AHMED FARID
       Figure 8: Graphs of the gauge pressures in two sound waves of different intensities.
       The more intense sound is produced by a source that has larger-amplitude
       oscillations and has greater pressure maxima and minima. Because pressures are
       higher in the greater-intensity sound, it can exert larger forces on the objects it
       encounters.

Sound intensity levels are quoted in decibels (dB) much more often than sound intensities
in watts per meter squared. Decibels are the unit of choice in the scientific literature
as well as in the popular media. The reasons for this choice of units are related to how
we perceive sounds. How our ears perceive sound can be more accurately described by
the logarithm of the intensity rather than directly to the intensity. The sound intensity
level in decibels of a sound having an intensity I in watts per meter squared is defined

to be                               is a reference intensity. In

particular, is the lowest or threshold intensity of sound a person with normal hearing

can perceive at a frequency of 1000 Hz. Sound intensity level is not the same as intensity.

Because is defined in terms of a ratio, it is a unitless quantity telling you the level of the

sound relative to a fixed standard  , in this case). The units of decibels (dB)

are used to indicate this ratio is multiplied by 10 in its definition. The bel, upon which the

decibel is based, is named for Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.

DESCRIBE THE DOPPLER EFFECT IN THE CONTEXT OF WAVES EMANATING FROM A
MOVING SOURCE
The characteristic sound of a motorcycle buzzing by is an example of the Doppler effect. The
high-pitch scream shifts dramatically to a lower-pitch roar as the motorcycle passes by a stationary
observer. The closer the motorcycle brushes by, the more abrupt the shift. The faster the motorcycle
moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this characteristic shift in frequency for passing race cars,
airplanes, and trains.
The Doppler effect is an alteration in the observed frequency of a sound due to motion of either the
source or the observer. Although less familiar, this effect is easily noticed for a stationary source and
moving observer. For example, if you ride a train past a stationary warning bell, you will hear the
bell's frequency shift from high to low as you pass by. The actual change in frequency due to relative
motion of source and observer is called a Doppler shift. The Doppler effect and Doppler shift are
named for the Austrian physicist and mathematician Christian Johann Doppler (1803-1853), who did
experiments with both moving sources and moving observers. Doppler, for example, had musicians
play on a moving open train car and also play standing next to the train tracks as a train passed by.
Their music was observed both on and off the train, and changes in frequency were measured.

                                                                                FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 161
What causes the Doppler shift? Figures 9, 10, and 11 compare sound waves emitted by stationary
and moving sources in a stationary air mass. Each disturbance spreads out spherically from the point
where the sound was emitted. If the source is stationary, then all of the spheres representing the air
compressions in the sound wave centered on the same point, and the stationary observers on either
side see the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by the source, as seen in Figure 9. If the source
is moving, as in Figure 10, then the situation is difference. Each compression of the air moves out in
a sphere from the point where it was emitted, but the point of emission moves. This moving emission
point causes the air compressions to be closer together on one side and farther apart on the other.
Thus, the wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in Figure 10), and
longer in the opposite direction (on the left in Figure 10). Finally, if the observers move, as in Figure
11, the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer moving toward the
source receives them at a higher frequency, and the person moving away from the source receives
them at a lower frequency.

   Figure 9: Sounds emitted by a source spread out in spherical waves. Because the source, observers, and air are stationary, the
   wavelength and frequency are the same in all directions and to all observers.

162 AHMED FARID
Figure 10: Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The
wavelength is reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on
the right hears a higher-pitch sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased,
and the frequency is reduced.

Figure 11: The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the
source increases frequency as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if
stationary. Motion away from the source decreases frequency as the observer on the left passes through
fewer wave crests, he would if stationary.

We know that wavelength and frequency are related by          , where is the fixed speed of
sound. The sound moves in a medium and has the same speed  in that medium whether the source

FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 163
is moving or not. The f multiplied by is a constant. Because the observer on the fight in the Figure 10
receives a shorter wavelength, the frequency she receives must be higher. Similarly, the observer on
the left receives a longer wavelength, and hence he hears a lower frequency. The same thing happens
in Figure 11. A higher frequency is received by the observer moving toward the source, and a lower
frequency is received by an observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion
of source and observer toward one another increases the received frequency. Relative motion apart
decreases frequency. The greater the relative speed is, the greater the effect.

RELEVANCE TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING COURSEWORK

In this section, you will learn about spot speed study and speed limit enforcement helping ensure
that roadway design is consistent with speed on roadways and highways. You will also learn about
sustainable transportation planning and development.

         Spot speed study and speed limit enforcement

        The information from spot speed studies is critical for the enforcement and implementation of
        speed management strategies if needed. A Doppler radar, either hand-held, vehicle-mounted,
        or poll-mounted, has been one of the most commonly used tools for speed limit enforcement.
        These devices are also useful in conducting spot speed studies to ensure that the roadway design
        is consistent with the desired speed for the street and highways. Newer Lidar-based speed
        measurement also works based on the Doppler Effect discussed in this chapter.

         Transportation Planning and Sustainable Development

        As we learn about the ill effects of noise pollution, it becomes a vital part of the environmental
        impact assessments and mitigation for transportation projects. It remains a critical equity
        concern since, historically, lower-income and minoritized communities bear the brunt of the
        impact of traffic-related noise. Traffic noise barriers are one of the key mitigation measures
        that manipulate sound waves to reduce their intensity and help minimize their impact. Noise
        barriers reduce the sound entering a community by either absorbing/reflecting the sound of
        traffic or forcing the waves to take an alternate path over and around the obstacle. The design
        of noise barriers is based on the wave propagation principles outlined in this chapter.

   Key Takeaways

           The technology used for spot speed studies and speed limit enforcement is based on the Doppler
              effect in wave propagation. Spot speed studies are critical to ensure that the roadway design
              context aligns with the speed limit posted on the roadway segment.

           The design of noise barriers to protect communities surrounding freeways and railroads from
              noise pollution is based on the wave propagation principles discussed in this chapter. It has been an
              equity issue since marginalized lower-income communities have historically borne the most
              impact of roadway noise pollution.

CHAPTER 8: PROBABILITY: BASIC PRINCIPLES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

This chapter discusses understanding the basic principles of probability because transportation
system operations and planning are critically dependent on these basic principles. Several processes
are modeled using probability distributions for real-valued random variables. These distributions
include normal distribution for the speed of vehicles on the road, Poisson's distribution for gaps in
traffic on an uncongested facility, or negative binomial as a distribution for crash frequency on a
roadway segment.

                                                 Learning Objectives

   At the end of the chapter, the reader should be able to do the following:

           Use basic counting techniques (multiplication rule, combinations, permutations) to estimate
              probability and odds.

           Set up and work with distributions for discrete random variables, including Bernoulli, binomial,
              geometric, and Poisson distributions.

           Set up and work with distributions for continuous random variables, including uniform, normal
              and exponential distributions.

           Identify topics in the introductory transportation engineering courses that build on the concepts
              discussed in this chapter.

USE BASIC COUNTING TECHNIQUES TO ESTIMATE PROBABILITY AND ODDS

This section will explain ways to estimate probability and odds with videos to help your
understanding. Also, short problems to check your understanding are included.

Multiplication Rule
         Multiplication Rule

The multiplication rule says: If there are n ways to perform action 1 and then by m ways

to perform action 2, then there are  ways to perform action 1 followed by action 2.

Permutations

Permutations

A permutation of a set is a particular ordering of its elements. For example, the set

                 has six permutations: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba. We found the number of

permutations by listing them all. We could have also found the number of permutations

by using the multiplication rule. That is, there are 3 ways to pick the first element, then 2

ways for the second, and 1 for the third. This gives a total of            permutations.

In general, the multiplication rule tells us that the number of permutations of a set of
elements is

We also talk about the permutations of k things out of a set of n things.
Example: List all the permutations of 3 elements out of the set

                Note that abc and acb count as distinct permutations. That is, for permutations the order
                matters.
                There are 24 permutations. Note that the multiplication rule would have told us there are

                                    permutations without bothering to list them all.

Combinations
         Combinations

        In contrast to permutations, in combinations order does not matter: permutations are
        lists and combinations are sets.

Example: List all the combinations of 3 elements out of the set  .

Answer: Such a combination is a collection of 3 elements without regard to order. So, abc
and cab both represent the same combination. We can list all the combinations by listing
all the subsets of exactly 3 elements.

There are only 4 combinations. Contrast this with the 24 permutations in the previous
example. The factor of 6 comes because every combination of 3 things can be written in
6 different orders.

     Permutations and Combinations Comparison

     We will use the following notations.
          = number of permutations (list) of k distinct elements from a set of size n

                      = number of combinations (subsets) of k elements from a set of size n

     We emphasize that by the number of combinations of k elements we mean the number of
     subsets of size k.

     These have the following notation and formulas:

     Permutations:

     Combinations:

     The notation     is read "n choose k". The formula for  follows from the multiplication

     rule. It also implies the formula for because a subset of size k can be ordered in k! ways.

     We can illustrate the relationship between permutations and combinations by lining up the
     results of the previous two examples.

     Probability Using the Rules
              The General Multiplication Rule

             When we calculate probabilities involving one event AND another event occurring, we
             multiply their probabilities.
             In some cases, the first event happening impacts the probability of the second event. We
             call these dependent events.
             In other cases, the first event happening does not impact the probability of the seconds.
             We call these independent events.
             Independent events: Flipping a coin twice
             What is the probability of flipping a fair coin and getting "heads" twice in a row? That is,
             what is the probability of getting heads on the first flip AND heads on the second flip?
             Imagine we had 100 people simulate this and flip a coin twice. On average, 50 people
             would get heads on the first flip, and then 25 of them would get heads again. So, 25 out of
             the original 100 people - or 1/4 of them - would get heads twice in a row.
             The number of people we start with does not really matter. Theoretically, 1/2 of the
             original group will get heads, and 1/2 of that group will get heads again. To find a fraction
             of a fraction, we multiply.
             We can represent this concept with a tree diagram like the one shown below in Figure 1.

                                                                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 175
                                  Figure 1

                We multiply the probabilities along the branches to find the overall probability of one
                event AND the next event occurring.
                For example, the probability of getting two "tails" in a row would be:

                When two events are independent, we can say that

                Be careful! This formula only applies to independent events.
                Dependent events: Drawing cards
                We can use a similar strategy even when we are dealing with dependent events.
                Consider drawing two cards, without replacement, from a standard deck of 52 cards.
                That means we are drawing the first card, leaving it out, and then drawing the second
                card.
                What is the probability that both cards selected are black?
                Half of the 52 cards are black, so the probability that the first card is black is 26/52. But
                the probability of getting a black card changes on the next draw, since the number of
                black cards and the total number of cards have both been decreased by 1.
                Here is what the probabilities would look like in a tree diagram:

176 AHMED FARID
              Figure 2

So, the probability that both cards are black is:

The General Multiplication Rule
For any two events, we can say that

The vertical bar in  means "given," so this could also be read as "the probability

that B occurs given that A has occurred."

This formula says that we can multiply the probabilities of two events, but we need to take
the first event into account when considering the probability of the second event.

If the events are independent, one happening does not impact the probability of the other,

and in that case,                    .

Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem

          Conditional Probability

        Conditional probability answers the questions `how does the probability of an
        event change if we have extra information.'

                 Example: Toss a fair coin 3 times.

                 What is the probability of 3 heads?

                 Answer:             Sample                      space                                    =
                 equally likely, so
                                                                          . All outcomes are

                 Suppose we are told that the first toss was heads. Given this information how
                 should we compute the probability of 3 heads?

                 Answer: We have a new (reduced) sample space =

                 .  All              outcomes         are        equally  likely,                         so

178 AHMED FARID
This is called conditional probability, since it takes into account additional
conditions. To develop the notation, we rephrase (b) in terms of events.

Rephrased (b): Let A be the event `all three tosses are heads' =     . Let B be

the event `the first toss is heads' =                             .

The conditional probability of A knowing that B occurred is written

This is read as `the conditional probability of A given B ' OR `the probability of A
conditioned on B ' OR simply `the probability of A given B.'

We can visualize conditional probability as follows. Think of        as the

proportion of the area of the whole sample space taken up by A. For  we

restrict our attention to B. That is,  is the proportion of area of B taken

up by A, i.e.,              .

Figure 3

 The formal definition of conditional probability catches the gist of the above
 example and visualization.

 Formal definition of conditional probability

 Let A and B be events. We define the conditional probability of A given B as

Let us redo the coin-tossing example using the definition in the equation above.

Recall A = 3 heads and B = first toss is heads. We have              and

                . Since                , we also have                . Now

according to the equation,             which agrees with the answer in

Example B.

Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem is a pillar of both probability and statistics. For two events A and
B Bayes' theorem says

                FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 179
Bayes' rule tells us how to `invert' conditional probabilities, i.e., to find

from  .

Proof of Bayes' Theorem

The key point is that     is symmetric in A and B. So, the multiplication rule
says                                                               .

Now divide through by P (A) to get Bayes' rule.

A common mistake is to confuse                      and   . They can be very

different. This is illustrated in the next example.

Example: Toss a coin 5 times. Let                                                                                                   and let
                                                                                                                                          but
                          .                         Then

                       .

For practice, let us use Bayes' theorem to compute                                                                                  using
                                                                                                                                          ,
      . The terms are                                     ,

         . So,

Which agrees with our previous calculation.

         Introduction to Discrete Random Variables

        A student takes a ten-question, true-false quiz. Because the student had such a busy schedule,
        he or she could not study and guesses randomly at each answer. What is the probability of the
        student passing the test with at least a 70?
        Small companies might be interested in the number of long-distance phone calls their
        employees make during the peak time of the day. Suppose the historical average is 20 calls. What
        is the probability that the employees make more than 20 long-distance phone calls during the
        peak time?
        These two examples illustrate two different types of probability problems involving discrete
        random variables. Recall that discrete data are data that you can count, that is, the random
        variable can only take on whole number values. A random variable describes the outcomes of
        a statistical experiment in words. The values of a random variable can vary with each repetition
        of an experiment, often called a trial.
        Random Variable Notation
        The upper-case letter X denotes a random variable. Lowercase letters like x or y denote the
        value of a random variable. If X is a random variable, then X is written in words, and x is
        given as a number.

                                                                                FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 181
        For example, let X = the number of heads you get when you toss three fair coins. The sample
        space for the toss of three fair coins is TTT; THH; HTH; HHT; HTT; THT; TTH; HHH. Then,
        x = 0, 1, 2, 3. X is in words and x is a number. Notice that for this example, the x values are
        countable outcomes. Because you can count the possible values as whole numbers that X can
        take on and the outcomes are random (the x values 0, 1, 2, 3), X is a discrete random variable.

        Probability Density Functions (PDF) for a Random Variable

        A probability density function or probability distribution function has two characteristics:

             1. Each probability is between zero and one, inclusive.
             2. The sum of the probabilities is one.

        A probability density function is a mathematical formula that calculates probabilities for
        specific types of events. There is a sort of magic to a probability density function (Pdf) partially
        because the same formula often describes very different types of events. For example, the
        binomial Pdf will calculate probabilities for flipping coins, yes/no questions on an exam,
        opinions of voters in an up or down opinion poll, and indeed any binary event. Other
        probability density functions will provide probabilities for the time until a part will fail, when
        a customer will arrive at the turnpike booth, the number of telephone calls arriving at a central
        switchboard, the growth rate of a bacterium, and on and on. There are whole families of
        probability density functions that are used in a wide variety of applications, including medicine,
        business and finance, physics, and engineering, among others.

        Counting Formulas and the Combinational Formula

        To repeat, the probability of event A, P(A), is simply the number of ways the experiment will
        result in A, relative to the total number of possible outcomes of the experiment.

        As an equation this is:

        When we looked at the sample space for flipping 3 coins, we could easily write the full sample
        space and thus could easily count the number of events that met our desired result, e.g., x = 1,
        where X is the random variable defined as the number of heads.

        As we have larger numbers of items in the sample space, such as a full deck of 52 cards, the
        ability to write out the sample space becomes impossible.

        We see that probabilities are nothing more than counting the events in each group we are
        interested in and dividing by the number of elements in the universe, or sample space. This is
        easy enough if we are counting sophomores in a Stat class, but in more complicated cases listing
        all the possible outcomes may take a lifetime. There are, for example, 36 possible outcomes
        from throwing just two six-sided dice where the random variable is the sum of the number of
        spots on the up-facing sides. If there were four dice, then the total number of possible outcomes
        would become 1,296. There are more than 2.5 MILLION possible 5-card poker hands in a

182 AHMED FARID
standard deck of 52 cards. Obviously keeping track of all these possibilities and counting them
to get at a single probability would be tedious at best.
An alternative to listing the complete sample space and counting the number of elements we
are interested in is to skip the step of listing the sample space, and simply figure out the number
of elements in it and do the appropriate division. If we are after a probability, we really do
not need to see each and every element in the sample space, we only need to know how many
elements are there. Counting formulas were invented to do just this. They tell us the number
of unordered subsets of a certain size that can be created from a set of unique elements. By
unordered it is meant that, for example, when dealing cards, it does not matter if you got {ace,
ace, ace, ace, king} or {king, ace, ace, ace, ace} or {ace, king, ace, ace, ace} and so on. Each of these
subsets are the same because they each have 4 aces and one king.
Combinational Formula (Review)

It is also sometimes referred to as the Binomial Coefficient.
Let us find the hard way the total number of combinations of the four aces in a deck of cards if
we were going to take them two at a time. The sample space would be:
S={(Spade,
Heart),(Spade,Diamond),(Spade,Club),(Diamond,Club),(Heart,Diamond),(Heart,Club)}
There are 6 combinations; formally, six unique unordered subsets of size 2 that can be created
from 4 unique elements. To use the combinatorial formula, we would solve the formula as
follows:

If we wanted to know the number of unique 5-card poker hands that could be created from a
52-card deck, we simply compute:

where 52 is the total number of unique elements from which we are drawing and 5 is the size
group we are putting them into.
With the combinatorial formula we can count the number of elements in a sample space
without having to write each one of them down, truly a lifetime's work for just the number of 5
card hands from a deck of 52 cards.
Remember, a probability density function computes probability for us. We simply put the

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 183
    appropriate numbers in the formula, and we get the probability of specific events. However, for
    these formulas to work they must be applied only to cases for which they were designed.

Mean (expected value) of a Discrete Random Variable

                 Expected Value

                 Example: Suppose we have a six-sided die marked with five 3's and one 6. What
                 would you expect the average of 6000 rolls to be?

                 Answer: If we knew the value of each roll, we could compute the average by

184 AHMED FARID
summing the 6000 values and dividing by 6000. Without knowing the values, we
can compute the expected average as follows.

Since there are five 3's and one 6, we expect roughly 5/6 of the rolls will give 3
and 1/6 will give 6. Assuming this to be exactly true, we have the following table of
values and counts (Table 3):

                             Table 3

              Value:                       3                 6
                                           5000              1000
              Expected
              counts:

The average of these 6000 values is then

We consider this the expected average in the sense that we "expect" each of the
possible values to occur with the given frequencies.

Definition: Suppose X is a discrete        random  variable  that takes values
                     with probabilities                        . The expected

value of X is denoted E(X) and defined by

Notes:

The expected value is also called the mean or average of X and is often denoted by
   ("mu").

As seen in the above example, the expected value need not be a possible value of the
random variable. Rather it is a weighted average of the possible values.

Expected value is a summary statistic, providing a measure of the location or
central tendency of a random variable.

If all the values are equally probable, then the expected value is just the usual
average of the values.

Probability Mass Function and Cumulative Distribution Function

It gets tiring and hard to read and write          for the probability that  .

When we know we are talking about X we will simply write p(a). If we want to make

X explicit we will write  .

Definition: The probability mass function (pmf) of a discrete random variable is

the function                 .

Note:

                 Mean and Center of Mass

                 You may have wondered why we use the name "probability mass function." Here

                 is the reason: if we place an object of mass      at position                            for each j,

                 then E(X) is the position of the center of mass. Let us recall the latter notion via an

                 example.

                 Example: Suppose we have two masses along the x-axis, mass                               at

                 position  and mass       at position              . Where is the center of

                 mass?

                 Answer: Intuitively we know that the center of mass is closer to the larger mass.

                                         Figure 4

                 From physics, we know the center of mass is

                 We call this formula a "weighted" average of the  and . Here   is weighted
                 more heavily because it has more mass.

                 Now look at the definition of expected value E(X). It is a weighted average of the

                 values of X with the weights being probabilities  rather than masses! We

                 might say that "The expected value is the point at which the distribution would

                 balance." Note the similarity between the physics example and the previous dice

                 example.

Variance and Standard Deviation for Discrete Random Variables

The expected value (mean) of a random variable is a measure of location or central
tendency. If you had to summarize a random variable with a single number, the mean
would be a desirable choice. Still, the mean leaves out a good deal of information. For
example, the random variables X and Y below both have mean 0, but their probability
mass is spread out about the mean quite differently.

It is probably a little easier to see the different spreads in plots of the probability mass
functions. We use bars instead of dots to give a better sense of the mass.

    Figure 5

Variance and Standard Deviation

Taking the mean as the center of a random variable's probability distribution, the
variance is a measure of how much the probability mass is spread out around this center.

Definition: If X is a random variable with mean     , then the variance of X is
defined by

The standard deviation of X is defined by

If the relevant random variable is clear from context, then the variance and standard
deviation are often denoted by and ("sigma"), just as the mean is ("mu").

What does this mean? First, let us rewrite the definition explicitly as a sum. If X takes

values  with probability mass function,             then

                                                 .

In words, the formula for Var(X) says to take a weighted average of the squared distance to
the mean. By squaring, we make sure we are averaging only non-negative values, so that
the spread to the right of the mean will not cancel that to the left.

Note on units:

1. has the same units as

2. Var(X) has the same units as the square of X. So, if X is in meters, then Var(X) is in
    meters squared.

Because  and X have the same units, the standard deviation is a natural measure of
spread.

                  Bernoulli Distributions

                Model: The Bernoulli distribution models one trial in an experiment that can result in
                either a success or failure. This is the most important distribution and is also the simplest.
                A random variable X has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p if:

                      1. X takes the values 0 and 1.

188 AHMED FARID
2.  and

We will write X ~ Bernoulli (p) or Ber (p), which is read "X follows a Bernoulli distribution
with parameter " or " is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p."

A simple model for the Bernoulli distribution is to flip a coin with probability p of heads,
with X = 1 on heads and X = 0 on tails. The general terminology is to say X is 1 on success
and 0 on failure, with success and failure defined by the context.

Many decisions can be modeled as a binary choice, such as votes for or against a proposal.
If p is the proportion of the voting population that favors the proposal, then the vote of a
random individual is modeled by a Bernoulli (p).

Here are the table and graphs of the pmf for the Bernoulli (1/2) distribution and below
that for the general Bernoulli (p) distribution.

Binomial Distributions

The binomial distribution Binomial (n,p), or Bin (n,p), models the number of successes in
n independent Bernoulli(p) trials.

There is a hierarchy here. A single Bernoulli trial is, say, a toss of a coin. A single binomial
trial consists of n Bernoulli trials. For coin flips the sample space for a Bernoulli trial is

          . The sample space for a binomial trial is all sequences of heads and tails of length
n. Likewise, a Bernoulli random variable takes values 0 and 1 and a binomial random
variable takes values 0, 1, 2, ..., n.

Example: The number of heads in n flips of a coin with probability p of heads follows a
Binomial(n,p) distribution.

We describe X~Binomial(n,p) by giving its values and probabilities. For notation we will
use k to mean an arbitrary number between 0 and n.

We remind you that `n choose k'  is the number of ways to choose

k things out of a collection of n things and it has the formula

(It is also called a binomial coefficient). Table 5 is a table for the pmf of a Binomial(n,k)
random variable:

           Example: What is the probability of 3 or more heads in 5 tosses of a fair coin?
           Answer: The binomial coefficients associated with n = 5 are

                                                           ,

           And similarly

           Using these values, we get Table 6 for X~Binomial(5,p).

                    Explanation of the Binomial Probabilities

                    For concreteness, let n = 5 and k = 2 (the argument for arbitrary n and k is identical).
                    So X~Binomial(5,p) and we want to compute p(2). The long way to compute p(2)
                    is to list all the ways to get exactly 2 heads in 5-coin flips and add up their
                    probabilities. The list has 10 entries: HHTTT, HTHTT, HTTHT, HTTTH, THHTT,
                    THTHT, THTTH, TTHHT, TTHTH, TTTHH.

                    Each entry has the same probability of occurring, namely

                    This is because each of the two heads has probability p and each of the 3 tails has

192 AHMED FARID
probability 1 - p. Because the individual tosses are independent, we can multiply

probabilities. Therefore, the total probability of exactly 2 heads is the sum of 10

identical probabilities, i.e.,      , as shown in Table 6.

This guides us to the shorter way to do the computation. We have to count the
number of sequences with exactly 2 heads. To do this we need to choose 2 of the
tosses to be heads and the remaining 3 to be tails. The number of such sequences is

the number of ways to choose 2 out of the 5 things, which is  . Since each such

sequence has the same probability,  , we get the probability of exactly 2

heads                           .

Here are some binomial probability mass functions (here, frequency is the same as
probability).

              Characteristics of a Binomial Experiment

                   1. There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an

                                                                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 193
                 experiment. The letter n denotes the number of trials.

                 2. The random variable, x, number of successes, is discrete.

                 3. There are only two possible outcomes, called "success" and "failure," for each
                     trial. The letter p denotes the probability of a success on any one trial, and q
                     denotes the probability of a failure on any one trial. p + q = 1

                 4. The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Think

                 of this as drawing WITH replacement. Because the n trials are independent, the

                 outcome of one trial does not help in predicting the outcome of another trial.

                 Another way of saying this is that for each individual trial, the probability, p, of a

                 success and probability, q, of a failure remain the same. For example, randomly

                 guessing at a true-false statistics question has only two outcomes. If a success is

                 guessing correctly, then a failure is guessing incorrectly. Suppose Jow always

                 guesses correctly on any statistics true-false question with a probability

                 . Then,  . This means that for every true-false statistics question Joe

                 answers, his probability of success (  ) and his probability of failure (

                          ) remain the same.

Any experiment that has characteristics three and four and where n = 1 is called the
Bernoulli Trial.

A word about independence

So far, we have been using the notion of an independent random variable without ever
carefully defining it. For example, a binomial distribution is the sum of independent
Bernoulli trials. This may (should?) have bothered you. Of course, we have an intuitive
sense of what independence means for experimental trials. We also have the probabilistic
sense that random variables X and Y are independent if knowing the value of X gives you
no information about the value of Y.

Definition: The discrete random variables X and Y are independent if

For any values a,b. That is, the probabilities multiply.

Geometric Distributions

A geometric distribution models the number of tails before the first head in a sequence
of coin flips (Bernoulli trials).

Example: (a) Flip a coin repeatedly. Let X be the number of tails before the first heads.
So, X can equal 0, i.e., the first flip is heads, 1, 2, .... In principle, it takes any nonnegative
integer value.

(b) Give a flip of tails the value 0 and heads the value 1. In this case, X is the number of 0's
before the first 1.

(c) Give a flip of tails the value 1 and heads the value 0. In this case, X is the number of 1's
before the first 0.

(d) Call a flip of tails a success and heads a failure. So, X is the number of successes before
the first failure.

(e) Call a flip of tails a failure and heads a success. So, X is the number of failures before
the first success.

You can see this models many different scenarios of this type. The most neutral language
is the number of tails before the first head.

Formal definition: The random variable X follows a geometric distribution with
parameter p if

                 X takes the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ...  . In Table 7 we have:
                 Its pmf is given by

            The geometric distribution is an example of a discrete distribution that takes an infinite
            number of possible values. Things can get confusing when we work with successes and
            failures since we might want to model the number of successes before the first failure, or
            we might want the number of failures before the first success. To keep things straight you
            can translate to the neutral language of the number of tails before the first heads.

                      Characteristics of a Geometric Experiment

                    The geometric probability density function builds upon what we have learned from
                    the binomial distribution. In this case, the experiment continues until either a
                    success or a failure occurs rather than for a set number of trials. Here are the main
                    characteristics of a geometric experiment:

                           1. There are one or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one,
                               which is a success. In other words, you keep repeating what you are doing
                               until the first success. Then you stop. For example, you throw a dart at a
                               bullseye until you hit the bullseye. The first time you hit the bullseye is a
                               "success," so you stop throwing the dart. It might take six tries until you

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 197
                 hit the bullseye. You can think of the trials as failure, failure, failure,
                 failure, failure, success, STOP.

                 2. In theory, the number of trials could go on forever.

                 3. The probability, p, of a success and the probability, q, of a failure is the

                 same for each trial. p + q = 1 and  . For example, the probability

                 of rolling a three when you throw one fair die is . This is true no matter

                 how many times you roll the die. Suppose you want to know the

                 probability of getting the first three on the fifth roll. On rolls one through

                 four, you do not get a face with a three. The probability for each of the

                 rolls is  , the probability of a failure. The probability of getting a

                 three on the fifth roll is

                 4. X = the number of independent trials until the first success.

              Poisson Distribution

             Another useful probability distribution is the Poisson distribution or waiting time
             distribution. This distribution is used to determine how many checkout clerks are needed
             to keep the waiting time in line to specified levels, how many telephone lines are needed
             to keep the system from overloading, and many other practical applications. The
             distribution gets its name from Simeon Poisson who presented it in 1837 as an extension
             of the binomial distribution.
             Here are the main characteristics of a Poisson experiment:

                   1. The Poisson probability distribution gives the probability of a number of
                       events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events happen with a
                       known average rate.

                   2. The events are independent of the time since the last event. For example, a book

                                                                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 199
                           editor might be interested in the number of words spelled incorrectly in a
                           particular book. It might be that, on the average, there are five words spelled
                           incorrectly in 100 pages. The interval is the 100 pages, and it is assumed that
                           there is no relationship between when misspellings occur.
                      3. The random variable X = the number of occurrences in the interval of interest.
                Example: You notice that a news reporter says "uh," on average, two times per broadcast.
                What is the probability that the news reporter says "uh" more than two times per
                broadcast?
                This is a Poisson problem because you are interested in knowing the number of times the
                news reporter says "uh" during a broadcast.

                  (a) What is the interval of interest?
                           a. one broadcast measured in minutes

                  (b) What is the average number of times the news reporter says "uh" during one broadcast?
                           a. 2

                  (c) Let X = ____. What values does X take on?
                           a. Let X = the number of times the news reporter says "uh" during one broadcast.

                  d. The probability question is P(__).
                           a.

                Notation for the Poisson: P = Poisson Probability Distribution Function

                Read this as "X is a random variable with a Poisson distribution." The parameter is
                                                the mean for the interval of interest. The mean is the number of

                occurrences that occur on average during the interval period.
                The formula for computing probabilities that are from a Poisson process is:

                where P(X) is the probability of X successes, is the expected number of successes based
                upon historical data, e is the natural logarithm approximately equal to 2.718, and X is the
                number of successes per unit, usually per unit of time.

200 AHMED FARID
In order to use the Poisson distribution, certain assumptions must hold. These are: the
probability of a success, , is unchanged within the interval, there cannot be simultaneous
successes within the interval, and finally, that the probability of a success among intervals
is independent, the same assumption of the binomial distribution.

In a way, the Poisson distribution can be thought of as a clever way to convert a
continuous random variable, usually time, into a discrete random variable by breaking up
time into discrete independent intervals. This way of thinking about the Poisson helps us
understand why it can be used to estimate the probability for the discrete random variable
from the binomial distribution. The Poisson is asking for the probability of a number of
successes during a period of time while the binomial is asking for the probability of a
certain number of successes for a given number of trials.

Example: Leah's answering machine receives about six telephone calls between 8 a.m.
and 10 a.m. What is the probability that Leah receives more than one call in the next 15
minutes?

Let X = the number of calls Leah receives in 15 minutes (the interval of interest is 15
minutes or hour)

If Leah receives, on average, six telephone calls in two hours, and there are eight 15

minutes intervals in two hours, then Leah receives  calls in 15 minutes, on

average. So,  for this problem.

Probability that Leah receives more than one telephone call in the next 15 minutes is
about 0.1734.

SET UP AND WORK WITH DISTRIBUTIONS FOR CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLES

This section will explain how to work with distributions for continuous random variables. It will
start with some definition and a calculus warm-up to help prepare you. The videos help explain the
concepts while there are problems after each short section to help check your understanding.

         Continuous Random Variables

        We now turn to continuous random variables. All random variables assign a number to each
        outcome in a sample space. Whereas discrete random variables take on a discrete set of possible
        values, continuous random variables have a continuous set of values.

        Computationally, to go from discrete to continuous we simply replace sums by integrals. It will
        help you to keep in mind that (informally) an integral is just a continuous sum.

                  Calculus Warmup

                Conceptually, you should be comfortable with two views of a definite integral.

      1.
      2.
The connection between the two is seen below in Figure 11:

Note: In calculus, you learned to compute integrals by finding antiderivatives. This is
important for calculations, but do not confuse this method for the reason we use
integrals. Our interest in integrals comes primarily from its interpretation as a "sum" and
to a much lesser extent its interpretation as area.

Probability Density Functions

 One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them
 online here: https://uta.pressbooks.pub/oert-mpsfundamentals/?p=271#oembed-34

Continuous Random Variables and Probability Density Functions

A continuous random variable takes a range of values, which may be finite in extent. Here
are a few examples of ranges:
Definition: A random variable X is continuous if there is a function f (x) such that for any

         we have

The function f (x) is called the probability density function (pdf).

The pdf always satisfies the following properties:

1.  (f is nonnegative).

2.  (This is equivalent to:

The probability density function f (x) of a continuous random variable is the analogue of
the probability mass function p (x) of a discrete random variable. Here are two significant
differences:

                      1. Unlike p (x), the pdf f (x) is not a probability. You have to integrate it to get
                           probability.

204 AHMED FARID
    2. Since f (x) is not a probability, there is no restriction that f (x) be less than or
        equal to 1.

Note: In property 2, we integrated over                 since we did not know the range of

values taken by X. Formally, this makes sense because we just define f (x) to be 0 outside

of the range of X. In practice, we would integrate between bounds given by the range of

X.

The Terms "Probability Mass" and "Probability Density"

Why do we use the terms mass and density to describe the pmf and pdf? What is the
difference between the two? The simple answer is that these terms are completely
analogous to the mass and density you saw in physics and calculus. We will review this
first for the probability mass function and then discuss the probability density function.
in extent.

Mass as a sum:

If masses                   and are set in a row at positions                                ,

then the total mass is

              Figure 13

We can define a `mass function' p (x) with              for    and

otherwise. In this notation the total mass is

The probability mass function behaves in exactly the same way, except it has the
dimension of probability instead of mass.

Mass as an integral of density:

Suppose you have a rod of length L meters with varying density f (x) kg/m. (Note the units
are mass/length).

Figure 14

If the density varies continuously, we must find the total mass of the rod by integration:

total mass =             .

                            FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 205
   This formula comes from dividing the rod into small pieces and `summing' up the mass of
   each piece. That is:

   In the limit as goes to zero the sum becomes the integral.

   The probability density function behaves exactly the same way, except it has units
   of probability/ (unit x) instead of kg/m. Indeed, the equation

                                              is exactly analogous to the above integral for total mass.

   While we are on a physics kick, note that for both discrete and continuous random
   variables, the expected value is simply the center of mass or balance point.

   Properties of Continuous Probability Density Functions

   The graph of a continuous probability distribution is a curve. Probability is represented
   by area under the curve. The curve is called the probability density function (pdf). We
   use the symbol f (x) to represent the curve. f (x) is the function that corresponds to the
   graph; we use the density function f (x) to draw the graph of the probability distribution.

   Area under the curve is given by a different function called the cumulative distribution
   function (cdf). The cumulative distribution function is used to evaluate probability as
   area. Mathematically, the cumulative probability density function is the integral of the
   pdf, and the probability between two values of a continuous random variable will be the
   integral of the pdf between these two values: the area under the curve between these
   values. Remember that the area under the pdf for all possible values of the random
   variable is one, certainty. Probability thus can be seen as the relative percent of certainty
   between the two values of interest.

 The outcomes are measured, not counted.

 The entire area under the curve and above the x-axis is equal to one.

 Probability is found for intervals of x values rather than for individual x values.

         is the probability that the random variable X is in the interval between

   the values c and d.            is the area under the curve, above the x-axis, to the

   right of c and the left of d.

         The probability that x takes on any single individual value is zero. The

   area below the curve, above the x-axis, and between x = c and x = c has no width, and

   therefore no area (area= 0). Since the probability is equal to the area, the probability is also

   zero.

         is the same as                   because probability is equal to area.

                We will find the area that represents probability by using geometry, formulas, technology,

206 AHMED FARID
or probability tables. In general, integral calculus is needed to find the area under the
curve for many probability density functions.
There are many continuous probability distributions. When using a continuous
probability distribution to model probability, the distribution used is selected to model
and fit the particular situation in the best way.
In this section, we will study the uniform distribution, the exponential distribution, and
the normal distribution. The following graphs illustrate these distributions.

             Figure 17

Cumulative Distribution Function

The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a continuous random variable X is defined
in exactly the same way as the cdf of a discrete random variable.

Note well that the definition is about probability. When using the cdf you should first
think of it as a probability. Then when you go to calculate it, you can use

Notes:

                 1. For discrete random variables, there was not much occasion to use the
                     cumulative distribution function. The cdf plays a far more prominent role for
                     continuous random variables.

                 2. As before, we started the integral at  because we did not know the precise

                 range of X. Formally, this still makes sense since  outside the range of

                 X. In practice, we will know the range and start the integral at the start of the

                 range.

                 3. In practice, we often say "X has distribution F (x)" rather than "X has cumulative
                     distribution function F (x)."

         The Uniform Distribution

        The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution and is concerned with
        events that are equally likely to occur. When working out problems that have a uniform
        distribution, be careful to not if the data is inclusive or exclusive of endpoints.
        The mathematical statement of the uniform distribution is

        Where a = the lowest value of x and b = the highest value of x.
        Formulas for the theoretical mean and standard deviation are

                  The Exponential Distribution

                The exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some
                specific occurs. For example, the amount of time (beginning now) until an earthquake

210 AHMED FARID
occurs has an exponential distribution. Other examples include the length of time, in
minutes, of long-distance business telephone calls, and the amount of time, in months, a
car battery lasts. It can be shown, too, that the value of the change that you have in your
pocket or purse approximately follows an exponential distribution.

Values for an exponential random variable occur in the following way. There are fewer
large values and more small values. For example, marketing studies have shown that the
amount of money customers spend in one trip to the supermarket follows an exponential
distribution. There are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer
people who spend large amounts of money.

Exponential distributions are commonly used in calculations of product reliability, or
length of time a produce lasts.

The random variable for the exponential distribution is continuous and often measures a

passage of time, although it can be used in other applications. Typical questions may be,

"what is the probability that some event will occur within the next x hours or days, or

what is the probability that some event will occur between  hours, or

what is the probability that the event will take more than hours to perform?" In short,

the random variable X equals (a) the time between events or (b) the passage of time to

complete an action, e.g., wait on a customer. The probability density function is given by:

Where    is the historical average waiting time and has a mean and standard deviation of
     .

In order to calculate probabilities for specific probability density functions, the
cumulative density function is used. The cumulative density function (cdf) is simply the
integral of the pdf and is:

Memorylessness of the Exponential Distribution

Say that the amount of time between customers for a postal clerk is exponentially
distributed with a mean of two minutes. Suppose that five minutes have elapsed since
the last customer arrived. Since an unusually long amount of time has now elapsed, it
would seem to be more likely for a customer to arrive within the next minute. With
the exponential distribution, this is not the case - the additional time spend waiting
for the next customer does not depend on how much time has already elapsed since
the last customer. This is referred to as the memoryless property. The exponential and
geometric probability density functions are the only probability functions that have the
memorylessmemoryless property. property. Specifically, the memoryless property says
that

For example, if five minutes have elapsed since the last customer arrives, then the

probability that more than one minute will elapse before the next customer arrives is

computed by using                                in the foregoing equation.

             This is the same probability as tat of waiting more than one minute for a customer to
             arrive after the previous arrival.

Relationship Between the Poisson and the Exponential Distribution

There is an interesting relationship between the exponential distribution and the Poisson
distribution. Suppose that the time that elapses between two successive events follows the
exponential distribution with a mean of units of time. Also assume that these times are
independent, meaning that the time between events is not affected by the times between
previous events. If these assumptions hold, then the number of events per unit of time
follows a Poisson distribution with mean . Recall that if X has the Poisson distribution
with mean , then

The formula for the exponential distribution:             . Where
average time between occurrences.

We see that the exponential is the cousin of the Poisson distribution, and they are linked
through this formula. There are important differences that make each distribution
relevant for different types of probability problems.

First, the Poisson has a discrete random variable, x =, where time; a continuous variable
is artificially broken into discrete pieces. We saw that the number of occurrences of an
event in a given time interval, x, follows the Poisson distribution.

For example, the number of times the telephone rings per hour. By contrast, the time
between occurrences follows the exponential distribution. For example, the telephone
just rang, how long will it be until it rings again? We are measuring length of time of
the interval, a continuous random variable, exponential, not events during an interval,
Poisson.

The Exponential Distribution v. the Poisson Distribution

A visual way to show both the similarities and differences between these two
distributions is with a timeline.

FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 213
Figure 19

The random variable for the Poisson distribution is discrete and thus counts events

during a given time period,  on Figure 19 above and calculates the probability of

that number occurring. The number of events, four in the graph is measured in counting

numbers; therefore, the random variable of the Poisson is a discrete random variable.

The exponential probability distribution calculates probabilities of the passage of time, a
continuous random variable. In Figure 19, this is shown as the bracket from to the next
occurrence of the event marked with a triangle.

Classic Poisson distribution questions are "how many people will arrive at my checkout
window in the next hour?"

Classic exponential distribution questions are "how long it will be until the next person
arrives," or a variant, "how long will the person remain here once they have arrived?"

Again, the formula for the exponential distribution is:

                We see immediately the similarity between the exponential formula and the Poisson
                formula.

                Both probability density functions are based upon the relationship between time and
                exponential growth or decay. The "e" in the formula is a constant with the approximate
                value of 2.71828 and is the base of the natural logarithmic exponential growth formula.
                When people say that something has grown exponentially this is what they are talking
                about.

                An example of the exponential and the Poisson will make clear the differences been the
                two. It will also show the interesting applications they have.

                Poisson Distribution

                Suppose that historically 10 customers arrive at the checkout lines each hour. Remember
                that this is still probability, so we have to be told these historical values. We see this is a
                Poisson probability problem.

214 AHMED FARID
We can put this information into the Poisson probability density function and get a
general formula that will calculate the probability of any specific number of customers
arriving in the next hour.

The formula is for any value of the random variable we chose, and so the x is put into the
formula. This is the formula:

As an example, the probability of 15 people arriving at the checkout counter in the next
hour would be

Here we have inserted x = 15 and calculated the probability that in the next hour 15
people will arrive is .061.

Exponential Distribution

If we keep the same historical facts that 10 customers arrive each hour, but we now are
interested in the service time a person spends at the counter, then we would use the
exponential distribution. The exponential probability function for any value of x, the
random variable, for this particular checkout counter historical data is:

To calculate , the historical average service time, we simply divide the number of people

that arrive per hour, 10, into the time period, one hour, and have  . Historically,

people spend 0.1 of an hour at the checkout counter, or 6 minutes. This explains the .1 in

the formula.

There is a natural confusion with in both the Poisson and exponential formulas. They
have different meanings, although they have the same symbol. The mean of the
exponential is one divided by the mean of the Poisson. If you are given the historical
number of arrivals, you have the mean of the Poisson. If you are given an historical length
of time between events, you have the mean of an exponential.

Continuing with our example at the checkout clerk; if we wanted to know the probability
that a person would spend 9 minutes or less checking out, then we use this formula. First,
we convert to the same time units which are parts of one hour. Nine minutes is 0.15 of
one hour. Next, we note that we are asking for a range of values. This is always the case
for a continuous random variable. We write the probability question as:

We can now put the numbers into the formula, and we have our result

                                                       FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 215
                The probability that a customer will spend 9 minutes or less checking out is 0.7769.
                We see that we have a high probability of getting out in less than nine minutes and a tiny
                probability of having 15 customers arriving in the next hour.

         The Normal Distribution

        The normal probability density function, a continuous distribution, is the most important of

216 AHMED FARID
all the distributions. It is widely used and even more widely abused. Its graph is bell-shaped.
You see the bell curve in almost all disciplines. Some of these include psychology, business,
economics, the sciences, nursing, and, of course, mathematics. Some of your instructors may
use the normal distribution to help determine your grade. Most IQ scores are normally
distributed. Often real-estate prices fit a normal distribution.
The normal distribution has two parameters (two numerical descriptive measures): the mean

     and the standard deviation . If X is a quantity to be measured that has a normal
distribution with mean and standard deviation , we designate this by writing the
following formula of the normal probability density function:

          Figure 21

The probability density function is a rather complicated function. Do not memorize it. It is not
necessary.

The curve is symmetric about a vertical line drawn through the mean, The mean is the same
as the median, which is the same as the mode, because the graph is symmetric about As
the notation indicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard
deviation. Note that this is unlike several probability density functions we have already studies,
such as the Poisson, where the mean is equal to and the standard deviation simply the square
root of the mean, or the binomial, where p is used to determine both the mean and standard
deviation. Since the area under the curve must equal one, a change in the standard deviation,

  , causes a change in the shape of the normal curve; the curve becomes fatter and wider or
skinnier and taller depending on . A change in causes the graph to shift to the left or right.
This means there are an infinite number of normal probability distributions. One of the special
interests is called the standard normal distribution.

         The Standard Normal Distribution

        The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution of standardized values
        called z--scores. A z-score is measure in units of the standard deviation.

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 217
The mean for the standard normal distribution is zero, and the standard deviation is one.

What this does is dramatically simplify the mathematical calculation of probabilities. Take

a moment and substitute zero and one in the appropriate places in the above formula and

you can see that the equation collapses into one that can be much more easily solved using

integral calculus. The transformation                    produces the distribution

. The value x in the given equation comes from a known normal distribution with

known mean and known standard deviation . The z-score tells how many standard

deviations a particular x is away from the mean.

Z-Scores

If X is a normally distributed random variable and       , then the z-score for a
particular x is:

The z-score tells you how many standard deviations the value x is above (to the right
of) or below (to the left of) the mean, . Values of x that are larger than the mean have
positive z-scores, and values of x that are smaller than the mean have negative z-scores. If
x equals the mean, then x has a z-score of zero.

Example: Suppose          . This says that X is a normally distributed random
variable with mean
                          and standard deviation         . Suppose                  . Then:

This means that     is two standard deviations           above or to the right of the

mean      .

Now suppose x = 1. Then:                                 (rounded to two decimal places).

This means that x = 1 is 0.67 standard deviations        below or to the left of the

mean      .

The Empirical Rule

If X is a random variable and has a normal distribution with mean                   and standard
deviation , then the Empirical Rule states the following:

                 About 68% of the x values lie between  of the mean (within one
                    standard deviation of the mean).                              (within two

                 About 95% of the x values lie between
                    standard deviations of the mean).

218 AHMED FARID
 About 99.7% of the x values lie between  of the mean (within three

standard deviations of the mean). Notice that almost all the x values lie within three

standard deviations of the mean.

Normal Distribution Properties

In 1809, Carl Friedrich Gauss published a monograph introducing several notions that
have become fundamental to statistics: the normal distribution, maximum likelihood
estimation, and the method of least squares. For this reason, the normal distribution is
also called the Gaussian distribution, and it is the most important continuous distribution.

                 2. Range:
                 3. Notation: normal

                 4. Density:

                 5. Distribution:     has no formula, so use tables or software such as "pnorm" in

                 R to compute F(x). (Will be discussed later in the module)

                 6. Models: Measurement error, intelligence/ability, height, averages of lots of data.

Here are some graphs of normal distributions. Note they are shaped like a bell curve. Note
also that as increases as they become more spread out.

                 Figure 23

Using the Normal Distribution

The shaded area in Figure 24 indicates the area to the right of x. This area is represented

by the probability                    . Normal tables provide the probability between the mean,

zero for the standard normal distribution, and a specific value such as . This is the

unshaded part of the graph from the mean to .

220 AHMED FARID
       Figure 24

Because the normal distribution is symmetrical, if were the same distance to the left of
the mean the area, probability, in the left tail, would be the same as the shaded area in the
right tail. Also, bear in mind that because of the symmetry of this distribution, one-half of
the probability is to the right of the mean and one-half is to the left of the mean.
Calculations of Probabilities
To find the probability for probability density functions with a continuous random
variable we need to calculate the area under the function across the values of X we are
interested in. For the normal distribution this seems a difficult task given the complexity
of the formula. There is, however, a simple way to get what we want. Here again is the
formula for the normal distribution:

Looking at the formula for the normal distribution it is not clear just how we are going
to solve for the probability doing it the same way we did it with the previous probability
functions. There we put the data into the formula and did the math.
To solve this puzzle, we start knowing that the area under a probability density function
is the probability.

                                                       FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 221
Figure 25: Normal distribution with a section shaded between x_1 and x_2.

This shows that the area between  is the probability as stated in the formula:

The mathematical tool needed to find the area under a curve is integral calculus. The

integral of the normal probability density function between the two points  is

the area under the curve between these two points and is the probability between these

two points.

Doing these integrals is no fun and can be very time consuming. But now, remembering
that there are an infinite number of normal distributions out there, we can consider
the one with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. This particular normal
distribution is given the name Standard Normal Distribution. Putting these values into
the formula it reduces to a very simple equation. We can now quite easily calculate all
probabilities for any value of x, for this particular normal distribution, that has a mean of
zero and a standard deviation of 1. They are presented in numerous ways. The table is the
most common presentation and is set up with probabilities for one-half the distribution
beginning with zero, the mean, and moving outward. The shaded area in the graph at the
top of the table in Statistical Tables represents the probability from zero to the specific Z
value noted on the horizontal axis, Z.

The only problem is that even with this table, it would be a ridiculous coincidence that
our data had a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The solution is to convert
the distribution we have with its mean and standard deviation to this new Standard
Normal Distribution. The Standard Normal has a random variable called Z.

                Using the standard normal table, typically called the normal table, to find the probability
                of one standard deviation, go to the Z column, reading down to 1.0 and then read at
                column 0. That number, 0.3413 is the probability from zero to 1 standard deviation. At
                the top of the table is the shaded area in the distribution which is the probability for one
                standard deviation. The table has solved our integral calculus problem. But only if our
                data has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.

222 AHMED FARID
             However, the essential point here is, the probability for one standard deviation on one
             normal distribution is the same on every normal distribution. If the population data set
             has a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 5 then the probability from 10 to 15, one
             standard deviation, is the same as from zero to 1, one standard deviation on the standard
             normal distribution. To compute probabilities, areas, for any normal distribution, we
             need only to convert the particular normal distribution to the standard normal
             distribution and look up the answer in the tables. As review, here again is the
             standardizing formula:

             where Z is the value on the standard normal distribution, X is the value from a normal
             distribution one wishes to convert to the standard normal,  and  are, respectively, the
             mean and standard deviation of that population. Note that the equation uses  and 
             which denotes population parameters. This is still dealing with probability, so we always
             are dealing with the population, with known parameter values and a known distribution.
             It is also important to note that because the normal distribution is symmetrical it does not
             matter if the z-score is positive or negative when calculating a probability. One standard
             deviation to the left (negative Z-score) covers the same area as one standard deviation to
             the right (positive Z-score). This fact is why the Standard Normal tables do not provide
             areas for the left side of the distribution. Because of this symmetry, the Z-score formula
             is sometimes written as:

             Where the vertical lines in the equation means the absolute value of the number. What
             the standardizing formula is really doing is computing the number of standard deviations
             X is from the mean of its own distribution.

Expectation, Variance and Standard Deviation for Continuous Random Variables

So far, we have looked at expected value, standard deviation, and variance for discrete random
variables. These summary statistics have the same meaning for continuous random variables:

 The expected value               is a measure of location or central tendency.
 The standard deviation  is a measure of the spread or scale.
 The variance
                                is the square of the standard deviation.

To move from discrete to continuous, we will simply replace the sums in the formulas by
integrals.

Expected Value of a Continuous Random Variable

Definition: Let X be a continuous random variable with range                      and probability

density function   . The expected value of X is defined by

Let us see how this compares with the formula for a discrete random variable:

The discrete formula says to take a weighted sum of the values                    , where the

weights are the probabilities  . Recall that    is a probability density. Its units are

prob/(unit of X).

So,              represents the probability that X is in an infinitesimal range of width

dx around x. Thus, we can interpret the formula for E(X) as a weighted integral of the

values x of X, where the weights are the probabilities f(x)dx.

As before, the expected value is also called the mean or average.

Example 1: Let                                  .

226 AHMED FARID
Answer: X has range [0,1] and density     . Therefore,

Not surprisingly the mean is at the midpoint of the range.

Example 2: Let X have a range                                  .

Answer:

Does it make sense that this X has mean in the right half of its range?
Yes. Since the probability density increases as x increases over the range, the average value
of x should be in the right half of the range.

                                 Figure 26

is "pulled" to the right of the midpoint 1 because there is more mass to the right.

                                          symmetric and has mean 0.

                 Properties of E(X)

                 The properties of E(X) for continuous random variables are the same as for discrete
                 ones:

                       1. If X and Y are random variables on a sample space, then

                 2. If a and b are constants, then

                 Example 5: In this example we verify that for           we have  .

                 Answer: Example (4) showed that for standard normal Z,           . We could

                 mimic the calculation there to show that              . Instead, we will use the

                 linearity properties of  .                     is a normal random variable we can

                 standardize it:

                 Inverting this formula, we have                . The linearity of expected value now
                 gives

Quantiles

Definition: The median of X is the value x for which                            , i.e. the value

of x such that                                     . In other words, X has equal probability of

being above or below the median, and each probability is therefore . In terms of the

cdf                               , we can equivalently define the median as the value x satisfying

                       .

Think: What is the median of Z?

Answer: By symmetry, the median is 0.

Example 11: Find the median of                     .

Answer: The cdf of                                 . So, the median is the value of x for which

                                  . Solving for x we find:  .

Think: In this case the median does not equal the mean of                       . Based on the graph

of the pdf of X can you argue why the median is to the left of the mean.

With respect to the pdf                is the value such that there is an area of

p to the left of and an area of        to the right of . In the examples below, note how

we can represent the quartile graphically using either area of the pdf or height of the cdf.

                           Percentiles, decile, quartiles

                        For convenience, quantiles are often described in terms of percentile, decile, or
                        quantiles. The 60th percentile is the same as the 0.6 quantile. For example, you are
                        in the 60th percentile for height if you are taller than 60 percent of the population,
                        i.e., the probability that you are taller than a randomly chosen person is 60 percent.
                        Likewise, deciles represent steps of 1/10. The third decile is the 0.3 quantile.
                        Quartiles are in steps of . Third quartile is the 0.75 quantile and the 75th
                        percentile.

         Poisson Model of Vehicle Arrivals

        The Poisson distribution is used to represent arrival patterns at a roadway location to conduct
        traffic queue and delay analysis. The distribution helps estimate the likelihood of n vehicles
        arriving in a specific time frame and the average arrival rate using data collected from roadway
        locations. For more information on the Poisson distribution, the reader is referred to in the
        above section labeled "Poisson Distributions."

         Distribution of Time-Mean Speed

        Spot speed studies during relatively congestion-free durations are conducted to estimate mean
        speed, modal speed, pace, standard deviation, and different percentile of speeds at a roadway
        location. 85th percentile speed estimated from a spot speed study is one of the crucial measures
        for determining the appropriate speed limit for the roadway section. Speed data for
        automobiles on roadway locations collected as part of the spot speed study typically follow the
        normal distribution discussed in "The Normal Distribution" section above.

         Traffic Safety

        Traffic safety analysis involves statistical methods that are used to process records of historical
        collisions or crash data. The negative binomial distribution is used to describe crash
        occurrences on roadway segments and intersections. The negative binomial model's
        formulation is a variant of Poisson's distribution (see "Poisson Distributions" above) that allows
        the standard deviation of the sample to exceed the mean.

   Key Takeaways

           Probability distribution functions (PDFs) discussed in the chapter are used in several
              transportation engineering modeling applications. For example, arrival patterns at a roadway
              location critical to queue analysis follow a Poisson's distribution while the time interval between
              arrivals follows a negative binomial distribution.

           Negative binomial distribution and its variants are also used to model collision frequency on road
              segments and intersections. These models, known as Safety Performance Functions, are used to
              estimate expected crash frequency on roadway entities.

           Data from spot speed studies are used to ensure that the roadway design context aligns with the
              posted speed limit. The speeds on the roadway segments with no congestion follow a normal

232 AHMED FARID
distribution, and the data are used to estimate the mean, median, and 85th percentile of the normal
distribution.

                                                  GLOSSARY: KEY TERMS

Bayes' Theorem[2] - a useful tool for calculating conditional probability. Bayes'Bernoulli trials.
theorem can be expressed as: 1, 2,...,  be a set of mutually exclusive events that together
form the sample space S. Let B be any event from the same sample space, such that ()>0. Then,

Bernoulli Trials[1] - an experiment with the following characteristics: (1) There are only two
possible outcomes called "success" and "failure" for each trial. (2) The probability p of a success is the
same for any trial (so the probability =1- of a failure is the same for any trial).
Binomial Experiment[1] - a statistical experiment that satisfies the following three conditions: (1)
There are a fixed number of trials, n. (2) There are only two possible outcomes, called "success" and,
"failure," for each trial. The letter p denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and q denotes, the
probability of a failure on one trial. (3) The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical
conditions.
Binomial Probability Distribution[1] - a discrete random variable that arises from Bernoulli trials;
there are a fixed number, n, of independent trials. "Independent" means that the result of any trial
(for example, trial one) does not affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted
under the same conditions. Under these circumstances the binomial random variable X is defined as
the number of successes in n trials. The mean is = and the standard deviation is

The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is

Combination[2]- a combination is a selection of all or part of a set of objects, without regard to the

order in which objects are selected

Conditional Probability[1] - the likelihood that an event will occur given that another event has

already occurred.

Discrete Variable / continuous variable[2]- if a variable can take on any value between its minimum

value and its maximum value, it is called a continuous variable; otherwise it is called a discrete variable

Expected Value[2] - the mean of the discrete random variable X is also called the expected value of
X. Notationally, the expected value of X is denoted by ().

Exponential Distribution[1] - a continuous random variable that appears when we are interested

in the intervals of time between some random events, for example, the length of time between

emergency arrivals at a hospital. The mean is          and the standard deviation is  . The

probability                          density           function                                      is

Geometric Distribution[1] - a discrete random variable that arises from the Bernoulli trials; the
trials are repeated until the first success. The geometric variable X is defined as the number of trials

                                                                                FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 233
until the first success. The mean is

The probability of exactly x failures before the first success is given by the formula:
(=)=(1-)-1 where one wants to know probability for the number of trials until the first

success: the xth trial is the first success. An alternative formulation of the geometric distribution asks

the question: what is the probability of x failures until the first success? In this formulation the trial

that resulted in the first success is not counted. The formula for this presentation of the geometric is:

(=)=(1-). The expected value in this form of the geometric distribution is               . The

easiest way to keep these two forms of the geometric distribution straight is to remember that p is

the probability of success and (1-) is the probability of failure. In the formula the exponents simply

count the number of successes and number of failures of the desired outcome of the experiment. Of

course the sum of these two numbers must add to the number of trials in the experiment.

Geometric Experiment[1] - a statistical experiment with the following properties: (1) There are one

or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success. (2) In theory, the

number of trials could go on forever. There must be at least one trial. (3) The probability, p, of a

success and the probability, q, of a failure do not change from trial to trial.

Independent[2] - two events are independent when the occurrence of one does not affect the

probability of the occurrence of the other

Mean[2]- a mean score is an average score, often denoted by . It is the sum of individual scores

divided by the number of individuals.

Memoryless Property[1] - For an exponential random variable X, the memoryless property is the

statement that knowledge of what has occurred in the past has no effect on future probabilities.

This means that the probability that X exceeds +, given that it has exceeded x, is the same as

the probability that X would exceed t if we had no knowledge about it. In symbols we say that

                                       .

Multiplication Rule[2] - If events A and B come from the same sample space, the probability that

both A and B occur is equal to the probability the event A occurs time the probability that B occurs,

given that A has occurred.                  .

Normal Distribution[1] - a continuous random variable with pdf                           , where

 is the mean of the distribution and  is the standard deviation; notation:
                                                     , the random variable, Z, is called the standard normal

distribution
Permutation[2]- an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, with regard to the order of the
arrangement.
Poisson Distribution[1] - If there is a known average of  events occurring per unit time, and
these events are independent of each other, then the number of events X occurring in one unit of
time has the Poisson distribution. The probability of x events occurring in one unit time is equal to

Poisson Probability Distribution[1] - a discrete random variable that counts the number of times

a certain event will occur in a specific interval; characteristics of the variable: (1) the probability that

the event occurs in a given interval is the same for all intervals. (2) the events occur with a known

mean and independently of the time since the last event. The distribution is defined by the mean 

of the event in the interval. The mean is =. The standard deviation is           . The probability

234 AHMED FARID
of having exactly x successes in r trials is            . The Poisson distribution is often used to

approximate the binomial distribution, when n is "large" and p is "small" (a general rule is that np

should be greater than or equal to 25 and p should be less than or equal to 0.01).

Probability Distribution Function (PDF)[1]- a mathematical description of a discrete random

variable, given either in the form of an equation (formula) or in the form of a table listing all the

possible outcomes of an experiment and the probability associated with each outcome.

Quartile[2] - Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. The values that divide

each part are called the first, second, and third quartiles; and they are denoted by

1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Random Variable[1] - a characteristic of interest in a population being studied; common notation for

variables are upper case Latin letters X, Y, Z..; common notation for a specific value from the domain

(set of all possible values of a variable) are lower case Latin letters x, y, and z. For example, if X is the

number of children in a family, then x represents a specific integer 0, 1, 2, 3,... Variables in statistics

differ from variables in intermediate algebra in the two following ways: (1) The domain of the random

variable is not necessarily a numerical set; the domain may be expressed in words; for example, if X =

hair color then domain is {black, blonde, gray, green, orange}. (2) We can tell what specific value x the

random variable X takes only after performing the experiment.

Standard Deviation[2] - The standard deviation is a numerical value used to indicate how widely

individuals in a group vary. If individual observations vary greatly from the group mean, the standard

deviation is big; and vice versa. It is important to distinguish between the standard deviation of

a population and the standard deviation of a sample. They have different notation, and they are

computed differently. The standard deviation of a population is denoted by  and the standard

deviation of a sample, by 

Standard Normal Distribution[1] - a continuous random variable ~(0,1); when X follows the

standard normal distribution, it is often noted as ~(0,1).

Uniform Distribution[1] - a continuous random variable that has equally likely outcomes over the

domain, <<; it is often referred as the rectangular distribution because the graph of the pdf

has the form of a rectangle. The mean is                and the standard deviation is

The  probability                              density          function                is

Variance[2] - the variance is a numerical value used to indicate how widely individuals in a group
vary. If individual observations vary greatly from the group mean, the variance is big; and vice versa.
It is important to distinguish between the variance of a population and the variance of a sample. They
have different notation, and they are computed differently. The variance of a population is denoted
by 2; and the variance of a sample, by 2

Z-Score[1] - the linear transformation of the form                                     ; if this

transformation is applied to any normal distribution ~(,) the result is the standard normal

distribution ~(0,1). If this transformation is applied to any specific value x of the random variable

with mean  and standard deviation , the result is called the z-score of x. The z-score allows us to

compare data that are normally distributed but scaled differently. A z-score is the number of standard

deviations a particular x is away from its mean value.

association between variables, e.g., travel speed and congestion as measured by traffic density on the
road.

Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit theorem for Sample Means

The sampling distribution is a theoretical distribution. It is created by taking many samples
of size n from a population. Each sample mean is then treated like a single observation of this
new distribution, the sampling distribution. The genius of thinking this way is that it recognizes
that when we sample, we are creating an observation and that observation must come from
some particular distribution. The Central Limit Theorem answers the question: from what
distribution dis a sample mean come? If this is discovered, then we can treat a sample mean just
like any other observation and calculate probabilities about what values it might take on. We
have effectively moved from the world of statistics where we know only what we have from the
sample to the world of probability where we know the distribution from which the same mean
came and the parameters of that distribution.

The reasons that one samples a population are obvious. The time and expense of checking every
invoice to determine its validity or every shipment to see if it contains all the items may well
exceed the cost of errors in billing or shipping. For some products, sampling would require
destroying them, called destructive sampling. One such example is measuring the ability of a
metal to withstand saltwater corrosion for parts on ocean going vessels.

Sampling thus raises an important question; just which sample was drawn. Even if the sample
were randomly drawn, there are theoretically an almost infinite number of samples. With just
100 items, there are more than 75 million unique samples of size five that can be drawn. If six
are in the sample, the number of possible samples increases to just more than one billion. Of the
75 million possible samples, then, which one did you get? If there is variation in the items to be
sampled, there will be variation in the samples. One could draw an "unlucky" sample and make
very wrong conclusions concerning the population. This recognition that any sample we draw
is really only one from a distribution of samples provides us with what is probably the single
most important theorem is statistics: the Central Limit Theorem. Without the Central Limit
Theorem, it would be impossible to proceed to inferential statistics from simple probability
theory. In its most basic form, the Central Limit Theorem states that regardless of the
underlying probability density function of the population data, the theoretical distribution of
the means of samples from the population will be normally distributed. In essence, this says that
the mean of a sample should be treated like an observation drawn from a normal distribution.
The Central Limit Theorem only holds if the sample size is "large enough" which has been
shown to be only 30 observations or more.

Figure 1 graphically displays this very important proposition.

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 243
                    Figure 1

Notice that the horizontal axis in the top panel is labeled X. These are the individual
observations of the population. This is the unknown distribution of the population values. The
graph is purposefully drawn all squiggly to show that it does not matter just how odd ball
it really is. Remember, we will never know what this distribution looks like, or its mean or
standard deviation for that matter.

The horizontal axis in the bottom panel is labeled . This is the theoretical distribution called
the sampling distribution of the means. Each observation on this distribution is a sample mean.
All these sample means were calculated from individual samples with the same sample size. The
theoretical sampling distribution contains all of the sample mean values from all the possible
samples that could have been taken from the population. Of course, no one would ever actually
take all of these samples, but if they did this is how they would look. And the Central Limit
Theorem says that they will be normally distributed.

The Central Limit Theorem goes even further and tells us the mean and standard deviation of
this theoretical distribution.

                                                                      Table 1

The practical significant of The Central Limit Theorem is that now we can compute

probabilities for drawing a sample mean, , in just the same way as we did for drawing specific

observations,  s, when we knew the population mean and standard deviation and that the

population data were normally distributed. The standardizing formula has to be amended to

recognize that the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution, sometimes, called

the standard error of the mean, are different from those of the population distribution, but

otherwise nothing has changed. The new standardizing formula is

Notice that in the first formula has been changed to simply in the second version. The
reason is that mathematically it can be shown that the expected value of is equal to .

Using the Central Limit Theorem

Law of Large Numbers

The law of large numbers says that if you take samples of larger and larger size from any

population, then the mean of the sampling distribution,  tends to get close and close to

the true population mean, . From the Central Limit Theorem, we know that as n gets larger

                                 FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 245
and larger, the sample means follow a normal distribution. The larger n gets, the smaller the

standard deviation of the sampling distribution gets. (Remember that the standard deviation

for sampling distribution of           . This means that the sample mean must be closer to

the population mean as n increases. We can say that is the value that the sample means
approach as n gets larger. The Central Limit Theorem illustrates the law of large numbers.

Indeed, there are two critical issues that flow from the Central Limit Theorem and the
application of the Law of Large numbers to it. These are listed below.

1. The probability density function of the sampling distribution of means is normally
    distributed regardless of the underlying distribution of the population observations
    and

2. Standard deviation of the sampling distribution decreases as the size of the samples
    that were used to calculate the means for the sampling distribution increases.

Taking these in order. It would seem counterintuitive that the population may have any
distribution and the distribution of means coming from it would be normally distributed.
With the use of computers, experiments can be simulated that show the process by which the
sampling distribution changes as the sample size is increased. These simulations show visually
the results of the mathematical proof of the Central Limit Theorem.

Figure 2 shows a sampling distribution. The mean has been marked on the horizontal axis of
the and the standard deviation has been written to the right above the distribution. Notice
that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the original standard deviation
of the population, divided by the sample size. We have already seen that as the sample size
increases the sampling distribution becomes closer and closer to the normal distribution. As
this happens, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution changes in another way; the
standard deviation decreases as n increases. At very large n, the standard deviation of the
sampling distribution becomes very small and at infinity it collapses on top of the population
mean. This is what it means that the expected value of is the population mean, .

                             Figure 2

246 AHMED FARID
At non-extreme values of n, this relationship between the standard deviation of the sampling
distribution and the sample size plays a very important part in our ability to estimate the
parameters in which we are interested.
Figure 3 shows three sampling distributions. The only change that was made is the sample size
that was used to get the sample means for each distribution. As the sample size increases, n goes
from 10 to 30 to 50, the standard deviations of the respective sampling distributions decrease
because the sample size is in the denominator of the standard deviations of the sampling
distributions.

                  Figure 3

The implications for this are very important. Figure 4 shows the effect of the sample size on the
confidence we will have in our estimates. These are two sampling distributions from the same
population. One sampling distribution was created with samples of size 10 and the other with
samples of size 50. All other things constant, the sampling distribution with sample size 50 has
a smaller standard deviation that causes the graph to be higher and narrower. The important
effect of this is that for the same probability of one standard deviation from the mean, this
distribution covers much less of a range of possible values than the other distribution. One
standard deviation is marked on the axis for each distribution. This is shown by the two
arrows that are plus or minus one standard deviation for each distribution. If the probability
that the true mean is one standard deviation away from the mean, then for the sampling
distribution with the smaller sample size, the possible range of values is much greater. A simple
question is, would you rather have a sample mean from the narrow, tight distribution, or the
flat, wide distribution as the estimate of the population mean? Your answer tells us why people
intuitively will always choose data from a large sample rather than a small sample. The sample
mean they are getting is coming from a more compact distribution.

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 247
Figure 4

The Central Limit Theorem for Proportions

The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the point estimate for the sample mean, , comes from
a normal distribution of . This theoretical distribution is called the sampling distribution of

    . We now investigate the sampling distribution for another important parameter we wish to
estimate, p from the binomial probability density function.

If the random variable is discrete, such as for categorical data, then the parameter we wish to

estimate is the population proportion. This is, of course, the probability of drawing a success in

any one random draw. Unlike the case just discussed for a continuous random variable where

we did not know the population distribution of X's, here we actually know the underlying

probability density function for these data; it is the binomial. The random variable is X = the

number of successes and the parameter we wish to know is p, the probability of drawing a

success which is of course the proportion of successes in the population. The question at issue

is: from what distribution was the sample proportion,  drawn? The sample size is n

and X is the number of successes found in that sample. This is a parallel question that was

just answered by the Central Limit Theorem: from what distribution was the sample mean,

drawn? We saw that once we knew that the distribution was the Normal distribution then we

were able to create confidence intervals for the population parameter, . We will also use this

same information to test hypotheses about the population mean later. We wish now to be able

to develop confidence intervals for the population parameter "p" from the binomial probability

density function.

        In order to find the distribution from which sample proportions come we need to develop the
        sampling distribution of sample proportions just as we did for sample means. So again, imagine
        that we randomly sample say 50 people and ask them if they support the new school bond issue.
        From this we find a sample proportion, p', and graph it on the axis of p's. We do this again and
        again etc., etc. until we have the theoretical distribution of p's. Some sample proportions will
        show high favorability toward the bond issue and others will show low favorability because

248 AHMED FARID
random sampling will reflect the variation of views within the population. What we have done
can be seen in Figure 5. The top panel is the population distributions of probabilities for each
possible value of the random variable X. While we do not know what the specific distribution
looks like because we do not know p, the population parameter, we do know that it must look
something like this. In reality, we do not know either the mean or the standard deviation of this
population distribution, the same difficulty we faced when analyzing the X's previously.

Figure 5

Figure 5 places the mean on the distribution of population probabilities as  but of

course we do not actually know the population mean because we do not know the population

probability of success, p. Below the distribution of the population values is the sampling

distribution of p's. Again, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that this distribution is normally

distributed just like the case of the sampling distribution for . This sampling distribution

also has a mean, the mean of the p's, and a standard deviation, .

Importantly, in the case of the analysis of the distribution of sample means, the Central Limit
Theorem told us the expected value of the mean of the sample means in the sampling
distribution, and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. Again, the Central Limit
Theorem provides this information for the sampling distribution for proportions. The answers
are:

1. The expected value of the mean of sampling distribution of sample proportions, , is

                                                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 249
         the population proportion, p.

     2. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample proportions, , is the
         population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, n.

Both these conclusions are the same as we found for the sampling distribution for sample
means. However, in this case, because mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution
both rely upon p, the formula for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution requires
algebraic manipulation to be useful. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution for
proportions is thus:

Mean                                         Sample
Standard deviation

Table 2 summarizes these results and shows the relationship between the population, sample,
and sampling distribution.

Reviewing the formula for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution for proportions

we see that as n increases the standard deviation decreases. This is the same observation we

made for the standard deviation for the sampling distribution for means. Again, as the sample

size increases, the point estimate for either             is found to come from a distribution with

a narrower and narrower distribution. We concluded that with a given level of probability, the

range from which the point estimate comes is smaller as the sample size, n, increases.

         Introduction to Confidence Intervals

        Suppose you were trying to determine the mean rent of a two-bedroom apartment in your
        town. You might look in the classified section of the newspaper, write down several rents listed,

250 AHMED FARID
and average them together. You would have obtained a point estimate of the true mean. If you
are trying to determine the percentage of times you make a basket when shooting a basketball,
you might count the number of shots you make and divide that by the number of shots you
attempted. In this case, you would have obtained a point estimate for the true proportion the
parameter p in the binomial probability density function.

We use sample data to make generalizations about an unknown population. This part of
statistics is called inferential statistics. The sample data help us to make an estimate of a
population parameter. We realize that the point estimate is most likely not the exact value of the
population parameter, but close to it. After calculating point estimates, we construct interval
estimates, called confidence intervals. What statistics provides us beyond a simple average, or
point estimate, is an estimate to which we can attach a probability of accuracy, what we will call
a confidence level. We make inferences with a known level of probability.

If you worked in the marketing department of an entertainment company, you might be
interested in the mean number of songs a consumer downloads a month from iTunes. If so, you
could conduct a survey and calculate the sample mean, , and the sample standard deviation,
s. You would use to estimate the population mean and s to estimate the population standard
deviation. The same mean, , is the point estimate for the population mean, . The sample
standard deviation, s, is the point estimate for the population standard deviation, .

and s are each called a statistic.

A confidence interval is another type of estimate but, instead of being just one number, it is an
interval of numbers. The interval of numbers is a range of values calculated from a given set of
sample data. The confidence interval is likely to include the unknown population parameter.

Suppose for the iTunes examples, we do not know the population mean , but we do know that

the population standard deviation is    and our sample size is 100. Then, by the Central

Limit Theorem, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means is

.

The Empirical Rule, which applies to the normal distribution, says that in approximately 95%

of the samples, the same mean, , will be within two standard deviations of the population mean

. For our iTunes example, two standard deviations is  . The sample mean is

likely to be within 0.2 units of .

Because is within 0.2 units of which is unknown, then is likely to be within 0.2 units of

with 95% probability. The population mean is contained in an interval whose lower number

is calculated by taking the sample mean and subtracting two standard deviations

and whose upper number is calculated by taking the sample mean and adding two standard

deviations. In other words, is between                in 955 of all the samples.

For the iTunes example, suppose that a sample produced a sample mean  . Then with 95%
probability the unknown population mean is between

   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 251
We say that we are 95% confident that the unknown population mean number of songs
downloaded from iTunes per month is between 1.8 and 2.2. The 95% confidence interval is
(1.8, 2.2). Please note that we talked in terms of 95% confidence using the empirical rule. The
empirical rule for two standard deviations is only approximately 95% of the probability under
the normal distribution. To be precise, two standard deviations under a normal distribution is
actually 95.44% of the probability. To calculate the exact 95% confidence level, we would use
1.96 standard deviations.

The 95% confidence interval implies two possibilities. Either the interval (1.8, 2.2) contains the
true mean ">, or our sample produce an that is not within 0.2 units of the true mean ">.
The first possibility happens for 95% of well-chosen samples. It is important to remember that
the second possibility happens for 5% of samples, even though correct procedures are followed.

Remember that a confidence interval is created for an unknown population parameter like the
population mean, ">.

For the confidence interval for a mean the formula would be:

Or written another way as:

Where s is the sample mean. a is determined by the level of confidence desired by the

analyst, and     is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution for means given to us

by the Central Limit Theorem.

A Confidence Interval for a Population Standard Deviation, Known or Large Sample Size

A confidence interval for a population mean, when the population standard deviation is known
based on the conclusion of the Central Limit Theorem that the sampling distribution of the
sample means follow an approximately normal distribution.

Calculating the Confidence Interval

Consider the standardizing formula for the sampling distribution developed in the discussion
of the Central Limit Theorem:

Notice that is substituted for  - because we know that the expected value of           - is

from the Central Limit Theorem and   - is replaced with  , also from the Central

Limit Theorem.

In this formula we know         and n, the sample size. (In actuality we do not know the

population standard deviation, but we do have a point estimate for it, s, from the sample we

252 AHMED FARID
took. More on this later.) What we do not know is              We can solve for either one of
these in terms of the other. Solving for "> in terms of      gives:

Remembering that the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the distribution of the , the
sampling distribution for means, is normal, and that the normal distribution is symmetrical, we
can rearrange terms thus:

This is the formula for a confidence interval for the mean of a population.

Notice that has been substituted for in this equation. This is where the statistician must

make a choice. The analyst must decide the level of confidence they wish to impose on the

confidence interval. is the probability that the interval will not contain the true population

mean. The confidence level is defined as                 is the number of standard deviations

lies from the mean with a certain probability. If we chose,  we are asking for the

95% confidence interval because we are setting the probability that the true mean lies within

the range at 0.95. If we set at 1.64 we are asking for the 90% confidence interval because

we have set the probability at 0.90. These numbers can be verified by consulting the Standard

Normal table. Divide either 0.95 or 0.90 in half and find that probability inside the body of the

table. Then read on the top and left margins the number of standard deviations it takes to get

this level of probability.

                                          Table 3

                            Confidence Level

                            0.80                   1.28

                            0.90                   1.645

                            0.95                   1.96

                            0.99                   2.58

In reality, we can set whatever level of confidence we desire simply by changing the value
in the formula. It is the analyst's choice. Common convention in Economics and most social
sciences sets confidence intervals at either 90, 95, or 99 percent levels. Levels less than 90%
are considered of little value. The level of confidence of a particular interval estimate is called

              .

Let us say we know that the actual population mean number of iTunes downloads is 2.1. The
true population mean falls within the range of the 95% confidence interval. There is absolutely
nothing to guarantee that this will happen. Further, if the true mean falls outside of the
interval, we will never know it. We must always remember that we will never ever know
the true mean. Statistics simply allows us, with a given level of probability (confidence), to say
that the true mean is within the range calculated.

Changing the Confidence Level or Sample Size

                            FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 253
        Here again is the formula for a confidence interval for an unknown population mean assuming
        we know the population standard deviation:

        It is clear that the confidence interval is driven by two things, the chosen level of confidence, ,
        and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The standard deviation of the sampling
        distribution is further affected by two things, the standard deviation of the population and
        sample size we chose for our data. Here we wish to examine the effects of each of the choices
        we have made on the calculated confidence interval, the confidence level, and the sample size.

        For a moment we should ask just what we desire in a confidence interval. Our goal was to
        estimate the population mean from a sample. We have forsaken the hope that we will ever
        find the true population mean, and population standard deviation for that matter, for any
        case except where we have an extremely small population and the cost of gathering the data
        of interest is very small. In all other cases we must rely on samples. With the Central Limit
        Theorem, we have the tools to provide a meaningful confidence interval with a given level of
        confidence, meaning a known probability of being wrong. By meaningful confidence interval
        we mean one that is useful. Imagine that you are asked for a confidence interval for the ages
        of your classmates. You have taken a sample and find a mean of 19.8 years. You wish to be
        very confident, so you report an interval between 9.8 years and 29.8 years. This interval would
        certainly contain the true population mean and have a very high confidence level. However,
        it hardly qualifies as meaningful. The very best confidence interval is narrow while having
        high confidence. There is a natural tension between these two goals. The higher the level of
        confidence the wider the confidence interval as the case of the students' ages above. We can see
        this tension in the equation for the confidence interval.

        The confidence interval will increase in width as increases, increases as the level of
        confidence increases. There is a tradeoff between the level of confidence and the width of
        the interval. Now let us look at the formula again and we see that the sample size also plays
        an important role in the width of the confidence interval. The sample size, n, shows up in
        the denominator of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. As the sample size
        increases, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution decreases and thus the width
        of the confidence interval, while holding constant the level of confidence. Again, we see the
        importance of having large samples for our analysis although we then face a second constraint,
        the cost of gathering data.

        Calculating the Confidence Interval: An Alternative Approach

        Another way to approach confidence intervals is through the use of something called the Error
        Bound (margin of error). The Error Bound gets its name from the recognition that it provides
        the boundary of the interval derived from the standard error of the sampling distribution. In the
        equations above it is seen that the interval is simply the estimated mean, sample mean, plus or
        minus something. That something is the Error Bound and is driven by the probability we desire

254 AHMED FARID
to maintain in our estimate, , times the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The
Error Bound for a mean is given the name, Error Bound Mean, or EBM (or margin of error,
M.O.E.).

To construct a confidence interval for a single unknown population, mean ">, where the
population standard deviation is known, we need as an estimate for "> and we need the
margin of error. Here, the margin of error (EBM) is called the error bound for a population
mean. The sample mean is the point estimate of the unknown population mean ">.

The confidence interval estimate will have the form:

(Point estimate - error bound, point estimate + error bound) or, in symbols,

The mathematical formula for this confidence interval is:

The margin of error (EBM) depends on the confidence level (abbreviated CL). The confidence
level is often considered the probability that the calculated confidence interval estimate will
contain the true population parameter. However, it is more accurate to state that the confidence
level is the percent of confidence intervals that contain the true population parameter when
repeated samples are taken. Most often, it is the choice of the person constructing the
confidence interval to choose a confidence level of 90% or higher because that person wants to
be reasonably certain of his or her conclusions.

There is another probability called alpha               is related to the confidence level, CL. is

the probability that the interval does not contain the unknown population parameter.

Mathematically,  .

A confidence interval for a population mean with a known standard deviation is based on

the fact that the sampling distribution of the sample means follow an approximately normal

distribution. Suppose that our sample has a mean of        and we have constructed the 90%

confidence interval (5, 15) where EMB = 5.

To get a 90% confidence interval, we must include the central 90% of the probability of the

normal distribution. If we include the central 90%, we leave out a total of  in both

tails, or 5% in each tail, of the normal distribution.

                    FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 255
                       Figure 6

To capture the central 90%, we must go out 1.645 standard deviations on either side of the
calculated sample mean. The value 1.645 is the z-score from a standard normal probability
distribution that puts an area of 0.90 in the center, an area of 0.05 in the far-left tail, and an area
of 0.05 in the far-right tail.

It is important that the standard deviation used must be appropriate for the parameter we are
estimating, so in this section we need to use the standard deviation that applies to the sampling
distribution for mean which we studied with the Central Limit Theorem and is, .

Calculating the Confidence Interval Using EBM

To construct a confidence interval, estimate for an unknown population mean, we need data
from a random sample. The steps to construct and interpret the confidence interval are listed
below.

 Calculate the sample mean from the sample data. Remember, in this section we know
   the population standard deviation .

 Find the z-score from the standard normal table that corresponds to the confidence level
   desired.

 Calculate the error bound EBM.
 Construct the confidence interval.
 Write a sentence that interprets the estimate in the context of the situation in the problem.

Finding the z-score for the Stated Confidence Level

When we know the population standard deviation , we use a standard normal distribution

to calculate the error bound EBM and construct the confidence interval. We need to find the

value of z that puts an area equal to the confidence level (in decimal form) in the middle of the

standard normal distribution  .

256 AHMED FARID
The confidence level, CL, is the area in the middle of the standard normal distribution.
                             is the area that is split equally between the two tails. Each of the tails

contains an area equal to .

The z-score that has an area to the right of is denoted by

For example, when

The area to the right of                                                     is

                              , using a standard normal probability table. We will see later that we
can use a different probability table, the Student's t-distribution, for finding the number of
standard deviations of commonly used levels of confidence.

A Confidence Interval for a Population Standard Deviation Unknown, Small Sample Case

In practice, we rarely known the population standard deviation. In the past, when the sample
size was large, this did not present a problem to statisticians. They used the sample standard
deviation s as an estimate for and proceeded as before to calculate a confidence interval with
close enough results. Statisticians ran into problems when the sample size was small. A small
sample size caused inaccuracies in the confidence interval.

William S. Goset (1876-1937) of the Guinness brewery in Dublin, Ireland ran into this problem.
His experiments with hops and barely produced very few samples. Just replacing with s did
not produce accurate results when he tried to calculate a confidence interval. He realized that
he could not use a normal distribution for the calculation; he found that the actual distribution
depends on the sample size. This problem led him to "discover" what is called the Student's t-
distribution. The name comes from the fact that Gosset wrote under the pen name "A Student."

Up until the mid-1970s, some statisticians used the normal distribution approximation for
large sample sizes and used the Student's t-distribution only for sample sizes of at most 30
observations.

If you draw a simple random sample of size n from a population with mean "> and unknown

population standard deviation and calculate the t-score  , then the t-scores follow

a Student's t-distribution with n - 1 degrees of freedom. The t-score has the same
interpretation as the z-score. It measures how far in standard deviation units is from its mean

  . For each sample size n, there is a different Student's t-distribution.

258 AHMED FARID
The degrees of freedom, n - 1, come from the calculation of the sample standard deviation

s. Remember when we first calculated a sample standard deviation, we divided the sum of the

squared deviations by  , but we used n deviations  to calculate s. Because

the sum of the deviations is zero, we can find the last deviation once we know the other

deviations. The other  deviations can change or vary freely. We call the number           the

degrees of freedom (df) in recognition that one is lost in the calculations. The effect of losing a

degree of freedom is that the t-value increases, and the confidence interval increases in width.

Properties of the Student's t-distribution

        The graph for the Student's t-distribution is similar to the standard normal curve and at
           infinite degrees of freedom it is the normal distribution. You can confirm this by reading
           the bottom line at infinite degrees of freedom for a familiar level of confidence, e.g., at
           column 0.05, 95% level of confidence, we find the t-value of 1.96 at infinite degrees of
           freedom.

        The mean for the Student's t-distribution is zero and the distribution is symmetric about
           zero, again like the standard normal distribution.

        The Student's t-distribution has more probability in its tails than the standard normal
           distribution because the spread of the t-distribution is greater than the spread of the
           standard normal. So, the graph of the Student's t-distribution will be thicker in the tails
           and shorter in the center than the graph of the standard normal distribution.

        The exact shape of the Student's t-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom. As the
           degrees of freedom increases, the graph of Student's t-distribution becomes more like the
           graph of the standard normal distribution.

        The underlying population of individual observations is assumed to be normally
           distributed with unknown population mean and unknown population standard
           deviation . This assumption comes from the Central Limit Theorem because the
           individual observations in this case are the of the sample distribution. The size of the
           underlying population is generally not relevant unless it is very small. If it is normal, then
           the assumption is met and does not need discussion.

A probability table for the Student's t-distribution is used to calculate t-values at various
commonly used levels of confidence. The table gives t-scores that correspond to the confidence
level (column) and degrees of freedom (row). When using a t-table, note that some tables are
formatted to show the confidence level in the column headings, while the column headings in
some tables may show only corresponding area in one or both tails. Notice that at the bottom
the table will show the t-value for infinite degrees of freedom. Mathematically, as the degrees of
freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution. You can find
familiar Z-values by looking in the relevant alpha column and reading value in the last row.

A Student's t-table gives t-scores given the degrees of freedom and the right-tailed probability.

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 259
The Student's t-distribution has one of the most desirable properties of the normal: it is
symmetrical. What the Student's t-distribution does is spread out the horizontal axis, so it takes
a larger number of standard deviations to capture the same amount of probability. In reality
there are an infinite number of Student's t-distributions, one for each adjustment to the sample
size. As the sample size increases, the Student's t-distribution become more and more like
the normal distribution. When the sample size reaches 30 the normal distribution is usually
substituted for the Student's t because they are so much alike. This relationship between the
Student's t-distribution and the normal distribution is shown in Figure 8.

                           Figure 8

Here is the confidence interval for the mean for cases when the sample size is smaller than 30
and we do not know the population standard deviation, :

distributions, one for each sample size. is the symbol for the degrees of freedom of the

distribution and depends on the size of the sample. Often df is used to abbreviate degrees of

freedom. For this type of problem, the degrees of freedom is  , where n is the sample

size. To look up a probability in the Student's t table we have to know the degrees of freedom in

the problem.

     A Confidence Interval for a Population Proportion

    During an election year, we see articles in the newspaper that state confidence intervals in
    terms of proportions or percentages. For example, a poll for a particular candidate running for
    president might show that the candidate has 40% of the vote within three percentage points (if
    the sample is large enough). Often, election polls are calculated with 95% confidence, so, the
    pollsters would be 95% confident that the true proportion of voters who favored the candidate
    would be between 0.37 and 0.43.
    The procedure to find the confidence interval for a population proportion is similar to that
    for the population mean, but the formulas are a bit different although conceptually identical.
    While the formulas are different, they are based upon the same mathematical foundation given
    to us by the Central Limit Theorem. Because of this we will see the same basic format using the
    same three pieces of information: the sample value of the parameter in question, the standard
    deviation of the relevant sampling distribution, and the number of standard deviations we need
    to have the confidence in our estimate that we desire.
    How do you know you are dealing with a proportion problem? First, the underlying
    distribution has a binary random variable and therefore is a binomial distribution. (There
    is no mention of a mean or average). If X is a binomial random variable, then
     where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of a success. To form a sample
    proportion, take X, the random variable for the number of successes and divide it by n, the
    number of trials (or the sample size). The random variable (read "P Prime") is the sample
    proportion,

    (Sometimes the random variable is denoted as , read "P hat.")

        = the estimated proportion of successes or sample proportion of successes (p' is a point
    estimate for p, the true population proportion, and thus q is the probability of a failure in any
    one trial.)
    x = the number of successes in the sample

                                                                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 261
n = the size of the sample
The formula for the confidence interval for a population proportion follows the same format
as that for an estimate of a population mean. Remembering the sampling distribution for the
proportion, the standard deviation was found to be:

The confidence interval for a population proportion, therefore, becomes:

        is set according to our desired degree of confidence and  is the standard
deviation of the sampling distribution.

The sample proportions p' and q' are estimates of the unknown population proportions p
and q. The estimated proportions p' and q' are used because p and q are not known.

Remember that as p moves further from 0.5 the binomial distribution becomes less
symmetrical. Because we are estimating the binomial with the symmetrical normal distribution
the further away from symmetrical the binomial becomes the less confidence we have in the
estimate.

This conclusion can be demonstrated through the following analysis. Proportions are based
upon the binomial probability distribution. The possible outcomes are binary, either "success"
or "failure." This gives rise to a proportion, meaning the percentage of the outcomes that are
"successes." It was shown that the binomial distribution could be fully understood if we knew
only the probability of a success in any one trial, called p. The mean and the standard deviation
of the binomial were found to be:

        It was also shown that the binomial could be estimated by the normal distribution if BOTH np
        AND nq were greater than 5. From the discussion above, it was found that the standardizing
        formula for the binomial distribution is:

        Which is nothing more than a restatement of the general standardizing formula with
        appropriate substitutions for and from the binomial. We can use the standard normal
        distribution, the reason Z is in the equation, because the normal distribution is the limiting
        distribution of the binomial. This is another example of the Central Limit Theorem.

262 AHMED FARID
We can now manipulate this formula in just the same way we did for finding the confidence
intervals for a mean, but to find the confidence interval for the binomial population parameter,
p.

Where             , the point estimate of p taken from the sample. Notice that p' has replaced p in

the formula. This is because we do not know p, indeed, this is just what we are trying to estimate.

x = number of successes.

n = the number in the sample.

       , the failure in any trial

Unfortunately, there is no correction factor for cases where the sample size is small so np' and
nq' must always be greater than 5 to develop an interval estimate for p.

         Calculating the Sample Size n: Continuous and Binary Random Variables

        Continuous Random Variables

Usually, we have no control over the sample size of a data set. However, if we are able to set
the sample size, as in cases where we are taking a survey, it is very helpful to know just how
large it should be to provide the most information. Sampling can be very costly in both time and
product. Simple telephone surveys will cost approximately $30.00 each, for example, and some
sampling requires the destruction of the product.

If we go back to our standardizing formula for the sampling distribution for means, we can see

that it is possible to solve it for n. If we do this, we have  in the denominator.

Because we have not taken a sample, yet we do not know any of the variables in the formula

except that we can set to the level of confidence we desire just as we did when determining

confidence intervals. If we set a predetermined acceptable error, or tolerance, for the difference

between                  in the formula, we are much further in solving for the sample size

n. We still do not know the population standard deviation, . In practice, a pre-survey is usually

done which allows for fine tuning the questionnaire and will give a sample standard deviation

that can be used. In other cases, previous information from other surveys may be used for

in the formula. While crude, this method of determining the sample size may help in reducing

cost significantly. If will be the actual data gathered that determines the inferences about the

population, so caution in the sample size is appropriate calling for high levels of confidence and

small sampling errors.

Binary Random Variables

What was done in cases when looking for the mean of a distribution can also be done when
sampling to determine the population parameter p for proportions. Manipulation of the
standardizing formula for proportions gives:

Where            , and is the acceptable sampling error, or tolerance, for this application.

This will be measured in percentage points.

In this case the very object of our search is in the formula, p, and of course q because
. This result occurs because the binomial distribution is a one parameter distribution. If we
know p then we know the mean and the standard deviation. Therefore, p shows up in the
standard deviation of the sampling distribution which is where we got this formula. If, in an
abundance of caution, we substitute 0.5 for p we will draw the largest required sample size that
will provided the level of confidence specified by and the tolerance we have selected. This is

264 AHMED FARID
true because of all combinations of two fractions that add to one, the largest multiple is when
each is 0.5. Without any other information concerning the population parameter p, this is the
common practice. This may result in oversampling, but certainly not under sampling, thus, this
is a cautious approach.

There is an interesting trade-off between the level of confidence and the sample size that shows
up here when considering the cost of sampling. Table 4 shows the appropriate sample size at
different levels of confidence and different level of the acceptable error, or tolerance.

                                Table 4

      Required sample size (90%) Required sample size (95%) Tolerance level

      1691                 2401                      2%

      752                  1067                      3%

      271                  384                       5%

      68                   96                        10%

Table 4 is designed to show the maximum sample size required at different levels of confidence

given an assumed                as discussed above.

The acceptable error, called tolerance in the table, is measured in plus or minus values from the
actual proportion. For example, an acceptable error of 5% means that if the sample proportion
was found to be 26 percent, the conclusion would be that the actual population proportion is
between 21 and 31 percent with a 90 percent level of confidence if a sample of 271 had been
taken. Likewise, if the acceptable error was set at 2%, then the population proportion would be
between 24 and 28 percent with a 90 percent level of confidence but would require that the
sample size be increased from 271 to 1,691. If we wished a higher level of confidence, we would
require a larger sample size. Moving from a 90 percent level of confidence to a 95 percent level
at a plus or minus 5% tolerance requires changing the sample size from 271 to 384. A very
common sample size often seen reported in political surveys is 384. With the survey results it is
frequently stated that the results are good to a plus or minus 5% level of "accuracy".

Example: Suppose a mobile phone company wants to determine the current percentage of
customers aged 50+ who use text messaging on their cell phones. How many customers aged
50+ should the company survey in order to be 90% confident that the estimated (sample)
proportion is within three percentage points of the true population proportion of customers
aged 50+ who use text messaging on their cell phones.

Solution: From the problem, we know that the acceptable error, e, is 0.03 (3% = 0.03) and
                          , because the confidence level is 90%. The acceptable error, e, is the

difference between the actual population proportion p, and the sample proportion we expect to
get from the sample.

However, in order to find n, we need to know the estimated (sample) proportion p'. Remember

that      . But we do not know p' yet. Since we multiply p' and q' together, we make them

both equal to 0.5 because                results in the largest possible product.

(Try other products:                                                         and so on).

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 265
        The largest possible product gives us the largest n. This gives us a large enough sample so that
        we can be 90% confident that we are within three percentage points of the true population
        proportion. To calculate the sample size n, use the formula and make the substitutions.

        Round the answer to the next higher value. The sample size should be 752 cell phone customers
        aged 50+ in order to be 90% confident that the estimated (sample) proportion is within three
        percentage points of the true population proportion of all customers aged 50+ who use text
        messaging on their cell phones.

         Hypothesis Testing with One Sample

        Statistical testing is part of a much larger process known as the scientific method. The scientific
        method, briefly, states that only by following a careful and specific process can some assertion
        be included in the accepted body of knowledge. This process begins with a set of assumptions
        upon which a theory, sometimes called a model, is built. This theory, if it has any validity, will
        lead to predictions; what we call hypotheses.
        Statistics and statisticians are not necessarily in the business of developing theories, but in the
        business of testing others' theories. Hypotheses come from these theories based upon an explicit
        set of assumptions and sound logic. The hypothesis comes first, before any data are gathered.

266 AHMED FARID
Data do not create hypotheses; they are used to test them. If we bear this in mind as we study
this section, the process of forming and testing hypotheses will make more sense.

One job of a statistician is to make statistical inferences about populations based on samples
taken from the population. Confidence intervals are one way to estimate a population
parameter. Another way to make a statistical inference is to make a decision about the value
of a specific parameter. For instance, a car dealer advertises that its new small truck gets 35
miles per gallon, on average. A tutoring service claims that its method of tutoring helps 90% of
its students get an A or a B. A company says that women managers in their company earn an
average of $60,000 per year.

A statistician will make a decision about these claims. This process is called "hypothesis
testing." A hypothesis test involves collecting data from a sample and evaluating the data. Then,
the statistician makes a decision as to whether or not there is sufficient evidence, based upon
analyses of the data, to reject the null hypothesis.

         Null and Alternative Hypotheses

        The actual test begins by considering two hypotheses. They are called the null
        hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. These hypotheses contain opposing
        viewpoints.

               The null hypothesis: It is a statement of no difference between the variables-they
        are not related. This can often be considered the status quo and as a result if you cannot
        accept the null, it requires some action.

                The alternative hypothesis: It is a claim about the population that is contradictory
        to and what we conclude when we cannot accept . This is usually what the
        researcher is trying to prove. The alternative hypothesis is the contender and must win
        with significant evidence to overthrow the status quo. This concept is sometimes referred
        to the tyranny of the status quo because as we will see later, to overthrow the null
        hypothesis takes usually 90 or greater confidence that this is the proper decision.

        Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence
        to decide if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence
        is in the form of sample data.

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 267
After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a decision.
There are two options for a decision. They are "cannot accept " if the sample
information favors the alternative hypothesis or "do not reject " or "decline to reject
" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis. These conclusions
are all based upon a level of probability, a significance level, that is set by the analyst.

Table 5 presents the various hypotheses in the relevant pairs. For example, if the null
hypothesis is equal to some value, the alternative has to be not equal to that value.

                                                            Table 5

                 Equal (=)                 Not equal
                 Greater than or equal to  Less than (<)
                 Less than or equal to     More than (>)

Note: As a mathematical convention always has a symbol with an equal in it.
never has a symbol with an equal in it. The choice of symbol depends on the wording of
the hypothesis test.

Example 1:

     : No more than 30% of the registered voters in Santa Clara County voted in the
primary election.

     : More than 30% of the registered voters in Santa Clara County voted in the primary
election.

Example 2: We wants to test whether the mean GPA of students in American colleges is
different from 2.0 (out of 4.0). The null and alternative hypotheses are:

Example 3: We want to test if college students take less than five years to graduate from
college, on the average. The null and alternative hypotheses are:

Outcomes and the Type I and Type II Errors

When you perform a hypothesis test, there are four possible outcomes depending
on the actual truth (or falseness) of the null hypothesis and the decision to reject
or not. The outcomes are summarized in Table 6:

                                 Table 6

           Statistical Decision        is actually...

                                 True                  False

           Cannot reject         Correct outcome Type II error

           Cannot accept         Type I error          Correct outcome

The four possible outcomes in the table are:

1. The decision is cannot reject when is true (correct decision).

2. The decision is cannot accept when is true (incorrect decision
    known as a Type I error). This case is described as "rejecting a good null".
    As we will see later, it is this type of error that we will guard against by
    setting the probability of making such an error. The goal is to NOT take
    an action that is an error.

3. The decision is cannot reject when, in fact, is false (incorrect
    decision known as a Type II error). This is called "accepting a false null".
    In this situation you have allowed the status quo to remain in force when
    it should be overturned. As we will see, the null hypothesis has the
    advantage in competition with the alternative.

4. The decision is cannot accept when is false (correct decision).

Each of the errors occurs with a particular probability. The Greek letters and
represent the probabilities.

      probability of a Type I error = P(Type I error) = probability of rejecting the
null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true: rejecting a good null.

probability of a Type II error = P(Type II error) = probability of not rejecting

the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.                  is called the Power of

the Test.

                          FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 269
                    should be as small as possible because they are probabilities of errors.

                    Statistics allows us to set the probability that we are making a Type I error. The

                    probability of making a Type I error is . Recall that the confidence intervals in

                    the last section were set by choosing a value called  and the alpha value

                    determined the confidence level of the estimate because it was the probability of

                    the interval failing to capture the true mean (or proportion parameter p). This alpha

                    and that one are the same.

                    The easiest way to see the relationship between the alpha error and the level of
                    confidence is in Figure 9.

          Figure 9  In the center of Figure 9 is a normally distributed sampling distribution marked

270 AHMED FARID     . This is a sampling distribution of and by the Central Limit Theorem it is

                    normally distributed. The distribution in the center is marked and represents

                    the distribution for the null hypotheses              . This is the value that is

                    being tested. The formal statements of the null and alternative hypotheses are listed

                    below the figure.

                    The distributions on either side of the distribution represent distributions that
                    would be true if is false, under the alternative hypothesis listed as . We do
                    not know which is true, and will never know. There are, in fact, an infinite number
                    of distributions from which the data could have been drawn if is true, but only
                    two of them are on Figure 9 representing all of the others.

                    To test a hypothesis, we take a sample from the population and determine if it
                    could have come from the hypothesized distribution with an acceptable level of
                    significance. This level of significance is the alpha error and is marked on Figure
                    9 as the shaded areas in each tail of the distribution. (Each are actually
                    because the distribution is symmetrical, and the alternative hypothesis allows for
                    the possibility for the value to be either greater than or less than the hypothesized
                    value-called a two-tailed test).
If the sample mean marked as is in the tail of the distribution of , we
conclude that the probability that it could have come from the distribution is
less than alpha. We consequently state, "the null hypothesis cannot be accepted with

     level of significance." The truth may be that this did come from the
distribution, but from out in the tail. If this is so, then we have falsely rejected a true
null hypothesis and have made a Type I error. What statistics has done is provide
an estimate about what we know, and what we control, and that is the probability
of us being wrong, .

We can also see in Figure 9 that the sample mean could be really from an
distribution, but within the boundary set by the alpha level. Such a case is marked
as . There is a probability that actually came from but shows up in the
range of between the two tails. This probability is the beta error, the probability
of accepting a false null.

Our problem is that we can only set the alpha error because there are an infinite
number of alternative distributions from which the mean could have come that
are not equal to . As a result, the statistician places the burden of proof on the
alternative hypothesis. That is, we will not reject a null hypothesis unless there is
a greater than 90, or 95, or even 99 percent probability that the null is false: the
burden of proof lies with the alternative hypothesis. This is why we called this the
tyranny of the status quo earlier.

By way of example, the American judicial system begins with the concept that a
defendant is "presumed innocent". This is the status quo and is the null hypothesis.
The judge will tell the jury that they cannot find the defendant guilty unless the
evidence indicates guilt beyond a "reasonable doubt" which is usually defined in
criminal cases as 95% certainty of guilt. If the jury cannot accept the null, innocent,
then action will be taken, jail time. The burden of proof always lies with the
alternative hypothesis. (In civil cases, the jury needs only to be more than 50%
certain of wrongdoing to find culpability, called "a preponderance of the evidence").

The example above was for a test of a mean, but the same logic applies to tests of
hypotheses for all statistical parameters one may wish to test.

Example: Suppose the null hypothesis, , is Frank's rock climbing is safe.

Type I error: Frank thinks that his rock-climbing equipment may not be safe when,
in fact, it really is safe.

Type II error: Frank thinks that his rock-climbing equipment may be safe when, in
fact, it is not safe.

probability that Frank thinks his rock-climbing equipment may not be safe

when, in fact, it really is safe.  probability that Frank thinks his rock-climbing

equipment may be safe when, in fact, it is not safe.

FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 271
                     Notice that, in this case, the error with the greater consequence is the Type II error.
                     (If Frank thinks his rock-climbing equipment is safe, he will go ahead and use it.)
                     This is a situation described as "accepting a false null".

Distribution Needed for Hypothesis Testing

Earlier, we discussed sampling distributions. Particular distributions are associated with

hypothesis testing. We will perform hypotheses tests of a population mean using a normal

distribution or a Student's t-distribution. (Remember, use a Student's t-distribution when

the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small, where small is

considered to be less than 30 observations.) We perform tests of a population proportion

using a normal distribution when we can assume that the distribution is normally

distributed. We consider this to be true if the sample proportion, p', times the sample size

is greater than 5 and   times the sample size is also greater than 5. This is the same

rule of thumb we used when developing the formula for the confidence interval for a

population proportion.

Hypothesis Test for the Mean

Going back to the standardizing formula we can derive the test statistic for testing
hypotheses concerning means.

                The standardizing formula cannot be solved as it is because we do not have , the
                population mean. However, if we substituted in the hypothesized value of the mean,

272 AHMED FARID
in the formula as above, we can compute a Z value. This is the test statistic for a test
of hypothesis for a mean and is presented in Figure 10. We interpret this Z value as the
associated probability that a sample with a sample mean of could have come from a
distribution with a population mean of and we call this Z value for "calculated."
Figure 10 shows this process.

Figure 10

In Figure 10, two of the three possible outcomes are presented. and are in the

tails of the hypothesized distribution of . Notice that the horizontal axis in the top

panel is labeled      s. This is the same theoretical distribution of , the sampling

distribution, that the Central Limit Theorem tells us is normally distributed. This is why

we can draw it with this shape. The horizontal axis of the bottom panel is labeled Z and is

the standard normal distribution.  , called the critical values, are marked

on the bottom panel as the Z values associated with the probability the analyst has set

as the level of significance in test, . The probabilities in the tails of both panels are,

therefore, the same.

Notice that for each there is an associated , called the calculated Z, that comes
from solving the equation above. This calculated Z is nothing more than the number of
standard deviations that the hypothesized mean is from the sample mean. If the sample

                      FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 273
mean falls "too many" standard deviations from the hypothesized mean we conclude

that the sample mean could not have come from the distribution with the hypothesized

mean, given our pre-set required level of significance. It could have come from ,

but it is deemed just too unlikely. In Figure 10, both  are in the tails of the

distribution. They are deemed "too far" from the hypothesized value of the mean given

the chosen level of alpha. If in fact this sample mean it did come from , but from in the

tail, we have made a Type I error: we have rejected a good null. Our only real comfort is

that we know the probability of making such an error, , and we can control the size of

.

Figure 11 shows the third possibility for the location of the sample mean, . Here the
sample mean is within the two critical values. That is, within the probability of
and we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

                          Figure 11

                This gives us the decision rule for testing a hypothesis for a two-tailed test:

274 AHMED FARID
    Table 7

Decision rule: two-tail test

If  : then DO NOT REJECT

If  : then REJECT

This rule will always be the same no matter what hypothesis we are testing or what
formulas we are using to make the test. The only change will be change the to the
appropriate symbol for the test statistic for the parameter being tested. Stating the
decision rule another way: if the sample mean is unlikely to have come from the
distribution with the hypothesized mean we cannot accept the null hypothesis. Here we
define "unlikely" as having a probability less than alpha of occurring.

P-Value Approach

An alternative decision rule can be developed by calculating the probability that a sample
mean could be found that would give a test statistic larger than the test statistic found
from the current sample data assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Here the notion of
"likely" and "unlikely" is defined by the probability of drawing a sample with a mean from
a population with the hypothesized mean that is either larger or smaller than that found
in the sample data. Simply stated, the p-value approach compares the desired significance
level, to the p-value which is the probability of drawing a sample mean further from
the hypothesized value than the actual sample mean. A large p-value calculated from the
data indicates that we should not reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the
more unlikely the outcome, and the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis.
We would reject the null hypothesis if the evidence is strongly against it. The relationship
between the decision rule of comparing the calculated test statistics, , and the Critical
Value, , and using the p-value can be seen in Figure 12.

                                                       FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 275

                is in the tail and thus we cannot accept the null hypothesis, the associated is just too
                unusually large to believe that it came from the distribution with a mean of with a
                significance level of .

                If we use the p-value decision rule, we need one more step. We need to find in the
                standard normal table the probability associated with the calculated test statistic, . We
                then compare that to the associated with our selected level of confidence. In Figure 12
                we see that the p-value is less than and therefore we cannot accept the null. We know
                that the p-value is less than because the area under the p-value is smaller than . It
                is important to note that two researchers drawing randomly from the same population
                may find two different P-values from their samples. This occurs because the P-value is
                calculated as the probability in the tail beyond the sample mean assuming that the null
                hypothesis is correct. Because the sample means will in all likelihood be different this
                will create two different P-values. Nevertheless, the conclusions as to the null hypothesis
                should be different with only the level of probability of .

                Here is a systematic way to make a decision of whether you cannot accept or cannot reject
                a null hypothesis if using the p-value and a preset or preconceived  (the "significance
                level"). A preset is the probability of a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when
                the null hypothesis is true). It may or may not be given to you at the beginning of the

276 AHMED FARID
problem. In any case, the value of  is the decision of the analyst. When you make a
decision to reject or not reject , do as follows:

 If p-value, cannot accept . The results of the sample data are significant. There is
   sufficient evidence to conclude that is an incorrect belief and that the alternative
   hypothesis, , may be correct.

 If  p-value, cannot reject . The results of the sample data are not significant. There

is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the alternative hypothesis, , may be correct.

In this case the status quo stands.

 When you "cannot reject ," it does not mean that you should believe that is true. It
   simply means that the sample data have failed to provide sufficient evidence to cast
   serious doubt about the truthfulness of . Remember that the null is the status quo, and
   it takes high probability to overthrow the status quo. This bias in favor of the null
   hypothesis is what gives rise to the statement "tyranny of the status quo" when discussing
   hypothesis testing and the scientific method.

Both decision rules will result in the same decision, and it is a matter of preference which
one is used.

One and Two-Tailed Tests

The discussion with the figures above was based on the null and alternative hypothesis

presented in the first figure. This was called a two-tailed test because the alternative

hypothesis allowed that the mean could have come from a population which was either

larger or smaller than the hypothesized mean in the null hypothesis. This could be seen

by the statement of the alternative hypothesis as          , in this example.

It may be that the analyst has no concern about the value being "too" high or "too" low

from the hypothesized value. If this is the case, it becomes a one-tailed test, and all of

the alpha probability is placed in just one tail and not split into  as in the above

case of a two-tailed test. Any test of a claim will be a one-tailed test. For example, a car

manufacturer claims that their Model 17B provides gas mileage of greater than 25 miles

per gallon. The null and alternative hypothesis would be:

      FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 277
The claim would be in the alternative hypothesis. The burden of proof in hypothesis
testing is carried in the alternative. This is because failing to reject the null, the status quo,
must be accomplished with 90 or 95 percent confidence that it cannot be maintained.
Said another way, we want to have only a 5 or 10 percent probability of making a Type I
error, rejecting a good null; overthrowing the status quo.

This is a one-tailed test, and all of the alpha probability is placed in just one tail and not
split into as in the above case of a two-tailed test.

Figure 13 shows two possible cases and the form of the null and alternative hypothesis
that give rise to them.

Figure 13         is the hypothesized value of the population mean.

Effects of Sample Size on Test Statistic

In developing the confidence intervals for the mean from a sample, we found that most
often we would not have the population standard deviation, . If the sample size were
less than 30, we could simply substitute the point estimate for , the sample standard
deviation, s, and use the student's t-distribution to correct for this lack of information.

When testing hypotheses, we are faced with this same problem and the solution is exactly

the same. Namely: If the population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample size

is less than 30, substitute s, the point estimate for the population standard deviation, , in

the formula for the test statistic and use the student's t-distribution. All the formulas and

figures above are unchanged except for this substitution and changing the Z distribution

to the student's t-distribution on the graph. Remember that the student's t-distribution

can only be computed knowing the proper degrees of freedom for the problem. In

this case, the degrees of freedom is computed as before with confidence intervals:

. The calculated t-value is compared to the t-value associated with the pre-

set level of confidence required in the test,  found in the student's t tables. If we do

not know , but the sample size is 30 or more, we simply substitute s for and use the

normal distribution.

Table 8 summarizes these rules.

A Systematic Approach for Testing a Hypothesis

A systematic approach to hypothesis testing follows the following steps and in this order.
This template will work for all hypotheses that you will ever test.

 Set up the null and alternative hypothesis. This is typically the hardest part of the process.
   Here the question being asked is reviewed. What parameter is being tested, a mean, a
   proportion, differences in means, etc. Is this a one-tailed test or two-tailed test?

                                                         FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 279
 Decide the level of significance required for this particular case and determine the critical

value. These can be found in the appropriate statistical table. The levels of confidence

typical for businesses are 80, 90, 95, 98, and 99. However, the level of significance is a

policy decision and should be based upon the risk of making a Type I error, rejecting a

good null. Consider the consequences of making a Type I error.

Next, on the basis of the hypotheses and sample size, select the appropriate test statistic

and find the relevant critical value:  , etc. Drawing the relevant probability

distribution and marking the critical value is always big help. Be sure to match the graph

with the hypothesis, especially if it is a one-tailed test.

 Take a sample(s) and calculate the relevant parameters: sample mean, standard deviation,
   or proportion. Using the formula for the test statistic from above in step 2, now calculate
   the test statistic for this particular case using the parameters you have just calculated.

 Compare the calculated test statistic and the critical value. Marking these on the graph will
   give a good visual picture of the situation. There are now only two situations:

                  The test statistic is in the tail: Cannot Accept the null, the probability that this
                    sample mean (proportion) came from the hypothesized distribution is too small to
                    believe that it is the real home of these sample data.

                  The test statistic is not in the tail: Cannot Reject the null, the sample data are
                    compatible with the hypothesized population parameter.

 Reach a conclusion. It is best to articulate the conclusion two different ways. First a formal
   statistical conclusion such as "With a 5 % level of significance we cannot accept the null
   hypotheses that the population mean is equal to XX (units of measurement)". The second
   statement of the conclusion is less formal and states the action, or lack of action, required.
   If the formal conclusion was that above, then the informal one might be, "The machine is
   broken, and we need to shut it down and call for repairs."

All hypotheses tested will go through this same process. The only changes are the relevant
formulas and those are determined by the hypothesis required to answer the original
question.

Hypothesis Test for Proportions

Just as there were confidence intervals for proportions, or more formally, the population
parameter p of the binomial distribution, there is the ability to test hypotheses concerning
p.

The population parameter for the binomial is p. The estimated value (point estimate) for

p is p' where              is the number of successes in the sample and n is the sample

size.

When you perform a hypothesis test of a population proportion p, you take a simple

random sample from the population. The conditions for a binomial distribution must

be met, which are: there are a certain number n of independent trials meaning random

sampling, the outcomes of any trial are binary, success or failure, and each trial has the

same probability of a success p. The shape of the binomial distribution needs to be similar

to the shape of the normal distribution. To ensure this, the quantities np' and nq' must

both be greater than five                   . In this case the binomial distribution

of a sample (estimated) proportion can be approximated by the normal distribution with

                           . Remember that  . There is no distribution that can

correct for this small sample bias and thus if these conditions are not met, we simply

                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 281
                cannot test the hypothesis with the data available at that time. We met this condition
                when we first were estimating confidence intervals for p.
                Again, we begin with the standardizing formula modified because this is the distribution
                of a binomial.

                Substituting , the hypothesized value of p, we have:

                This is the test statistic for testing hypothesized values of p, where the null and alternative
                hypotheses take one of the following forms:

                                                                                Table 9
                                                Two-tailed test One-tailed test One-tailed test

                The decision rule stated above applies here also: if the calculated value of shows
                that the sample proportion is "too many" standard deviations from the hypothesized
                proportion, the null hypothesis cannot be accepted. The decision as to what is "too many"
                is pre-determined by the analyst depending on the level of significance required in the
                test.

         Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

        Studies often compare two groups. For example, researchers are interested in the effect aspirin
        has in preventing heart attacks. Over the last few years, newspapers and magazines have
        reported various aspirin studies involving two groups. Typically, one group is given aspirin and
        the other group is given a placebo. Then, the heart attack rate is studied over several years.
        There are other situations that deal with the comparison of two groups. For example, studies
        compare various diet and exercise programs. Politicians compare the proportion of individuals
        from different income brackets who might vote for them. Students are interested in whether

282 AHMED FARID
SAT or GRE preparatory courses really help raise their scores. Many business applications
require comparing two groups. It may be the investment returns of two different investment
strategies, or the differences in production efficiency of different management styles.

To compare two means or two proportions, you work with two groups. The groups are
classified either as independent or matched pairs. Independent groups consist of two samples
that are independent, that is, sample values selected from one population are not related in
any way to sample values selected from the other population. Matched pairs consist of two
samples that are dependent. The parameter tested using matched pairs is the population mean.
The parameters tested using independent groups are either population means or population
proportions of each group.

         Comparing Two Independent Population Means

        The comparison of two independent population means is very common and provides a
        way to test the hypothesis that the two groups differ from each other. Is the night shift less
        productive than the day shift, are the rates of return from fixed asset investments different
        from those from common stock investments, and so on? An observed difference between
        two sample means depends on both the means and the sample standard deviations. Very
        different means can occur by chance if there is great variation among the individual
        samples. The test statistic will have to account for this fact. The test comparing two
        independent population means with unknown and possibly unequal population standard
        deviations is called the Aspin-Welch t-test. The degrees of freedom formula we will see
        later was developed by Aspin-Welch.

        When we developed the hypothesis test for the mean and proportions, we began with the
        Central Limit Theorem. We recognized that a sample mean came from a distribution of
        sample means, and sample proportions came from the sampling distribution of sample
        proportions. This made our sample parameters, the sample means and sample
        proportions, into random variables. It was important for us to know the distribution that
        these random variables came from. The Central Limit Theorem gave us the answer: the
        normal distribution. Our Z and t statistics came from this theorem. This provided us with
        the solution to our question of how to measure the probability that a sample mean came
        from a distribution with a particular hypothesized value of the mean or proportion. In
        both cases that was the question: what is the probability that the mean (or proportion)
        from our sample data came from a population distribution with the hypothesized value
        we are interested in?

        Now we are interested in whether or not two samples have the same mean. Our question
        has not changed: Do these two samples come from the same population distribution? We
        recognize that we have two sample means, one from each set of data, and thus we have
        two random variables coming from two unknown distributions. To solve the problem,
        we create a new random variable, the difference between the sample means. This new
        random variable also has a distribution and, again, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that
        this new distribution is normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distributions
        of the original data. A graph may help to understand this concept.

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 283
Figure 14

Pictured in Figure 14 are two distributions of data,  , with unknown means

and standard deviations. The second panel shows the sampling distribution of the newly

created random variable  . This distribution is the theoretical distribution of

many samples means from population 1 minus sample means from population 2. The

Central Limit Theorem tells us that this theoretical sampling distribution of differences

in sample means is normally distributed, regardless of the distribution of the actual

population data shown in the top panel. Because the sampling distribution is normally

distributed, we can develop a standardizing formula and calculate probabilities from the

standard normal distribution in the bottom panel, the Z distribution.

The Central Limit Theorem, as before, provides us with the standard deviation of the
sampling distribution, and further, that the expected value of the mean of the distribution
of differences in sample means is equal to the differences in the population means.
Mathematically this can be stated:

                Because we do not know the population standard deviations, we estimate them using the
                two sample standard deviations from our independent samples. For the hypothesis test,

284 AHMED FARID
   we calculate the estimated standard deviation, or standard error, of the difference in

   sample means,           .

   The standard error is:

   We remember that substituting the sample variance for the population variance when
   we did not have the population variance was the technique we used when building the
   confidence interval and the test statistic for the test of hypothesis for a single mean back
   in Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing with One Sample. The test statistic (t-
   score) is calculated as follows:

   Where:

          , the sample standard deviations, are estimates of  , respectively

          are the unknown population standard deviations

          are the sample means.  are the unknown population means.

   The number of degrees of freedom (df) requires a somewhat complicated calculation.
   The df are not always a whole number. The test statistic above is approximated by the
   Student's t-distribution with df as follows:

   When both sample sizes         are 30 or larger, the Student's t approximation is

   very good. If each sample has more than 30 observations, then the degrees of freedom can

   be calculation as          .

   The format of the sampling distribution, differences in sample means, specifies that the
   format of the null and alternative hypothesis is:

   Where   is the hypothesized difference between the two means. If the question is simply

                                             FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 285
"is there any difference between the means?" then  and the null and alternative
hypotheses becomes:

An example of when might not be zero is when the comparison of the two groups
requires a specific difference for the decision to be meaningful. Imagine that you are
making a capital investment. You are considering changing from your current model
machine to another. You measure the productivity of your machines by the speed they
produce the product. It may be that a contender to replace the old model is faster in
terms of product throughout but is also more expensive. The second machine may also
have more maintenance costs, setup costs, etc. The null hypothesis would be set up so
that the new machine would have to be better than the old one by enough to cover these
extra costs in terms of speed and cost of production. This form of the null and alternative
hypothesis shows how valuable this particular hypothesis test can be. For most of our
work we will be testing simple hypotheses asking if there is any difference between the
two-distribution means.

Cohen's Standards for Small, Medium, and Large Effect Sizes

Cohen's d is a measure of "effect size" based on the differences between two means.
Cohen's d, named for United States statistician Jacob Cohen, measures the relative
strength of the differences between the means of two populations based on sample
data. The calculated value of effect size is then compared to Cohen's standards of small,
medium, and large effect sizes.

Size of effect  Table 10
Small                                            d
Medium                                           0.2

                                                 0.8

Cohen's d is the measure of the difference between two means divided by the pooled
standard deviation:

It is important to note that Cohen's d does not provide a level of confidence as to the
magnitude of the size of the effect comparable to the other tests of hypothesis we have
studied. The sizes of the effects are simply indicative.

Test for Differences in Means: Assuming Equal Population Variances

Typically, we can never expect to know any of the population parameters, mean,

                                                       FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 287
                proportion, or standard deviation. When testing hypotheses concerning differences in
                means we are faced with the difficulty of two unknown variances that play a critical
                role in the test statistic. We have been substituting the sample variances just as we did
                when testing hypotheses for a single mean. And as we did before, we used a Student's
                t to compensate for this lack of information on the population variance. There may be
                situations, however, when we do not know the population variances, but we can assume
                that the two populations have the same variance. If this is true, then the pooled sample
                variance will be smaller than the individual sample variances. This will give more precise
                estimates and reduce the probability of discarding a good null. The null and alternative
                hypotheses remain the same, but the test statistic changes to:

                Where is the pooled variance given by the formula:

                Example: A drug trial is attempted using a real drug and a pill made of just sugar. 18
                people are given the real drug in hopes of increasing the production of endorphins.
                The increase in endorphins is found to be on average 8 micrograms per person, and
                the sample standard deviation is 5.4 micrograms. 11 people are given the sugar pill,
                and their average endorphin increase is 4 micrograms with a standard deviation of 2.4.
                From previous research on endorphins, it is determined that it can be assumed that the
                variances within the two samples can be assumed to be the same. Test at 5% to see if the
                population mean for the real drug had a significantly greater impact on the endorphins
                than the population mean with the sugar pill.
                Solution:
                First, we begin by designating one of the two groups Group 1 and the other Group 2. This
                will be needed to keep track of the null and alternative hypotheses. Let us set Group 1 as
                those who received the actual new medicine being tested and therefore Group 2 is those
                who received the sugar pill. We can now set up the null and alternative hypothesis as:

                This is set up as a one-tailed test with the claim in the alternative hypothesis that the
                medicine will produce more endorphins than the sugar pill. We now calculate the test
                statistic which requires us to calculate the pooled variance, using the formula above.

288 AHMED FARID
, allows us to compare the test statistic and the critical value.

The test statistic is clearly in the tail, 2.31 is larger than the critical value of 1.703,
and therefore we cannot maintain the null hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that there is
significant evidence at the 95% level of confidence that the new medicine produces the
effect desired.

Two Population Means with Known Standard Deviations

Even though this situation is not likely (knowing the population standard deviations is

very unlikely), the following example illustrates hypothesis testing for independent means

with known population standard deviations. The sampling distribution for the difference

between the means is normal in accordance with the central limit theorem. The random

variable is  . The normal distribution has the following format:

The standard deviation is:

The test statistic (z-score) is:

                  Matched or Paired Samples

                In most cases of economic or business data we have little or no control over the process
                of how the data are gathered. In this sense the data are not the result of a planned
                controlled experiment. In some cases, however, we can develop data that are part of
                a controlled experiment. This situation occurs frequently in quality control situations.
                Imagine that the production rates of two machines built to the same design, but at
                different manufacturing plants, are being tested for differences in some production
                metric such as speed of output or meeting some production specification such as strength
                of the product. The test is the same in format to what we have been testing, but here
                we can have matched pairs for which we can test if differences exist. Each observation
                has its matched pair against which differences are calculated. First, the differences in the
                metric to be tested between the two lists of observations must be calculated, and this
                is typically labeled with the letter "d." Then, the average of these matched differences,

                      is calculated as is its standard deviation, . We expect that the standard deviation
                of the differences of the matched pairs will be smaller than unmatched pairs because
                presumably fewer differences should exist because of the correlation between the two
                groups.

                When using a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, the following characteristics
                may be present:

                      1. Simple random sampling is used.
                      2. Sample sizes are often small.
                      3. Two measurements (samples) are drawn from the same pair of individuals or

                           objects.
                      4. Differences are calculated from the matched or paired samples.
                      5. The differences form the sample that is used for the hypothesis test.
                      6. Either the matched pairs have differences that come from a population that is

                           normal or the number of differences is sufficiently large so that distribution of
                           the sample mean of differences is approximately normal.

                In a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, subjects are matched in pairs and
                differences are calculated. The differences are the data. The population mean for the
                differences, , is then tested using a Student's t-test for a single population mean with

290 AHMED FARID
                      degrees of freedom, where n is the number of differences, that is, the number of
             pairs not the number of observations.
             The null and alternative hypotheses for this test are:

             The test statistic is:

Comparing Two Independent Population Proportions

When conducting a hypothesis test that compares two independent population
proportions, the following characteristics should be present:

                 1. The two independent samples are random samples are independent.

                 2. The number of successes is at least five, and the number of failures is at least five,
                     for each of the samples.

                 3. Growing literature states that the population must be at least ten or even
                     perhaps 20 times the size of the sample. This keeps each population from being
                     over-sampled and causing biased results.

Comparing two proportions, like comparing two means, is common. If two estimated
proportions are different, it may be due to a difference in the populations or it may be
due to chance in the sampling. A hypothesis test can help determine if a difference in the
estimated proportions reflects a difference in the two population proportions.

Like the case of differences in sample means, we construct a sampling distribution for

differences in sample proportions:  where                                                                 are

the sample proportions for the two sets of data in question.  are the number

of successes in each sample group respectively, and           are the respective sample

sizes from the two groups. Again, we go the Central Limit Theorem to find the

distribution of this sampling distribution for the differences in sample proportions. And

again, we find that this sampling distribution, like the one's past, are normally distributed

as proved by the Central Limit Theorem, as see in Figure 15.

292 AHMED FARID
Figure 15

     Generally, the null hypothesis allows for the test of a difference of a particular value, ,
     just as we did for the case of difference in means.

     Most common, however, is the test that the two proportions are the same. That is,

     To conduct the test, we use a pooled proportion, .
     The pooled proportion is calculated as follows:
     The test statistic (z-score) is:

                                                               FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 293
Where is the hypothesized differences between the two proportions and                                is the
pooled variance from the formula above.

         The Chi-Square Distribution

        Have you ever wondered if lottery winning numbers were evenly distributed or if some
        numbers occurred with a greater frequency? How about if the types of movies people preferred
        were different across different age groups? What about if a coffee machine was dispensing
        approximately the same amount of coffee each time? You could answer these questions by
        conducting a hypothesis test.
        You will now study a new distribution, one that is used to determine the answers to such
        questions. This distribution is called the chi-square distribution.
        In this section, you will learn the three major applications of the chi-square distribution:

294 AHMED FARID
1. The test of a single variance, which tests variability, such as in the coffee example
2. The goodness-of-fit test, which determines if data fit a particular distribution, such as

    in the lottery example
3. the test of independence, which determines if events are independent, such as in the

    movie example

   Facts About the Chi-Square Distribution

  The notation for the chi-square distribution is:

Where         degrees of freedom which depends on how chi-square is being used. (If you

want to practice calculating chi-square probabilities then use               . The degrees of

freedom for the three major uses are each calculated differently.)

For the distribution, the population mean is  and the population standard

deviation is  .

The random variable is shown as .

The random variable for a chi-square distribution with k degrees of freedom is the sum
of k independent, squared standard normal variables.

1. The curve is nonsymmetrical and skewed to the right.
2. There is a different chi-square curve for each df.

               Figure 16

3. The test statistic for any test is always greater than or equal to zero.

4. When       , the chi-square curve approximates the normal distribution. For

              FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 295
           the mean,                                  and the standard deviation,
                         . Therefore,                             , approximately.

   5. The mean, is located just to the right of the peak.

   Test of a Single Variance

   Thus far our interest has been exclusively on the population parameter or it is
   counterpart in the binomial, p. Surely the mean of a population is the most critical piece
   of information to have, but in some cases, we are interested in the variability of the
   outcomes of some distribution. In almost all production processes quality is measured
   not only by how closely the machine matches the target, but also the variability of the
   process. If one were filling bags with potato chips not only would there be interest in
   the average weight of the bag, but also how much variation there was in the weights.
   No one wants to be assured that the average weight is accurate when their bag has no
   chips. Electricity voltage may meet some average level, but great variability, spikes, can
   cause serious damage to electrical machines, especially computers. I would not only like
   to have a high mean grade in my classes, but also low variation about this mean. In
   short, statistical tests concerning the variance of a distribution have great value and many
   applications.

   A test of a single variance assumes that the underlying distribution is normal. The
   null and alternative hypotheses are stated in terms of the population variance. The test
   statistic is:

   Where:

      the total number of observations in the sample data

      sample variance

      hypothesized value of the population variance





   You may think of s as the random variable in this test. The number of degrees of freedom

   is      . A test of a single variance may be right-tailed, left-tailed, or two-tailed.

   The example below will show you how to set up the null and alternative hypotheses. The

   null and alternative hypotheses contain statements about the population variance.

                Example: Math instructors are not only interested in how their students do on exams,

296 AHMED FARID
             on average, but how the exam scores vary. To many instructors, the variance (or standard
             deviation) may be more important than the average.
             Suppose a math instructor believes that the standard deviation for his final exam is five
             points. One of his best students thinks otherwise. The student claims that the standard
             deviation is more than five points. If the student were to conduct a hypothesis test, what
             would the null and alternative hypotheses be?
             Solution: Even though we are given the population standard deviation, we can set up the
             test using the population variance as follows:

              Goodness-Of-Fit Test

             In this type of hypothesis test, you determine whether the data "fit" a particular
             distribution or not. For example, you may suspect your unknown data fit a binomial
             distribution. You use a chi-square test (meaning the distribution for the hypothesis test is
             chi-square) to determine if there is a fit or not. The null and the alternative hypotheses
             for this test may be written in sentences or may be stated as equations or inequalities.
             The test statistic for a goodness-of -fit test is:

                                                                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 297
Where:

 O = observed values (data)
 E = expected values (from theory)
 k = the number of different data cells or categories

The observed values are the data values, and the expected values are the values you
would expect to get it the null hypothesis were true. There are n terms of the form

          .

The number of degrees of freedom is                     .

The goodness-of-fit test is almost always right-tailed. If the observed values and the
corresponding expected values are not close to each other, then the test statistic can get
very large and will be way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve.

Note: The number of expected values inside each cell needs to be at least five in order to
use this test.

 Test of Independence

 Tests of independence involve using a contingency table of observed (data) values.
 The test statistic of a test of independence is similar to that of a goodness-of-fit test:

 Where:

 O = observed values
 E = expected values
 i = the number of rows in the table
 j = the number of columns in the table

 There are
 A test of independence determines whether two factors are independent or not.
 Note: The expected value inside each cell needs to be at least five in order for you to use
 this test.
 The test of independence is always right tailed because of the calculation of the test
 statistic. If the expected and observed values are not close together, then the test statistic
 is very large and way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve, as it is in a goodness-of-
 fit.
 The number of degrees of freedom for the test of independence is:

 The following formula calculates the expected number (E):

                  Test for Homogeneity

                The goodness-of-fit test can be used to decide whether a population fits a given
                distribution, but it will not suffice to decide whether two populations follow the same
                unknown distribution. A different test, called the test of homogeneity, can be used
                to draw a conclusion about whether two populations have the same distribution. To
                calculate the test statistic for a test for homogeneity, follow the same procedure as with
                the test of independence.
                Note: The expected value inside each cell needs to be at least five in order for you to use
                this test.

              Comparison of the Chi-Square Tests

             Above the test statistic was used in three different circumstances. The following
             bulleted list is a summary of which test is the appropriate one to use in different
             circumstances.
             Goodness-of-fit: Use the goodness-of-fit test to decide whether a population with an
             unknown distribution "fits" a known distribution. In this case there will be a single
             qualitative survey question or a single outcome of an experiment from a single

                                                                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 301
                population. Goodness-of-Fit is typically used to see if the population is uniform (all
                outcomes occur with equal frequency), the population is normal, or the population is
                the same as another population with a known distribution. The null and alternative
                hypotheses are:

                       The population fits given distribution

                        The population does not fit the given distribution

                Independence: Use the test for independence to decide whether two variables (factors)
                are independent or dependent. In this case there will be two qualitative survey questions
                or experiments and a contingency table will be constructed. The goal is to see if the
                two variables are unrelated (independent) or related (dependent). The null and alternative
                hypotheses are:

                      The two variables (factors) are independent

                        The two variables (factors) are dependent

                Homogeneity: Use the test for homogeneity to decide if two populations with unknown
                distributions have the same distribution as each other. In this case there will be a single
                qualitative survey question or experiment given to two different populations. The null
                and alternative hypotheses are:

                       The two populations follow the same distribution

                     : The two populations have different distributions

         F Distribution and One-Way ANOVA

        Many statistical applications in psychology, social science, business administration, and the
        natural sciences involve several groups. For example, an environmentalist is interested in
        knowing if the average amount of pollution varies in several bodies of water. A sociologist is
        interested in knowing if the amount of income a person earns varies according to his or her
        upbringing. A consumer looking for a new car might compared the average gas mileage of
        several models.

        For hypothesis tests comparing averages among more than two groups, statisticians have
        developed a method called "Analysis of Variance" (abbreviated ANOVA). In this chapter, you
        will study the simplest form of ANOVA called single factor or one-way ANOVA. You will also
        study the F distribution, used for one-way ANOVA, and the test for differences between two
        variances. This is just a very brief overview of one-way ANOVA. One-Way ANOVA, as it is
        presented here, relies heavily on a calculator or computer.

                  Test of Two Variances

                This chapter introduces a new probability density function, the F distribution. This
                distribution is used for many applications including ANOVA and for testing equality
                across multiple means. We begin with the F distribution and the test of hypothesis of

302 AHMED FARID
differences in variances. It is often desirable to compare two variances rather than two
averages. For instance, college administrators would like two college professors grading
exams to have the same variation in their grading. In order for a lid to fit a container, the
variation in the lid and the container should be approximately the same. A supermarket
might be interested in the variability of check-out times for two checkers. In finance,
the variance is a measure of risk and thus an interesting question would be to test the
hypothesis that two different investment portfolios have the same variance, the volatility.

In order to perform a F test of two variances, it is important that the following are true:

                 1. The populations from which the two samples are drawn are approximately
                     normally distributed.

                 2. The two populations are independent of each other.

Unlike most other hypothesis tests in this Module, the F test for equality of two variances
is very sensitive to deviations from normality. If the two distributions are not normal, or
close, the test can give a biased result for the test statistic.

Suppose we sample randomly from two independent normal populations. Let

                 be the unknown population variances and                      be the sample

variances. Let the sample sizes be            . Since we are interested in comparing the

two sample variances, we use the F ratio:

F has the distribution

Where            are the degrees of freedom for the numerator and             are the degrees

of freedom for the denominator.

If the null hypothesis is        , then the F Ratio, test statistic, becomes

The various forms of the hypotheses tested are:

                                    Table 11

Two-Tailed Test         One-Tailed Test          One-Tailed Test

A more general form of the null and alternative hypothesis for a two tailed test would be:

                                                       FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 303
Where if         it is a simple test of the hypothesis that the two variances are equal.

This form of the hypothesis does have the benefit of allowing for tests that are more

than for simple differences and can accommodate tests for specific differences as we

did for differences in means and differences in proportions. This form of the hypothesis

also shows the relationship between the F distribution and the : the F is a ratio of

two chi squared distributions a distribution we saw in the last chapter. This is helpful in

determining the degrees of freedom of the resultant F distribution.

If the two populations have equal variances, then            are close in value and the test

statistic,                is close to one. But if the two population variances are very different,
                 tend to be very different, too. Choosing as the larger sample variance causes

the ratio        to be greater than one. If                  are far apart, then  is a large
number.

Therefore, if F is close to one, the evidence favors the null hypothesis (the two population
variances are equal). But if F is much larger than one, then the evidence is against the
null hypothesis. In essence, we are asking if the calculated F statistic, test statistic, is
significantly different from one.

To determine the critical points, we have to find            . This F table has values for

various levels of significance from 0.1 to 0.001 designated as "p" in the first column. To

find the critical value choose the desired significance level and follow down and across

to find the critical value at the intersection of the two different degrees of freedom. The

F distribution has two different degrees of freedom, one associated with the numerator,

                 , and one associated with the denominator,  and to complicate matters, the F

distribution is not symmetrical and changes the degree of skewness as the degrees of

freedom of change. The degrees of freedom in the numerator is                     is the

sample size for group 1, and the degrees of freedom in the denominator is         , where

                 is the sample size for group 2.  will give the critical value on the upper end

of the F distribution.

To find the critical value for the lower end of the distribution, reverse the degrees of
freedom and divide the F-value from the table into one.

 Upper tail critical value:

304 AHMED FARID
             Lower tail critical value:

             When the calculated value of F is between the critical values, not in the tail, we cannot
             reject the null hypothesis that the two variances came from a population with the same
             variance. If the calculated F-value is in either tail we cannot accept the null hypothesis
             just as we have been doing for all of the previous tests of hypothesis.
             An alternative way of finding the critical values of the F distribution makes the use of the
             F-table easier. We note in the F-table that all the values of F are greater than one therefore
             the critical F value for the left-hand tail will always be less than one because to find the
             critical value on the left tail we divide an F value into the number one as shown above.
             We also note that if the sample variance in the numerator of the test statistic is larger than
             the sample variance in the denominator, the resulting F value will be greater than one.
             The shorthand method for this test is thus to be sure that the larger of the two sample
             variances is placed in the numerator to calculate the test statistic. This will mean that only
             the right-hand tail critical value will have to be found in the F-table.

              One-Way ANOVA

             The purpose of a one-way ANOVA test is to determine the existence of a statistically
             significant difference among several group means. The test actually uses variances to

                                                                           FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 305
help determine if the means are equal or not. In order to perform a one-way ANOVA test,
there are five basic assumptions to be fulfilled:

      1. Each population from which a sample is taken is assumed to be normal.
      2. All samples are randomly selected and independent.
      3. The populations are assumed to have equal standard deviations (or variances).
      4. The factor is a categorical variable.
      5. The response is a numerical variable.

The Null and Alternative Hypotheses

The null hypothesis is simply that all the group population means are the same. The
alternative hypothesis is that at least one pair of means is different. For example, if there
are k groups:

                 At least two of the group means      are not equal. That is,
                                            .

The graphs, a set of box plots representing the distribution of values with the group

means indicated by a horizontal line through the box, help in the understanding of the

hypothesis test. In the first graph (red box plots),  and the three

populations have the same distribution if the null hypothesis is true. The variance of the

combined data is approximately the same as the variance of the populations.

If the null hypothesis is false, then the variance of the combined data is larger which is
caused by the different means as shown in the second graph (green box plots).

       Figure 17: (a) is true. All means are the same; the
       differences are due to random variation. (b) is not
       true. All means are not the same; the differences are
       too large to be due to random variation.

The F Distribution and the F-Ratio

The distribution used for the hypothesis test is a new one. It is called the F distribution,
invented by George Snedecor but named in honor of Sir Ronald Fisher, an English
statistician. The F statistic is a ratio (a fraction). There are two sets of degrees of freedom:
one for the numerator and one for the denominator.

For example, if F follows an F distribution and the number of degrees of freedom for the
numerator is four, and the number of degrees of freedom for the denominator is ten, then

               .

To calculate the F ratio, two estimates of the variance are made.

      1. Variance between samples: An estimate of that is the variance of the sample
          means multiplied by n (when the sample sizes are the same). If the samples are
          different sizes, the variances between samples is weighted to account for the
          different sample sizes. The variances is also called variance due to treatment or
          explained variation.

                                                       FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 307
                 2. Variance within samples: An estimate of that is the average of the sample
                     variances (also known as a pooled variance). When the sample sizes are
                     different, the variance within samples is weighted. The variance is also called the
                     variation due to error or unexplained variation.

                   the sum of squares that represents the variation among the different
   samples        the sum of squares that represents the variation within samples that is due


   to chance.

   To find a "sum of squares" means to add together squared quantities that, in some cases,
   may be weighted.

   MS means "mean square."             is the variance between groups, and                     is

   the variance within groups.

 Mean square (variance estimate) that is due to chance (unexplained):

                                  can be written as follows:




   The one-way ANOVA test depends on the fact that                      can be influenced by

   population differences among means of the several groups. Since      compares

   values of each group to its own group mean, the fact that group means might be different

   does not affect          .

   The null hypothesis says that all groups are samples from populations having the same

   normal distribution. The alternate hypothesis says that at least two of the sample groups

   come from populations with different normal distributions. If the null hypothesis is true,

       and                        should both estimate the same value.

   Note: The null hypothesis says that all the group population means are equal. The
   hypothesis of equal means implies that the populations have the same normal
   distribution, because it is assumed that the populations are normal and that they have
   equal variances.

   F-Ration or F Statistic

   If                             estimate the same value (following the belief that is

   true), then the F-ratio should be approximately equal to one. Mostly, just sampling errors

   would contribute to variations away from one. As it turns out,       consists of the

   population variance plus a variance produced form the differences between the samples.

       is an estimate of the population variance. Since variances are always positive, if

   the null hypothesis is false,  will generally be larger than         . Then the

                               FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 309
            F-ratio will be larger than one. However, if the population effect is small, it is not unlikely

            that               will be larger in a given sample.

            The foregoing calculations were done with groups of different sizes. If the groups are the
            same size, the calculations simplify somewhat, and the F-ratio can be written as:

            F-Ratio Formula when the groups are the same size

            Where:

          n = the sample size
         
         

                   the mean of the sample variances (pooled variance)

                 the variance of the sample means.

            Data are typically put into a table for easy viewing. One-Way ANOVA results are often
            displayed is this manner by computer software.

Facts About the F Distribution

      1. The curve is not symmetrical but skewed to the right.
      2. There is a different curve for each set of degrees of freedom.
      3. The F statistic is greater than or equal to zero.
      4. As the degrees of freedom for the numerator and for the denominator get larger,

          the curve approximates the normal as can be seen in Figure 18. Remember that
          the F cannot ever be less than zero, so the distribution does not have a tail that
          goes to infinity on the left as the normal distribution does.
      5. Other uses for the F distribution include comparing two variances and two-way
          Analysis of Variances. Two-Way Analysis is beyond the scope of this section.

COMPUTE AND INTERPRET SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES

         Linear Regression and Correlation

        Professionals often want to know how two or more numeric variables are related. For example,
        is there a relationship between the grade on the second math exam a student takes and the grade
        on the final exam? If there is a relationship, what is the relationship and how strong is it?

This example may or may not be tied to a model, meaning that some theory suggested that a
relationship exists. This link between a cause and an effect is the foundation of the scientific
method and is the core of how we determine what we believe about how the world works.
Beginning with a theory and developing a model of the theoretical relationship should result in
a prediction, what we have called a hypothesis earlier. Now the hypothesis concerns a full set of
relationships.

The foundation of all model building is perhaps the arrogant statement that we know what

caused the result we see. This is embodied in the simple mathematical statement of the

functional form that  . The response, Y, is caused by the stimulus, X. Every model will

                      FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 313
        eventually come to this final place, and it will be here that the theory will live or die. Will the
        data support this hypothesis? If so, then fine, we shall believe this version of the world until
        a better theory comes to replace it. This is the process by which we moved from flat earth to
        round earth, from earth-center solar system to sun-center solar system, and on and on.

        In this section we will begin with correlation, the investigation of relationships among variables
        that may or may not be founded on a cause-and-effect model. The variables simply move in the
        same, or opposite, direction. That is to say, they do not move randomly. Correlation provides
        a measure of the degree to which this is true. From there we develop a tool to measure cause
        and effect relationships, regression analysis. We will be able to formulate models and tests to
        determine if they are statistically sound. If they are found to be so, then we can use them to make
        predictions: if as a matter of policy, we changed the value of this variable what would happen to
        this other variable? If we imposed a gasoline tax of 50 cents per gallon how would that effect the
        carbon emissions, sales of Hummers/Hybrids, use of mass transit, etc.? The ability to provide
        answers to these types of questions is the value of regression as both a tool to help us understand
        our world and to make thoughtful policy decisions.

         The Correlation Coefficient r

        As we begin this section, we note that the type of data we will be working with has changed.
        Perhaps unnoticed, all the data we have been using is for a single variable. It may be from two
        samples, but it is still a univariate variable. The type of data described for any model of cause
        and effect is bivariate data -- "bi" for two variables. In reality, statisticians use multivariate
        data, meaning many variables.

        Data can be classified into three broad categories: time series data, cross-section data, and panel
        data. Time series data measures a single unit of observation; say a person, or a company or a
        country, as time passes. What are measures will be at least two characteristics, say the person's
        income, the quantity of a particular good they buy and the price they paid. This would be three
        pieces of information in one time period, say 1985. If we followed that person across time we
        would have those same pieces of information for 1985, 1986, 1987, etc. This would constitute a
        time series data set.

        A second type of data set is for cross-section data. Here the variation is not across time for
        a single unit of observation, but across units of observation during one point in time. For a
        particular period of time, we would gather the price paid, amount purchased, and income of
        many individual people.

        A third type of data set is panel data. Here a panel of units of observation is followed across
        time. If we take our example from above, we might follow 500 people, the unit of observation,
        through time, ten years, and observe their income, price paid and quantity of the good
        purchased. If we had 500 people and data for ten years for price, income and quantity purchased
        we would have 15,000 pieces of information. These types of data sets are very expensive to
        construct and maintain. They do, however, provide a tremendous amount of information that
        can be used to answer very important questions. As an example, what is the effect on the labor
        force participation rate of women as their family of origin, mother and father, age? Or are

314 AHMED FARID
there differential effects on health outcomes depending upon the age at which a person started
smoking? Only panel data can give answers to these and related questions because we must
follow multiple people across time.

Beginning with a set of data with two independent variables we ask the question: are these
related? One way to visually answer this question is to create a scatter plot of the data. We could
not do that before when we were doing descriptive statistics because those data were univariate.
Now we have bivariate data so we can plot in two dimensions. Three dimensions are possible
on a flat piece of paper but become very hard to fully conceptualize. Of course, more than three
dimensions cannot be graphed although the relationships can be measured mathematically.

To provide mathematical precision to the measurement of what we see we use the correlation
coefficient. The correlation tells us something about the co-movement of two variables, but
nothing about why this movement occurred. Formally, correlation analysis assumes that both
variables being analyzed are independent variables. This means that neither one causes the
movement in the other. Further, it means that neither variable is dependent on the other, or for
that matter, on any other variable. Even with these limitations, correlation analysis can yield
some interesting results.

The correlation coefficient, (pronounced rho), is the mathematical statistic for a population
that provides us with a measurement of the strength of a linear relationship between the two
variables. For a sample of data, the statistic, r, developed by Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is
an estimate of the population correlation and is defined mathematically as:

OR

Where                are the standard deviations of the two independent variables

                     are the sample means of the two variables, and  are

the individual observations of  . The correlation coefficient r ranges in value from

-1 to 1. The second equivalent formula is often used because it may be computationally easier.

As scary as these formulas look, they are really just the ratio of the covariance between the two

variables and the product of their two standard deviations. That is to say, it is a measure of

relative variances.

In practice all correlation and regression analysis will be provided through computer software
designed for these purposes. Anything more than perhaps one-half a dozen observations creates
immense computational problems. It was because of this fact that correlation, and even more so,
regression, were not widely used research tools until after the advent of "computing machines."
Now the computing power required to analyze data using regression packages is deemed
almost trivial by comparison to just a decade ago.

To visualize any linear relationship that may exist review the plot of a scatter diagrams of the

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 315
standardized data. Figure 19 presents several scatter diagrams and the calculated value of r. In

panels (a) and (b) notice that the data generally trend together, (a) upward and (b) downward.

Panel (a) is an example of a positive correlation and panel (b) is an example of a negative

correlation, or relationship. The sign of the correlation coefficient tells us if the relationship is

a positive or negative (inverse) one. If all the values of     are on a straight line the

correlation coefficient will be either        depending on whether the line has a positive

or negative slope and the closer to one or negative one the stronger the relationship between

the two variables. BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT

DOES NOT TELL US THE SLOPE.

     Figure 19

Remember, all the correlation coefficient tells us is whether or not the data are linearly related.
In panel (d) the variables obviously have some type of very specific relationship to each other,
but the correlation coefficient is zero, indicating no linear relationship exists.

If you suspect a linear relationship between                can measure how strong the
linear relationship is.

What the VALUE of r tells us:

 The value of r is always between                          .

 The size of the correlation r indicates that strength of the linear relationship between

316 AHMED FARID
               . Values of r close to                               indicate a stronger linear relationship
                          .
between

 If     there is absolutely no linear relationship between             (no linear

correlation).

 If     , there is perfect positive correlation. If                there is perfect negative

correlation. In both these cases, all of the original data points lie on a straight line: ANY

straight line no matter what the slope. Of course, in the real world, this will not generally

happen.

What the SIGN of r tells us

 A positive value of r means that when                             tends to increase and when

                             tend to decrease (positive correlation).

 A negative value of r means that when                             tends to decrease and when

                             tends to increase (negative correlation).

Note: Strong correlation does not suggest that                                                               We say,
"correlation does not imply causation."

Linear Equations

Linear regression to two variables is based on a linear equation with one independent variable.
The equation has the form:

Where a and b are constant numbers.

The variable x is the independent variable, and y is the dependent variable. Another way to
think about this equation is a statement of cause and effect. The X variable is the cause, and
the Y variable is the hypothesized effect. Typically, you choose a value to substitute for the
independent variable and then solve for the dependent variable.

The graph of a linear equation of the form   is a straight line. Any line that is not
vertical can be described by this equation.

Slope and Y-Intercept of a Linear Equation

For the linear equation                , b = slope and a = y-intercept. From algebra recall that the

slop is a number that described the steepness of a line, and the y-intercept is the y coordinate of

318 AHMED FARID
the point  where the line crosses the y-axis. From calculus the slope is the first derivative

of the function. For a linear function, the slope is        where we can read the mathematical

expression as "the change in         that results from a change in

Figure 20: Three possible graphs of  . (a) if b > 0, the line slopes upward to the right.

(b) if b=0, the line is horizontal. (c) if b < 0, the line slopes downward to the right.

The Regression Equation

Regression analysis is a statistical technique that can test the hypothesis that a variable is
dependent upon one or more other variables. Further, regression analysis can provide an
estimate of the magnitude of the impact of a change in one variable on another. This last feature,
of course, is all important in predicting future values.

Regression analysis is based upon a functional relationship among variables and further,
assumes that the relationship is linear. This linearity assumption is required because, for the
most part, the theoretical statistical properties of non-linear estimation are not well worked
out yet by the mathematicians and econometricians. This presents us with some difficulties in
economic analysis because many of our theoretical models are nonlinear. The marginal cost
curve, for example, is decidedly nonlinear as is the total cost function, if we are to believe
in the effect of specialization of labor and the Law of Diminishing Marginal Product. There
are techniques for overcoming some of these difficulties, exponential and logarithmic
transformation of the data for example, but at the outset we must recognize that standard
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis will always use a linear function to estimate
what might be a nonlinear relationship.

The general linear regression model can be stated by the equation:

Where is the intercept,              are the slope between Y and the appropriate

(pronounced epsilon), is the error term that captures errors in measurement of Y and the effect

on Y of any variables missing from the equation that would contribute to explaining variations

in Y. This equation is the theoretical population equation and therefore uses Greek letters. The

equation we will estimate will have the Roman equivalent symbols. This is parallel to how we

kept track of the population parameters and sample parameters before. The symbol for the

population mean was and for the sample mean and for the population standard deviation

was and for the sample standard deviation was s. The equation that will be estimated with a

sample of data for two independent variables will thus be:

                              FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 319
        As with our earlier work with probability distributions, this model works only if certain
        assumptions hold. These are that the Y is normally distributed, the errors are also normally
        distributed with a mean of zero and a constant standard deviation, and that the error terms are
        independent of the size of X and independent of each other.

        Assumptions of the Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model

        Each of these assumptions needs a bit more explanation. If one of these assumptions fails to
        be true, then it will have an effect on the quality of the estimates. Some of the failures of these
        assumptions can be fixed while others result in estimates that quite simply provide no insight
        into the questions the model is trying to answer or worse, give biased estimates.

             1. The independent variables, , are all measured without error, and are fixed numbers
                  that are independent of the error term. This assumption is saying in effect that Y is
                  deterministic, the result of a fixed component "X" and a random error component " ."

             2. The error term is a random variable with a mean of zero and a constant variance. The
                  meaning of this is that the variances of the independent variables are independent of
                  the value of the variable. Consider the relationship between personal income and the
                  quantity of a good purchased as an example of a case where the variance is dependent
                  upon the value of the independent variable, income. It is plausible that as income
                  increases the variation around the amount purchased will also increase simply because
                  of the flexibility provided with higher levels of income. The assumption is for constant
                  variance with respect to the magnitude of the independent variable called
                  homoscedasticity. If the assumption fails, then it is called heteroscedasticity. Figure 21
                  shows the case of homoscedasticity where all three distributions have the same
                  variance around the predicted value of Y regardless of the magnitude of X.

             3. Error terms should be normally distributed. This can be seen in Figure 21 by the shape
                  of the distributions placed on the predicted line at the expected value of the relevant
                  value of Y.

             4. The independent variables are independent of Y but are also assumed to be
                  independent of the other X variables. The model is designed to estimate the effects of
                  independent variables on some dependent variable in accordance with a proposed
                  theory. The case where some or more of the independent variables are correlated is not
                  unusual. There may be no cause and effect relationship among the independent
                  variables, but nevertheless they move together. Take the case of a simple supply curve
                  where quantity supplied is theoretically related to the price of the product and the
                  prices of inputs. There may be multiple inputs that may over time move together from
                  general inflationary pressure. The input prices will therefore violate this assumption of
                  regression analysis. This condition is called multicollinearity.

             5. The error terms are uncorrelated with each other. This situation arises from an effect
                  on one error term from another error term. While not exclusively a time series
                  problem, it is here that we most often see this case. An X variable in time period one

320 AHMED FARID
has an effect on the Y variable, but this effect then has an effect in the next time period.
This effect gives rise to a relationship among the error terms. This case is called
autocorrelation, "self-correlated." The error terms are now not independent of each
other, but rather have their own effect on subsequent error terms.

Figure 21 shows the case where the assumptions of the regression model are being satisfied. The

estimated line is  . Three values of X are shown. A normal distribution is placed at

each point where X equals the estimated line and the associated error at each value of Y. Notice

that the three distributions are normally distributed around the point on the line, and further,

the variation, variance, around the predicted value is constant indicating homoscedasticity from

assumption 2. Figure 21 does not show all the assumptions of the regression model, but it helps

visualize these important ones.

Figure 21

                                                                  FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 321
                           Figure 22

        This is the general form that is most often called the multiple regression model. So-called
        "simple" regression analysis has only one independent (right-hand) variable rather than many
        independent variables. Simple regression is just a special case of multiple regression. There
        is some value in beginning with simple regression: it is easy to graph in two dimensions,
        difficult to graph in three dimensions, and impossible to graph in more than three dimensions.
        Consequently, our graphs will be for the simple regression case. Figure 22 presents the
        regression problem in the form of a scatter plot graph of the data set where it is hypothesized
        that Y is dependent upon the single independent variable X.
        The regression problem comes down to determining which straight line would best represent
        the data in Figure 23. Regression analysis is sometimes called "least squares" analysis because
        the method of determining which line best "fits" the data is to minimize the sum of the squared
        residuals of a line put through the data.

                        Figure 23: Population Equation:
                        Estimated Equation:

Figure 23 shows the assumed relationship between consumption and income from
macroeconomic theory. Here the data are plotted as a scatter plot and an estimated straight
line has been drawn. From this graph we can see an error term, . Each data point also has an
error term. Again, the error term is put into the equation to capture effects on consumption that
are not caused by income changes. Such other effects might be a person's savings or wealth, or
periods of unemployment. We will see how by minimizing the sum of these errors we can get
an estimate for the slope and intercept of this line.
Consider the graph in Figure 24. The notation has returned to that for the more general model
rather than the specific case of the Macroeconomic consumption function in our example.

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 323

The is read "y hat" and is the estimated value of y. (In Figure 23 represents the estimated
value of consumption because it is on the estimated line.) It is the value of y obtained using the
regression line. is not generally equal to y from the data.

The term                    is called the "error" or residual. It is not an error in the sense of a

mistake. The error term was put into the estimating equation to capture missing variables and

error in measurement that may have occurred in the dependent variables. The absolute value

of a residual measure the vertical distance between the actual value of y and the estimated value

of y. In other words, it measures the vertical distance between the actual data point and the

predicted point on the line as can be seen on the graph at point .

If the observed data point lies above the line, the residual is positive, and the line underestimates
the actual data value for y.

If the observed data point lies below the line, the residual is negative, and the line overestimates
that actual data value for y.

In the graph,               is the residual for the point shown. Here the point lies above the

line, and the residual is positive. For each data point the residuals, or errors, are calculated

                            where n is the sample size. Each is a vertical distance.

The sum of the errors squared is the term obviously called Sum of Squared Errors (SSE).

Using calculus, you can determine the straight line that has the parameter values of

324 AHMED FARID
that minimizes the SSE. When you make the SSE a minimum, you have determined the points
that are on the line of best fit. It turns out that the line of best fit has the equation:

The sample means of the x values and the y values are         , respectively. The best fit line

always passes through the point      called the points of means.

The slope b can also be written as:

Where  the standard deviation of the y values and             the standard deviation of the x

values and r is the correlation coefficient between x and y.

These equations are called the Normal Equations and come from another very important
mathematical finding called the Gauss-Markov Theorem without which we could not do
regression analysis. The Gauss-Markov Theorem tells us that the estimates we get from using
the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression method will result in estimates that have some very
important properties. In the Gauss-Markov Theorem it was proved that a least squares line
is BLUE, which is, Best, Linear, Unbiased, Estimator. Best is the statistical property that an
estimator is the one with the minimum variance. Linear refers to the property of the type of
line being estimated. An unbiased estimator is one whose estimating function has an expected
mean equal to the mean of the population. (You will remember that the expected value
was equal to the population mean in accordance with the Central Limit Theorem. This is
exactly the same concept here).

Using the OLS method, we can now find the estimate of the error variance, which is the
variance of the squared errors, . This is sometimes called the standard error of the estimate.
(Grammatically this is probably best said as the estimate of the error's variance). The formula
for the estimate of the error variance is:

Where is the predicted value of y and y is the observed value, and thus the term

is the squared errors that are to be minimized to find the estimates of the regression line

parameters. This is really just the variance of the error terms and follows our regular variance

formula. One important note is that here we are dividing by       , which is the degrees of

freedom. The degrees of freedom of a regression equation will be the number of observations,

n, reduced b the number of estimated parameters, which includes the intercept as a parameter.

The variance of the errors is fundamental in testing hypotheses for a regression. It tells us just
how "tight" the dispersion is about the line. As we will see shortly, the greater the dispersion
about the line, meaning the larger the variance of the errors, the less probable that the

                                                                   FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 325
        hypothesized independent variable will be found to have a significant effect on the dependent
        variable. In short, the theory being tested will more likely fail if the variance of the error term
        is high. Upon reflection this should not be a surprise. As we tested hypotheses about a mean we
        observed that large variances reduced the calculated test statistic and thus it failed to reach the
        tail of the distribution. In those cases, the null hypotheses could not be rejected. If we cannot
        reject the null hypothesis in a regression problem, we must conclude that the hypothesized
        independent variable has no effect on the dependent variable.
        A way to visualize this concept is to draw two scatter plots of x and y data along a
        predetermined line. The first will have little variance of the errors, meaning that all the data
        points will move close to the line. Now do the same except the data points will have a large
        estimate of the error variance, meaning that the data points are scattered widely along the
        line. Clearly the confidence about a relationship between x and y is affected by this difference
        between the estimate of the error variance.

How Good is the Equation?

The multiple correlation coefficient, also called the coefficient of multiple determination
or the coefficient of determination, is given by the formula:

Where SSR is the regression sum of squares, the squared deviation of the predicted value

of y from the mean value of y  and SST is the total sum of squares which is the

total squared deviation of the dependent variable, y, from its mean value, including the

error term, SSE, the sum of squared errors. Figure 25 shows how the total deviation of

the dependent variable, y, is partitioned into these two pieces.

     Figure 25

Figure 25 shows the estimated regression line and a single observation, . Regression
analysis tries to explain the variation of the data about the mean value of the dependent
variable, y. The question is, why do the observations of y vary from the average level of y?

                                                       FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 329
The value of y at observation varies from the mean of y by the difference

.). The sum of these differences squared is SST, the sum of squares total. The actual value

of y at deviates from the estimated value, , by the difference between the estimate

value and the actual value,  . We recall that this is the error term, e, and the sum

of these errors is SSE, sum of squared errors. The deviation of the predicted value of y, ,

from the mean value of y is  and is the SSR, sum of squares regression. It is called

"regression" because it is the deviation explained by the regression. (Sometimes the SSR

is called SSM for sum of squares mean because it measures the deviation from the mean

value of the dependent variable, y, as shown on the graph.).

Because the SST = SSR + SSE we see that the multiple correlation coefficient is the
percent of the variance, or deviation in y from its mean value, that is explained by the
equation when taken as a whole. will vary between zero and 1, with zero indicating
that none of the variation in y was explained by the equation and a value of 1 indicating
that 100% of the variation in y was explained by the equation. For time series studies
expect a high and for cross-section data expect low .

While a high is desirable, remember that it is the tests of the hypothesis concerning
the existence of a relationship between a set of independent variables and a particular
dependent variable that was the motivating factor in using the regression model. It is
validating a cause-and-effect relationship developed by some theory that is the true
reason that we chose the regression analysis. Increasing the number of independent
variables will have the effect of increasing . To account for this effect the proper
measure of the coefficient of determination is , adjusted for degrees of freedom, to
keep down mindless addition of independent variables.

There is no statistical test for the and thus little can be said about the model using
     with our characteristic confidence level. Two models that have the same size of SSE,

that is sum of squared errors, may have very different if the competing models have
different SST, total sum of squared deviations. The goodness of fit of the two models
is the same; they both have the same sum of squares unexplained, errors squared, but
because of the larger total sum of squares on one of the models the differs. Again, the
real value of regression as a tool is to examine hypotheses developed from a model that
predicts certain relationships among the variables. These are tests of hypotheses on the
coefficients of the model and not a game of maximizing .

RELEVANCE TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING COURSEWORK

This section explains the relevance of the regression models for trip generation, mode choice, traffic
flow-speed-density relationship, traffic safety, and appropriate sample size for spot speed study to
transportation engineering coursework.

         Regression Models for Trip Generation

        The trip generation step is the first of the four-step process for estimating travel demand for
        infrastructure planning. It involves estimating the number of trips made to and from each
        traffic analysis zone (TAZ). Trip generation models are estimated based on land use and trip-
        making data. They use either linear regression or cross-tabulation of household characteristics.
        Simple linear regression is described in the section above titled "Compute and Interpret Simple
        Linear Regression Between Two Variables", and the tools to conduct the linear regression are
        discussed in "Data Analysis Tools (Spreadsheets and Basic Programming)".

         Mode Choice

        Estimation of Mode Choice is also part of the four-step process for estimating travel demand.
        It entails estimating the trip makers' transportation mode (drive alone, walk, take public transit,
        etc.) choices. The results of this step are the counts of trips categorized by mode. The most
        popular mode choice model is the discrete choice, multinomial logit model. Hypothesis tests
        are conducted for the estimated model parameters to assess whether they are "statistically
        significant." The section titled "Use Specific Significance Tests Including, Z-Test, T-Test (one
        and two samples), Chi-Squared Test" of this chapter provides extensive information on
        hypothesis testing.

         Traffic Flow-Speed-Density Relationship

        Greenshield's model is used to represent the traffic flow-speed-density relationship. Traffic
        speed and traffic density (number of vehicles per unit mile) are collected to estimate a linear
        regression model for speed as a function of density. "Compute and Interpret Simple Linear
        Regression Between Two Variables" above provides information on simple linear regression.
        "Data Analysis Tools (Spreadsheets and Basic Programming)" provides guidance for
        implementing the linear regression technique using tools available in Microsoft Excel and the
        programing language R.

332 AHMED FARID
         Traffic Safety

        Statistical analyses of traffic collisions are used to estimate traffic safety in roadway locations. A
        variety of regression models, most of which are beyond the scope of this book, are implemented
        to investigate the association between crashes and characteristics of the roadway locations.
         Hypothesis tests are conducted for the estimated model parameters to assess whether they are
        "statistically significant." "Find Confidence Intervals for Parameter Estimates" above describes
        the confidence intervals of the parameters, and "Use Specific Significance Tests Including,
        Z-Test, T-Test (one and two samples), Chi-Squared Test" discusses the different types of
        hypothesis tests. Programing language R includes statistical analysis toolkits or packages that
        may be used to estimate the regression models for crash data.

         Appropriate Sample Size for Spot Speed Study

        Spot speed studies during relatively congestion-free durations are conducted to estimate mean
        speed, modal speed, pace, standard deviation, and different percentile of speeds at a roadway
        location. An adequate number of data points (i.e., the number of vehicle speeds recorded) are
        required to ensure reliable results within an acceptable margin of error. "Estimate the Required
        Sample Size for Testing" in this chapter discusses the approach to assessing the adequacy of
        sample size.

   Key Takeaways

           Estimating the total number of trips made to and from each traffic analysis zone (TAZ)is typically
              the first step in the four-step travel demand modeling process. Simple linear regression models and
              the tools (such as MS Excel and R) to estimate these models are used this step of the travel demand
              modeling process. The independent variables for these models are the total number of trips with
              demographic and employment data for the zones as independent variables.

           Hypothesis testing is used to determine the statistical significance of coefficients estimated for the
              discrete choice multinomial models. Such models are used for the mode choice step of the travel
              demand modeling process.

           Linear regression models are also used to estimate the relationship between speed and density on
              uninterrupted flow facilities such as freeway segments.

           Regression models are also implemented to investigate the association between crashes and
              characteristics of the roadway locations. Tools described in the chapter for linear regression may
              also be used for estimating these models, including negative binomial regression models.

           Statistical analysis is also used to ensure that an adequate number of data points (i.e., the number of
              vehicle speeds recorded) are used to obtain estimates of the mean, median, and 85th percentile of
              speed within an acceptable margin of error in a spot speed study.

                                                GLOSSARY - KEY TERMS

 - Coefficient of Determination[1] - this is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the
percentage variation of the dependent variable that can be explained by the variation in the

                                                                                FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 333
independent variable. Sometimes calculated by the equation                where SSR is the "sum of

squares regressions" and SST is the "sum of squares total." The appropriate coefficient of

determination to be reported should always be adjusted for degrees of freedom first

A is the Symbol for the y-Intercept[1] - sometimes written as 0, because when writing the

theoretical linear model 0 is used to represent a coefficient for a population

Analysis of Variance[1] - also referred to as ANOVA, is a method of testing whether or not the

means of three or more populations are equal. The method is applicable if: (1) all populations of

interest are normally distributed (2) the populations have equal standard deviations (3) samples (not

necessarily of the same size) are randomly and independently selected from each population (4) there

is one independent variable and one dependent variable. The test statistic for analysis of variance is

the F-ratio

Average[1] - a number that describes the central tendency of the data; there are a number of

specialized averages, including the arithmetic mean, weighted mean, median, mode, and geometric

mean.

B is the Symbol for Slope[1] - the word coefficient will be used regularly for the slope, because it is a

number that will always be next to the letter "x." It will be written a 1 when a sample is used, and 1

will be used with a population or when writing the theoretical linear model.

Binomial Distribution[1] - a discrete random variable which arises from Bernoulli trials; there are

a fixed number, n, of independent trials. "Independent" means that the result of any trial (for example,

trial 1) does not affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same

conditions. Under these circumstances the binomial random variable X is defined as the number of

successes in n trials. The notation is: ~(,). The mean is = and the standard deviation is

             . The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is

Bivariate[1] - two variables are present in the model where one is the "cause" or independent variable
and the other is the "effect" of dependent variable.
Central Limit Theorem[1] - given a random variable with known mean  and known standard
deviation, , we are sampling with size n, and we are interested in two new random variables: the

sample mean, . If the size (n) of the sample is sufficiently large, then                    . If the size

(n) of the sample is sufficiently large, then the distribution of the sample means will approximate a
normal distributions regardless of the shape of the population. The mean of the sample means will
equal the population mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, , is

called the standard error of the mean.
Cohen's d [1] - a measure of effect size based on the differences between two means. If d is between
0 and 0.2 then the effect is small. If d approaches is 0.5, then the effect is medium, and if d approaches
0.8, then it is a large effect.
Confidence Interval (CI)[1] - an interval estimate for an unknown population parameter. This
depends on: (1) the desired confidence level (2) information that is known about the distribution (for
example, known standard deviation) (3) the sample and its size
Confidence Level (CL)[1] - the percent expression for the probability that the confidence interval
contains the true population parameter; for example, if the CL = 90%, then in 90 out of 100 samples
the interval estimate will enclose the true population parameter.
Contingency Table[1] - a table that displays sample values for two different factors that may be
dependent or contingent on one another; it facilitates determining conditional probabilities.

334 AHMED FARID
Critical Value[1] - The t or Z value set by the researcher that measures the probability of a Type I
error, 

Degrees of Freedom (df)[1] - the number of objects in a sample that are free to vary

Error Bound for a Population Mean (EBM)[1] - the margin of error; depends on the confidence

level, sample size, and known or estimated population standard deviation.

Error Bound for a Population Proportion (EBP)[1] - the margin of error; depends on the

confidence level, the sample size, and the estimated (from the sample) proportion of successes.

Goodness-of-Fit[1] - a hypothesis test that compares expected and observed values in order to look

for significant differences within one non-parametric variable. The degrees of freedom used equals

the (number of categories - 1).

Hypothesis[1] - a statement about the value of a population parameter, in case of two hypotheses,
the statement assumed to be true is called the null hypothesis (notation 0) and the contradictory
statement is called the alternative hypothesis (notation )

Hypothesis Testing[1] - Based on sample evidence, a procedure for determining whether the

hypothesis stated is a reasonable statement and should not be rejected, or is unreasonable and should

be rejected.

Independent Groups[1] - two samples that are selected from two populations, and the values from

one population are not related in any way to the values from the other population.

Inferential Statistics[1] - also called statistical inference or inductive statistics; this facet of statistics

deals with estimating a population parameter based on a sample statistic. For example, if four out

of the 100 calculators sampled are defective we might infer that four percent of the production is

defective.

Linear[1] - a model that takes data and regresses it into a straight line equation.

Matched Pairs[1] - two samples that are dependent. Differences between a before and after scenario

are tested by testing one population mean of differences.

Mean[1] - a number that measures the central tendency; a common name for mean is "average."

The term "mean" is a shortened form of "arithmetic mean." By definition, the mean for a sample

(denoted by                      , and the mean for a population (denoted by )

is
Multivariate[1] - a system or model where more than one independent variable is being used to
predict an outcome. There can only ever be one dependent variable, but there is no limit to the
number of independent variables.

Normal Distribution[1] - a continuous random variable with pdf                        , where 

is the mean of the distribution and  is the standard deviation; notation: ~(,). If =0 and =1,
the random variable, Z, is called the standard normal distribution.

Normal Distribution[1] - a continuous random variable with pdf                                   ,

where  is the mean of the distribution and  is the standard deviation, notation:
~(,) and =1, the random variable is called the standard normal distribution.
One-Way ANOVA[1] - a method of testing whether or not the means of three or more populations
are equal; the method is applicable if: (1) all populations of interest are normally distributed (2) the
populations have equal standard deviations (3) samples (not necessarily of the same size) are randomly
and independently selected from each population. The test statistic for analysis of variance is the F-
ratio

Parameter[1] - a numerical characteristic of a population

Point Estimate[1] - a single number computed from a sample and used to estimate a population

parameter

Pooled Variance[1] - a weighted average of two variances that can then be used when calculating

standard error.

R - Correlation Coefficient[1] - A number between -1 and 1 that represents the strength and

direction of the relationship between "X" and "Y." The value for "r" will equal 1 or -1 only if all the

plotted points form a perfectly straight line.

Residual or "Error"[1] - the value calculated from subtracting              . The absolute value of a

residual measures the vertical distance between the actual value of y and the estimated value of y that

appears on the best-fit line.

Sampling Distribution[1] - Given simple random samples of size n from a given population with

a measured characteristic such as mean, proportion, or standard deviation for each sample, the

probability distribution of all the measured characteristics is called a sampling distribution.

Standard Deviation[1] - a number that is equal to the square root of the variance and measures how

far data values are from their mean; notation: s for sample standard deviation and  for population

standard deviation

Standard Error of the Mean[1] - the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, or

Standard Error of the Proportion[1] - the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of

proportions

Student's t-Distribution[1] - investigated and reported by William S. Gossett in 1908 and published

under the pseudonym Student; the major characteristics of this random variable are: (1) it is

continuous and assumes any real values (2) the pdf is symmetrical about its mean of zero (3) it

approaches the standard normal distribution as n gets larger (4) there is a "family" of t-distributions:

each representative of the family is completely defined by the number of degrees of freedom, which

depends upon the application for which the t is being used.

Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)[1] - the calculated value from adding up all the squared residual terms.

The hope is that this value is very small when creating a model.

Test for Homogeneity[1] - a test used to draw a conclusion about whether two populations have the

same distribution. The degrees of freedom used equals the (number of columns - 1).

Test of Independence[1] - a hypothesis test that compares expected and observed values for

contingency tables in order to test for independence between two variables. The degrees of freedom

used equals the (number of columns - 1) multiplied by the (number of rows - 1).

Test Statistic[1] - the formula that counts the number of standard deviations on the relevant

distribution that estimated parameter is away from the hypothesized value.

Type I Error[1] - the decision is to reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis is true.

Type II Error[1] - the decision is not to reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis is

false.

Variance[1] - mean of the squared deviations from the mean; the square of the standard deviation.

For a set of data, a deviation can be represented as         where x is a value of the data and is the

sample mean. The sample variance is equal to the sum of the squares of the deviations divided by the

difference of the sample size and one.

X - the Independent Variable[1] - This will sometimes be referred to as the "predictor" variable,

336 AHMED FARID
because these values were measured in order to determine what possible outcomes could be
predicted.
Y - the Dependent Variable[1] - also, using the letter "y" represents actual values while represents
predicted or estimated values. Predicted values will come from plugging in observed "x" values into a
linear model

CHAPTER 8

Bayes Theorem[6] - a useful tool for calculating conditional probability. Bayes theorem can be
expressed as: 1, 2,...,  be a set of mutually exclusive events that together form the sample space
S. Let B be any event from the same sample space, such that ()>0. Then,
Bernoulli Trials[5] - an experiment with the following characteristics: (1) There are only two

348 AHMED FARID
possible outcomes called "success" and "failure" for each trial. (2) The probability p of a success is the
same for any trial (so the probability =1- of a failure is the same for any trial).
Binomial Experiment[5] - a statistical experiment that satisfies the following three conditions: (1)
There are a fixed number of trials, n. (2) There are only two possible outcomes, called "success" and,
"failure," for each trial. The letter p denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and q denotes, the
probability of a failure on one trial. (3) The n trials are independent and are repeated using identical
conditions.
Binomial Probability Distribution[5] - a discrete random variable that arises from Bernoulli trials;
there are a fixed number, n, of independent trials. "Independent" means that the result of any trial
(for example, trial one) does not affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted
under the same conditions. Under these circumstances the binomial random variable X is defined as
the number of successes in n trials. The mean is = and the standard deviation is

The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is

Combination[6] - a combination is a selection of all or part of a set of objects, without regard to the

order in which objects are selected

Conditional Probability[5] - the likelihood that an event will occur given that another event has

already occurred.

Discrete Variable / continuous variable[6] - if a variable can take on any value between its

minimum value and its maximum value, it is called a continuous variable; otherwise it is called a

discrete variable

Expected Value[6] - the mean of the discrete random variable X is also called the expected value of
X. Notationally, the expected value of X is denoted by ().

Exponential Distribution[5] - a continuous random variable that appears when we are interested

in the intervals of time between some random events, for example, the length of time between

emergency arrivals at a hospital. The mean is          and the standard deviation is     . The

probability                          density           function                          is

Geometric Distribution[5] - a discrete random variable that arises from the Bernoulli trials; the
trials are repeated until the first success. The geometric variable X is defined as the number of trials

until the first success. The mean is

The probability of exactly x failures before the first success is given by the formula:
(=)=(1-)-1 where one wants to know probability for the number of trials until the first

success: the xth trial is the first success. An alternative formulation of the geometric distribution asks

the question: what is the probability of x failures until the first success? In this formulation the trial

that resulted in the first success is not counted. The formula for this presentation of the geometric is:

(=)=(1-). The expected value in this form of the geometric distribution is               . The

easiest way to keep these two forms of the geometric distribution straight is to remember that p is

the probability of success and (1-) is the probability of failure. In the formula the exponents simply

count the number of successes and number of failures of the desired outcome of the experiment. Of

course the sum of these two numbers must add to the number of trials in the experiment.

                                      FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 349
Geometric Experiment[5] - a statistical experiment with the following properties: (1) There are one

or more Bernoulli trials with all failures except the last one, which is a success. (2) In theory, the

number of trials could go on forever. There must be at least one trial. (3) The probability, p, of a

success and the probability, q, of a failure do not change from trial to trial.

Independent[6] - two events are independent when the occurrence of one does not affect the

probability of the occurrence of the other

Mean[6] - a mean score is an average score, often denoted by . It is the sum of individual scores

divided by the number of individuals.

Memoryless Property[5] - For an exponential random variable X, the memoryless property is the

statement that knowledge of what has occurred in the past has no effect on future probabilities.

This means that the probability that X exceeds +, given that it has exceeded x, is the same as

the probability that X would exceed t if we had no knowledge about it. In symbols we say that

                                       .

Multiplication Rule[6] - If events A and B come from the same sample space, the probability that

both A and B occur is equal to the probability the event A occurs time the probability that B occurs,

given that A has occurred.                    .

Normal Distribution[5] - a continuous random variable with pdf                        , where

 is the mean of the distribution and  is the standard deviation; notation:
                                                     , the random variable, Z, is called the standard normal

distribution
Permutation[6] - an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, with regard to the order of the
arrangement.
Poisson Distribution[5] - If there is a known average of  events occurring per unit time, and
these events are independent of each other, then the number of events X occurring in one unit of
time has the Poisson distribution. The probability of x events occurring in one unit time is equal to

Poisson Probability Distribution[5] - a discrete random variable that counts the number of times

a certain event will occur in a specific interval; characteristics of the variable: (1) the probability that

the event occurs in a given interval is the same for all intervals. (2) the events occur with a known

mean and independently of the time since the last event. The distribution is defined by the mean 

of the event in the interval. The mean is =. The standard deviation is                . The probability

of having exactly x successes in r trials is  . The Poisson distribution is often used to

approximate the binomial distribution, when n is "large" and p is "small" (a general rule is that np

should be greater than or equal to 25 and p should be less than or equal to 0.01).

Probability Distribution Function (PDF)[5] - a mathematical description of a discrete random

variable, given either in the form of an equation (formula) or in the form of a table listing all the

possible outcomes of an experiment and the probability associated with each outcome.

Quartile[6] - Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four equal parts. The values that divide

each part are called the first, second, and third quartiles; and they are denoted by

1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Random Variable[5] - a characteristic of interest in a population being studied; common notation for

variables are upper case Latin letters X, Y, Z..; common notation for a specific value from the domain

(set of all possible values of a variable) are lower case Latin letters x, y, and z. For example, if X is the

350 AHMED FARID
number of children in a family, then x represents a specific integer 0, 1, 2, 3,... Variables in statistics
differ from variables in intermediate algebra in the two following ways: (1) The domain of the random
variable is not necessarily a numerical set; the domain may be expressed in words; for example, if X =
hair color then domain is {black, blonde, gray, green, orange}. (2) We can tell what specific value x the
random variable X takes only after performing the experiment.
Standard Deviation[6] - The standard deviation is a numerical value used to indicate how widely
individuals in a group vary. If individual observations vary greatly from the group mean, the standard
deviation is big; and vice versa. It is important to distinguish between the standard deviation of
a population and the standard deviation of a sample. They have different notation, and they are
computed differently. The standard deviation of a population is denoted by  and the standard
deviation of a sample, by 
Standard Normal Distribution[5] - a continuous random variable ~(0,1); when X follows the
standard normal distribution, it is often noted as ~(0,1).
Uniform Distribution[5] - a continuous random variable that has equally likely outcomes over the
domain, <<; it is often referred as the rectangular distribution because the graph of the pdf

has the form of a rectangle. The mean is                and the standard deviation is

The        probability                    density           function                          is

Variance[6] - the variance is a numerical value used to indicate how widely individuals in a group
vary. If individual observations vary greatly from the group mean, the variance is big; and vice versa.
It is important to distinguish between the variance of a population and the variance of a sample. They
have different notation, and they are computed differently. The variance of a population is denoted
by 2; and the variance of a sample, by 2

Z-Score[5] - the linear transformation of the form                                            ; if this

transformation is applied to any normal distribution ~(,) the result is the standard normal

distribution ~(0,1). If this transformation is applied to any specific value x of the random variable

with mean  and standard deviation , the result is called the z-score of x. The z-score allows us to

compare data that are normally distributed but scaled differently. A z-score is the number of standard

deviations a particular x is away from its mean value.

CHAPTER 9

 - Coefficient of Determination[5] - this is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the

percentage variation of the dependent variable that can be explained by the variation in the

independent variable. Sometimes calculated by the equation  where SSR is the "sum of

squares regressions" and SST is the "sum of squares total." The appropriate coefficient of

determination to be reported should always be adjusted for degrees of freedom first
A is the Symbol for the y-Intercept[5] - sometimes written as 0, because when writing the
theoretical linear model 0 is used to represent a coefficient for a population

of three or more populations are equal. The method is applicable if: (1) all populations of interest are

normally distributed (2) the populations have equal standard deviations (3) samples (not necessarily

of the same size) are randomly and independently selected from each population (4) there is one

                        FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 351
independent variable and one dependent variable. The test statistic for analysis of variance is the F-
ratio

specialized averages, including the arithmetic mean, weighted mean, median, mode, and geometric
mean.
B is the Symbol for Slope[5] - the word coefficient will be used regularly for the slope, because it is a
number that will always be next to the letter "x." It will be written a 1 when a sample is used, and 1
will be used with a population or when writing the theoretical linear model.
Binomial Distribution[5] - a discrete random variable which arises from Bernoulli trials; there are a
fixed number, n, of independent trials. "Independent" means that the result of any trial (for example,
trial 1) does not affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same
conditions. Under these circumstances the binomial random variable X is defined as the number of
successes in n trials. The notation is: ~(,). The mean is = and the standard deviation is

. The probability of exactly x successes in n trials is

Bivariate[5] - two variables are present in the model where one is the "cause" or independent variable
and the other is the "effect" of dependent variable.
Central Limit Theorem[5] - given a random variable with known mean  and known standard
deviation, , we are sampling with size n, and we are interested in two new random variables: the

sample mean, . If the size (n) of the sample is sufficiently large, then  . If the size

(n) of the sample is sufficiently large, then the distribution of the sample means will approximate a
normal distributions regardless of the shape of the population. The mean of the sample means will
equal the population mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, , is

called the standard error of the mean.
Cohen's d [5] - a measure of effect size based on the differences between two means. If d is between
0 and 0.2 then the effect is small. If d approaches is 0.5, then the effect is medium, and if d approaches
0.8, then it is a large effect.
Confidence Interval (CI)[5] - an interval estimate for an unknown population parameter. This
depends on: (1) the desired confidence level (2) information that is known about the distribution (for
example, known standard deviation) (3) the sample and its size

contains the true population parameter; for example, if the CL = 90%, then in 90 out of 100 samples
the interval estimate will enclose the true population parameter.

error, 
Degrees of Freedom (df)[5] - the number of objects in a sample that are free to vary
Error Bound for a Population Mean (EBM)[5] - the margin of error; depends on the confidence
level, sample size, and known or estimated population standard deviation.
Error Bound for a Population Proportion (EBP)[5] - the margin of error; depends on the
confidence level, the sample size, and the estimated (from the sample) proportion of successes.
Goodness-of-Fit[5] - a hypothesis test that compares expected and observed values in order to look

352 AHMED FARID
for significant differences within one non-parametric variable. The degrees of freedom used equals

the (number of categories - 1).

the statement assumed to be true is called the null hypothesis (notation 0) and the contradictory
statement is called the alternative hypothesis (notation )

Hypothesis Testing[5] - Based on sample evidence, a procedure for determining whether the

hypothesis stated is a reasonable statement and should not be rejected, or is unreasonable and should

be rejected.

Independent Groups[5] - two samples that are selected from two populations, and the values from

one population are not related in any way to the values from the other population.

Inferential Statistics[5] - also called statistical inference or inductive statistics; this facet of statistics

deals with estimating a population parameter based on a sample statistic. For example, if four out

of the 100 calculators sampled are defective we might infer that four percent of the production is

defective.

Linear[5] - a model that takes data and regresses it into a straight line equation.

Matched Pairs[5] - two samples that are dependent. Differences between a before and after scenario

are tested by testing one population mean of differences.

Mean[5] - a number that measures the central tendency; a common name for mean is "average."

The term "mean" is a shortened form of "arithmetic mean." By definition, the mean for a sample

(denoted by                      , and the mean for a population (denoted by )

is
Multivariate[5] - a system or model where more than one independent variable is being used to
predict an outcome. There can only ever be one dependent variable, but there is no limit to the
number of independent variables.

Normal Distribution[5] - a continuous random variable with pdf                       , where 

is the mean of the distribution and  is the standard deviation; notation: ~(,). If =0 and =1,
the random variable, Z, is called the standard normal distribution.

Normal Distribution[5] - a continuous random variable with pdf                       ,

where  is the mean of the distribution and  is the standard deviation, notation:
~(,) and =1, the random variable is called the standard normal distribution.
One-Way ANOVA[5] - a method of testing whether or not the means of three or more populations
are equal; the method is applicable if: (1) all populations of interest are normally distributed (2) the
populations have equal standard deviations (3) samples (not necessarily of the same size) are randomly
and independently selected from each population. The test statistic for analysis of variance is the F-
ratio
Parameter[5] - a numerical characteristic of a population
Point Estimate[5] - a single number computed from a sample and used to estimate a population
parameter
Pooled Variance[5] - a weighted average of two variances that can then be used when calculating
standard error.
R - Correlation Coefficient[5] - A number between -1 and 1 that represents the strength and
direction of the relationship between "X" and "Y." The value for "r" will equal 1 or -1 only if all the
plotted points form a perfectly straight line.

                                 FUNDAMENTALS OF MATH, PHYSICS, AND STATISTICS FOR TRANSPORTATION 353
Residual or "Error"[5] - the value calculated from subtracting              . The absolute value of a

residual measures the vertical distance between the actual value of y and the estimated value of y that

appears on the best-fit line.

Sampling Distribution[5] - Given simple random samples of size n from a given population with

a measured characteristic such as mean, proportion, or standard deviation for each sample, the

probability distribution of all the measured characteristics is called a sampling distribution.

Standard Deviation[5] - a number that is equal to the square root of the variance and measures how

far data values are from their mean; notation: s for sample standard deviation and  for population

standard deviation

Standard Error of the Mean[5] -the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means, or

Standard Error of the Proportion[5] -the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of

proportions

Student's t-Distribution[5] - investigated and reported by William S. Gossett in 1908 and published

under the pseudonym Student; the major characteristics of this random variable are: (1) it is

continuous and assumes any real values (2) the pdf is symmetrical about its mean of zero (3) it

approaches the standard normal distribution as n gets larger (4) there is a "family" of t-distributions:

each representative of the family is completely defined by the number of degrees of freedom, which

depends upon the application for which the t is being used.

Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)[5] - the calculated value from adding up all the squared residual terms.

The hope is that this value is very small when creating a model.

Test for Homogeneity[5] - a test used to draw a conclusion about whether two populations have the

same distribution. The degrees of freedom used equals the (number of columns - 1).

Test of Independence[5] - a hypothesis test that compares expected and observed values for

contingency tables in order to test for independence between two variables. The degrees of freedom

used equals the (number of columns - 1) multiplied by the (number of rows - 1).

Test Statistic[5] - The formula that counts the number of standard deviations on the relevant

distribution that estimated parameter is away from the hypothesized value.

Type I Error[5] -The decision is to reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis is true.

Type II Error[5] - The decision is not to reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, the null hypothesis

is false.

Variance[5] - mean of the squared deviations from the mean; the square of the standard deviation.

For a set of data, a deviation can be represented as         where x is a value of the data and is the

sample mean. The sample variance is equal to the sum of the squares of the deviations divided by the

difference of the sample size and one.

X - the Independent Variable[5] - This will sometimes be referred to as the "predictor" variable,

because these values were measured in order to determine what possible outcomes could be

predicted.

Y - the Dependent Variable[5] - also, using the letter "y" represents actual values while represents

predicted or estimated values. Predicted values will come from plugging in observed "x" values into a

linear model
