The first law states that energy is constant and indestructible: we transform it from one form
to another. Work is a transfer involving a force and a displacement. Heat is a chaotic transfer
associated with a potential, temperature.

Introduction

We are presenting here the essential concepts that we will use in the
following chapters, attempting to answer two questions:
· What does energy represent?
· Which forms of energy are manipulated in a machine?

1.1 Concept of Energy

1.1.1 Energy

We immediately tackle one of the most difficult concepts in all of physics:
energy.

We observe that in all phenomena, during all the transformations that we
can observe in the universe, there exists a quantity that does not vary. This
quantity is a measure for an abstract property (energy comes from the
Greek  or energeia, meaning "activity", "operation") that can take
on multiple forms.

We have learned to quantify the amount of energy present in any arbitrary
volume, and we strive to control its transformation from one form to another.
For example, the electrical energy stored in a battery can be transformed
into work in an electric motor, which can be used to operate an elevator,
which can lift a load. During all these processes, the total amount of energy
remains the same (figure 1.1), a fact that allows us, for example, to quantify
the minimum size of battery required to lift a given load.

Figure 1.1: The chemical energy stored in the fuel that has been burned is exactly
equal to the energy rejected by the exhaust pipe, plus the energy dissipated by
friction, plus the kinetic energy of the moving car. All this energy is transformed
into heat, but never destroyed, once the car is stopped (whichever the means!).

                                                                  Photo CC-by-sa by Tommi Nummelin (cropped)

Thus, energy is primarily a concept that we use to describe the transforma-
tions we observe in the world: we could say that it is "what does not change
when things change." For the engineer, it represents above all the ability of
one body to set another in motion, in a unified way (for example, with a
displacement) or in a disordered way (for example, with chaotic excitation).
We measure energy in joules (J).

                                           1.1.2 The first law

                                           The first law of thermodynamics simply states:

                                           Energy is indestructible.

 « It is important to realize that in      One can also state that "the energy of the universe is constant", or "energy is

                                           We will express the first law quantitatively in two different ways, one for a
                                           closed system (in chapter 2, equation 2/2) and the other for an open system
                                           (in chapter 3, equation 3/15).

                                           1.1.3 Forms of energy

                                           The different forms of energy that we usually identify have been revealed
                                           one by one throughout the history of physics.

                                           Kinetic energy is possessed by a body due to its velocity (see §1.2 below).
                                           It is the easiest form of energy to identify. It has long been called vis viva
                                           ("living force").

                                           Potential energy is stored due to the interaction between two objects linked
                                           by a conservative force.1 On a macroscopic scale, its most palpable form is
                                           the potential energy of altitude, resulting from the work done on a mass
                                           against its weight (it is this work that makes climbing stairs more tiring
                                           than going down, for example). By compressing a spring, potential energy
                                           of compression is stored, which can be recovered by letting it expand again.

                                           Chemical energy is a combination of potential energy and kinetic energy
                                           between atoms. Human metabolism, as well as the combustion of hydro-
                                           carbons with atmospheric oxygen used in almost all our vehicles, are both
                                           based on chemical energy transfers.
                                           In the 20th century, it was discovered that mass, at the sub-atomic level, was
                                           also a form of energy (hence the famous  = 2 relates mass and energy).
                                           Radiant (electromagnetic) energy is also identifiable at the sub-atomic level.
                                           These forms of energy are not relevant in this book.

                                           In thermodynamics, we will focus on three forms of energy, identifiable at
                                           the macroscopic scale:

                                                1A force is called conservative when it remains the same in one direction as in
                                           the other. For example, gravity is conservative (it is the same whether going up or
                                           down) but friction is not (it always opposes the motion).

Internal energy denoted  , a concept that we use to group together all
      of the kinetic and potential energy of all of the molecules of a body.
      It represents the total amount of mechanical energy stored at the
      microscopic level within an object;

Heat denoted , which is a transfer of the kinetic energy of molecules in a
      chaotic manner from one body to another;

Work denoted  , which is a transfer of energy in a coherent manner from
      one body to another.

In general, the thermodynamic engineer wishes to capture heat from bodies
that s/he wants to cool, or supply work to bodies that s/he wants to move.
We will therefore study these transfers in detail.

1.1.4 Power

Power represents a flow of energy in time. Its si unit is the joule per second,
which we name the watt (W):

1  W    1  J   -1  (1/1)

              s

Other units are often used, such as the horsepower. One horsepower is
approximately the power that a strong horse can deliver as work in full
effort (the story in §5.5 p. 141 reveals the name of the creator of this unit).
Note that several definitions for horsepower exist (see Appendix A5 p. 317);
here we refer to the din 66036 standard used in the automotive industry:

1 hp = 735.5 W     (1/2)

We will denote power by placing a dot above the symbol for energy; thus
we write  as a power (for example, mechanical) delivering an amount of
energy  every second.

In everyday language, the term "power" is used to quantify the maximum
useful power of a system. For example, when we say that a car has "100
horsepower", it means has an engine capable of providing it with a power
of  mech. = 100 hp for a few moments--but for this, the engine receives
about  combustion = 300 hp in the form of heat. Furthermore, on the road,
the average mechanical power supplied by the engine probably does not
exceed 20 hp.

Figure 1.2: A trailer, with zero power ( = 0 W) but capable of delivering a lot of
energy. The combustion of 20 t of kerosene releases about  = 800 GJ as heat;
A Trent 900 turbofan engine, with very high power (able to supply  = 14 MW to
a commercial aircraft) but devoid of energy (0 J).

              1.1.5 Specific energy and specific power

              In many thermodynamic applications, it is interesting to quantify energy
              transfers independently of the amount of mass inside the machine. For
              example, if we want to compare the operation of the engines of a motorcycle
              and of a truck, it will be wise to divide each of the energy transfers (during
              compression, combustion, expansion) by the quantity of air in the cylinders,
              to eliminate the scale effects. To this end, we use quantities called specific
              (sometimes called mass-specific); and we denote them in lowercase.

              Specific energy (sometimes called mass-specific energy), is measured in
                    joules per kilogram (J kg-1):

                                                                        (1/3)
                                                 

                                                       

              where  is the specific energy (J kg-1),
                       is the energy (J),

              and  is the mass of the system under consideration (kg).

                                              Example 1.1

              A fuel injector in a car engine must supply a specific heat comb. =
              300 kJ kg-1 regardless of the quantity of air in the cylinder. What
              will be the energy supplied when air = 0.5 kg and when air =
              1 kg?

              The heat required will be comb.1 = 1comb. = 0.5 × 300 × 103 =
              150 × 103 J = 150 kJ in the first case, and comb.2 = 2comb. =
              300 kJ in the second case.

              Specific power (sometimes also called mass-specific power), has the same
                    units as specific energy: we divide watts (joules per second) by a mass
                    flow rate (kilos per second).

                                                                        (1/4)
                                                 

                                                       

              where  is the specific power (J kg-1),
                       is the power (W),

              and  is the mass flow rate through the system (kg s-1).

                                              Example 1.2

              A combustion chamber in a jet engine must supply a spe-
              cific power comb. = 300 kJ kg-1 regardless of the air flow rate
              through the engine. What will be the power supplied when
               air = 0.5 kg s-1 and when  air = 1 kg s-1?

              A power  comb.1 =  1comb. = 0.5 × 300 × 103 = 150 × 103 W =
              150 kW will be required in the first case, and  comb.2 =  2comb. =
              300 kW in the second case.

                  Power  and mass flow  are written with a dot (flow in
             time) but not the specific power as heat , which is measured
             in J kg-1 just like specific heat.

                  Thanks to the concepts of specific energy and specific
             power, we can compare the same physical process (air heated
             up by combustion) in this example with the previous one, in
             two very different machines.

It should be noted that in practice, the adjectives "specific" or "mass-
specific" are often simply omitted, and that the lowercase notation is not
systematically used in scientific literature.

1.2 Mechanical Energy

The student will have no difficulty quantifying kinetic energy:

                                       =   1 2 (1/5)
                                             2

   where  is the kinetic energy (J),
            is the mass of the body (kg),

   and  is the velocity (m s-1, see Appendix A6 p. 319 for other units).

Of course, we also define specific kinetic energy correspondingly:

                                      =   1 2 (1/6)
                                           2

In thermodynamics, we are mainly interested in the changes in the energy
of fluids within machines. The kinetic energy of gases varies negligibly in
piston/cylinder engines, but it plays a major role in jet engines, as we will
see in chapter 10 (air-based power cycles).

The expression for potential energy due to altitude should also not cause
any concern for the student:

 =                     (1/7)

                       (1/8)

  =  



where  is the gravitational acceleration (usually 9.81 m s-2),
and  is the altitude relative to the reference point (m, see Appendix A5 p. 317
for other units).

We will show that in machines, the change of the potential energy of the air
due to altitude is always negligible, and that this is often also true for water.

Kinetic energy and potential energy due to altitude are often combined into
a single term, called mechanical energy:

   +  =  +   1 2 (1/9)
                   2

16 Chapter 1

                                                 Example 1.3

              A student is coasting down a mountain road with a bicycle. At a point
              with an altitude of 540 m (1772 ft), his/her speed is 10 km/h (6.214 mph).
              A few moments later, passing a point at an altitude of 490 m (1608 ft),
              his/her speed is 45 km/h (27.96 mph). The mass of the cyclist together
              with his/her equipment is 70 kg (154.3 lb).
              How much energy has s/he dissipated in the form of friction?

              The student's mechanical energy changed by

               = 2 - 1 = (2 - 1)

              =  ( 2  -   1  +  1 2  -   1 2)  =    [ (2  -  1)  +  1 (2  -  12)]

                                22       21                         22

                                         1 45×10    32    10×10  32

              = 70 9.81(490 - 540) + [ 2 (( 3600 ) - ( 3600 ) )]

              = 70 [-490.5 + 74.3] = -2.91 × 104 J = -29.1 kJ.

              The student has lost 29.1 kJ of mechanical energy. This quantity was
              transferred to the atmosphere in the form of turbulence and heat, and
              to the bicycle's bearings and tires in the form of heat.

                     Energy changes may well be negative. Kinetic energy is however
                 always positive.

                 Refer to Appendix A5 p. 317 for converting to and from SI units.

                     The passage of the bicycle through the air causes observable
                 disturbances on a macroscopic scale that we call turbulence. After a
                 short time, this kinetic energy has dissipated down to a microscopic
                 scale, warming up the atmosphere.

              1.3 Work

              Work is a transfer of energy. An object does work (and thus loses energy)

              when it exerts a force over a displacement. In mechanics, this work is

              quantified using vectors:

                                                                                   (1/10)

              where  is the work (J),
                       is the vector representing the force (of magnitude  in N),

              and  is the vector representing the displacement (of magnitude  in m).

              In thermodynamics, we will use this equation 1/10 to quantify the work
              done by fluids. In order to do this, we will rewrite it by adding three
              particularities:

              · We will measure the displacement with the length of the object that does
                the work;

              · We will only consider cases where the vectors  and  are collinear;

              · We will take into account the fact that  can vary as a function of .

                      Engineering Thermodynamics by Olivier Cleynen
                                                                                                                     Chapter 1 17

With these three constraints, equation 1/10 becomes:

                                                                   B

                                  AB =    d

                                                                 A

Since d is measured from the length of the object performing the work,
d will be negative when  is positive (work is then done to the object,
causing its length to decrease). Finally, since  is always collinear with d
in our case, we can write:

                       B                                              (1/11)

AB = -   d

                     A

where AB is the work done between two points A and B (J),
         is the force (N),

and d is the infinitesimal change in the length of the considered object (m).

On a diagram representing the force as a function of distance, this work
AB is represented by the area under the curve from A to B (figure 1.3).
The shape of the curve, in other words, the relationship () between  and
 during the process, will determine the quantity AB.

Figure 1.3: On a force-distance diagram, the work done by an object can be visu-
alized by the area under the curve. In the case shown here, the object's length 
increases, and the work will be negative (done by the object).

                                                                                       Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

                                      Example 1.4
  A spring is compressed from a length of 30 cm (11.81 in) down to a
  length of 5 cm (1.968 in). The spring is such that it exerts a force (in
  newtons) independent of its length and equal to:

                                    () = 6 × 103 N

              What is the energy supplied to the spring in the form of work during
              compression?

              The work done is obtained using equation 1/11, making sure to set the

              boundaries in si units: AB = - AB () d = - AB 6 × 103 d = -6 ×

                         The sign of the transferred work is positive: the spring has
                   received energy. This does not suprise us: its length has decreased
                   as it was compressed.

                        Springs with such a characteristic (independent of their length)
                   are often ribbon springs, like those used in mechanical watches.

                                                 Example 1.5

              Another spring is also compressed from a length of 30 cm down to
              a length of 5 cm. It is such that it exerts a force (in N) related to its
              length  (in m) by the relation:

                                          () = 9 × 103 - 14 × 103 

              What is the energy supplied to the spring in the form of work during
              compression?

              The work done is still obtained using equation 1/11, and the integral

              is  only   slightly  more  complex:      AB         =   -     B  ×    103  -  14  ×     103)  d  =

                                                                         A (9

                        Springs with such a characteristic (force proportional to length)
                   have regular coils.

                                                   Example 1.6

              One final spring is compressed from a length of 30 cm down to a length

              What is the energy supplied to the spring in the form of work during

              compression?

     Springs with such a characteristic are called progressive springs:
very soft at first, but increasing rapidly in hardness. They are
often used in automobile suspensions. We will see in chapter 2
(closed systems) that gases have a similar characteristic.

1.4 Heat

1.4.1 Temperature

For now, we define temperature as a body's potential for supplying or
receiving heat.

The temperature of a body is a quantity that indicates its level of internal
excitation. The higher the kinetic energy of its molecules, with different
speeds and directions, the higher its temperature will be.

When the molecules making up a body are perfectly stationary relative
to each other, the body has no internal vibration: this state defines zero
temperature. In contrast, the temperature scale is open towards infinity.
There is no defined maximum temperature point.

We cannot simply measure the "mean kinetic energy of the molecules" of a
body, and as a result, it is very difficult to rigorously define a temperature
scale (for example, what it means for a temperature to be "twice as large").
We will revisit the concept of temperature itself in chapter 4 (the ideal gas)
and define it fully in chapter 7 (the second law). In the meantime, we will
accept the definition given above.

Temperature is measured in kelvins (K), on a scale created for the needs of
thermodynamics and rather immodestly referred to as absolute.

Students will likely be familiar with at least one of two temperature scales:

· the Celsius scale (C). Simply subtracting 273.15 units from an absolute
   temperature (in kelvins) gives a temperature in degrees Celsius:

           (C)   (K) - 273.15                 (1/12)
           (K) =  (C) + 273.15                (1/13)

· the Fahrenheit scale (°F). The translation to kelvins is a little more
  complex:

           (°F) = 1.8 × [ (K) - 273.15] + 32  (1/14)
                                              (1/15)
                   (°F) - 32

           (K) =              + 273.15

                  1.8

Both of those scales precede the Kelvin scale, and they were cleverly rede-
fined and synchronized with it in 1848 (wee will have the opportunity to
study this clever manipulation in chapter 7, see §7.4 p. 191). Purists will
note that the absolute unit is named kelvin and not "degree Kelvin". Some
indicative temperatures are listed in table 1.1.

      Rudolf Clausius, 1850 [10, 11, 21]

                                             Just like we denote heat as  (J), we denote specific heat as  (J kg-1).

                                             The concept of heat is very difficult to understand. It was long believed to be
                                             a fluid (the caloric) of very low density, capable of permeating all materials.
                                             This theory was abandoned in the mid-19th century, when it was shown
                                             that heat is not conserved, that is, it has the ability to disappear or appear.
                                             For example, an engine in operation receives heat (through combustion) but
                                             releases less than it received. It transforms part of it into work, which we
                                             can then use to propel a vehicle.

                                             On a microscopic scale, in other words, when we consider the movement of
                                             individual particles, the concepts of temperature and heat are even more diffi-

cult to define (Richard Feynman [30, 35] explores this beautifully). However,
this is beyond the scope of this book.

1.4.3 Thermal capacity

When the same amount of heat is supplied to two different bodies, their
temperature can increase in different ways - for example, it takes less heat
to raise the temperature of a kilogram of steel than a kilogram of aluminum.
This tendency of a body's temperature to increase is called its thermal
capacity (or heat capacity).

The specific thermal capacity of a body is defined as the amount of heat

required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of the substance by one

kelvin:                                  1                                    (1/16)
                                 =
  where 
                                       d  d

             is the specific thermal capacity of the substance (J kg-1 K-1),

             is a (specific) infinitesimal quantity of heat (J kg-1),

 is an infinitesimal quantity of heat (J),

 is the mass (kg),

and d is an infinitesimal change in temperature (K or C).

In this equation 1/16, the infinitesimal transfer of heat is denoted by the
symbol , while the infinitesimal change in temperature is denoted by the
symbol d. This distinction is harmless and is detailed in Appendix A4 p. 316.

The specific thermal capacity of solids is generally invariant. However, for
fluids, which we use extensively in machines, it is not so simple:

· By working a gas (namely, by allowing it to push on a movable wall), we
  significantly increase its specific thermal capacity. We will quantify this
  phenomenon in chapter 4 (the ideal gas).

· The specific thermal capacity of liquids and vapors becomes infinite (!)
  during boiling, which takes place over a particular range of properties.
  Outside of this range, the capacity becomes finite again, but it varies
  with temperature. We will describe these behaviors in chapter 5 (liquids
  and vapors).

                    Example 1.7

The specific thermal capacity of solid steel is constant (independent of
temperature) and has a value of steel = 475 J kg-1 K-1. How much heat
is required to change the temperature of a 50 kg (110.2 lb) block of steel
from a temperature of A = 5 C to a temperature of B = 18 C?

We use the definition 1/16 to write, in the general case:

                                        1 
                            steel =

                                     steel d
                               = steel steel d

                                                        B

                          AB =  steel steel d

                                                      A

22 Chapter 1

              Since the capacity steel is independent of  , this integral becomes

                                                                B

              simply: AB = steel steel A d = steel steel(B - A) = 50 × 475 ×
              (18 - 5) = +3.0875 × 105 J = +308.8 kJ.

                                                                B

                      During integration, A d becomes  (a temperature differ-

                                            B

                 ence), while A  becomes simply AB (a transfer between two
                 states). Heat, a path quantity, is transferred, while temperature, a
                 state quantity, is increased (see Appendix A4 on this topic).

                  In this book, when we quantify energy transfers, we convene to
              make their sign explicit (so we add a "+" in positive transfers).

                   A conversion of the temperatures to kelvins would not have
              changed the value of  . The result would then have been the same.

              With an electrical resistance of the power of a standard domestic

              heater (2 kW), it would take   =  AB     =  308.8×103  =  154 s to warm
                                                            2×103
                                                

              up the steel, just over two minutes. We will see in chapter 4 (the ideal

              gas) that air at constant pressure has a specific thermal capacity

              three times greater than that of steel.

              1.5 Hot and Cold

              We conclude this chapter by revisiting some common language terms, as
              they are understood in thermodynamics.

               Hot -- For us, "hot" is not a property of objects: instead of "this object
                     is hot", we say that its temperature is high. Instead of "this object is
                     heating up/cooling down" we say that its temperature is increasing
                     or decreasing. In everyday language, phrases like "it is hot" or "heat
                     wave" also refer to temperature.

               To heat -- For us, "to heat up" means to supply heat. We can "heat up" an
                     object while its temperature drops. We can also raise the temperature
                     of an object without supplying heat (figure 1.4).

               Cold -- For us, the sensation of "cold" denotes a low temperature. We
                     do not consider "cold" to be something that can be manufactured or
                     measured. Instead, we would say that we are transfering heat away
                     from an object (for example, a refrigerator extracts heat from a warm
                     food item).

               Fire -- Fire is the term given to the emission of light (electromagnetic
                     radiation) from a gas at high temperatures. In thermodynamics, "fire"
                     does not have any special properties. For us, it is the same heat
                     whether it is generated by the combustion of wood or kerosene, by
                     friction in a brake, or by a nuclear reaction. Ultimately, the only thing
                     that matters is the temperature at which it is transmitted!

In the case of thermodynamics, the English philoso-
pher Francis Bacon, laying the foundations of induc-
tive reasoning at the beginning of the 17th century,
used heat as an example to illustrate his point. In
order to study its nature, he proposed in the Novum
Organum to compile all observations of phenomena
in which heat appears, of phenomena where it does
not appear, and finally of those where it appears
"by degrees." This method remained qualitative,
but at approximately the same time, there was an
explosion of attempts to make truly quantitative
measurements of this "degree of heat."

It seems that the first thermometer was invented
around 1605 by a Dutchman named Cornelis
Drebbel [39]: based on ideas dating back to Hero
of Alexandria (1st century CE), it consisted of a
hollow glass sphere extended by a tube pointing

A closed system contains a fixed amount of mass. Heat and work transfers cause variations in
the internal energy of the fluid. For work to be reversible, the movement must be infinitely slow.

Introduction

We wish to develop here a method of energy accounting applied to a
fixed quantity of mass. This chapter 2 (closed systems) aims to answer two
questions:
· How to quantify the work that can be received and provided by a body of

   fixed mass?
· What is reversibility, and why are we pursuing it?

2.1 Why Use a Closed System?

From now on, we want to describe and quantify energy transfers in fluids.
We can adopt two different points of view to observe the fluid:

· Either we "cut out" a small piece of mass, which we closely follow as it
   moves along, and then quantify the energy transferred to it: this is what
   we call a closed system;

· Or we choose a fixed volume, which is constantly being crossed by a mass
   flow, and then quantify the energy transfers towards the volume: this is
   what we call an open system.

Of course, these two methods are equivalent: they will produce the same
results. The choice of one or the other will simply make the analysis and
quantification of transfers easier.

The use of a closed system is appropriate for analyzing machines with
reciprocating motion (automotive engines, pumps and compressors, and
generally all piston/cylinder machines). These machines divide the fluid
into small quantities that are trapped in a chamber, where they are heated,
cooled, compressed, or expanded (figure 2.1). It is then easy to identify a
given mass quantity and quantify the transfers it undergoes.

A closed system is a useful tool for studying the air trapped in a cylinder. The
photographed engine is a diesel V8 from man.

              On the contrary, to study what happens in a jet engine nozzle, for example,
              we would have difficulties identifying a given group of particles and quanti-
              fying the change in their properties. It would then be more convenient to
              use an open system, as we will study in chapter 3 (open systems).

              Concretely, in this chapter, we want to quantify the work that can be done
              by a fluid in a cylinder. A car engine provides work because the air in the
              cylinders provides more work by expanding on the return stroke than it
              received by being compressed on the intake stroke (figure 2.2). How can we
              generate this? In order to answer this question, we need a robust method to
              quantify energy transfers.

              Figure 2.2: Operating principle of an engine. When heat is supplied to a fluid in a
              closed reservoir, it increases the forces it exerts on the walls of the reservoir. By
              allowing the reservoir to deform, we let the fluid perform work.

                                                                                                      Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

              2.2 Accounting Conventions

              2.2.1 The closed system

              We refer to a closed system as an arbitrary study subject with boundaries
              impermeable to mass: a given set of particles, with fixed mass. All properties
              of this set (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.) can change, but it always
              involves the same molecules, not mixed with others. For example, a gas
              trapped in a cylinder and compressed by a piston (figure 2.3) is perfectly
              described with a closed system.

              Figure 2.3: A typical closed system: a fixed mass quantity in a closed reservoir. A
              movable wall allows to compress it; we will also allow it to receive and lose heat.

              2.2.2 Sign conventions

              In order to quantify transfers, we will use the following sign convention,
              illustrated in figure 2.4:

              · When they are positive, transfers  and  indicate a receipt by the
                system.

· Conversely, when they are negative, transfers  and  indicate a loss
  from the system. The system then supplies work  and rejects heat .

Figure 2.4: Sign conventions for a closed system. Incoming flows are positive,
outgoing flows are negative; they are all represented with inward-pointing arrows.
The mass quantity is constant.

                                                                                       Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

Thus, in the equations, we can systematically add the terms without needing
to know the direction of the changes. Transfers are accounted for like in a
bank account: expenses are negative and revenues are positive.

2.3 The First Law in a Closed System

The first law states that energy is indestructible (§1.1.2). If we supply 100 J
of work to a closed system and it rejects 80 J in the form of heat, then "its"
energy has increased by 20 J. We call this increase the change of internal
energy,  .

In the form of an equation, the first law in a closed system is expressed by                                         « Let therefore be  the whole

the equation:                                                                                                        quantity of heat which one must im-

              We can rewrite this equation 2/2 to express it in its differential form:

                                        +  = d                                           (2/3)

              for a stationary closed system;
              where d is the infinitesimal change of specific internal energy (J kg-1),

                       is the (specific) infinitesimal work transfer (J kg-1),
              and  is the (specific) infinitesimal heat transfer (J kg-1).

              In this equation 2/3, the mathematical operators d and  have slightly
              different meanings: d, an exact differential, represents an infinitesimal
              change that will integrate to  = 2 - 1; on the other hand, an , inexact
              differential, represents an infinitesimal transfer that will integrate to 12.
              This distinction is further elaborated in Appendix A4 p. 316.

              When a fluid is brought back to its initial state (same pressure, same volume,
              same temperature), then it contains exactly the same amount of internal
              energy as before. The total energy it has received (in the form of heat or
              work) has therefore necessarily been returned to the surroundings in one
              form or another. We express this statement as follows:

                                       cycle + cycle = 0                                 (2/4)

              for a complete thermodynamic cycle,
              where cycle is the work received by the system (J),
              and cycle is the heat received by the system (J).

              This equation 2/4 is the reason why the first law is often stated--without
              adding much to our simple statement in chapter 1 -- in the following way:

              "When a system has completed a full thermodynamic cycle, the algebraic
              sum of the heat it has supplied and the work it has done is zero."

              2.4 Quantifying Work with a Closed
                    System

              Calculating work with fluids is delicate. We will proceed in three steps of
              increasing complexity:
              · By replacing the fluid with a spring;
              · By compressing the fluid infinitely slowly;
              · By compressing the fluid rapidly.

              2.4.1 Work as a function of volume, with a spring

              Let's start by imagining that the fluid within a closed system behaves like a

              metal spring (figure 2.5). This is an interesting modeling approach to begin

              our study. We had seen in §1.3 that the work supplied or received by a

              spring is expressed as:

                                                              B                          (1/11)

                                       AB = -   d

                                                            A

              Today, since we are using a fluid, we want to express work in terms of
              pressure and volume rather than force and length.

Pressure is defined as a force divided by an area:

                                                               (2/5)

                    

                                     

where  is the pressure (Pa),
         is the force (N),

and  is the area of the surface on which the force acts (m2).

The si unit of pressure is the Pascal,

             1  Pa                1  N       -2                (2/6)

                                          m

but three other units are commonly used instead:

· the bar:

             1 bar  1 × 105 Pa                                 (2/7)

· the kilogram - force per square centimeter, which is almost equal

to the bar:

             1 kgf/cm2 = 9.806 65 × 104 Pa                     (2/8)

· and the pound per square inch:

             1 psi = 6.894 757 × 103 Pa                        (2/9)

      Note that atmospheric pressure at low altitude is of the order of one
      bar or one kilogram-force per square centimeter (atm.std.  1 atm 
      1.013 25 bar  14.7 psi). Care is needed when reading pressure on
      measurement devices, which often indicate gauge pressure and not
      real pressure. This difference is described in Appendix A2 p. 314.

Volume can also be easily expressed. If the system is deformed by a piston
      with area , such that its length varies by d, we have:

                d =  d                                         (2/10)

where d is the infinitesimal change in volume (m3),
         is the area of the piston surface being displaced (m2),

and d is the infinitesimal change in length of the system correspond-
ing to the piston displacement (m).

In the si system of units, volume is measured in m3, but the student is
likely accustomed to using at least one of three common units:

              Let's now express the work of a closed system in terms of volume and
              pressure. By inserting equations 2/5 and 2/10 into equation 1/11, we obtain:

                                   B                                B

                            AB = -   d = -   d
                                A                                   A

                                   B

                            AB = -   d                                 (2/14)

                                                 A

              for a closed system modeled by a spring,
              where AB is the work received by the system (J),

                       is the (uniform) internal pressure (Pa),
              and d is the change in volume (m3).

              In order to quantify the work done on or by the system, we only need to
              know the relationship between  and  . In this case, this function ( ) is
              directly related to the characteristic () of the spring. The spring stiffness
              and its geometry (regular or progressive coils) will ultimately determine the
              amount of work received or supplied by the system.

              A powerful tool for understanding and analyzing work transfers is the
              pressure-volume diagram. In the case where the fluid is modeled by a spring,
              work can be visualized by the area under the curve (figure 2.6).

              Figure 2.6: Pressure-volume diagram of a closed system modeled by a spring. In

              the case shown here, the volume is increasing (the piston moves away). The

              quantity d remains positive, and the work is negative: the system loses energy

              by doing work on the piston. This figure represents the same phenomenon as in

                                   Example 2.1
A closed system consists of an empty box in which there is a spring.
The pressure exerted by the spring on the walls of the box is constant
at  = 105 Pa regardless of its volume. The box is compressed from a
volume A = 2 L to B = 1 L. What is the work transfer?

The process can be drawn qualitatively (that is, without showing
numerical values) on a pressure-volume diagram as follows:

                                                      B        B
Starting from equation 2/14: AB = - A  d = -cst. A d =

cst.        B  =  -105(1  ×  10-3  -  2  ×  10-3)  =  +100 J.

      [ ]A

    The sign is positive: the box ("the system") receives work. We
always explicitly specify the sign when quantifying transfers.

                                   Example 2.2

A closed system has an internal pressure related to its volume by the
relation  = 7 × 105 - 2 × 108  (in si units). The box is compressed from
a volume A = 2 L to B = 1 L. How much energy has been received or
supplied as work?

The process can be drawn qualitatively on a pressure-volume diagram
as follows:

                                                                                                      B

Once again, starting from equation 2/14: AB = - A  d =
- AB(7 × 105 - 2 × 108 ) d = - [7 × 105 - 12 2 × 108 2]B = -(700 - A
100 - 1400 + 400) = +400 J (positive: work received by the system).

                                                            When a fluid is compressed, the molecules it is made of are brought closer
                                                            to each other (figure 2.7) and the collisions between them and against the

                                                            in an increase in pressure.

On a diagram representing pressure as a function of specific volume, this
work AB is represented by the area under the curve from A to B, just like
in figure 2.6. The shape of the curve, that is, the relationship between 
and  as the fluid undergoes the process, will ultimately determine the
quantity AB.

How exactly do fluids behave when they are compressed - in other words,
by what type of "spring" can they be modeled? Experimentally, it is observed
that when compressed, most gases have their pressure and volume related
by a relation of the form   = cst. with  being a constant (figure 2.9). (An
exception to this trend is found with liquid/vapors when they change phase,
as we will see in chapter 5.)

progressive coils.  Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

                                        A gas in a cylinder is slowly compressed by a piston. It is observed
                                        that its pressure is related to its volume by the relation 1.2 =  (in si
                                        units, with  being a constant). At the beginning of compression, its
                                        properties are A = 1 bar and A = 1 m3 kg-1. It is compressed until its
                                        volume reaches B = 0.167 m3 kg-1.
                                        What amount of specific work has the gas received or supplied?

                                        the relation between  and . We obtain it with the initial conditions:

         The physical quantity represented by  is confusing: it is
   measured in Pa m3.6 kg-1.2. This is not important for us, and it is
   sufficient (after properly converting the input units to si!) to indicate
   "in si units" or u.si.

105 J kg-1 = +215.2 kJ kg-1.

      The sign of AB is positive: the gas has work done to it.

        The result may seem large, but it is important to remember
   that it is a mass-specific amount of work (§1.1.5) that needs to be
   multiplied by the mass of the gas to obtain a quantity in joules. At
   the initial conditions (1 kg m-3), a volume of air of 1 L weighs just
   over one gram.

                                    Example 2.4

A mass of 0.3 gram of pressurized gas in a cylinder is slowly expanded
as a piston moves. It is known that its pressure and volume are related
by a relation of the form 1 = 2 (where 1 and 2 are two constants).
At the beginning of the expansion, the pressure is at 12 bar (174 psi) and
the volume is 0.25 L (0.22 gal imp). Once expanded, the gas reaches am-
bient pressure of 1 bar (14.5 psi) with a volume of 1.76 L (0.387 gal imp).
What is the work done by the gas during the expansion?

The process can be drawn qualitatively on a pressure-volume diagram
as follows:

First, we need to fully know the law relating  to ; then we will proceed

with the integration -   d during the process to calculate the work.

Let us start by calculating the specific volumes at the start and end: A =

A  =  0.25×10-3      =  0.833 m3 kg-1.  Similarly, B  =  B  =  5.867 m3 kg-1.

                   1 is an exponent and has no units. The units of 2 are not
              interesting to us.

                   Although it may seem laborious, this approach of "we have
              a general model for the trend, what are the parameters for this
              specific case?" is very common in physics, and extremely useful for
              engineers.

              We can now quantitatively describe the properties during the process:
              1.2733 = 9.514 × 105. We just have to carry out our usual integra-
              tion: AB = - AB  d = -2 AB -1 d = -0.2733 [ -9.514×10  ]0.833 = 5 -0.2733 5.867
              -1.513 × 106 J kg-1 = -1513 kJ kg-1. We multiply by the mass of the
              gas to obtain the work: AB =  AB = -453.8 J.

                      This calculation can be done more quickly without calculating
                  the values of A, B, and 2. However, to ensure reaching the correct
                  result, it is safer and easier to quantify  and  (in si) at all stages of
                  the process before starting an integration.

                                                 Example 2.5

              A gas confined in a sealed container is slowly heated. Its volume
              remains at 12 L, and its pressure changes from 1 bar to 40 bar. What is
              the work done?

              The process can be drawn qualitatively on a pressure-volume diagram
              as follows:

              The work is zero, of course. Since the volume does not change, d is
              zero throughout the process. We can heat or cool as we wish, but as
              long as no wall is moved, there will be no work done.

compressed (left), the pressure on the piston wall is increased. During a rapid
expansion (right), this pressure is decreased.

In order to describe what happens inside the fluid, we can take the example
of water in a bathtub being pushed with hands - like the object shown in
figure 2.12 being moved in liquid water. When the object is moved away
and brought closer abruptly, the pressure on its walls is not the same as
when it is moved slowly.
In each case, the amount of work done on the fluid during compression
is larger, and the amount of work done by the fluid during expansion is
smaller.
We call this phenomenon irreversibility. It will be a great challenge in our
quantitative study of thermodynamics and will make our conversions of
work and heat even more difficult.
What happens in the cylinder filled with fluid when it is not compressed
infinitely slowly? During a rapid compression, the pressure on the piston
wall is greater than the average pressure inside the cylinder (figure 2.13).
More energy is expended than necessary to carry out the displacement.
We could thus say that when compressed and expanded abruptly, a fluid
behaves like a "fragile" spring, inside which something changes: it is not
able to fully return all the mechanical energy it has stored.
If the received work is not equal to the work returned, then where did the
excess energy go? This surplus of energy, supplied in the form of work by
the piston, is converted into heat inside the fluid during the movements.

                                     complex than in the case of an infinitely slow process. The average pressure
                                     inside the fluid increases more rapidly than it would in a slow motion.
                                     During expansion, the opposite phenomenon occurs (figure 2.15): a zone of

have followed if the compression had been infinitely slow is represented with a

converted into heat, even though the gas is perfectly isolated.

              From a quantitative point of view, the more abrupt the movements on the
              fluid, the more the process will resemble one with heat input ("hardening"
              of the fluid and increase in the exponent  during compressions, decrease in
              the exponent  during expansions).
              However, the work done on or by the fluid can no longer be simply calcu-
              lated by integral, since the pressure inside the cylinder is not homogeneous
              at all. It is the pressure at the piston surface that would allow this work
              to be calculated. Unfortunately, no simple mathematical relationship de-
              scribes this relationship between pressure and volume. An experimental
              measurement must be made each time.

                                                    Example 2.6

                A gas is confined in a sealed cylinder and back-and-forth movements
                between two given volumes are performed with the piston, without
                transferring heat. Initially, the back-and-forth movements are very
                slow. Then, the back-and-forth movements are carried out very rapidly.
                What will the processes look like on a pressure-volume diagram?

                During slow processes, the pressure always passes through the same
                values during the back-and-forth movements:

              However, when the movements are fast, at the end of each trip the final
              pressure is greater than it would have been with a slow movement:

              Thus, the pressure gradually rises on the pressure-volume diagram:
              the excess work invested during compressions, and the lack of work
              recovered during expansion, result in an increase in the internal energy
              of the gas, whose temperature continuously rises.

direction! In order to bring the gas back to the state it was in before being
abruptly compressed, we are forced to transfer heat away from it. It is
surprising that without going against Newton's laws, we have created a
situation where we cannot go back by "doing the opposite". Are there other
irreversible processes? Can we quantify irreversibility? We will attempt to
answer these questions in chapters 7 (the second law) and 8 (entropy).

In the meantime, we shall agree that three conditions must be met for a
process to be reversible:

1. The process must occur without friction. There should be no friction
   in the mechanical elements (for example, between piston and cylinder).

2. The pressure in the fluid must be homogeneous. The movement of
   the walls must therefore be infinitely slow, and the fluid must move
   without turbulence or internal friction.

3. The temperature difference between the fluid and its environment must
   be infinitely small. If heat is supplied or rejected, it must be transferred
   infinitely slowly.

These three conditions obviously exclude any real process--and in particular,
any practical application in an engine! However, we will use them to
establish an ideal theoretical limit for all of the real processes that we will
study.

              2.5 Quantifying Heat with a Closed
                    System

              At the risk of frustrating the student, we must immediately admit that we
              cannot directly quantify heat transfers. We will always proceed by deduction:
              by quantifying the change in energy and subtracting the work transfers, we
              obtain the amount of heat that has been transferred. Mathematically, in a
              closed system, we simply reuse equation 2/1 to obtain:

                                    12 =  - 12               (2/16)

                                    12 =  - 12               (2/17)

              for a closed system.

              The entire difficulty in quantifying a heat transfer is now to predict and
              quantify the change in internal energy,  . For gases,  is simply pro-
              portional to temperature; for liquids and vapors, the relationship is more

              gas) and 5 (liquids and vapors).

In order to increase the efficiency of an engine of
given capacity, we seek to increase the amount of
work generated by each kilogram of steam, which
can be approximated by the relation 2/15:

The compound engine addresses this issue by using
multiple cylinders in series (see figure 2.17). The
high-pressure steam first drives a piston of small
diameter (thus limiting the force exerted on the
mechanism). It is then transferred to another cylin-
der of larger diameter. This cylinder allows for the
same force to be obtained with a lower pressure; it
sweeps a larger volume.

By increasing the total volume swept by the
expanding steam, more work can be extracted
from the compressed steam without oversizing the
crankshaft or overloading the pistons.
With such an engine, the merchant navy was able
to look beyond coastal shipping: it seized upon
this new technology which experienced immedi-
ate success. From two cylinders in series (double
compound) it moved to three, and sometimes even
four (quadruple compound!), in order to extract ever
more energy from steam, in the form of work.
Enthusiastic shipowners could now boast that they
now only needed to burn one sheet of paper to
move one ton of cargo one mile. Even though it
was understood that the said paper is very thick,
progress had been made. Soon, the tea from the
East Indies would arrive in the Londonian teacups -
the British Empire now had the machinery required
to power its formidable economic network.

From B to C The student ensures the cylinder volume
      remains constant by mechanically locking the pis-
      ton, removes the thermal insulator, and places
      the cylinder outside the building (outside temper-
      ature: -5 C or 23 °F). The gas temperature and
      pressure slowly rise.

From C to A When the pressure reaches 1 bar pre-
      cisely, the cylinder air temperature is indicated as
      C = 262 K.
      The student wishes to return to the initial con-
      ditions (by reducing the volume to the initial
      volume) while keeping the pressure constant at
      1 bar.

  1. Sketch the process on a pressure-volume diagram.
  2. Show that during a reversible process undergone

      by a closed system whose properties are related
      by a relation of the form 1 = 2 (where 1  1
      and 2 are constants), the specific work done is:

  3. What is the work done by the gas during the

      expansion?
  4. The thermal capacity of air when its volume is

      fixed is 718 J kg-1 K-1. How much heat was trans-
      ferred to or from the outside air?
  5. How much work will be needed to perform the C
       A return at constant pressure?
  6. Over the entire cycle, will the student have done
      or received work?
  7. [difficult question] The return path at constant
      pressure requires heat transfer. In which direction
      and to what extent? Why can't (unfortunately)
      this transfer be entirely done inside the building?

enthalpy of the fluid. For work to be reversible, the movement must be infinitely slow.

Introduction

In the previous chapter, we quantified energy exchanges within closed
systems. This chapter 3 (open systems) aims to answer a similar question:
how to quantify energy transfers within a system when it is crossed by a
mass flow?

3.1 Why Use an Open System?

In many machines, the fluid used to transfer heat and work is continuously
circulating. It can then be difficult to identify a particular amount of mass,
making it a closed system, in order to quantify energy transfers to and
from it. For example, in a jet engine nozzle, air expands and accelerates
continuously: at any given moment, there is no identifiable volume that
would have one specific speed or one particular pressure.

Using an open system is very useful to account for energy in flows. Rather
than separating stages in time (for example before and after compression),
we quantify work and heat transfers by separating stages in space (for
example upstream and downstream of the compressor).

3.2 Accounting Conventions

3.2.1 The open system                                                                                                « The constructive difficulties that

In our study of thermodynamics, we will only use open systems:
· with fixed volume;
· having only one inlet and one outlet;

   https://thermodynamicsbook.com - CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen
62 Chapter 3

              · being crossed by a constant mass flow rate  (positive by convention).
              These systems are said to be in steady state (sometimes called steady flow
              or stationary flow regime).

              3.2.2 Sign conventions

              Just like for closed systems, we will take the open system's point of view to
              quantify transfers:
              · Receiving work, heat, or mass results in a positive transfer;
              · Expending work, heat, or mass results in a negative transfer.
              Thus, we add up all transfers as on a bank statement.

              3.3 The First Law in an Open System

              We have seen that in a closed system, the law of conservation of energy is
              expressed by the equation  +  =  (2/2). In an open system, the situation
              is a little different and we must consider additional forms of energy.

              3.3.1 Entering and exiting the system: flow work

              Let's imagine an open system in steady flow, containing a small water pump.
              In order to insert water into the pump at a given pressure, energy must
              be supplied to the system. Conversely, to push the water outside (at a
              higher pressure), the system must supply energy. How can we quantify this
              energy?

              Consider the case of a fluid element (namely, a small quantity of fluid in
              transit, with volume element) entering our system at pressure 1 (figure 3.2).

              The work insertion received by the system when the element is pushed
              through the insertion is:

              insertion = 1 element                                 (3/1)

              where insertion is the insertion work (J),
              and element is the volume of the fluid element (m3).

              If such a volume of fluid enters the system every second, then the system
              receives power in the form of work, which we call insertion power,  insertion.

              Figure 3.2: A fluid element of volume element entering at pressure  into the open
              system.

                                                                                                     Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

                                                                               Chapter 3 63

We sometimes express it in specific form (§1.1.5):

 insertion = 1  1 =  1 1 1 =  1 1                      (3/2)
insertion = 1 1                                        (3/3)

where  insertion is the insertion power (W),
        insertion is the specific insertion power (J kg-1),
         1 is the net mass flow rate at 1 (kg s-1),
         is the mass flow rate crossing the system (always positive, kg s-1),
         1 is the volumetric flow rate of fluid (m3 s-1),

and 1 is the specific volume of the fluid at the inlet (m3 kg-1).

Similarly, for the fluid to exit the system at the other end, the system must
continuously supply a power called extraction power:

 extraction = -2 2 =  2 2 2 = - 2 2                    (3/4)

extraction = -2 2                                      (3/5)

where the outgoing mass flow rate  2 (negative) is expressed in terms of the
mass flow rate  crossing the system (always positive, kg s-1).

The net sum of these two powers at the boundaries is called flow power,
 flow   insertion+ extraction. Its sign depends on the operating conditions -
the student is encouraged to visualize and formulate the conditions under
which the flow power can be negative, zero, or positive.

3.3.2 Energy balance

Let us try to design an open system in steady flow in the most general way
possible, as represented in figure 3.3. We will now account for all energy
transfers within it.

When entering the system, the fluid already has an internal energy 1;
therefore, the system sees its own internal energy increase with power  1:

 1 =  1                                                (3/6)

Similarly, the fluid has a specific mechanical energy mech1 (1/9), and the
system also receives power  mech1:

 mech1 =  mech1 =   12                                 (3/7)
                      1 +  1
                    (2                              )

These expressions 3/6 and 3/7 have the opposite sign at the system's outlet,
where we assign them the index 2.

At this point, we have covered all of the energy forms that can be observed
crossing the boundaries of an open system together with the fluid: flow
work, internal energy, and mechanical energy. Since the first law states that
energy is indestructible (§1.1.2), the addition of power  in the form of heat
or  in the form of work can only vary these three forms. This results in
the equation:

              Figure 3.3: An arbitrary open system. The system (whose boundaries are dashed
              lines, in red) is crossed from left to right by the fluid flowing with a constant mass
              flow rate  . It receives power  12 in the form of work and power  12 in the
              form of heat.

                                                                                                     Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

               12 +  12 + ( insertion +  1 +  mech1) + ( extraction +  2 +  mech2) = 0
                                                                                                    (3/8)

                 where all terms are expressed in watts.
              We can re-express equation 3/8 in terms of directly measurable quantities:

               12 +  12 +                     12  =                  12
                               1 1 + 1 + 1 +  1       2 2 + 2 + 2 +  2
                            (  2                  )(      2              )

                                                                  (3/9)

              or:

                    12 +  12 =    [                   12  ]       (3/10)
                                      + () +  ( ) +               (3/11)

                                                  2

                   12 + 12 =  + () + mech.

              where the symbols  indicate the change of properties between points 1 and 2
              within the system.

              Equations 3/9 and 3/11 are extremely useful in thermodynamics, because
              they allow us to quantify by deduction the powers involved in flows. They
              allow us, in particular, to predict the properties of the fluid at the outlet of a
              device for which we know the mechanical power and heat emissions. For
              example, we can determine the remaining energy in the air at the outlet of
              a turbine for which we know the power.

                                    Example 3.1

The compressor of a turbofan admits 1.5 kg s-1 of air at a pressure
of 0.8 bar, internal energy of 192.5 kJ kg-1, and specific volume of
0.96 m3 kg-1. It compresses the air to 30 bar, releasing it with an inter-
nal energy of 643.1 kJ kg-1 and a specific volume of 8.57 × 10-2 m3 kg-1.
The velocity and altitude of the air remain unchanged.
What is the power of the compressor if its heat transfers are negligible?

We apply equation 3/10 to obtain:

 12  =  - 12  +    [  +  ()        +  1   (2)  +    ]

                                      2

= 0 +  [ + () + 0 + 0] = 1.5 [(643.1 × 103 - 192.5 × 103)

+ (30 × 105 × 8.57 × 10-2 - 0.8 × 105 × 0.96)]

= +9.464 × 105 W = +946.4 kW.

    The only difficulty in applying this equation concerns the proper
conversion of units. Pressure and energy should always be converted
from their usual units to si units.

    The power is positive, as expected since the air receives the work.
In a turbine, the work would be negative.

3.3.3 Enthalpy

In many cases, the terms  and  vary in the same manner together with
the state of the fluid (in fact, we will even see in the next chapter that in the
case of an ideal gas, they are both proportional to the temperature). In order
to simplify their use in calculations, they are often combined into a single
term.

We call the sum of the terms  and  the specific enthalpy, and assign it

the symbol :

                         +                                 (3/12)

where the terms are expressed in J kg-1.

Of course, the enthalpy  is simply defined as:

                                                           (3/13)

where  is measured in joules (J).

In practice, the term enthalpy is often used even if it refers to specific         « The decrease of the heat con-
enthalpy; the symbol and context help determine which variable is being
referred to.                                                                       tents is equal to the heat value of the

              Thus, in an open system, we see that heat and work transfers change the
              enthalpy of the fluid, and not only its internal energy as in a closed system.

                                                    Example 3.2

                In a nozzle, air expands without any work or heat transfer. It enters with
                a specific enthalpy of 776 kJ kg-1 and a velocity of 30 km/h (18.6 mph)
                and exits at the same altitude, with an enthalpy of 754 kJ kg-1.
                What is the air ejection velocity?

              We start from equation 3/15:

                                      12 + 12 =  + mech.

                                             mech. = - + 0 + 0
                                       12 2

                                         (2 - 1) = -
                                       2

                                                                                                                             1

                                                  2 = [-2  + 2 2 1 ]

                                                                                                                              1

              So 2 = [-2 × (754 × 103 - 776 × 103) + ( 33.06 )2 2 ] = 209.9 m s-1 =
              755.7 km/h = 470 mph.

                      Care must be used with conversions: in the equations, velocities
                  and energies are always in si units.

              3.4 Quantifying Work with an Open
                    System

              3.4.1 Work of a fluid in a slow process

              We have seen that when the fluid undergoes a slow process, the work done
              by a closed system can be quantified by carrying out the integral -   d
              (2/15). With an open system, the expression is slightly different. In order to
              develop it, we propose to study the steady compression of a fluid passing
              through a compressor.

              To this end, let us first observe the process undergone by a fixed mass
              quantity  circulating in the compressor (figure 3.4). As it passes between
              the moving blades, its pressure varies by d and its volume by d. This is
              simply a moving closed system: since the process is very slow (reversible),
              the work A received by the system will be:

              A = - d                                        (3/16)

              during a reversible process,
              and where the notation  is used to denote the infinitesimal transfer of work
              (work being a path quantity, see Appendix A4 p. 316).

Figure 3.4: A fixed mass quantity  flows from left to right through a compressor.

It is compressed: its properties change from  and  to  + d and  + d. If

we consider the point of view of a closed system in transit, the work transfer is

A = - d.                                       Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

Now, let's observe the course of this same phenomenon from the point of
view of an open system (figure 3.5). What specific power O.S. must be
supplied to the compressor so that each fluid particle receives work A?

Figure 3.5: The same flow as in figure 3.4, now observed from the viewpoint of
a stationary open system crossed from left to right by a steady flow. We seek to
quantify the work O.S. to be supplied to the system so that each mass quantity
A receives work A .

                                                                                       Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

The open system has four work transfer forms:

The specific insertion power insertion (3/3) is due to the permanent ar-

rival of the fluid at the system's inlet. From the viewpoint of the open

system, we have:

                  insertion = +                (3/17)

The specific compression power -A is the specific work that the

open system must transfer to each mass quantity  to effectively

compress it:

                  -A = -(- d)                  (3/18)

https://thermodynamicsbook.com - CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen
68 Chapter 3

              The specific extraction power extraction is spent by the open system to
                    continuously remove the fluid.

                    At the outlet, the fluid properties have become  + d for pressure,
                    and  + d for volume. Thus, we have:

              extraction = -( + d)( + d)                                           (3/19)

              The specific power received from the outside O.S. is the power that
                    feeds the compression: this is the quantity we aim to quantify.

              These four powers cancel each other out, since the total work transfer
              involved in the flow does not depend on the adopted viewpoint:

              O.S. + insertion + (-A ) + extraction = 0                            (3/20)

              Therefore, we can quantify the specific power O.S. that must be supplied
              to the compressor:

                             O.S. = -insertion + A - extraction
                             O.S. = -  + (-d) + ( + d)( + d)

                                      = -  -  d +   +  d + d  + d d
                                      = d  + d d

              And since the product d × d tends to zero when using infinitesimal
              quantities, we obtain the surprising expression:

              O.S. =  d                                                            (3/21)

              The terms d and d in our study are not necessarily positive: this expres-
              sion applies equally to expansions and compressions, as long as they are
              reversible.

              By integrating this expression 3/21 to apply it to the general case in steady
              flow, we obtain:

              O.S. =   d                                                           (3/22)

                                                                                B  (3/23)

                                              AB =    d

                                                                              A

              in steady flow,
              when the process is reversible,
              and regardless of the heat input.

              Thus, when we want to quantify reversible work in an open system, it is the
              integral +   d that needs to be calculated, and not -   d.

              On a pressure-volume diagram, we can visualize this work by adding the
              insertion work and extraction work to the compression work, as shown in
              figure 3.6.

              The reversible work done in steady, reversible flow is thus visualized by the
              area enclosed to the left of the curve, as shown in figure 3.7.

Figure 3.6: Work received by an open system crossed by a fluid, during a slow

The system first receives the insertion work (ini.ini., in orange, positive) to enter
the system, then it spends compression work (hatched area, negative), and finally,
it spends extraction work (fin.fin., in blue, negative).
The net sum of these three areas is the specific power to be supplied to the open
system.

The integral of  d is visualized by the area to the left of the curve.
If the fluid returns to its initial state (having completed a thermodynamic cycle),

quantification is the same for closed and open systems.

                                                 Example 3.3

              A pump slowly compresses 2 kg s-1 (4.41 lb/s) of water from 1 to 20 bar
              (from 14.5 to 290 psi). During compression, the specific volume of water
              remains constant at  = 10-3 m3 kg-1. What is the power required in
              the form of work?

              The process can be drawn qualitatively (that is, without showing
              numerical values) on a pressure-volume diagram as follows:

              We use equation 3/23, being cautious with the units. Since  is inde-

              pendent  of  ,  integration        is  straightforward:   AB  =         B  =

                          B                                                     A  d

                A d          =                B  =   2 × 10-3 (20 × 105 - 1 × 105)  =  +3.8 ×

                                  []A

              103 W = +3.8 kW.

                  This power is indeed positive, since the fluid in the system is
              receiving the work.

                  Here the specific volume  is constant (as always with liquid
              water). If it were the pressure that was constant, then the work
              would be zero even if  were to vary.

                                                  Example 3.4

              A compressor slowly compresses an air flow of 2 kg s-1 from 1 bar to
              20 bar. During compression, the specific volume and pressure of the
              air are related by the expression  1.35 = . At the inlet, the specific
              volume of the air is A = 0.8 m3 kg-1.
              What is the power required in the form of work?

              The process can be drawn qualitatively on a pressure-volume diagram
              as follows:

= +7.247 × 105 W = +724.7 kW.

     Here the key is to correctly describe the function () before
proceeding with the integration.

     The power of the compressor is 190 times larger than that
of the pump in the previous example. Additionally, the specific
volume of the air at the inlet is 800 times larger: a much larger
machine will be required (it must handle a volumetric flow rate
 A =  A = 1.6 m3 s-1 = 1600 L s-1 = 423 US gal/s at the inlet).

3.4.2 Work of a fluid in a fast process

When the process is carried out rapidly (as is always the case in practice),
we encounter the phenomena described in the previous chapter (§2.4.3): the
pressure exerted on the moving walls no longer corresponds to the "average"
pressure inside the fluid. The work required in compressions is greater and
the work received during expansions is less than during slow processes.

Using an open system to account for energy transfers does not change the
problem, of course. We do not have the means to predict analytically the
work required for compression at a given speed. The problem -calculating
the spatial distribution of pressure inside the fluid over time- falls within
the scope of fluid mechanics, and will be solved on a case-by-case basis.

72 Chapter 3

              On our pressure-volume diagrams, we represent irreversible processes with
              a dashed line, to clearly differentiate them from reversible processes, as
              shown in figure 3.8.

                                                    Example 3.5

                Air is continuously compressed from 1 to 20 bar in a compressor. Just
                after leaving the compressor, the air enters a turbine that expands it
                from 20 to 1 bar. After leaving the turbine, the air is again inserted into
                the compressor.
                What will be the shape of the processes on a pressure-volume diagram?

                If the processes occur infinitely slowly, the pressure and specific vol-
                ume always pass through the same values during the back-and-forth
                movements:

              However, if the processes are carried out with realistic speed, at each
              trip the final specific volume is larger than it would have been during a
              slow trip:

              Thus, the properties gradually shift on the pressure-volume diagram.
              Unless the processes are infinitely slow, running the compressor re-
              quires more energy than the turbine is able to provide. This ex-
              cess energy is absorbed by the air, increasing its internal energy and
              temperature.

3.5 Quantifying Heat with an Open
      System

With an open system, we will use the same method as with a closed system:
since we cannot quantify heat transfers directly, we will always proceed by
deduction. Mathematically, we simply reuse equation 3/14 to obtain:

                      12 =  ( + mech.) -  12  (3/24)

                     12 =  + mech. - 12       (3/25)

for an open system.

Once again, the main challenge in quantifying a heat transfer is predicting

the snow remained at the same temperature: the
78 degrees of heat brought by the lukewarm wa-

drawn was that the melting of the snow required
the supply of these 78 degrees of heat by the liq-
uid water. He called this heat latent heat [39], to
differentiate it from sensible heat associated with
measurable temperature changes. Beyond a clever
experiment and a brilliant interpretation, a new
concept had emerged.

3.3 Steam Boiler

A power plant provides electricity as well as industrial
and domestic heat from the combustion of household
waste (known as a cogeneration plant). It is equipped
with a water circuit that receives some of the heat
released by the combustion, at constant pressure, in a
boiler.
Water enters the boiler (figure 3.12) in a liquid state,
pressurized at 71.89 kgf/cm2 (70.5 bar). Its internal en-
ergy is then 1160.2 kJ kg-1. We want to feed the turbine
with 317 t h-1 of steam at an enthalpy of 3595.9 kJ kg-1.

Introduction

In chapters 2 and 3 we learned to quantify energy transfers -- but we can
only do so when we know the values of  or , which are quantities that
are impossible to measure directly in practice.
This chapter 4 (the ideal gas) aims to answer two questions:
· How can we describe the behavior of air when it is heated or compressed?
· How can we predict the values of  and  when using air?
This chapter is incompatible with chapter 5 (liquids and vapors), where we
will have to forget everything learned here.

              It is also possible to express Equation 4/2 in terms of the amount of sub-
              stance in moles.1 Because it is inseparable from the concept of absolute
              temperature, it took 150 years for this equation to take its final form: the
              one given by Émile Clapeyron in 1834 [5].

                                                    Example 4.1

                A mass of 2 kg of gas with a constant  = 100 J K-1 kg-1 is contained
                in a reservoir of 200 L (52.83 US gal) at a pressure of 3 bar (43.51 psi).
                What is its temperature?

              We start from Equation 4/2 to express the temperature:                           =       =
                                                                                                  

              3×105×0.2 = 300 K = 26.85 C = 80.33 °F.

                      Admirable Émile! The simplicity of this calculation will be
                 missed in the next chapter.

                     The only thorn in this equation concerns the units, which must
                 be properly converted to si: 200 L = 0.2 m3 and 3 bar = 3 × 105 Pa.
                 The temperature is always in kelvins.

                                                 Example 4.2

              Atmospheric air can be modeled as an ideal gas with air =
              287 J kg-1 K-1. Under ambient conditions (1 bar, 20 C, that is, 14.5 psi
              and 68 °F), what are the specific volume and the density of the atmo-
              sphere?

              We start from Equation 4/1 to express the specific volume:                       =       =
                                                                                                     

              287×(20+273.15)    =  0.841 m3 kg-1.       The density then follows simply:              =

                              5
                      1×10

              1  =    1.189 kg m-3.
              

                      Once again, forgetting to convert the temperature units to
                 kelvins would be fatal (try using 0 C or 0 °F).

                     In one cubic meter (220 gal imp), we have only 1.2 kg (2.6 lb) of
                 air. This is very little, especially when compared to liquid water
                 (1000 kg for the same volume). Air machines typically operate with
                 large volumetric flow rates.

4.1.3 What does an ideal gas represent?

The ideal gas is the simplest model one can imagine to represent the behavior
of a gas.

According to this model, molecules behave like spheres bouncing off each
other (figure 4.1). One can imagine a large number of very small billiard balls
in chaotic motion, colliding and bouncing off each other without attracting
one another or dissipating their energy through friction.

Figure 4.1: An ideal gas can be visualized as a set of balls in random motion. They
collide without friction and without mutual attraction. The speed of each ball
changes with each collision.

In this chaos, temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of the molecules.
It is quantified by measuring the time-averaged force resulting from the
impact of the molecules on a wall of the container - that is, with pressure.
With this model, we can propose a temperature scale such that   .

The fewer molecules impacting the surface, and the more forcefully they

must impact it in order to generate a given pressure. Thus, when the density

 decreases at a given pressure, it means that the temperature is increasing:

we  can  also  propose      1.

                            

If these two proposals are combined into a single equation, we obtain a
simple model to quantify temperature:   .

              For now, we will remember that the ideal gas model works better:

              · When molecules collide at high speed, that is, when the gas temperature
                 is high;

              · When the average space between molecules is large, that is, when the
                 specific volume of the gas is large.

              These conditions ensure that the attractive forces between molecules can
              only play a minor role in the overall behavior of the gas. They are met for
              air in the vast majority of engineering applications. We will use the value
              air = 287 J kg-1 K-1 for pure air in our machines.

              4.1.5 Model limitations

              It will not take long for the student to find the limits of Equation 4/2, which
              indicates that a non-zero mass of ideal gas occupies zero volume at zero
              temperature. Strictly speaking, the ideal gas cannot exist - the mathematical
              model loses its meaning at very low temperatures since it does not take into
              account the volume of the molecules themselves.

              Several other equations of state can be used to better match real gases over

              a wider range of properties.

              Thus, the Van der Waals equation, proposed as early as the late 18th century,

              suggests:

                                                                        (4/3)

                         ( + 2 ) ( - ) = 
                                            

              where  and  are two constants.

              This equation has the advantage of taking into account two factors ignored
              in the equation of state 4/1: the attractive force between molecules (the
              term /2, which becomes part of the pressure expression) and the volume
              occupied by the molecules themselves (the term  which is subtracted from
              the available volume).

              Despite the difficulties inherent in quantifying the terms  and , these mod-
              ifications have significantly extended the range of application of equations
              of state. They earned their author, Johannes Diderik Van der Waals, the
              Nobel Prize in Physics in 1910.

              Building mathematical models to describe the state of real gases is an
              important research area in fluid mechanics. The curious student can refer
              to equations of state such as the Beattie-Bridgeman, Benedict-Webb-Rubin,
              or the Strobridge models, in order get an overview of their increasing
              complexity. As for us, we will stick to equation 4/1.

              4.2 Properties of Ideal Gases

              4.2.1 Two important thermal capacities

              We have already discussed the concept of thermal capacity in the first
              chapter (1/16). It is defined as the amount of heat required to increase the
              temperature of one kilogram of the substance by one Kelvin (or one degree

Celsius, since these temperature differences are equal). Thus, we have:

                                                               (4/4)

=

   d

where  is the specific thermal capacity (J K-1 kg-1),
         the (specific) infinitesimal heat transfer (J kg-1),

and d the produced infinitesimal change in temperature (K).

Since the temperature of a gas also varies when work is done on it or by it,
there are an infinite number of different ways to change its temperature by
one degree, by combining heat and work (figure 4.2). Each of these requires
a unique amount of heat; thus, there are infinitely many thermal capacities
associated with it.

Figure 4.2: Two identical quantities of gas receive the same amount of heat . The
temperature increase will be lower on the right due to the work done on the piston.

                                                                                                            Diagram CC-0

Among these, two particular values (figure 4.3) serve as references for
describing the behavior of an ideal gas:
the thermal capacity at constant volume:  ,
the thermal capacity at constant pressure:  .
These two quantities are properties (or state quantities, see Appendix A4
p. 316), and we will soon use them to quantify energy in gases. In an ideal
gas,  and  are independent of temperature. In real gases, these capacities
vary with temperature (figure 4.4), but for most hand-written engineering
applications, it is reasonable to use average values. For air, we will take
 (air) = 718 J kg-1 K-1 and  (air) = 1005 J kg-1 K-1.

                                     The large number of equations we are discussing makes this short section
                                     4.2.2 useful, but not essential. For the engineer, its only interest is to simplify
                                     the writing of the equations in the section that comes after it.
                                     Let us observe the amounts of energy involved in the experiment described
                                     in figure 4.3. We supply each body with a different amount of heat to achieve
                                     the same temperature change. The difference between the two required
                                     amounts of heat comes from the fact that the gas at constant pressure (on
                                     the right) has done work during the process.
                                     What is the difference between the thermal capacities of each? In both cases,
                                     we have 12 + 12 =  (2/2). For body A on the left, since no work is
                                     done and the process is at constant volume, we can write:

                                                                         {

For body B on the right, with constant pressure cst., we can write:

                             {

                                 B =   (4/6)
                                 = B + (-cst. )

By combining the two systems 4/5 and 4/6, we obtain

                  =   - cst.                           (4/7)

which simply states that the difference between the two amounts of heat
supplied to the gas is found in the work done by the gas on the right. (To
be truly rigorous, in order to assert that  and  are equal, we would
need to wait for equation 4/11 which comes in the next section.)

A little algebra leads to:

( - ) = cst. 

                         2 - 1 2 - 1  

                ( - ) =    =       =

                                                     

                 -  =                                  (4/8)

This expression only serves to simplify equation 4/13 that we will write
below.

4.2.3 Ratio of thermal capacities

The ratio of thermal capacities at constant pressure and constant volume is

named  . Thus:

                                                       (4/9)

                         

                           

By returning to figure 4.3 it quickly appears that  must be greater than ;
thus  is always greater than 1. We take air = 1.4.

4.3 Energy and Temperature

4.3.1 Historical context

The first research undertakings aimed at exploring the concept of temper-
ature took place at the very beginning of the 19th century. The scientific
community was then very interested in gases - it was noticed that there
are two ways to increase their temperature: by heating them, but also by
compressing them.

Frenchman Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac sought to understand why the temper-
ature of a gas drops when it expands (he actually sought, according to the
concepts of the time, to identify the source of the caloric and the reasons
why it flows). He thus endeavored to produce gas expansions that were as
simple as possible, and to measure the temperature. Thirty years later, the
Englishman James Prescott Joule resumed and deepened these experiments,
but this time, by quantifying heat as work equivalence. These experiments
with gas balloons and thermometers are anything but spectacular - but
they would play a pivotal role in thermodynamics, because they allowed for

                                           the first time to distinguish heat, work, energy, and temperature. Joule's
                                           meticulous work lead to the first formal expression of the first law of ther-
                                           modynamics, and to the end of the caloric theory according to which heat
                                           was a very low-density and invisible fluid. Our modern unit for energy is
                                           named after him as a tribute to these results.

                                           Joule and Gay-Lussac are interested in the temperature changes measured in each
                                           reservoir. The closer the gas properties resemble the behavior of ideal gases model
                                           (§4.1.4), the smaller the temperature changes they measure, becoming undetectable
                                           for some simple gases at high temperatures.

                                                                                                                                   Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

                                           Joule carried out a multitude of different experiments during which he
                                           observed that regardless of the supplied work, the relationship between
                                           internal energy (which varies only with work and heat) and temperature
                                           remained essentially the same - and he suggested that for an ideal gas, it
                                           always remains identical.

                                           This postulate is known as Joule's law and is posited as true for any ideal
                                           gas. It can be summarized as follows:

                                                                         The temperature of an ideal gas

                                           Mathematically, we can write it as:              (4/10)

For a mass  of ideal gas, we have of course:

   =                                                                    (4/12)

As long as our fluid behaves as an ideal gas, this relation 4/11 remains true. It
works for any process, reversible or not, and regardless of volume, pressure,
or temperature constraints.
On the other hand, it should be noted that this equation 4/11, which results
from Joule's law, does not work all for liquids and vapors. For example, we
can add energy to a mass of boiling water without its temperature increasing.
We will study liquids and vapors in chapter 5.

                                      Example 4.3

  The specific thermal capacity at constant volume for air is measured at
   (air) = 718 J kg-1 K-1.
  We take a mass of 0.5 kg of air at 20 C and transfer +15 kJ as heat and
  -10 kJ as work. What is its final temperature?

We know that the energy has varied with the transfers:  = AB +

AB =    . Thus, the temperature has varied proportionally:

  AB +AB                  -10×103+(+15×103)            = 33.92 C.
B = A +   = A +   = 20 +
                                              0.5×718

     Good old James! We just only need to quantify the energy
changes to know the temperature, and vice versa.

    Here the temperatures in degrees Celsius are only added and a
conversion to kelvins would not have changed the result. In case of
doubt, it is better not to take this shortcut.

4.3.3 Enthalpy of an ideal gas

Because we have just linked the internal energy  to the temperature, and
because and the product  also depends on the temperature, we can now
easily express the enthalpy  of an ideal gas in terms of temperature only.

Indeed, we have    +  (3/12); with a quick insertion of equations 4/1
and 4/11 we can write, for any ideal gas:

   =  +  =  +  = ( + )                                                  (4/13)

              Using the equation 4/8 that we developed earlier, we can simplify this

              expression to obtain:

                                      =              (4/14)

              For any ideal gas,
              regardless of the process (reversible or not),
              where  is the specific enthalpy (J kg-1);

                       is the temperature (K);
              and  is the specific thermal capacity at constant pressure (J kg-1 K-1).

                                     Example 4.4

              The specific thermal capacity at constant pressure for air is measured
              at  (air) = 1005 J kg-1 K-1.
              A flow rate of 2 kg s-1 of air passes through a compressor, where its
              temperature increases by 150 C. What is the power supplied by the
              compressor to the air?

              We know that the change energy is directly proportional to the change
              in temperature. Using equations 3/14 and 4/14, we obtain:  AB +
               AB =   =    = 2 × 1005 × (+150) = +301.5 kW.

                      With an ideal gas, a simple thermometer is enough to quantify
                  energy. . .

                       . . . but not to differentiate work and heat. Here we cannot
                  separate  AB from  AB. We also cannot predict the state of
                  the gas at the outlet, that is its pressure  and specific volume 
                 (only their product). For this, a precise description of what happens
                  between the inlet and the outlet would be needed.

              4.3.4 Interlude: what to remember so far

              The ideal gas is a model for quantifying the temperature of a gas. According
              to this model, the three main forms of energy we have used so far -- internal
              energy , enthalpy , and the term  -- are directly proportional to the
              temperature  :

                                       =   (J kg-1)
                                       =   (J kg-1)
                                      =    (J kg-1)

              If we measure the absolute temperature of a gas, then we can immediately
              quantify these three forms of energy.

              4.4 Elementary Reversible Processes

              Here we intend to calculate the properties of an ideal gas, as well as
              the energy transfers involved, when it is compressed or expanded under
              completely arbitrary constraints of volume, pressure, or temperature.

4.4.1 What is this chapter section for?

The gas processes we study here are very hypothetical and not necessarily
exciting, but they deserve the attention of the student for two reasons:

1. The behavior of gases is inherently complex, even when we use the
   ideal gas model. These elementary processes serve as small exercises
   for us, to help us learn step by step;

2. These elementary processes are conceptual tools that we will later
   assemble, first to quantify the theoretical limits of machines (in chap-
   ter 7), and then to describe the behavior of gases inside real machines
   (in chapter 10).

4.4.2 Processes at constant pressure

It is possible to heat or cool a gas while maintaining its pressure constant
(figure 4.6). A process at constant pressure is called isobaric. In order to
generate such a process, we can:

· with a closed system, heat or cool the gas while maintaining a constant
  force on the walls;

· with an open system, heat or cool the gas by simply letting it flow in
  a duct, without any moving parts. This is the case, for example, in the
  combustion chamber of a jet engine.

When the pressure is constant, the properties of the gas vary according to

the relation

                                      (4/15)
                 = constant

              In a closed system, we have 12 + 12 =  (2/2) and, if the process is
              reversible, heat and work can be easily related to the temperature:

                 2                               2

              12 = -   d = -cst.  d = -cst.

              during a reversible process at constant pressure cst., in a closed system.

              and we notice that the work is of opposite sign to the change in temperature.

              Heat can be easily quantified:

                                12 =  - 12 =  + cst.  =                                   (4/17)
                                12 =  
              during a reversible process at constant pressure, in a closed system.

              When the process takes place in an open system, we have 12 + 12 =
               (3/15), and, if the process is reversible, heat and work can be easily
              quantified:

                                      2                                                   (4/18)

                    12 =   d

                                    1

                    12 = 0

              during a reversible process at constant pressure, in an open system.

              The work is of course zero, since there are no moving parts present to
              mechanically extract energy from the gas.

              Heat is then responsible for the entire change in temperature:

                                          12 =  - 12 =                                    (4/19)
                                          12 =  
              during a reversible process at constant pressure, in an open system.

For air, we have  (air) = 1005 J kg-1 K-1,  (air) = 718 J kg-1 K-1, air =
287 J kg-1 K-1. How much energy is needed to heat the air in a 30 m2
(322.9 ft2) apartment from 10 C to 20 C (50 °F to 68 °F)?

The heating will likely take place at constant pressure (unless the
apartment is hermetically sealed, the pressure will be atmospheric
everywhere and the air will "leak" under the doors). We assume a
pressure of 1 bar and a ceiling height of 2.5 m. We use a closed system
encompassing all the heated air.
We have a volume of 75 m3, which leads to the total mass of air as
A =  A = 287×(10+273.15) = 92.29 kg = 203.5 lb A A 1×105×75 .
The heat required to heat this amount of air at constant pressure can be
quantified with equation 4/17: AB =    = 93.29 × 1005 × (20 -
10) = +9.28 × 105 J = +928 kJ.

        This result represents the final net heat transfer to the air (after
    losses to walls and windows, as well as transfers that compensate
    for them).

        Conversely, cooling would cause outside air to come in, which
   would need to be taken into account in the mass calculation.

4.4.3 Processes at constant volume

It is possible to heat or cool a gas while maintaining its volume constant
(figure 4.8). A process at constant volume is called isochoric.

· With a closed system, we can heat or cool a gas in a fixed and closed
  reservoir. This is the case, for example, during the combustion phase in a
  gasoline engine.

· With an open system, the manipulation is more complex. When heating
  the gas, we must compress it, in order to prevent its volume from increas-
  ing; conversely, while cooling it, we must expand it so as to prevent its
  volume from decreasing. This manipulation has no common practical
  application.

When the specific volume of a perfect gas is constant, its properties vary

according to the relation

                                                                     (4/20)
                              = constant

                           

In a closed system, we have 12+12 =  and, if the process is reversible,
heat and work can be easily related to temperature.

Since the volume does not change, the work is of course zero:

                                                                 2   (4/21)

                               12 = -   d

                                                               1

                               12 = 0

The heat transfer can be easily quantified:

                            12 =  - 12 =                                             (4/22)
                            12 =  
during a reversible process at constant volume, in a closed system.

When the process occurs in an open system, we have 12 + 12 = 
and, if the process is reversible, heat and work can be quantified, although
with a little more difficulty:

                       2                    2                   2                 2

12 =   d = cst.  d = cst.                                    1 cst.   d =   d

during a reversible process at constant volume, in an open system.

One can then easily quantify the heat to be supplied:

                     12 =  - 12 =   -                                                (4/24)
                     12 =  
during a reversible process at constant volume, in an open system.

                                   Example 4.6

For air, we measure  (air) = 1005 J kg-1 K-1,  (air) = 718 J kg-1 K-1,
air = 287 J kg-1 K-1.
In a cylinder of a gasoline engine, air is at a pressure of 17 bar (246.6 psi)
with a density of 9.4 kg m-3. The combustion of the fuel (so fast that the
volume does not have time to vary) results in the supply of 1450 kJ kg-1
of heat. What are the temperature and pressure values reached?

Initially, the temperature is A = AA = A = 17×105 = 630.1 K =
                                                              9.4×287

357 C = 674.5 °F.

We use a closed system consisting of the mass of air. Since the volume

does not change, the work is zero (4/21) and it is the heat transfer which

changes the internal energy (4/22): AB =  - AB =  =   ;

thus B      =      A + AB        =                1450×103   =  2649.6 K    =  2376.5 C  =
                          
                                    630.1 +
                                                  718

4309.6 °F.

The final pressure is obtained by comparing the final condition and

the initial condition (4/20): A =  A A = B = BB ; thus B = B  A A =

2649.6  ×  17  ×  105  =  7.148  ×  106  Pa    =  71.5  bar  =  1037  psi.
630.1

    Care must be taken with temperatures in the fractions, where
they must be expressed in kelvins.

    The maximum temperature, exceeding 2300 C, surpasses the
melting temperature of most metals. In a gasoline engine, this
temperature is only reached sporadically, with each combustion.

               with 100 kJ of heat without changing its temperature. What should be
               the transfer of work? What will be the volume and pressure in the end?

               The work is easy to determine: AB + AB =  = 0 here since the
               temperature does not change. Thus, AB = -AB = -100 kJ (the
               gas must provide as much work as it receives as heat).
               The final properties are obtained using equation 4/26:

                          AB =  cst. ln        A         =  cst. ln    A

                                            ( B )                    ( B )

                             A   = exp   AB           = exp  AB

                             B           [  cst. ]           [   cst. ]

                                               -100 × 103

                                 = exp                                      = 0.878 207

                                         [ 2.5 × 287 × (800 + 273.15) ]

               And since A = A   A = 2×105 2.5×287×(800+273.15) = 3.85 m3 = 1017 US gal, we

               obtain  a  final  volume  B  =     A       =  4.384 m3  =  1158 US  gal.
                                               0.878 207

               Finally, the final pressure is obtained by comparing the final and initial

               states: AA =   A =   B = BB (or with equation 4/27):

               B  =       A  =   2 × 105 × 0.878 207  =  1.756 × 105 Pa  =  1.756 bar  =  25.47 psi.

                      The volume increases and the pressure decreases, since the gas
                  is doing work while it receives heat.

                      It is difficult to hide that this type of process is rarely used in
                  practice, but it will serve us to develop an extraordinary absolute
                  thermometer-engine-refrigerator, in chapter 7 (the second law).

               4.4.5 Reversible adiabatic processes

               An adiabatic process is one where there is no heat transfer (figure 4.12).
               This can be achieved by wrapping the gas container or duct with a thick
               layer of thermal insulation.

A reversible adiabatic process is carried out infinitely slowly. A piston in a
cylinder will need to be moved infinitely slowly for this, and a steady-flow
compressor will need to be infinitely long. Later, in chapter 8 (entropy), we
will call these processes isentropic.

It must be noted that even though there is absolutely no heat transfer, the
temperature must necessarily vary in such a process, since the work is
non-zero. This temperature change is often the intended effect, as we will
see in chapter 7 (the second law).

In a closed system, we have 12+12 =  and, if the process is reversible,
heat and work are quantified without any difficulty:

                                     12 = 0                (4/31)
during a reversible adiabatic process, by definition.

12 =  - 12 = 

12 =                                                       (4/32)

during a reversible adiabatic process in a closed system.

When the process occurs in an open system, we have 12 + 12 = 
and we can also write:

12 = 0                                                     (4/33)
12 =                                                       (4/34)

               Unfortunately, these two equations 4/32 and 4/34 are of no use until we
               have predicted the temperature 2 at the end of the process. However, in a
               reversible adiabatic process, nothing remains constant: the specific volume,
               pressure, and temperature all vary. How can we quantify these properties?
               Let us start with an infinitely small adiabatic process in a closed system.
               When the process is reversible,  = - d and then:

                                                   = d -  = 0

                                                       d +  d = 0

               By using d =  d for an ideal gas and  =  /, we can rewrite this
               equation as:

                                

                       d + d = 0

And since   =    -   (4/8) and          /     (4/9), we have      =    - 1, which
                                                                

allows us to reformulate equation 4/35 above as:

                                               -1

                              2            1

                     ( 1 ) ( 2 )

Thus, we have linked temperature and specific volume when the process is
reversible adiabatic (devoid of heat transfer and infinitely slow).

Some algebraic manipulations, which are left to the student to revise, allow
us to derive this expression in terms of pressure. We thus obtain the
following three relations:

                                               -1

                              1            2                           (4/36)

                                       =                               (4/38)

                     ( 2 ) ( 1 )

                                                    -1

                              1            1 

                                       =

                                       =

                     ( 2 ) ( 1 )

for any reversible adiabatic process.

This last equation 4/38 is equivalent to the expression:

                                  = constant                           (4/39)
for any reversible adiabatic process.

                              Example 4.8

For air, we have  (air) = 1005 J kg-1 K-1,  (air) = 718 J kg-1 K-1, air =
287 J kg-1 K-1, and air = 1.4.
A compressed air tank of 200 L (52.83 US gal) contains air at 40 bar and
50 C (580.2 psi and 122 °F). The ambient atmosphere is at 1 bar (14.5 psi).
What is the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from the
compressed air without supplying heat?

The maximum work will be obtained if the expansion is reversible.

Since we are not allowed to supply heat, our best option here is to

perform a reversible adiabatic expansion from 40 bar to 1 bar.

We want to calculate the final temperature, since it will give us the

change in energy, thus the work done by the gas. Among the three

daunting relations 4/36 to 4/38, it is the second one that interests us:

                -1                             -1

A  A                                   A -                                - 1.4-1
                                                                     40 1.4
( B ) = ( B ) . Thus: B = A ( B ) = (50 + 273.15) ( 1 ) =

112.6 K = -160.5 C = -257 °F.

The work done by the closed system composed of the gas is therefore

AB =  - AB =   - 0 = 718 × (-160.5 - 50) = -1.5115 ×

105 J kg-1 = -151.1 kJ kg-1.

By calculating the mass A = AA = 40×105×0.2 = 8.626 kg, we
                                        A     287× (50+273.15)

obtain AB = AAB = 8.626 × -151.1 × 103 = -1.3038 × 106 J =

-1.304 MJ.

               This amount of energy is enough to accelerate, without friction,

                    The final temperature, -160 C (!), reminds us not to confuse
               "adiabatic" with "constant temperature".

                   In the fractions, the pressures can be left in bars or psi, but the
               temperatures cannot remain in C or °F.

                   The expansion corresponds to the maximum work because it is
               reversible. If it were not reversible, then the temperature of the gas
               would drop less and the work would be lower (we would still have
                =  ). In the most extreme case, that of Joule and Gay-Lussac's
               expansion (§4.3.2), the temperature would remain at 50 C and no
               work would be done.

               4.4.6 Arbitrary processes

               It is important to keep in mind that in practice, the properties of a gas can
               be changed in any arbitrary manner (figure 4.14).

               Figure 4.14: An entirely arbitrary process undergone by an ideal gas represented
               on a pressure-volume diagram. Such a process requires a complex combination of
               heat and work transfers, which the student is invited to conceptualize.

                                                                                                                  CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

               We have focused on four specific processes of ideal gases, since each plays
               an important role for physicists and engineers in the design of thermal
               machines. However, this should not limit our way of thinking about a gas or
               the changes it may undergo. By cleverly controlling heat and work transfers,
               we can certainly cause any arbitrary process.

  independent of any hypothesis regarding the na-

  physicists, and we shall adopt it in the following
  research."
At the time when this text was written, the atomic
hypothesis remained largely speculative due to the
lack of adequate experimental means: the exper-
iment by Jean Perrin that finally settled the issue
only took place in the early years of the 20th century,
and the X-ray diffraction experiments suggested by
Max von Laue occurred in 1912.

      and Isochoric Coolings

A mass of 2 kg of air in a deformable reservoir is at
a pressure of 4.5 bar (65.27 psi) and occupies a volume
of 800 L (211.3 US gal). It is cooled, and the reservoir
maintains constant pressure until the volume has been
reduced by 40 %.
After this, the cooling is continued at constant volume
until the temperature reaches 25 C (77 °F).

Water generally follows the same trends as an ideal gas, but when it condenses or evaporates,
its properties change abruptly. They cannot be calculated like those of an ideal gas: they must
be tabulated.

Introduction

This chapter 5 has exactly the same objectives as chapter 4 (the ideal gas), but
applied to the study of fluids that liquefy and evaporate. It aims to answer
two questions:
· How can we describe the behavior of a liquid or vapor they are heated or

   compressed?
· How can we predict the values of  and  when we use water in machines?
This chapter is incompatible with chapter 4 (the ideal gas) and we must forget
everything that was learned there.

Compared to gases, liquids have two important differences:                                                       and on Machines Fitted to Develop that

     1The term incompressible, a true false friend for the student, does not mean that
the pressure is constant or uniform. It merely means that the specific volume ,
and thus with it the density , remains constant.

               5.1.2 Phase changes

               Heating liquid water at ambient pressure (for example in a saucepan) makes
               it easy to see that the transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state
               occurs with a very large volume change. At 1 bar and 100 C, the specific
               volume of water is multiplied by about a thousand before the temperature
               can increase again.

               The abrupt change in one physical quantity while another changes is called
               a phase change. In this chapter, we will focus on the two phases: liquid and
               gaseous. In applications where it may change phase, we call a gas a vapor,
               and water vapor is called steam.

               We will call the transition from liquid to vapor boiling or evaporation;
               conversely, the return from vapor to liquid is called condensation or
               liquefaction.

               The concept of phase is difficult to define; there are many different phases
               (among which liquid, solid, gaseous, and plasma) and their boundaries are
               not always distinct. For example, we will see that it is possible to transform a
               liquid into vapor without ever observing boiling or abrupt property changes.

               5.1.3 One way to approach evaporation and
                        condensation

               When we explored the model of the ideal gas in §4.1.3, we had pictured
               molecules as very small billiard balls in chaotic motion, colliding with each
               other without ever being attracted one to the other (figure 4.1). In reality,
               molecules are also subject to respective attractive forces that greatly affect
               their behavior.

               Let's imagine, to start with, two very small billiard balls attracted to each
               other by a magnetic force and colliding without friction at very high speed
               (figure 5.2). The attracting force alters their trajectory when the balls are
               very close to each other; but once they move away, its influence becomes
               negligible.

               Now, let's repeat the experiment with a lower initial speed (figure 5.3).
               There is a certain threshold speed below which the balls will not have
               enough kinetic energy to separate permanently. They will then form a pair,
               bouncing off each other periodically and occupying a significantly smaller
               average volume.

               This simplistic model is a good initial approach to describe the phenomenon
               of condensation. When we reduce the kinetic energy of a vapor's molecules
               (by cooling the vapor), once a critical threshold is crossed, they assemble
               much more compactly while continuing to collide at the same average
               speed (unchanged temperature). The more energy is extracted from the
               gas, the greater the number of molecules in compact interaction becomes.
               They form small groups; if they are numerous enough, the groups of 1014
               (one hundred trillion) molecules scatter light and form a suspension that
               is visible to the naked eye. Droplets with a diameter of 0.1 mm contain
               around 1016 molecules.

               Any gas can thus be liquefied by cooling it and reducing its volume. The
               temperature and pressure required for liquefaction depend on the size and

geometry of the molecules that compose it. In the following sections, we
will precisely quantify the amounts of energy and the ranges of properties
required to vaporize and liquefy one fluid in particular: water.

5.1.4 Industrial use of water and liquids/vapors

When using a fluid to convert work and heat, it can be advantageous to
exploit phase change phenomena.
In vapor form, a fluid behaves like a gas and spontaneously occupies all the
volume made available to it. It is often used in this form to move mechanical
parts (pistons in cylinders or blades in a turbine).
In liquid form, the fluid has a significantly higher density. It is often used
in this form to transfer heat (heating or cooling) because much smaller

                                             conduits can be used. For example, in order to achieve the same power, a
                                             radiator filled with a gas should have a volume roughly a thousand times
                                             larger than if the fluid was liquefied.

                                             Historically, water has been used in the very first engines in history for these
                                             reasons, and because changes in volume during phase changes allow for
                                             easier control of machines with low technology. Nowadays, liquids/vapors
                                             are mainly used in two major types of applications:

                                             In power plants where liquids/vapors allow efficient heat extraction from
                                                   external sources (waste combustion, nuclear reactions, geothermal
                                                   energy). Water is used there, because it is abundant and easy to
                                                   manipulate. Chapter 9 (steam power cycles) is entirely dedicated to these
                                                   machines.

                                             In refrigeration systems where liquids/vapors enable the use of compact
                                                   components, especially pumps. The use of liquids/vapors also allows
                                                   to drop the temperature of the fluid without having to use moving
                                                   parts, using a simple valve, which is not possible with an ideal gas
                                                   (see §4.3.2). A variety of fluids (then called "refrigerants," although
                                                   they are nothing extraordinary) are used for these purposes, selected
                                                   according to their range of physical properties, cost, impact on the
                                                   ozone layer, and contribution to global warming.

                                             In this book, we focus on water, but the phenomena and calculation methods
                                             apply equally well to other liquids/vapors.

Initially, when the water is liquid, the temperature increases linearly with
the volume, with a steep gradient. This state is referred to as subcooled
liquid (sometimes alternatively called compressed or unsaturated liquid).
Then, suddenly, while the volume continues to increase, the temperature
stops rising. The mixture in the cylinder is now two-phase: part liquid,
and part vapor. Adding heat does not cause any increase in temperature
(unlike an ideal gas), but only the transformation of more liquid into vapor:
this is called evaporation or boiling. In this state, the substance is called
liquid-vapor mixture.1

     1Strictly speaking, the mixture is called saturated liquid-vapor mixture, since it
consists of saturated liquid and saturated vapor. It can also be named wet vapor.

                                            indistinctly and there is no longer a range of constant temperature. The
                                            liquid turns into vapor without boiling!

At the end, we can connect all the phase change points, at all different
pressures: we obtain a curve called saturation curve. All this information
can be gathered on a temperature-volume ( -) diagram represented in
figure 5.7, which well describes the properties of liquid-vapor mixtures. The
student is encouraged to practice reproducing it.

5.2.3 The pressure-volume diagram (-)

In order to fully understand the phase change phenomenon, let's now
imagine a slightly different experiment.
We propose to vary the volume of a given mass of fluid, again here water,
while keeping its temperature constant (for example, by submerging the
container in a lukewarm water bath). We then observe the pressure inside
the container (figure 5.8).
As long as the water is liquid, we observe that the pressure drops sharply as
we increase its volume. Then, suddenly, the pressure stops decreasing and
remains perfectly constant, while the volume continues to increase: inside
the cylinder, the water starts to boil and we have a liquid-vapor mixture.
Finally, once the last drop of liquid water has evaporated in the cylinder, the
pressure again starts to decrease.
If we replicate the experiment at different temperatures, we observe that the
higher the temperature, and the shorter the phase change range becomes.
Above a certain temperature, which we call critical temperature (cr.), the
range disappears completely.
The behavior of a liquid-vapor in this experiment can be described on a
pressure-volume ( - ) diagram as shown in figure 5.9. The student is also
encouraged to reconstruct this diagram.

               5.2.4 A student's false friend

               The most important notion to remember from the behavior of liquid-vapors
               is that in contrast to ideal gases, their temperature is completely deregulated.
               It no longer simply dictates the other properties.

               Let's emphasize this. For a fluid close to a phase change:

                                                              (5/1)

                                                              (5/2)

                                                              (5/3)

               Almost everything that was covered in chapter 4 (the ideal gas) must be
               forgotten when dealing with a liquid/vapor. Fortunately, the first three
               chapters have not lost any of their utility.

5.2.5 Water in everyday life

The phenomena we describe here are easily observable and reproducible
with water in everyday life. However, it should be noted that:

· Water vapor is transparent and almost invisible. What is observed above
   a boiling pot of water or in the form of clouds is liquid water suspended
   in the air (figure 5.10). These fine liquid droplets can gather to form
   drops (as a droplet grows, the surface area offering frictional resistance
   increases less rapidly than its weight, and its falling velocity increases) or
   evaporate again and become invisible once more.

Figure 5.10: The visible water above a container of hot liquid, sometimes called

"steam", is in the liquid state and not gaseous. These droplets are observable to the

naked eye.  Photo by Jorge Barrios (public domain, cropped)

· Air is partially composed of water vapor (and its ability to carry water
  increases with temperature). When boiling liquid water in open air, it
  must not be forgotten that it is the air that hosts the water vapor; thus, the
  evaporation unfolds quite differently from the experiment described in
  figure 5.4. For example, the temperature of liquid water drops significantly
  during evaporation at constant pressure in the air. Another particularityis
  that condensation is catalyzed by the presence of dust particles in the air.

5.3 Quantifying the Properties of Water

For a liquid/vapor, there is no simple way to quantify the internal energy 
and enthalpy  that interest us so much. Indeed, from  and , we cannot
calculate the temperature (   ) and from  , we cannot calculate  and 
(   and    ).
· The bad news is that we will have to use tables of previously-measured

   properties, called steam tables, which can be tedious at times;
· The good news is that these tables spare us from using the dreadful

   mathematical relations (such as (1/2)1/-1 = ...) that described the
   properties of fluids in chapter 4 (the ideal gas).

5.3.1 Subcooled liquid and superheated vapor

Let's start by heating a fixed amount of liquid water while maintaining its
pressure constant, as we did in figure 5.4. For each temperature, we measure

                                            A discontinuity is observed between 200 C and 300 C: this is the state
                                            change that occurred at sat. = 201.37 C, the saturation temperature for this

                                            This steam table allows us to answer many questions. Here are a few
                                            examples:

                                                                                  Example 5.1

                                              At 16 bar and 600 C, what is the volume occupied by 2 kg of water?

                                            The pressure is 1.6 MPa. In Steam Table 1, at this pressure, at 600 C,
                                            we can read its specific volume as  = 0.249 99 m3 kg-1. The total
                                            volume will thus be  =   = 0.499 98 m3, which we confidently
                                            round to 0.5 m3.

                                                     Note that the temperature is higher than the saturation tem-
                                                perature (201.37 C), indicating that the water is in the superheated
                                               vapor state.

                                            With  an  ideal  gas,  we  could  simply  calculate  the   result  (  =     );
                                                                                                                      

                                            but this method does not work for liquid/vapor mixtures.

                                   Example 5.2

How much energy does this water lose as it undergoes a process from
600 C and 16 bar to 20 C and 6 bar?

From Steam Table 1, at 1.6 MPa and 600 C, we read 1 = 3293.9 kJ kg-1.
For a pressure of 0.6 MPa at 20 C, we read 2 = 83.9 kJ kg-1.
We can then quantify the change in energy as  = (2 - 1) =
-6420 kJ (hence a loss by the water).

         We were able to quantify  , but we cannot determine the
    proportions of heat (12) and work (12) in this change. The
    less reversible the process, and the smaller the work 12 will be
    compared to 12. After chapter 8 (entropy), we will be able to
    use entropy to quantify the maximum amount of work that can be
    obtained between 1 and 2.

                                    Example 5.3

A medium-sized turbine operates with a steam flow rate of 3 kg s-1
(6.61 lb/s) and a heat loss of 200 kW. At the inlet, the steam is at 600 C
and 16 bar; at the outlet, the steam is at 1 bar and 300 C. What is the
power delivered in the form of work?

At the inlet (1.6 MPa and 600 C), we read 1 = 3693.9 kJ kg-1.
At the outlet (0.1 MPa and 300 C), we read 2 = 3074.5 kJ kg-1.
Now, in an open system operating in steady state, neglecting changes
in mechanical energy, we have 12 + 12 =  (3/15). Therefore,
 12 =   -  12 = 3 × (3074.5 × 103 - 3693.9 × 103) - (-200 × 103) =
-1.6582 × 106 W = -1658.2 kW.

                                   Example 5.4

What is the specific internal energy of water at 16 bar and 585 C?

We interpolate between two lines of Steam Table 1. We have 500 C =

3120.1 kJ kg-1 and 600 C = 3293.9 kJ kg-1. We have progressed by a

factor    =  585-500  =  0.85  between  the  two  lines.
             600-500

We obtain by interpolation 585 C = 500 C +  × (600 C - 580 C) =

3267.83 kJ kg-1.

    After interpolating, always quickly check the order of magnitude
of the results. Here 585 C is indeed between 500 C and 600 C, and
closer to 600 C.

                     5.3.2 Saturation points

                     In order to precisely quantify the properties of water when it changes phase,
                     we use Steam Tables 2 and 3. The properties of water in the form of saturated
                     liquid (subscript ) and saturated vapor (subscript  ) are tabulated for each
                     temperature.

                     In Steam Table 2 (see pp. 310-311), the data is sorted by pressure (with each
                     pressure corresponding to a single saturation temperature). Steam Table 3
                     (see pp. 312-313) presents exactly the same data, but sorted by temperature

                     These are the same data as in Steam Table 2; they are merely sorted by

                     pressure instead of temperature.

                     We can already answer simple questions using these tables:
                                                           Example 5.5

                       What is the boiling temperature of water when the pressure is 3 bar?

                           Water is boiling, so it is at saturation (liquid-vapor mixture). We refer to
                           Steam Table 3 (excerpt in table 5.4) where the data is sorted by pressure.
                           At 0.3 MPa, the saturation temperature is 133.52 C.

                                Engineering Thermodynamics by Olivier Cleynen
                                                                                  Chapter 5 127

           As long as the water continues to boil or condense, it will remain
      at 133.52 C. In order to achieve boiling at a different temperature,
      the pressure must be adjusted.

                                      Example 5.6

  What is the increase in volume when water is vaporized at 130 C?

  Water goes from a volume  (a liquid just about to boil) to a volume 
  (when the last drop has evaporated).
  We refer to Steam Table 2 (excerpt in table 5.3) where the data is
  sorted by temperature. At 130 C, the specific volume increases by
    )   -  = 0.668 - 0.001 07 = 0.666 93 m3 kg-1 (it is
  multiplied by about 600).

           Here, evaporation occurs entirely at 130 C (which is quite easy
      to achieve in practice, since it simply involves maintaining constant
      pressure, see figure 5.7). If the temperature and pressure were not
      held constant, the final volume would be different.

                                      Example 5.7

  How much heat is needed to fully (and slowly) vaporize 4 L of saturated
  liquid water at 3 bar?

  The water will receive heat, but will also do work (by expanding at
  constant pressure of 3 bar). We will calculate evap. = 12 = (2 -
  1) - 12 (2/2).
  The water starts as a saturated liquid (state 1 = subscript ) and ends
  up as a saturated vapor (state 2 = subscript  ).
  Since the process is slow and at constant pressure, the work 12 =

          2

  - 1  d simply becomes -cst.(2 - 1).
  Let's gather all of this information in one equation: evap. = ( - ) +
  cst.( - ) =  -  =   ) = 2163.5 kJ kg-1.
  At 3 bar, our 4 L of saturated liquid water corresponds to a mass  =
    = 0.001073 4×10 = 3.7279 kg -3 . So, in the end, evap. =  evap. = 8065.2 kJ.

           If we had used the usual approximation of 1000 liters per cubic
      meter of liquid water (  10-3 m3 kg-1), we would have made an
      error of +7.3%.

It is worth mentioning that the term   )   -  is sometimes
called heat of vaporization or latent heat. Indeed, for evaporation in a closed
system at a given temperature, evap. =  - evap. = ( - ) + sat.( -
) =  (the same result is obtained in an open system).

5.3.3 The liquid-vapor mixture

Finally, we want to quantify the properties of water between the saturation
points, in other words, when it is only partially liquid. Experiment shows

   https://thermodynamicsbook.com - CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen
128 Chapter 5

               that in this region, fluids behave linearly, and its properties can be easily
               quantified.
               In order to "position" a liquid-vapor mixture between the two saturation
               points, we define the quality or dryness fraction as follows:

                      The dryness fraction  is the mass fraction of saturated vapor
                                      contained in a liquid-vapor mixture.

               For example, a mass of 1 kg of water with a dryness fraction of 0.2 contains
               0.8 kg of saturated liquid and 0.2 kg of saturated vapor. This 0.2 kg does
               occupy the majority of the available volume. We could say that the dryness
               fraction quantifies the progression of a liquid-vapor mixture between its
               two saturation points (figure 5.11). The concept of dryness fraction applies
               only to two-phase mixtures, thus we always have 0    1.

               Figure 5.11: The vapor dryness fraction represented by the point position on a  - 
               diagram.

                                                                                                       Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

               We can now express the properties , , and  in terms of the dryness
               fraction:

               The enthalpy  of a liquid-vapor mixture is equal to the sum of the en-
                     thalpy of the liquid and that of the vapor. We have, as illustrated in
                     figure 5.12:

                = (1 - ) +  

               =  + ( - )

                =  +                                          (5/4)

               where  is the specific enthalpy of the mixture at hand (J kg-1),
                        is its dryness fraction (unitless),

               and   )   -  (tabulated value) is the specific enthalpy of
               vaporization at its temperature (J kg-1).

The internal energy  of a liquid-vapor mixture is quantified in exactly

the same way:

                    =  +                           (5/5)

where  is the specific energy of the mixture under study (J kg-1),
         is its dryness fraction (unitless),

and   )   -  (tabulated value) is the difference of specific
internal energies at saturation, at its temperature (J kg-1).

The specific volume of a liquid-vapor mixture, finally, is quantified even
      more simply. The total volume of the mixture equals the volume of
      the gas plus the volume of the liquid, thus:

                    = (1 - ) +  

However, the specific volume  of the saturated liquid is usually small

compared to that of the vapor. A brief examination of Steam Table 2

will reveal that this is approximately a factor of 103 (this factor is not

very well highlighted by the  -  and  -  diagrams in this chapter,

whose abscissa scales are logarithmic). We can therefore neglect 

and simply write:

                                                   (5/6)

where  is the specific volume of the mixture under study (m3 kg-1),
         is its dryness fraction (unitless),

and  (tabulated value) is the specific volume of the saturated vapor
at its temperature (m3 kg-1).

This approximation is illustrated in figure 5.13.

We can now use the same Steam Tables 2 and 3 to quantify what happens
between the saturation points.

               graphically emphasized.                 Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

                                          Example 5.8

               What is the internal energy and volume occupied by a mass of 4 kg of
               water, 75 % vaporized, at 115 C (239 °F)?

               We have a liquid-vapor mixture and the dryness is 0.75. We refer to
               Steam Table 2 (excerpt in table 5.3) to find the saturation temperature
               of 115 C.
               Then, we simply apply equation 5/5:  =  + 0.75 ×  =
               482.4 + 0.75 × 2041 = 2013.15 kJ kg-1.
               Similarly, with equation 5/6:  = 0.75 ×  = 0.75 × 1.0358 =
               0.776 85 m3 kg-1.
               Therefore, we have  =   = 8052.6 kJ and  =   = 3.1074 m3 =
               820.89 US gal.

               What is the dryness of water at 2.5 bar whose enthalpy is 1500 kJ kg-1?

               We have a liquid-vapor mixture; we look in Steam Table 3 (excerpt

               in table 5.4) for the line corresponding to sat. = 0.25 MPa. We use

               equation 5/4.

               From there, we get:  = - = 1500-535.3 = 0.442.

                   A quick check: at 1500 kJ kg-1 we are roughly halfway between
                 500 and   2700 kJ kg-1.

5.4 Elementary Reversible Processes

We are now able to quantify the terms , , and  of a liquid/vapor in all
cases. Here, we intend to proceed just as in the previous chapter (§4.4):
we want to calculate the energy transfers involved when compressing or
expanding a liquid/vapor under entirely arbitrary constraints of volume,
pressure, or temperature.

5.4.1 What is this chapter section for?

The answer is the same as in chapter chapter 4 (the ideal gas) (§4.4.1). The
liquid/vapor processes we study here are highly hypothetical but interesting
for two reasons:

  1. The behavior of a liquid/vapor is intrinsically complex. These elemen-
      tary processes serve as exercises to learn how to describe it step by
      step;

  2. These elementary processes are conceptual tools that we will later as-
      semble: first to quantify the theoretical limits of machines (in chapter 7),
      and finally to describe the behavior of fluids in industrial machines (in
      chapter 9).

5.4.2 Processes at constant pressure                                                « It is well known that when water

How much work and heat are needed to slowly heat 2 kg of saturated
liquid water at constant pressure (3 bar) until the volume reaches 1 m3?

We start from the saturated liquid state, with 1 =  and 1 = . We

need the final specific volume and enthalpy in order to quantify 12

and  12.  The  final  volume  will  be  2  =  2  =   0.5 m3 kg-1.
                                              

    We notice that 2 is less than  at our temperature. At the end
of the heating process, the water will still be partially liquid, and we
will need to calculate its dryness fraction.

and 3. We know the pressure (0.3 MPa), therefore we need Steam
Table 3.

The final dryness fraction is 2         =     0.5    = 0.825 (5/6). Therefore,
                                           0.605 76

2 =  + 2  = 561.4 + 0.825 × 2163.5 = 2347.2 kJ kg-1 (5/4).

The work is obtained using equation 5/9: 12 =  12 =
- cst.  = -2×0.3×106×(0.5-0.001 073) = -2.994×105 J = -299.4 kJ.

Finally, the heat transfer is calculated using equation 5/10: 12 =
 12 =   = 2 × (2347.2 × 103 - 561.4 × 103) = +3.5715 × 106 J =
+3571.5 kJ.

    The heat transfer involved is ten times more significant than the
work done. In this case, we are heating a lot, and the fluid, at low
pressure, does little work.

    It is probably simpler and less risky to derive these equations 5/9
and 5/10 by hand rather than trying to memorize them.

One can notice that when heating water in a liquid/vapor mixture (below
the saturation curve), the volume increase is significant. In practice, just a
few milliliters of liquid water can lead to an expansion of several liters at
constant pressure, with a very moderate and constant temperature. This is
why all the early engines, in the 19th century, operated with water rather
than air. The large volume amplification allowed for more compact engines
with large strokes (simpler mechanisms), the constant pressure meant forces
were easier to manage, and the modest temperatures allowed the use of
simple materials. This combination made the liquid-vapor mixture of water
appealing at a time when metallic technology was limited. We will see in
chapters 7 (the second law) and 9 (steam power cycles) that these advantages
unfortunately translate into staggeringly low efficiencies. In order to over-
come this, the temperature must be increased: that would be for the 20th
century.

               5.4.3 Processes at constant volume

               It is possible to transfer heat to or from a liquid/vapor while maintaining
               its volume constant (figure 5.16). A process at constant volume is called an
               isochoric process. To generate one, we should:

               · With a fixed amount of fluid (closed system), simply transfer heat with a
                  fixed and closed container;

               · with a fluid in steady flow (open system), carry out a more complex pro-
                  cess: the liquid-vapor must be compressed while heating it to prevent its
                 volume from increasing; similarly, to prevent its volume from decreasing
                 when cooling it, it must be expanded.

               a closed system (left), the volume is fixed and no work is done. In an open system

               cooled, in order to maintain constant specific volume.

in a reversible constant volume process, in an open system.

We note that depending on its dryness fraction at the beginning, a liquid-
vapor mixture, when heated at constant volume, can become either entirely
liquid, or entirely gaseous.

5.4.4 Processes at constant temperature

It is possible to heat or cool a liquid-vapor while maintaining its tempera-
ture constant (figure 5.18). A process at constant temperature is called an
isothermal process.

When the fluid is in a mix of phases (inside of the saturation curve), the
constant temperature process also occurs at constant pressure, as described
in section §5.4.2 above. In order to quantify the energy transfers, we only
need to refer to equations 5/9 and 5/10.

However, as soon as we cross the saturation curve, things change. Once the
saturation is reached, the pressure starts to decrease, and we do not have an
analytical way to describe this process.

The consequence is that for now, we cannot quantify the work and heat
involved when evolving steam at constant temperature! We must wait until
chapter 8, where we will use the concept of entropy to tackle the problem.

                                   Example 5.11

How much work and heat are required to slowly heat 2 kg (4.41 lb) of
saturated liquid water at constant temperature (130 C = 266 °F), until
its volume reaches 1 m3 (220 imp gal)?

We first observe the final state.  The final volume will be 2  =       2  =
                                                                       

0.5 m3 kg-1, which is less than  at our temperature. Therefore, at the

end of the heating process, the water will still be partially liquid.

The process will also occur at constant pressure (at the saturation
pressure, sat130 C = 0.270 28 MPa). The calculation is exactly the same
as for example 5.10 p. 133. We obtain a dryness fraction of 0.749, the
work (done) is 12 = -269.7 kJ, and a heat (received) amounts to
12 = +3256.2 kJ.

    As long as we are in a liquid-vapor mixture (inside the saturation
curve), constant temperature = constant pressure. No problem.

                                   Example 5.12

We revisit the same question as in Example 5.11 above with a larger
final volume: 2 m3 (440 imp gal). How much heat and work are needed?

We cannot yet answer this question! The final specific volume ex-
ceeds  and towards the end of the process, the pressure decreases
(figure 5.19).

We could quantify the energy 2 by interpolating between the rows and
columns of Steam Table 1 (by looking for a volume 2 at 130 C), which
would be imprecise and cumbersome. However, even if we quantified
 = 2 - 1, we would be unable to determine the share of work and
heat within: both the pressure and volume change, and we are missing
a relationship between them to carry out the integral   d.

         With the ideal gas model, we could write that  = cst. at
    constant temperature, and thus calculate the work during expansion.
    But with a liquid-vapor mixture, this no longer works.

        In chapter 8 (entropy), we will be able to use the brilliant concept
    of entropy to answer this question.

How to quantify this  or ? Let's consider the example of an adiabatic
expansion, starting from 40 bar and 500 C. We try to extract the maximum
work from the steam before releasing it at atmospheric pressure (1 bar).

· If the expansion is completely irreversible (very abrupt), then the work is
  zero. The steam is released with the same amount of energy (, ) as at
  the inlet.

· The slower the expansion, the more work we receive.

· The best case - the maximum work - corresponds to a reversible adiabatic
  expansion (infinitely slow).

Unfortunately, we are still unable to quantify this maximum amount of
work! To do this, we would need to be able to quantify the energy within
the steam while it expands. We knew how to do this last chapter with an
ideal gas (and the daunting relationships of the type (1/2)1/-1 = ...), but
we do not have such a tool with liquids/vapors.

Later, in chapter 8 (entropy), we will see that a reversible adiabatic process
occurs at constant entropy (which is why we will call these processes
isentropic), and we will use this phenomenal tool to answer these questions.

5.4.6 Arbitrary processes

One must keep in mind that in practice, the properties of a liquid-vapor can
be arbitrarily changed (figure 5.22), just like with a gas.

We have focused on four specific processes, because each plays an important
role, for physicists and engineers, in the design of thermal machines. By
cleverly controlling heat and work transfers, of course, we can change the
fluid properties any way we would like.

5.10 Newcomen Engine

In their time, around 1720, Newcomen engines
(figure 5.23) were at the forefront of technology.
Slightly overheated steam (1 bar, 250 C) was injected
into a large cylinder (height 1 m, diameter 1.5 m).
This steam was then cooled (by allowing a small
amount of liquid water at atmospheric pressure and
temperature to enter), maintaining the internal pres-
sure at 0.1 bar. The piston would then descend, provid-
ing work.
The water available to the engine was at 1 bar, 10 C.

An aircraft catapult is mounted on a military ship (fig-               In a nuclear power plant, the electricity generator is

When heating a compressed fluid, it provides more work upon expansion than was spent
during compression. By expanding a fluid, its temperature drops and thus we can absorb heat
from a relatively "cooler" body. With these two processes, we transform heat into work and
vice versa.

Introduction

Thanks to chapters 4 and 5, we have learned to quantify energy in fluids
based on their properties. We will now use these fluids in machines to
convert heat into work, and work into heat. In this chapter 6 (thermodynamic
cycles), we aim to formalize the concept of a cycle, addressing two questions:
· How do engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps work?
· How is their efficiency quantified?

6.1 Graphical Conventions

We start by agreeing on some graphical and notation conventions, which
are summarized in figure 6.1.

white arrows are oriented according to the physical direction of the transfers; The
algebraic sum of all the work received and carried out is represented by a single

We use large white arrows to represent the physical direction of transfers.
We do not change our sign convention (transfers are positive when directed
toward the system and negative when coming from it), but only the graphi-
cal convention for their orientation, in order to make the visualization of
transfers in machines more intuitive.

The algebraic sum of the work in received by a machine and out it
supplies is named the net work net. The net work can be positive (done
onto the the machine from external sources) or negative (done by the
machine to an external receiver), depending on the application.

net  in + out     (6/1)
 net   in +  out

               We define the net heat in the same way:

               net  in + out                                  (6/2)
                net   in +  out
               net  in + out

               Therefore, for example, a car's engine sees a positive net heat transfer
               (reception) and a negative net work (supplied to the gearbox).

               6.2 Transforming Heat and Work

               6.2.1 Building thermodynamic cycles

               We want to compare different ways of transforming work and heat. For
               these comparisons to be valid, we must always take into account all the
               processes undergone by the fluid until it returns to its initial state.

               For example, it is easy to cool a room with a compressed air bottle (simply
               make the fluid work during its expansion to lower its temperature); but if
               we want to continuously cool the room, then we also need to consider the
               energy required to return the air to the bottle, at its initial pressure and
               temperature, at the end of the process.

               A second example is that of a car engine, which releases heat carried by
               the exhaust gases. In order to account for this lost energy, we count the
               heat that would need to be removed from the gases in order to bring them
               back to the engine's inlet temperature. This imaginary cooling takes place
               outside the engine in practice, but from a thermodynamic standpoint, it is
               an integral part of the energy transformation process.

               Therefore, every time we analyze the operation of a thermodynamic ma-
               chine, we will make sure to continue the fluid processes until it returns to its
               initial state (same temperature, same pressure, same internal energy, etc.).
               We then say that it has completed a thermodynamic cycle (§2.3).

               6.2.2 Producing work with heat

               Let us start by compressing a fluid: we increase its pressure and reduce its
               specific volume, which requires a certain amount of work. After that, we
               heat up this fluid: its pressure and volume tend to increase. By expanding
               the fluid back to its initial pressure, we will recover more work than what
               we initially invested. Finally, in order to bring the fluid back to its initial
               state, it needs to be cooled down.

               In the end, the fluid has done more work when it was expended than was
               done onto it when it was compressed. Over a cycle, it will thus have produced
               work and absorbed heat (part of which it transformed). This is the operating
               principle of an engine.

               There are infinitely many possible cycles to perform this process, but they all
               involve at least four energy transfers: compression, heating, expansion, and
               cooling. We can separate these processes in space, as shown in figure 6.3, or

in time, as illustrated in figure 6.2. Depending on technological and practical
constraints, some of these transfers may be performed simultaneously.

temperature  . The compression power is lower than the expansion power: the
net power in the form of work  net =  in +  out is negative.

It is possible to mechanically link the sections that receive and supply energy
in the form of work. In the case where the fluid circulates continuously, the
compressor and the turbine can be connected by the same shaft, as shown
in figure 6.4. In the case where the processes are separated in time, such as
in an internal combustion engine, the processes can be linked by performing
multiple offset cycles simultaneously (with multiple cylinders) or by storing
energy in a flywheel. The engine then does not receive external work, and
the resulting output is a power  net.

                            6.2.3 Extracting heat with work

                                     When work is done on a fluid, its temperature tends to rise (with a brief
                                     exception for liquid/vapors between their saturation points) and it can thus
                                     supply heat to a body that was initially at a higher temperature ("hotter")
                                     than itself.
                                     Conversely, when a fluid is expanded, its temperature tends to decrease and
                                     it can thus absorb heat from a body that was initially "colder" than itself.
                                     By performing these steps one after the other, we obtain a refrigeration cycle:
                                     a machine capable of extracting heat at low temperature and rejecting it at
                                     high temperature. Such a cycle is depicted in figures 6.6 (stages separated in
                                     space) and 6.5 (stages separated in time).
                                     Careful examination of these two figures will reveal a major surprise: they
                                     are exactly the same arrangement as for an engine! The only difference lies
                                     in the operating temperatures. The temperature reached during compression
                                     must be higher than the high temperature  , and the temperature
                                     reached during expansion must be lower than the low temperature .
                                     Unless these conditions are met, the heat transfers will occur in the wrong
                                     direction.
                                     In a refrigeration cycle, the fluid has a larger volume when compressed
                                     (after having being heated) than when expanded (after having being cooled):
                                     this time, the compression requires more power than the expansion. The
                                     net power  net in the form of work is therefore positive, meaning that the
                                     machine must be powered by an external source of work.
                                     In practice in refrigeration systems, a trick is often used to lower the tem-
                                     perature: instead of a turbine, a simple valve (sometimes called a throttling
                                     valve) is used. In this component without moving parts, the fluid does not
                                     do work (therefore the power to be supplied to the machine is increased),

but it is much simpler to manufacture and use. This modification is depicted
in figure 6.7.
The throttle valve, in thermodynamic terms, allows for a completely ir-
reversible expansion, increasing the volume and reducing the pressure
without extracting work. If a perfect gas were used, this would have no
effect on the temperature (as in the experiments of Joule and Gay-Lussac
studied in §4.3.2 p. 90) and therefore no interest; but when liquids/vapors
are used, the throttling expansion is a technologically simple way to lower
the temperature.

                                     Refrigeration cycles have two main types of applications:
                                     Heat pumps (figure 6.8) are arranged to reject heat to a high-temperature

                                            body, most often a building;
                                     Refrigerators and air conditioners (figure 6.9) are arranged to extract

                                            heat from a low-temperature body (a cold enclosure).

In these two types of applications, it is exactly the same machine, operating
with the same cycle. The only difference concerns the internal/external
arrangement of the components: a heat pump is nothing more than a
refrigerator positioned to "cool the outside".
The similarity between an air conditioner and a heat pump allows these two
functions to be performed by a single machine, which is then referred to as
reversible in the industry. In thermodynamics, the word "reversible" has
a different meaning, as we will see in chapter 7 (the second law), and so we
will call this kind of machine bidirectional here. Depending on the needs,
the direction of fluid flow is reversed, which causes the inversion of heat
transfers. This type of machine is shown in figure 6.10.

By rotating both valves 90 degrees counterclockwise, the function changes from a
heat pump to an air conditioner.

               6.3 Cycle Efficiency

               6.3.1 A basic formula

               The efficiency1  of a thermodynamic machine compares the useful transfer
               or transformation it performs with the energy cost it incurs. We will adopt
               the following principle definition:

                |  useful transfer                |  (6/3)
                |                                 |
               |
                | energy expenditure |            |

               By convention, the efficiency is always expressed as a positive number; thus
               we use an absolute value in equation 6/3. For each of the three types of
               thermodynamic machine, we will define and quantify this "useful transfer"
               and this "energy expenditure".

               6.3.2 Efficiency of an engine

               The function of a thermal engine, like those found on board road vehicles
               or in power plants, is to supply work, meaning a negative quantity  net
               (figure 6.11). The expense incurred to generate this work is the heat it
               receives, namely the quantity  in (usually originating from the combustion
               of fuel or the fission of atomic nuclei).

               Figure 6.11: Energy transfers associated with an engine. We aim to obtain a large
               transfer  net (result) from the transfer  in (cost). The rejection  out is undesirable.

                                                                                                      Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

               According to definition 6/3, the efficiency engine of the thermal engine is
               therefore:

                                     |    net  |     (6/4)
                                     |         |
                   engine  |  |
                                     | in |

                    1Some authors make a distinction between the efficiency  defined in 6/3 and a
               relative efficiency or effectiveness    real comparing the efficiency achieved

                                                                                                                   theoretical

               in practice with the maximum achievable efficiency by the machine in theory. It is
               then necessary to carefully define the assumptions associated with the calculation
               of the maximum efficiency.

                                   Example 6.1

A car engine receives 100 kW in the form of heat from gasoline com-
bustion; it supplies 55 kW as work at the transmission shaft. What is
its efficiency?

The efficiency is engine = |  | = | +100×103 | = 0.55 = 55 % |  net | | -55×103 | .
            | in | |                      |

     This engine rejects  out = - net -  in = -(-55 × 103) - 100 ×
103 = -45 kW as heat. Most of this energy is carried away with the
exhaust gases.

     Since one must always supply at least as much heat  in as the
engine outputs in work  net, the efficiency of an engine will always
necessarily be less than 1.

The net power  net in the form of work can be expressed in terms of other
energy transfers, as follows:

             net =  in +  out = - in -  out

                             |    out  |                                             (6/5)
                             |         |
            engine = 1 - |  |
                             | in |

This equation 6/5 will be very useful in the next chapter (§7.5.1 p. 195), where
we will want to relate the heat transfers  in and  out to the temperatures at
which they occur.

6.3.3 Efficiency of a refrigerator or air conditioner

The function of a refrigerator or an air conditioner is to extract heat, and
thus to generate a positive power  in (heat extracted every second from the
compartment to be cooled). This transfer (figure 6.12) is made possible by
supplying work to the refrigerator,  net, an "expense" that must be positive,
too.

According to the definition 6/3, the efficiency of a refrigerator or an air

                 A refrigerator receives an electrical power of 100 W; it extracts heat
                 from the cold chamber with a power of 120 W. What is its efficiency?

               -220 W outside of the cold chamber (usually, within the building
               itself).

                    Household refrigerators and air conditioners often have efficien-
               cies greater than 1, but depending on the desired temperatures, the
               efficiency can indeed be lower.

               In order to prepare for the next chapter (§7.5.2 p. 196), and while paying
               attention to the pitfalls associated with the use of absolute values, we can
               express this efficiency in terms of heat transfers only:

                                                                       1                                  (6/7)
                                refrigerator = air conditioner = |  |

                                                                  | out | - 1

               6.3.4 Efficiency of a heat pump

               A heat pump operates exactly the same way as an air conditioner. Its
               function is to generate a transfer  out to the "hot" section (usually inside
               a building). This transfer, represented in figure 6.13, is made possible by
               supplying work to the heat pump,  net, an "expense" that is necessarily
               positive.

The efficiency heat pump of the heat pump, also known as the coefficient of
performance copheat pump, is thus defined as:

                                                   |   out   |        (6/8)
                           heat pump  |  |         |         |

                                                   | net |

                                   Example 6.3

A heat pump receives an electrical power of 100 W; it heats the inside
of a room with a power of 350 W. What is its efficiency?

The  efficiency  is  heat  pump  =  |   out  |  =  | -350 |  =  3.5.
                                    |        |     | +100 |

                                    | net |

     The heat pump rejects more energy as heat than it receives as
work - that is its whole purpose. If the cop were equal to or less
than 1, it would be more economical and much simpler to use an
electric heater instead.

Just as we did for the previous sections, we can express this efficiency in
terms of heat flows only:

                                              1                       (6/9)
                           heat pump = |  |

The second method is bound to offend purists: it

   the refrigerators, averaged over the year, is 80 kW.

· In the winter, the building loses heat with an average
   power of 400 kW. It is heated with a heat pump unit
   of cop 4.

· In the summer, the building absorbs heat with an
   average power of 160 kW. It is cooled with an air
   conditioning unit of cop 0.9.

· During autumn and spring, the heating/cooling
   needs are almost negligible.

The company is considering replacing its entire fleet
of refrigerators with a model of 220 % efficiency, which
requires a significant investment. It has a total of 100
supermarkets and pays 0.15 AC per kW h on average for
electricity.

      In a supermarket, both in spring and autumn, the

      energy savings provided by the new refrigerators

      amount to 43.6 kW.

      In summer, the heat to be absorbed by the air

      conditioners is reduced. Therefore, an additional

      saving of 48.5 kW in electricity can be added at

      the level of the air conditioners.

      In winter, the heat required by the heat pumps

      is increased. Therefore, an additional expense of

      10.9 kW must be added at the level of the heat

      pumps.

      In the end, this represents an annual savings of                                                             6.12

13) We first calculate                                   the work transfers are

728.4 K. In the pack,

pack = pack compressor + pack turbine = (4C -
3C) + (6C - 5C) = -138.9 kJ kg-1; Thus, the
air supplies net work in the pack, which in this

case has a net surplus of shaft power.

14) In order to calculate these cop, the cycles

must be completed by returning the air from

the cabin condition back to the inlet condition
(§6.2.1). In question 3 we have heat pump = || in | = | out ||
- (2A-1A) = 0.424 (4A-1A) (a rare application where a
cop less than 100 % is acceptable).

15) In question 12 we have conditioner = || in | = | in ||

 (1C-6C)                                                 = 0.842.

 (2C-1C+4C-3C+6C-5C)

In practice, however, the net work done by the

air in the pack is not recovered: it is dissipated

through friction into the ram air.We thus have

net = (2C - 1C) and the cop is decreased.

A few final comments : 1) In reality, adiabatic pro-

cesses are not reversible, which further reduces

the efficiencies calculated here. 2) The low val-

ues of these efficiencies result from compromises

made to reduce the size, complexity, and espe-

cially the weight of the onboard systems. In this

application, the available power as work is high,

pneumatic energy is widely available, and any

excess in volume or weight has disproportionate

consequences. 3) In more recent aircraft (referred

to as more electric), such as the B787 and the A350,

the packs are now powered by electricity rather

than using the same air intended for the cabin.

Heat only moves towards a body at a lower temperature. This poses a fundamental limit on the
efficiency of work-heat transformations. This limit depends on the maximum and minimum
temperatures at which a machine operates, and is usually very low. Carnot described an
engine of maximum efficiency.

Introduction

In chapter 6 (thermodynamic cycles), we studied the nature of different cycles
for converting heat and work. We now aim to study, explain, and quantify
their very limits. This chapter 7 (the second law) aims to answer two questions:
· Why do all heat engines always have an efficiency less than 100 %?
· How can the efficiency of a heat machine be maximized?

7.1 The Second Law

7.1.1 Statement

The second law of thermodynamics is expressed as follows:

                             Heat spontaneously moves
                         only towards a lower temperature.

This statement can be made more specific as follows:

                      Heat transfer to a higher temperature
                     can only occur with the input of energy.

We will see that this simple observation has multiple, profound conse-
quences for engineers. In particular, it determines the maximum efficiency
of all engines and refrigeration machines!

7.1.2 The evidence of the second law

The statement above seems so obvious that it is almost offending. Two
remarks are necessary here.
· The second law can be stated in multiple ways. It is more striking to

   talk about "increase in entropy" than the spontaneous behavior of heat;
   yet these different statements, which we will gradually address, are all
   equivalent.
· The apparent manifest evidence of the postulate - of course no one has
   ever seen, at room temperature, a cup of hot tea spontaneously heat up, or
   a cold drink spontaneously cool down - crumbles as soon as one studies
   phenomena at the microscopic level.
   Indeed, if temperature is only the level of agitation of particles, then
   there is a priori nothing preventing it from locally increasing even if the
   ambient temperature is lower. It took half a century of arduous work
   by thermodynamicists to provide a satisfactory answer to this (curious
   students will learn of Maxwell's demon to their delight). The application
   of probabilities to thermodynamics, and in particular the work of Ludwig

   https://thermodynamicsbook.com - CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen
178 Chapter 7

                  Boltzmann (§8.5.3), would reconcile it with the Newtonian mechanistic
                  view of the world during the 20th century. This is not a trivial problem.
               In our study and from our engineering point of view, we will accept the
               above postulate as obvious, without seeking to justify it or explain it.

               7.1.3 Zeroth law and third law

               The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two bodies are in thermal
               equilibrium with a third, then all three are in equilibrium with each other.
               The third law states that the entropy (a property that we will study in the
               next chapter) of a crystal at zero temperature is zero. Neither of these laws
               is of any importance to the engineer.

               7.2 The Second Law and Thermal
                     Machines

               7.2.1 All engines reject heat

               Let's imagine that we want to generate work by taking heat from a "hot"
               object, that is, at a high temperature: for example, 100 C (212 °F), as shown
               in figure 7.1. We connect a cylinder filled with a fluid to this object, and let
               the fluid push on a piston as it receives heat.

               Figure 7.1: Production of work with heat from a body at 100 C. The heat transfer
               allows work to be done, but also causes an increase in the fluid's temperature.

                                                                                                      Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

               Once it has done some work (at B in figure 7.1), the fluid has increased in
               volume. If we want to continue converting heat into work and do not want
               the engine to "inflate" indefinitely, we need to cool this gas to return it to its
               initial volume.

Unfortunately, the only way to extract heat from the gas is to put it in contact                                      « According to this principle, it is
with a "cooler" body, as shown in figure 7.2. In particular, it is impossible
to return the accumulated heat in the gas to the "hot" body - for that to                                             not sufficient, in order to give rise to
happen, the gas temperature would need to be higher than this body. This                                              motive power, to produce heat: one
accumulated energy is therefore irretrievably lost.                                                                   must also procure cold; without it, heat

Thus, for an engine to operate continuously, it must, in addition to a
high-temperature source from which to capture heat, have a "sink" at low
temperature to reject the heat that it can no longer make use of.

This reasoning applies in the same way to refrigerators, air conditioners,
and heat pumps, which are designed to absorb heat at a low temperature.
Once the heat has been absorbed into the low-temperature fluid, the only
way to reject it at a higher temperature is to increase the temperature of the
fluid. This requires a non-zero compression work. Thus, for a refrigerator
to operate continuously, it must receive energy in the form of work.

7.2.2 Limits of thermal machines

In order to study heat and work transformations more rigorously, we will
use the following notation to describe thermal machines:

·  and  will represent the high and low temperatures respectively;

· We will always call    the power in the form of heat transferred at
   high temperature, and    its equivalent at low temperature (each can
   be positive or negative).

Thus, the thermal machine in its most general representation looks like
figure 7.3.

Regardless of the operation mode and efficiency of the machine, it cannot
create or destroy energy (§1.1.2); and we will always have:

   +    +  net = 0  (7/1)

                                     The second law has particular consequences for each of the two main types
                                     of thermal machines:
                                     An engine takes heat from a high-temperature source (   > 0) and

                                            produces work ( net < 0, figure 7.4). We have just seen that if we
                                            want to carry out this transformation continuously, we have no choice
                                            but to reject heat into a low-temperature reservoir (   < 0).

                                            In power plants, the two temperature zones are easily identifiable: the
                                            steam takes heat from the core of the plant (nuclear reactor, gas boiler,
                                            or coal boiler) and releases heat through the large cooling chimneys.

Automotive and aeronautical engines, on the other hand, must dis-
charge the air that serves as their working fluid because of the com-
bustion products that prevent its reuse. For this reason, cooling takes
place in the atmosphere, outside the engine casing. Their "cooling
zone" is not easily distinguishable.

Applied to the engine, the second law can be expressed as follows:

      No engine can continuously convert heat into work from a
          single heat source. All engines reject heat at a lower
                                   temperature.

The continuous operation of an engine requires two heat
         reservoirs, each at a different temperature.

Purists will express this corollary, called the Kelvin-Planck corollary,
with the following inequality:

                            > - net                      (7/2)

for any thermal engine.

A refrigerator, an air conditioner, or a heat pump operates in the op-
      posite way to engines. These machines extract heat from a low-
      temperature source (   > 0) to reject it into a reservoir at a higher
      temperature (   < 0, figure 7.5). An inevitable consequence is that
      they must receive work for this ( net > 0).

                                            Carnot died shortly after his publication and before his work could be

                                            today.

                                            7.3.2 Concept of reversible machine

                                            Carnot sought the theoretical engine whose efficiency would be the maxi-
                                            mum possible. He imagined a unique way to transform heat into work and
                                            work into heat. His machine can operate in both directions: as an engine or
                                            as a refrigerator.

                                            In thermodynamic terms, the machine he conceptualized is not only bidirec-
                                            tional, meaning that the direction of fluid flow can be changed to change its
                                            function (like many domestic heat pump / ac systems on the market today),
                                            but it is also reversible: by reversing its operation, all heat flows become
                                            exactly opposite. In this way, if Carnot's refrigerator is powered by Carnot's
                                            engine, then the flows will be exactly compensated, as depicted in figure 7.6.

                                                 1Carnot figured out the second law correctly, but not the first law: he still used

                                            We can describe the Carnot cycle with a fixed amount of mass maintained
                                            inside a cylinder undergoing four processes (figure 7.8). It commutes be-

                                            In this stage, we aim to raise the temperature of the fluid to a high level
                                            without adding any heat to it.
                                            The cycle starts at 1, when the fluid is in the cylinder at the low tem-

                      Isothermal heating from 2 to 3 In this stage, we aim
to absorb a quantity   of heat from the high-temperature source.

At 2, the fluid has been compressed in the piston at temperature  . The
cylinder is brought into contact with the hot source (temperature  ) and
heat is supplied with an infinitesimal temperature difference: this is an
isothermal expansion (§4.4.4 & §5.4.4). The fluid's temperature remains
constant at  .

This phase generates work output (23 < 0).

                      Reversible adiabatic expansion from 3 to 4 In this
stage, we aim to decrease the temperature of the fluid to that of the cold
source ().

At 3, the fluid is still at temperature  . The cylinder is then thermally
isolated and the fluid is expanded in order to have the fluid do work
and reduce its temperature without heat transfer: this is a reversible
adiabatic expansion. The piston continues its slow retreat, and the fluid's
temperature decreases down to .

This phase generates work output (34 < 0).

                         Isothermal cooling from 4 to 1 In this final stage,
   we aim to reject a quantity   of heat into the low-temperature sink.

   At 4, the fluid is at low temperature . In order to bring it back to its
   initial volume, heat must be removed. We proceed with an isothermal
   cooling: the piston is gradually advanced, and the fluid's temperature is
   kept constant at .

   This phase requires work input (41 > 0).

Overall, the engine received a quantity of heat |  | at high temperature
and rejected a smaller quantity | | at low temperature. The difference
between these two quantities is the produced work, net = 12 + 23 +
34 + 41 = -  -   (6/1).

This quantity of work net represents the maximum that can be obtained
from a quantity of heat   between two given temperatures  and  .

                                          We start by raising the temperature to 600 C with a reversible adiabatic

                                          process (1  2). The energetic cost for this will be 12 =   =

                                              This phase's sole purpose is to raise the temperature so that we
                                          can later absorb heat reversibly, which would be impossible if the
                                          gas temperature were below 600 C.

We can now absorb heat at constant temperature (2  3). We choose to ex-

pand  the  gas   to  3  =  4  bar.  Thus      the  heat  transfer      is  23  =   -     2  ln    3  )  =

and the work is 23 = -23 = -398.2 kJ kg-1 (4/28, supplied by the gas).

    A promise has been kept: we had studied isothermal processes
in sections §4.4.4 and §5.4.4 precisely in order to be able to use them
here. . .

    The choice of the pressure 3 or its corresponding volume 3
is entirely arbitrary and does not affect any of the results obtained
here.

We proceed with the expansion of the gas, aiming to recover as much

work as possible and to reduce its temperature (3  4). The process

is adiabatic, therefore 34 =   = -12 = -359 J kg-1 and

34 = 0. Using equation 4/37 we obtain the final pressure: 4 =

    The work recovered from 3 to 4 is exactly opposite to the one
invested from 1 to 2. In a Carnot cycle, it is during the heat transfers
that the work leads to the production of a net work.

Finally, to bring the fluid back to its initial state (§6.2.1), we need to

cool the gas (4  1). This cooling is done at constant temperature, so

41    =  -    4   ln    1  )  =  -170.2       kJ  kg-1  (4/27,   supplied      by  the   gas)  and

                      ( 4

the work is 41 = -41 = +170.2 kJ kg-1 (4/28, received by the gas).

    It is a complex process for such an inglorious step: the rejection
of unusable heat! Not only do we need to proceed infinitely slowly
with significant volume fluctuations, but we also need to invest
considerable work to return to 1.

What is the cycle's balance? The compression phases required
compression = 12 + 41 = +529.2 kJ kg-1. In the expansion, we
recovered expansion = 23 + 34 = -757.2 kJ kg-1. The net work
is net = compression + expansion = -228 kJ kg-1 ; net =  net =
-22.8 kJ.

    We included the gas mass as late as possible. If we had studied a
cycle carried out continuously as depicted in figure 7.9, we would
only need to replace  with  to obtain the sought powers in watts.

    Compared to the recovered quantity, a substantial amount of
work must be invested, an undesirable characteristic that will be
quantified in chapter 10 (air-based power cycles) under the name of
work ratio (10/1).

The efficiency (6/4), finally, is engine                | net |        net         -228  = 57.3 %.

                          Although the cycle is already impracticable in reality, this meager
                     efficiency is the greatest that can physically be attained between
                     temperatures of 600 C and 100 C.

                          We could also have carried out these calculations using a liq-
                     uid/vapor instead of air: this would not have altered the final
                     results.

               7.3.5 Four stages or four strokes?

               Piston engines are often classified according to their mode of operation.
               Two-stroke engines perform one expansion per crankshaft revolution (every
               two piston movements); whereas four-stroke engines (figure 6.14) perform
               one expansion every two revolutions. The distinction lies in the mode of
               exhaust gas removal and its replacement with fresh air (see §6.4 p. 163).

               The transposition of the Carnot engine to reality, where eventually the fluid
               will need to be drained or transferred to a separate cylinder for cooling, can
               be done with either two or four strokes at the engineer's discretion. Thus,
               the Carnot cycle, although it is indeed made up of four stages, cannot be
               specifically associated with either of these two modes of operation.

               7.3.6 Carnot refrigerator

               By reversing the operating direction of the engine described above, we
               create a refrigerator, air conditioner, or heat pump of the same efficiency.
               The fluid then passes through the same states, but by following the reverse
               path (1-4-3-2-1) as shown in figure 7.11. The heat   > 0 is captured from
               the cold source, the work net > 0 is received by the machine, and the heat
                 < 0 is rejected by the machine towards the high-temperature source.

               This cycle allows obtaining the maximum efficiency (the "least bad" effi-
               ciency, since it is not infinite) of an air conditioning system or a heat pump
               operating between two given temperatures  and .

7.4 Thermodynamic Temperature Scale

7.4.1 In a nutshell, for the impatient student

Kelvin defines a temperature scale, called absolute temperature. Within a

Carnot engine, the ratio of the maximum temperature  and minimum

temperature  is defined to be equal to the ratio of the heat transfer rates,

that is:

                           |          |                   (7/4)
                           |          |
                           |  |
                           |   | 

by definition, in a Carnot engine,

where   is the heat transfer rate absorbed or rejected at high temperature

(  , at low temperature),

and where the temperatures are absolute (measured in K).

This equation 7/4 is a definition. Therefore, we can determine the tempera-
ture of a body without needing to use a specific fluid. Kelvin calibrates his
scale such that 0 C = 273.15 K.

The rest of this section §7.4 details the path that led to this definition. It is
intended for curious readers, and can be safely skimmed by busy students
or engineers.

7.4.2 What is a scale in physics?

In order to quantify a property in physics (for example, quantify "mass" or
"color"), three things must have been defined:

A zero point which defines what corresponds to zero property (zero mass,
      zero pressure, etc.);

A standard which serves as a reference gauge (for example, an object of
      one pound mass, one meter length);

A scale which allows to define the property between the zero point and
      the standard (for example, what is "twice as much" or "half as much"
      mass, light, etc.).

7.4.3 The limits of the Celsius and Fahrenheit
         thermometers

At the beginning of the 19th century, the two temperature scales that we use
today in everyday life, those of the Swedish Anders Celsius and the German
Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, were already in use. How are these scales defined
from a physical point of view?

· The zero point is rather easy to define (it is the point where bodies are
   completely frozen, unable to supply heat) but neither Fahrenheit nor
   Celsius could accurately locate it with certainty;

· The standards of Celsius and Fahrenheit differ significantly. Celsius chose
   the freezing point of pure water, Fahrenheit of saltwater, at atmospheric
   pressure, and each assigned it the relative "zero" graduation.

· However, the scales of Celsius and Fahrenheit are strictly identical. In fact,
   to measure temperatures around their standards, both scientists measured

                                          the contraction and expansion of a liquid in a tube. Between his relative
                                          zero point and the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure, Celsius
                                          drew 100 graduations; Fahrenheit, 212 graduations.
                                          As always, the history of thermodynamics is full of trivia: Celsius initially
                                          used a reversed scale, going from 100 at freezing to 0 at boiling! As for
                                          Fahrenheit, he likely chose 212 graduations in order to easily realign
                                          with his first graduation, calibrated on the freezing point of pure water
                                          (32) and the temperature of the human body (96), standards that were
                                          quite difficult to reproduce. We must not let ourselves be distracted: in
                                          a physical sense, these are only graduations and not a scale, which was
                                          already determined by using a liquid thermometer.

                                          The main problem with these two scales is that the temperature is well
                                          defined only in the range of existence of liquid thermometers. Whatever
                                          fluid is used (mercury, alcohol, water), it always ends up freezing or boiling
                                          at some point; and the graduations then no longer provide useful informa-
                                          tion. For example, Celsius could not define or even describe what allows
                                          recognizing a temperature of 1200 C.

                                          were to admit, for example, that 40 C could be "twice as much temperature"

                                          as 20 C, then what temperature would be twice as much as -10 C? This

                                          amounts  to  asking  the  question:     can  we  write  40 C  and  is  it  equal  to  40 C 80 C ?  As

                                          an inquisitive Scott would soon explain, the modern answer to this question

                                          is no.

                                          Scottish physicist and engineer William Thomson understood these limita-

                                          (for example, a thousand units, as shown in figure 7.12). A Carnot engine

                                          heat it receives; it is one-fourth when it rejects one fourth, and so on. In
                                          mathematical terms, Thomson proposed:1

                                                                               |       |                                        (7/4)

                                          1In fact, the records are again not that simple. Thomson initially proposed

                                          (in 1848 [9]) a scale in which      is proportional to the difference of temperatures;
                                                                          
                                                                          

                                          making it a logarithmic scale from our current perspective. He revised this with

                                          the help of James Prescott Joule to arrive at proposition 7/4 six years later [14].

By manipulating equations 7/4 and 7/1, we can reformulate Kelvin's defini-
tion as follows:

        Let there be a Carnot engine operating between two thermal
              reservoirs separated by one degree of temperature,

         and to which a quantity of heat   of one unit is supplied;

                        The temperature of the hot source
                 is defined as the inverse of the work produced.

The temperatures in this scale, called the absolute temperature scale or
thermodynamic temperature scale, are always positive and vary from zero
to infinity.

                                         7.4.5 Absolute zero and synchronization of scales

                                         Thomson therefore had a scale -- a method of defining a temperature as
                                         "twice as high".

                                         The zero of this scale corresponds well to the zero temperature point, since
                                         with the experiment in figure 7.12 one then has an "abyss" of zero tempera-

                                         William Thomson, already embarked on a stunning scientific career, was
                                         thirty years old when he published his temperature scale in 1854. In 1892,
                                         he was ennobled as First Baron Kelvin (he even ought to write The Right
                                         Honourable First Lord Kelvin of Largs, of the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian
                                         Order, and of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council!); it is under this
                                         name that he is known today. The Kelvin unit (K) was officially assigned to
                                         absolute temperature in 1948.

                                         Kelvin's work thus definitively separated the concept of temperature from
                                         real or imaginary fluids as previously done with the boiling point of water
                                         or the volume of perfect gases (§1.4.1 & §4.1.1); from here on it would be
                                         linked to a specific and quantitative physical experience.

                                                                               Example 7.2

                                         In order to illustrate the nature of the Kelvin scale, we carry out the
                                         following conceptual experiment. We have a Carnot engine and a
                                         standard: a solid titanium block that we know melts at 1668 C. We
                                         operate the machine between the standard temperature and an object
                                         whose temperature we want to measure. The machine absorbs 200 W
                                         and produces 45 W as work. What is the temperature of the object?

                                         The engine absorbs  in = 200 W, produces  net = -45 W; thus, it

                                         rejects  out = - in -  net = -155 W.

                                         By definition, the absolute temperatures are such that they correspond

                                         to heat transfers of a Carnot engine:            = |  | |  in | (7/4).  Therefore,

    Here we see that Kelvin used the Carnot engine as a thermome-
ter. In order to construct the scale, he carried out this experiment
between the two standards of 100 C and 0 C, and ensured they
were separated by one hundred intervals in absolute units.

7.5 Maximum Efficiency of Machines

The final definition of temperature in 7/4 allows us to return to thermal
machines and provide a simple answer to the questions raised by Carnot.

for a reversible thermal engine,

and where the temperatures are absolute (K).

This expression 7/6 is so remarkable that we must pause for a moment.

The answer to the question Carnot was asking, "what is the maximum
amount of work, in theory, that can be obtained from the combustion of a
given amount of coal?" is here - and it is astonishing: it depends only on
the high and low temperatures of the engine!

Two important remarks are necessary here.

· First, this efficiency is not 100 %. Yet, we are discussing machines here
  without friction or leaks, and with infinitely slow movements. By contrast,
  if we can ignore all practicalities, nothing is there to prevent an electric
  motor or an alternator from reaching an efficiency of 100 %.

Therefore, even before addressing the inevitable technological difficulties
associated with designing a real-world machine, the engine designer
is limited by the fundamental nature of heat in what he or she can
obtain from their machine. In the following chapters, we will address the
irreversibilities observed in real engines, which will further reduce the
efficiency calculated above.

· Secondly, this equation is a strong argument for increasing the combus-
  tion temperature in engines.

In practice, the low temperature  is limited by the ambient air tem-
perature. The only remaining parameter to increase the efficiency of
an ideal engine is the temperature  . This relationship explains the
surprising efforts made by engine designers to use high temperatures

196 Chapter 7

                 (and correspondingly, high pressures), even though real engines are far
                  from reversible.
               In summary, we can answer Carnot's question as follows: heat loss from
               the engine (wasted energy) is fundamentally inevitable. The losses are
               minimized, but not avoided, when the temperature at which the coal is
               burned is high, and the ambient temperature is low.

                                                     Example 7.3

                 The maximum achievable temperature in an engine is 600 C (1112 °F),
                 and the temperature at which exhaust gases are discharged is 100 C
                 (212 °F). What is the maximum efficiency achievable by the engine?

               In order to achieve the most efficient conversion, the engine must be

               reversible.  Thus, with equation 7/6: engine   = Carnot engine  =1-    =
                                                                                    

               1 - 100+273.15 = 57.3 %.

                     600+273.15

                    Make sure to use absolute temperatures here - at this point,
               using degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit in the calculation would be
               unforgivable.

                   The technological specifics of the engine (displacement, injection
               method, etc.) may possibly bring it close to 57.3 %, but will never
               bring it beyond that value.

                   We have indeed found the result obtained previously in exam-
               ple 7.1 p. 188, with a much simpler calculation.

               7.5.2 Efficiency of the Carnot refrigerator

               We saw in §6.3.3 that the efficiency of a refrigerator is the comparison
               between the heat extracted from the cold source (useful transfer,  in) and
               the work input (energy expenditure,  net). We had expressed this efficiency
               with the obscure expression:

               for all refrigerators.

               When it comes to a Carnot refrigerator, this efficiency is a function of
               temperature only (7/4) and thus we have:

                                                                   1                  (7/7)

               for a reversible refrigerator,
               where temperatures are absolute (K).

               The same remarks as above apply here: firstly, the efficiency of a refrigerator
               or an air conditioner never reaches infinity (an infinite cop refrigerator
               would operate without any work input). Secondly, this efficiency reduces
               when the refrigeration temperature  is reduced. In other words, when
               cooling an object with an ideal refrigerator, selecting a lower temperature is

more expensive, not merely because more heat needs to be extracted from
the object, but also because the efficiency of the extraction decreases.

                                      Example 7.4

  A refrigerator must bring the cold chamber to 5 °F (-15 C) in a room at
  77 °F (25 C). What is the maximum achievable efficiency?

The maximum efficiency would be achieved with a reversible re-

frigerator, allowing us to obtain, with equation 7/7, refrigerator =

Carnot refrigerator = 1 = 25+273.15 -1 1 = 6.45.
                          -1  -15+273.15

                          

    By carrying out the same calculation between temperatures of
365 °F and 437 °F (185 C and 225 C), we obtain an efficiency of 11.45:
this depends not only on the temperature difference but also on their
absolute values.

7.5.3 Efficiency of the Carnot heat pump

We saw in §6.3.4 that the efficiency (or Coefficient of Performance, cop) of a

heat pump is defined as the ratio of the heat supplied at high temperature

to the work input (6/8). We had then transformed this definition with the

expression:

                                             1         (6/9)

                              heat pump = |  |
                                          1-|    

                                                |
                                             |   |

for all heat pumps.

Using relation 7/4, when the machine is reversible, we can express this
efficiency solely based on the high and low temperatures:

                                                  1    (7/8)

                         Carnot heat pump =          

                                             1 - 

for a reversible heat pump,
where temperatures are absolute (K).

As with a refrigerator, the cop of a heat pump cannot be infinite: it is
bounded by the extreme temperatures reached in the cycle. The higher the
temperature at which heat out is delivered, and the lower the efficiency
that can be achieved.

                              Example 7.5

A heat pump is used to heat water to 120 C (248 °F) in an environment
at -5 C (23 °F). What is the maximum achievable efficiency?

The maximum efficiency would be achieved with a reversible heat pump,

allowing us to obtain, with equation 7/8, heat pump = Carnot heat pump =

 1 = 1- -5+273.15 1 = 3.15.

direct injection, which is made necessary by the

high temperatures reached during compression to

avoid premature combustion, is convincing. How-

ever, many details were lacking on how to handle

coal dust - the fuel chosen by Rudolf Diesel for its

abundance and low cost - so as to allow its direct

injection into the cylinders in practice.

Today, it is used wherever constraints of econ-
omy and durability take precedence over lightness
and responsiveness. In merchant ships, Diesel en-
gines several stories high operate on highly tur-
bocharged two-stroke cycles. In these engines ex-
ceeding 2000 tons and 18 000 hp (figure 7.16), the
cylinders move slowly on strokes of over two me-
ters, allowing for nearly isothermal combustion at
80 rpm and an efficiency exceeding 50 %.
At the other end of the spectrum, Diesels powering
the smallest utility vehicles benefit from numer-
ous systems to increase their responsiveness and
extend their power and torque ranges. In these
tiny machines of 80 hp rotating beyond 2000 rpm,
electronic control systems perform up to four fuel
injections at 2000 bar directly into the cylinder for
each combustion, optimizing combustion based on
the demanded power [46].
Ultimately, there is probably not a product in to-
day's industry that we manufacture whose materi-
als or components have not been extracted, assem-
bled, and transported without the contribution of
power from a Diesel engine. A great achievement
for a curious student!

Entropy is a property of bodies. We quantify its changes in order to measure the irreversibility
of energy transfers (always undesirable for the engineer). The total entropy always increases
during irreversible transfers: of work (with abrupt motion), of heat (with temperature gradient).

Introduction

We present here the most powerful and difficult concept of thermodynamics.
This chapter 8 (entropy) aims to approach it in the most pragmatic way
possible, starting from two questions:
· What does entropy represent?
· Why do physicists and engineers quantify its variations?

8.1 The Concept of Entropy

8.1.1 What is entropy used for?

At the very beginning of chapter 1 (fundamental concepts), we had seen that
we could conceptualize energy as "a quantity that never changes when
things evolve". Thus, we quantify energy to determine the limits of what is
possible: for example, we know that with 500 J, a stationary body of mass
10 kg cannot reach a speed greater than 10 m s-1 (eq. 1/5 p. 15).

However, our intuition and daily experience teach us that many transforma-
tions can only occur in one direction (figure 8.1). For example, there is as
much energy in a glass of water on the edge of a table as in the same glass
shattered with the water spilled on the floor. Yet we know, or more precisely,
we have a deep conviction, that it is possible for the glass to fall and break,
but impossible for the shards and water on the floor to spontaneously gather
together into a full glass on the table.
Thus, the quantification of energy is not entirely sufficient to determine
what is possible. We would also like to be able to predict absolutely and
quantitatively the direction in which energy can or cannot be transformed.

Entropy was conceived to address this question. By the end of this chap-
ter, we will have a tool to calculate the direction of a process, that is, to
mathematically predict which of two situations separated in time must have
occurred before the other.

Figure 8.1: We have the intuition and an inner conviction that these three photos
were taken in a very particular order. A calculation of the entropy in these three
situations, in which the energy is the same, allows us to determine this order by
associating a calculable quantity with our intuition.

                                                    process?

                                           In the vocabulary of thermodynamics, the concept of a "one-way change" is
                                           of course called irreversibility. We had already discussed irreversibility in
                                           section §2.4.3, where we had determined that it had two main causes:

                                           · The conversion of work into heat, through friction and turbulence;

                                           · The transfer of a quantity of heat between two bodies at different
                                             temperatures.

« For this purpose let us conceive         Irreversible processes in fluids invariably lead to states where the temper-
                                           ature, pressure, or volume are greater than they would have been with a

                                           amount of heat that one would need to remove from the body to bring it back
matter, reduced to its original condition  to its initial state reversibly. By subtracting to this amount the heat that
                                           was actually transferred, we obtain the heat that was somehow needlessly
by any reversible operation. We shall      created during the process. Moreover, the lower the temperature at which
                                           this heat is created, and the less of it can be transformed into work (§7.5.1).

                                           8.2 Definition

                                           8.2.1 Entropy is a property

                                           Let us begin by acknowledging the fact that entropy is a physical property,
                                           meaning something that characterizes the state of a system. Put another way:
                                           if we consider a portion of the universe at a given moment (a system), we
                                           find that this system has a mass, a volume, a temperature: these quantities
                                           describe its current state (which is why they are called state quantities).
                                           Entropy is one of these quantities.

                                           By contrast, we could say that heat, work, or electric current are not prop-
                                           erties: they are not quantities that describe an object, but rather a transfer
                                           between two objects (path quantities).

                                           Therefore, we will always think of entropy as the entropy "of something"
                                           (perhaps as we would say the color, the temperature "of something"). For
                                           example, we will say "this body has entropy" or "the entropy of this body
                                           is increasing/decreasing", and not "we are taking/giving entropy to this
                                           body". Rigorously, we say that entropy is an additive state quantity (see the
                                           appendices A3 and A4).

8.2.2 Definition

Entropy, noted , is a physical property.

· When a system undergoes a reversible process, its entropy varies such

that:

                                                                              (8/1)

                                  d 

                                       (  )rev.

   where the subscript rev. indicates the calculation is done along a reversible path;
           d is the infinitesimal change in entropy (J K-1);
            is the infinitesimal amount of (reversibly) supplied heat (J);

   and  is the temperature at which the heat transfer occurs (K).

When it transitions from a state A to a state B reversibly, the entropy of a
system therefore varies by an amount :

                                        B                                     (8/2)
                               = 

                                       A (  )rev.

where the subscript rev. indicates the calculation is done along a reversible path.

· When a system undergoes an irreversible process between A and B (as is
  the case for the majority of real processes), then a reversible path between
  these two states must be found and the integration 8/2 must be performed
  along it to calculate .

There is always a reversible way (in fact, there is even an infinity of
such ways) to make a system undergo a process between two arbitrary
states. For this, the work transfers must be carried out infinitely slowly
and the heat transfers must be carried out with infinitesimal temperature
differences.

We  must  be  careful  here:  if  one  integrates  the  quantity    along  a  process
                                                                  

where the temperature or pressure are not homogeneous (for example

during a rapid expansion, or in a body that has an internal temperature

gradient, see §2.4.3), then a result will be obtained which is lower than

the actual entropy change .

The si unit of entropy  is the J K-1 (joule per kelvin); and correspondingly,
the specific entropy  is defined as:

                                                                              (8/3)

                                       

                                         

where  is the considered mass (kg),
and  is its specific entropy (J K-1 kg-1).

In practice, the term "entropy" is often used even if it refers to specific en-
tropy; the symbol and context determine which variable is being referred to.

                                  Example 8.1

We extract 2000 J as heat, reversibly, from a mass of air while main-
taining its temperature constant at 30 C. How much does its entropy
change?

Since the process is reversible, we immediately apply equation 8/2:

https://thermodynamicsbook.com - CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen
212 Chapter 8

                =  -  = A (  )rev. B  = [ cst 1 AB ] = rev. [ cst 1 AB]rev. =

                    1     (-2000)  =  -6.6  J  K-1.
               30+273.15

                   We have already explored reversible processes at constant tem-
               perature (isothermal processes) in sections §4.4.4 p. 98 and §5.4.4
               p. 135. Here, the gas loses 2 kJ of heat and receives 2 kJ of work.

                    We do not know the value of entropy, but we know that it
               decreases by 7 joules per kelvin.

               The change in entropy should not be confused with the thermal

               capacity,                    =  1     (1/16),  where  we  divide  the  heat  by
                                      d         d

               the change in temperature. In this process, the thermal capacity is

               infinite since d = 0 K.

               Once the cooling is done, the air is allowed to expand suddenly: the
               expansion is irreversible. During this process, only 1000 J is supplied as
               heat and only 1000 J is recovered as work. At the end of the expansion,
               the gas is in the same state (same temperature, pressure, and internal
               energy) as at the very beginning of the experiment. What is the entropy
               change?

               This time, the process is not reversible. We should not consider the heat
               that is actually transferred, but the heat that would have been transferred
               in a reversible process leading to the same final state.
               Fortunately, we know that the gas returns from B to its initial state
               A; and from A to B the process was reversible. By performing the
               exact reverse process, we would reverse all heat and work transfers.
               Thus, along this imaginary process from B to A:  = A - B =
               B (  )rev. A  = - A (  )rev. B  = -(B - A) = +6.6 J K-1.

                        The  corresponds to the actual entropy change; but it is
                   calculated along an imaginary path.

                         Here we see that the heat actually transferred is not impor-
                   tant. It is the heat "that would have needed to be transferred" that
                   interests us.

                       Here, to simplify the exercise, the gas returns exactly to its initial
                   state A. If it ended up in a different state, we could still calculate the
                   entropy change, as we will learn to do in section §8.3.3.

                         In this irreversible process from B to A, it is the difference
                   between  A B (  )rev. = +6.6 J K-1 and  A B (  )actual = +1000 30+273.15 =
                   +3.3 J K-1 that will allow us to measure the irreversibility, in other
                  words, to show that with a transfer of 1 kJ we can go from B to A
                   but not from A to B.

8.2.3 Remarks

Let's add three remarks before moving on.

  1. Equation 8/2 does not allow for the calculation of the entropy of a
      system, but only its change during the process. In fact, we do not know
      how to calculate the entropy of an arbitrary body! We will see that this
      is not important for the engineer.

  2. Just like energy, entropy is invisible, odorless, intangible, and inaudible.
     There is no instrument capable of measuring it. We can only calculate
      its changes.

  3. Entropy changes can only be calculated along reversible processes,
     which is a very important limitation (no real process of interest to
      engineers is reversible). However, there are always multiple reversible
     ways, all equivalent, to reproduce the final state of an irreversible
      process.

8.3 Changes in Entropy

8.3.1 Analogy with volume

We have seen in chapter 2 (closed systems) that when the process is reversible,
the work done by a fluid as its volume changes is expressed by equation 2/14:

                                                                 B  (8/4)

                              AB = -   d

                                                               A

for a closed system when the volume changes are infinitely slow.

We could thus propose to define volume as being "what varies with pressure
when work is done, when the process is reversible", which would amount to
the following definition:

                                                                    (8/5)

                        d = -

                               (  )rev.

where the subscript rev. indicates the calculation is done along a reversible path.

or even the following, more approachable expression, which can be visual-
ized on a pressure-volume diagram (figure 8.2):

                                     B                              (8/6)
                         = - 

                                    A (  )rev.

where the subscript rev. indicates the calculation is done along a reversible path.

We can see that entropy is defined in a similar way, that is, as the variable 

that, during a reversible heat transfer, allows us to relate heat to temperature

with the relation 8/2:         B 

                         = 
                                 A (  )rev.

where the subscript rev. indicates the calculation is done along a reversible path.

               In this way, we are able to represent the processes on a temperature-entropy
               diagram. As shown in figure 8.3, the area under the curve of a process will
               represent the heat transferred in cases where the process is reversible; but
               in cases where the process is irreversible, it does not.

8.3.2 Temperature-entropy diagrams

After six chapters of loyal and dedicated service, the time has come to
honorably discharge the pressure-volume diagram, because it is time to
make use of our new tool: the temperature-entropy diagram. Even though
it is a bit more abstract, the  - diagram is very useful for describing what
happens inside machines because it is easy to plot and allows us to visualize
directly the irreversibility, which is always undesirable for the engineer.

When a fluid receives or supplies work in a reversible adiabatic manner,

then  =     =  0,  since  the   process  is  reversible  and    =  0.  A  reversible
          

adiabatic process thus occurs at constant entropy - it is iso-entropic, and we

call that isentropic. We will represent it as a vertical path on temperature-

entropy diagrams (figure 8.4).

Figure 8.4: elementary processes on temperature-entropy diagrams.

                                                                                      Diagrams CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

Transfer of heat, on the other hand, causes a change in the system's entropy
(positive when heat is received and negative when it is rejected). On  -
diagrams, we move from left to right while receiving heat or when there is
irreversibility in a compression or expansion.
When the system loses heat, its entropy decreases and we move from right
to left on the  - diagrams (figure 8.4).
Note also that when a fluid completes a cycle, the temperature at which
entropy decreases can be lower than the temperature at which it increases
(just like volume with pressure). The net heat transfer is then negative: the
fluid has absorbed heat which has been converted into work. If it were to
follow the reverse path, the fluid cycle would be a source of heat: this is the
operating principle of the refrigerator (§6.2.3).
When the processes are reversible, this net heat is represented by the area
enclosed by the path taken by the fluid on a temperature-entropy diagram
(figure 8.5).
Finally, we are pleased to note that the Carnot cycle, consisting of two
isothermal phases ( = constant) separated by two isentropic phases ( =
constant), benefits greatly from being represented on a temperature-entropy
diagram, as shown in figure 8.6.

                                     From now on, we wish to quantify the entropy change in fluids for any
                                     arbitrary process. For an ideal gas, the quantification of this change is
                                     surprisingly simple.
                                     For any process undergone by a fixed quantity of fluid, we have (2/2):

                                                                        12 + 12 =

                 What is the change in specific entropy of a mass of 2 kg (4.4 lb) of air,
                 when it is heated at constant pressure of 2 bar, from 50 °F to 212 °F (10 C
                 to 100 C)?

                 The process can be drawn qualitatively (that is, without showing
                 numerical values) on a temperature-entropy diagram as follows:

               In  order  to  calculate  ,  we  start  from  equation  8/11,     =    ln  B  -
                                                                                          A

                      B   and here B     =  A.         We thus have           =   ln B       =

                ln                                                                       
                   A                                                                      A

                            10+273,15

               The change in entropy is  =   = 2 × 277.4 = +554.8 J K-1.

                       It does not matter whether the process is reversible or not: we
                   just need to know the initial and final states.

                       We correctly state that "the entropy of the air increases" and not
                   that "entropy is given to it" (§8.2.1).

                                   Example 8.3
How much does the entropy of a mass of air of 0.5 kg change when it
is slowly cooled at constant temperature from 1 bar and 50 C to 5 bar?
How much heat needs to be removed for this?

The process can be drawn qualitatively on a temperature-entropy
diagram as follows:

In  order  to  quantify     we  start  from  equation  8/11,       =    ln        -
                                                                            

         and here        =  .  We thus have   =                    =  287  ln  5  =
                                                                               1

-461.9 J K-1 kg-1.

The change in entropy is  =   = 0.5 × -461.9 = -231 J K-1.

Since the process is reversible, the heat removed is obtained using

                                B             B
equation 8/7 : AB = A  d = cst. A d = cst. = (50 +

273, 15) × -231 = -74.6 kJ.

        We already knew how to quantify AB without using entropy,
    using equations 4/27 and 4/28.

                                   Example 8.4

How much does the temperature of air change when adiabatically and
reversibly expanded from 30 bar and 600 K down to 1 bar?

                       Using the reasoning "adiabatic reversible = isentropic" did not
                   actually bring us anything we did not already know here, as the
                   ideal gas model is already extremely simple and powerful. This will
                   not be the case with liquids/vapors.

               8.3.4 Entropy changes of a liquid/vapor mixture

               For a liquid/vapor mixture, the changes of  cannot be predicted with a
               calculation because there is no simple mathematical model to describe
               temperature as a function of other properties. The saturation curve and the
               path of process at constant pressure are represented in figure 8.8; this figure
               closely resembles the temperature-volume diagram we plotted in figure 5.7.

               In order to quantify changes in entropy, we we will proceed exactly as we
               did with internal energy  in chapter 5 (liquids and vapors): by tabulating
               values for . Since there is no way to measure  directly, all the tabulated
               values of entropy are relative to a reference point for which  is arbitrarily
               set to 0 J K-1 kg-1; in our case, it is the triple point of water. This does not
               matter for our calculations, since we are only interested in the changes of
               entropy.

Table 8.1: An extract from Steam Table 1 (see pp. 306-309). Values for
entropy can be read in the last column, and its values are interpolated like
the other properties.

Within the saturation curve, in other words, when a mix of phases is present,

we interpolate values for entropy between those of  (saturated liquid) and

 (saturated vapor) using the concept of dryness fraction, exactly as with

equation 5/5:

                                   =  +                                (8/14)

How much does the entropy of water change when it goes from a state
at 240 C and 6 bar, to 130 C with an internal energy of 1000 kJ kg-1?

A quick look at the steam tables allows us to draw the process qualita-

tively on a temperature-entropy diagram as shown below.

We read A by interpolation in Steam Table 1 at 0.6 MPa between 200 C

and  300 C:    A  =   6.9683  +   40   ×  (7.374  -  6.9683)  =  7.1306 kJ K-1 kg-1.
                                  100

Upon arrival, the water is in a liquid-vapor mixture (because B <

 130 C), so we read from Steam Table 2 (5/5): B = B-  = 1000-546.1 =  1993.5

222 Chapter 8

               0.228; thus with equation 8/14 we can calculate the entropy: B =
                + B  = 1.6346 + 0.228 × 5.3918 = 2.8623 kJ K-1 kg-1.

               We see that the entropy has decreased:  = B - A =
               -4.268 kJ K-1 kg-1.

                       We do not know what process took place. The less reversible it
                  was, and the more heat had to be removed from the steam in order
                   to bring it from A to B.

                                                  Example 8.6
               We slowly heat 2 kg (4.4 lb) of saturated liquid water at 300 C, main-
               taining its temperature constant, until the volume reaches 2 m3
               (440 imp gal). How much heat needs to be added for this?

               tively on a temperature-entropy diagram as follows:

               Since the process is reversible, we can calculate AB by integrating

               the term  d between A and B.

               We read A in Steam Table 2: A = 300 C = 3.2552 kJ kg-1.

               At the end, the specific volume is B  =  B  =          2  =  1 m3 kg-1;
                                                                      2

               in order to obtain B we must interpolate between two blocks of

               Steam Table 1 (between 0.2 MPa and 0.4 MPa at 300 C). Let  

               300 C & 0.4 MPa-300 C & 0.2 MPa B-300 = 0.654 89-1.3162 = 0.4781 C & 0.2 MPa 1-1.3162 and correspond-
               ingly, B = 300 C & 0.2 MPa + (300 C & 0.4 MPa - 300 C & 0.2 MPa) =

               7.8941 +0.4781(7.5677 - 7.8941 ) = 7.738 kJ K-1 kg-1.

                                                                                                        2

We can finally calculate AB with equation 8/8: AB = 1  d =
   = 2 × (300 + 273.15) × (7.738 - 3.2552) = +5.139 kJ.

        This somewhat laborious calculation may not be spectacular, but
    it is important to realize that without the use of entropy, we had no
    way to quantify AB without conducting an experiment. We had
    gotten stuck on this issue in example 5.12 page 137.

                                    Example 8.7

In a turbine, steam undergoes a reversible adiabatic (isentropic) expan-
sion. The steam enters at 40 bar and 500 C; it is expanded to 0.5 bar.
What is the specific power output?

A final look at the steam tables allows us to draw the process qualita-
tively on a temperature-entropy diagram as follows:

Here AB = 0 because the turbine is adiabatic, and we are looking for
AB = . Therefore, we need to find a way to quantify B.

In A, we read from Steam Table 1, at 4 MPa: A = 3446 kJ kg-1 and
A = 7.0922 kJ K-1 kg-1.

At B, we know that B = A because the process is isentropic; this infor-
mation will allow us to calculate B. Using Steam Table 3 at 0.05 MPa,
with equation 8/14, we obtain B = B-  = 7.0922-1.0912 = 0.923  6.5018 . Us-
ing the dryness fraction, we can simply calculate the enthalpy (equa-
tion 5/4): B =  + B  = 340.5 + 0.923 × 2304.7 = 2467.7 kJ kg-1.

The specific power of the turbine is therefore AB =  =
-978.3 kJ kg-1.

The calculation we have just carried out is extremely useful

for engineers. The idea that entropy remains constant during a

reversible adiabatic process allows us - at last! - to predict the state

of a liquid-vapor mixture at the outlet of a compressor or turbine.

Until now, this could be done with an ideal gas (and the cumbersome

relationships  like  1  =  ...),  but  not  for  a  liquid/vapor  mixture.

                                           Here we come to the central concept that has opened the doors of physics
                                           to thermodynamics. Based on the quantifications of entropy changes, we
                                           are able to describe the direction of processes, that is, to prove for example
                                           that a state B comes after a state A.

                                           If we consider only a small amount of time, the temperature of body A is

                                           uniform, and its heat loss occurs reversibly. Thus, the entropy change of A

                                           is:

                                           The temperature of body B is also uniform: the process there is also
                                           internally reversible, and the change of its entropy is:

                                           However, the temperature of the entire system [A+B] is not uniform at all:

                                           the process there is not internally reversible. Even if the system receives no

                                           heat from the external surroundings, it does not have "a" temperature, and

                                                                                                  2

                                           The entropy change of system [A+B] is the sum of those of its components,

Since A > B, this change is positive and non-zero; entropy has been created
during the irreversible heat transfer. The irreversibility occurs neither
in cup A nor in bottle B, but at the thin material boundary separating
them. The process can be represented rather convincingly on a  - diagram
(figure 8.10).

(representing the heat quantity ), but the sum of the two entropies increases.

8.4.2 Irreversibilities during adiabatic
         compressions and expansions

Another type of process leads to irreversibilities, and thus to an increase in
total entropy: it is the transfer of work in fluids.

In practice, any expansion or compression occurs in the presence of internal
irreversibilities. Since the duration of the process is finite (unlike Carnot's
idealized processes), there will necessarily be pressure imbalances within
the fluid. These imbalances lead to internal turbulence, which causes the
conversion of mechanical energy into internal energy through friction and
heat.

                                          Thus, a real adiabatic compression causes the fluid to reach a higher tem-
                                          perature than a reversible adiabatic compression (figure 8.11): part of the
                                          supplied work is completely converted into heat due to internal friction.
                                          Accordingly, during a real adiabatic expansion, the temperature decreases
                                          less than during a reversible adiabatic expansion. Each time, entropy is
                                          increased even though no heat transfer  has occurred.

                                          During a work transfer any irreversibility results in a higher final tem-

                                                perature than it could have been (see §2.4.3). Achieving the same final

                                                increase in total entropy.

                                          Thus, we can translate the second law as follows:

used), but this will necessarily be at the expense of an increase at least as
large in the entropy of another system.

We could also say, in the same way that we described energy as "a quantity
that does not change during transformations" (§1.1.1), that entropy is con-
ceptualized as "a quantity that always increases during transformations."
This is the indicator we were looking for in §8.1.1 to determine the direction
of processes.

8.4.4 Predicting the direction of processes

In order to demonstrate that a system can only go from state A to state B, in
other words, that the process is irreversible, we need to proceed as follows:

1. We need to find a reversible path A  B, namely, a process to go from A
   to B while keeping pressure and temperature internally homogeneous
   even if they vary;

2. Along this reversible path, we calculate  (that is, we carry out the
   integral   for this path).

3. We compare the integral   along the reversible path with the
   integral for the real path.

There are three possibilities:

· If the two integrals are equal, then the real process is reversible: it can
  take place in both directions.

· If  (  )   real path               rev.  , then the real process is irreversible. It

                        <  ( )

can only take place from A to B.

· If  (  )   real path                rev.  , then the described "real" process is

                        >  ( )

impossible. It can only take place in the reverse direction (B  A).

Thus, we can mathematically determine the direction of time, at least for
some simple cases - a subtlety that one would not expect from engineers
concerned about their fuel consumption!

                                     Example 8.8

A mass of air undergoes a process without any heat exchange. There
are two states:
· State X at 5 bar and 100 C (72.5 psi and 212 °F);
· State Y at 1 bar and 5 C (14.5 psi and 41 °F).
In which direction (X  Y or Y  X) can the process take place?

Let's suggest the direction X  Y and check if it is physically possible.

The entropy change is equal to the integral X (  ) Y  . Using equa-

               On the other hand, the integral X (  ) Y   real path  is equal to zero because

               in reality there was no heat transfer ( = 0).

               Therefore, we have  > X (  ) Y    real path  and the process is irreversible.

               If we wanted to reverse the process, from Y to X, we would have to

               remove heat.

               The process can be drawn qualitatively on a temperature-entropy
               diagram as follows:

                                                  Example 8.9

               Water undergoes a process during which 1 MJ kg-1 of heat is added
               to it at while its temperature is fixed at 130 C (266 °F). There are two
               states, one at the beginning and the other at the end:
               · State X as liquid at 130 C and saturated;
               · State Y as vapor at 170 C (338 °F) and saturated.
               In which direction (X  Y or Y  X) can the process take place?

               Let's consider the direction X  Y and verify if it is physically possible.

               We read the values of entropy in Steam Table 2: X = 130 C =

               1.6346 kJ K-1 kg-1 and  =  170 C = 6.665 kJ K-1 kg-1.
               Thus,  =  Y  X (  ) = +5.03 kJ K-1 kg-1 rev. .

               Separately, we can calculate the integral X (  ) Y    real path  because we

               know that heat was supplied when the temperature was fixed at

               130 C. Thus X (  ) Y   real path  = 1 XY ()real path =  = 170+273,15 = XY 1×106

               +2.26 kJ K-1 kg-1.

Here, we have  > X (  ) Y   real path  and the process is irreversible. If

we wanted to go back from Y to X, we would need to cool the water by

removing a quantity necessarily greater than 1 MJ kg-1.

8.5 Entropy, Time, and the Universe

8.5.1 Entropy for the engineer

We have seen that entropy, just like energy, is a concept which was designed
in order to back with calculations an intuition that we have about the world:
quantifying their changes enables us to determine the transformations that
are possible. It is therefore fundamentally a concept for physicists. For
engineers, entropy is:

· "what does not change when compressing and expanding fluids ideally".
   Thus, quantifying  allows us to quantify the properties that a fluid
   should have at the outlet of a compressor or a turbine;

· "what does not change when transferring heat within a system ideally".
   Thus, quantifying  allows us to calculate the irreversibility that occurs
   during heat transfers.

Whenever we produce an increase in overall entropy, we have to proceed
ultimately to an unwanted heat rejection. Thus, these quantifications of 
allow us to measure the quality of expansions, compressions, cooling, and
heating that we carry out with fluids in our machines.

8.5.2 Context: the direction of time

The examples we have studied in this chapter to determine the direction of

processes are very academic, however the approach remains valid for any

process: a stone thrown into a pond, a food plate breaking when it falls, etc.

If we go back to the three photos in figure 8.1, we could determine their

order by finding the initial and final states of the water around the diver,

and comparing  with the integral            real path  carried out during the

                                       ( )

entry into the water.

This desire to find the absolute order in which states succeed one another, in
other words, the direction of time, led the German physicist Rudolf Clausius
to propose the concept of entropy in 1865 in a masterly publication -- Über
verschiedene für die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der

mechanischen Wärmetheorie [17, 18, 19]. Concluding a decade of work

                                           After Clausius, the development of thermodynamics is no longer of great
                                           interest to engineers, but physicists may still be longing for more. Indeed,
                                           although we had described the irreversibility phenomenon, we had not yet
                                           explained its origin within bodies made up of particles whose movements
                                           (an incessant buzzing of collisions, based on attractive and repulsive forces),
                                           themselves, are perfectly reversible.

                                           It would take only ten years for the answer to be formalized: in 1875,

                                           Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann proposed a microscopic definition of

                                           entropy:

                                                                            ln                                      (8/17)

                                           to its state,

heart of the conflict; Thompson chose the Loyalist
side and became a secret agent for the British. At
the time of the Declaration of Independence of the
United States of America in 1776, cautiously, he left
for England.

He then undertook research on projectiles and
joined the Royal Society in 1779. He nevertheless re-
turned to America in 1782 still to fight on the British
side, but peace was declared the following year. He
was ennobled as Baron Rumford by King George iii
in reward for his services. He then became an advi-
sor to the Elector of Bavaria, and later the Minister
of War. During his 14 years spent in Bavaria, he
reformed the army, established assistance for the
needy, and created the famous Englischer Garten
in Munich. He then returned to England, and fi-
nally settled in France in 1805 where he had a
-disastrous- marriage with Marie Lavoisier, the
widow of the chemist who was guillotined during
the French Revolution.

During his adventurous life, he managed to make at
least two important discoveries. Within the frame-
work of the caloric theory, he attempted to weigh
heat by measuring the weight of bodies at different
temperatures. From these unsuccessful attempts, he
concluded that heat has no weight. Later, during his
tenure as Minister of War, he oversaw the drilling of
cannons and observed in 1798 that the drilling pro-
cess heated the barrels to the point of boiling water.
He realized that the amount of heat released was
not limited by the quantity of matter containing it.
From this, he deduced that the heat was not stored
in the material but rather produced by the work
of the horses driving the drill--a foreshadowing of
Joule's first law.

                                   1              1

Finally, we assume that the efficiencies of thermal

8.1 Knowledge Recap Questions

In order to tackle problems on such a substantial topic, it
is necessary to first master the basics!

  1. How is the change in the entropy of a body calcu-
      lated during any real process?

  2. Can the entropy of a body ever be reduced?
  3. What is the difference between specific entropy and

      thermal capacity (both have the same units!)?
  4. What would figure 8.10 p. 225 look like if the heat

      transfer was continued beyond an infinitesimal

Introduction

Now that we have acquired solid theoretical concepts, we can take a closer
look at the thermodynamic cycles used in industry. This chapter 9 (steam
power cycles) aims to answer two questions:
· Why and how are steam engines used today?
· Why are we moving away from ideal cycles and how do we quantify

   these compromises?

                                                                                1°. It offers, relative to water vapor,

and transport. All these factors justify the development of steam power
plants with several gigawatts of electrical power (1 GW = 109 W), making
them the most powerful thermal engines in the world.

               9.2 Engine Evaluation Criteria

               Several parameters are taken into account in the evaluation of the perfor-
               mance and value of steam engines.

               9.2.1 Thermal efficiency and overall efficiency

               The parameter that we have learned to quantify so far is of course the

               thermal  efficiency  of  the  engine  engine    |  net  |  (6/4)  that  we  always  strive
                                                               |       |

                                                               | in |

               to maximize towards its theoretical maximum, Carnot engine = 1 - min. max. (7/6).

               However, it is important not to forget that the conversion of heat into work

               is just one of the many operations involved in electricity production:

               · Fuel preparation (refinement and heating of oil, coal pulverization, sepa-
                 ration of oil sands) itself may require energy, which we can evaluate with
                 an efficiency preparation;

               · In the boiler, the energy transfer from the heat source to the water can be
                 incomplete (with some heat potentially being rejected with the exhaust
                 gases), which we can evaluate with an efficiency boiler;

               · The transmission of mechanical energy from the turbine to the generator,
                 possibly using a gearbox, incurs friction losses that we evaluate with an
                 efficiency transmission;

               · The transformation of shaft power into electrical power also involves
                 losses resulting in the production of heat, which we evaluate with an
                 efficiency generator.

               Thus, the overall efficiency overall of electricity production at the output
               of the power plant, which compares the electrical energy produced to the
               actual heat spent to generate it (in other words, its energy cost), is the
               product of all these efficiencies:

                        overall  preparation boiler engine transmission generator                  (9/1)

               Engineers are expected to work on increasing the overall efficiency rather
               than just engine. It may be acceptable to intentionally reduce thermal
               efficiency if it allows, for example, an increase in boiler (with better heat
               extraction from the flue gases) or generator (with an increase in turbine
               speed).

               9.2.2 Power and specific consumption

               The efficiency of an engine is not the only parameter we consider in the
               economic evaluation of its use: the costs associated with its maintenance
               or supervision of its operation, and of course the acquisition costs, are also
               crucial. These expenses can only be calculated if we delve into technological
               details that go beyond the scope of this book.

               Despite this, we can already crudely assess the size and acquisition cost of
               an engine by calculating its specific net power net. In order to be compact,
               it is indeed desirable for an engine to generate a large net power for a given
               mass flow rate: it may even be desirable to compromise thermal efficiency
               for this purpose.

9.2.3 Environmental impact

The production of heat in thermodynamic engines is at the heart of the
major ecological challenges of our century. A comprehensive study goes
beyond the scope of this book, so we will only note that the environmental
impact can be divided into three main categories:

· Pollution by emission of harmful particles from combustion, particularly
   concerning the combustion of solids (especially coal as well as household
   and agricultural waste). With a filtering system, these emissions can
   generally be reduced to a very low level;

· Emission of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, an inevitable product of
   the combustion of hydrocarbons which is now known to be a major
   contributor to global climate change. These emissions concern all heat
   sources based on combustion;

· Emission of radioactive waste, which concerns nuclear heat sources.
   These wastes are in small quantities but remain harmful for time periods
   counted in millennia.

Thus, apart from a few rarely-available heat sources (geothermal or solar
concentration), thermodynamic engines are always powered by sources with
major disadvantages. However, they are still the only ones that provide us
with abundant energy in mechanical and electrical form, and this abundance
is tightly coupled with the economic and societal progress our civilization
made in the last two centuries. It is up to responsible engineers and citizens
to judiciously assess their flaws and qualities.

9.3 Components of Steam Power Plants

Before studying the construction of steam thermodynamic cycles, we briefly
review the operation mode of the most common components of power
plants.

9.3.1 Calculation of component powers

All steam systems used today operate with a continuous flow rate. Also, in
these machines, the changes in the steam's kinetic and potential energy are
small compared to heat and work transfers. We will therefore exclusively
use the concepts covered in chapter 3 (open systems) and we will be able

https://thermodynamicsbook.com - CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen
244 Chapter 9

               to relate the powers and the thermodynamic state of the steam using the

               simple equation:

                                 12 + 12 =                                        (3/15)

               for all processes (reversible or not) in a steady-flow open system ( = const.),
               when changes in mechanical energy are neglected.

               From our study of chapter 3, we recall that when the process is reversible,
               the work AB between two points A and B is expressed as an integral:

                                                                               B  (3/22)

                                               AB =   d

                                                                             A

               in an open system,
               and when the process is reversible.

               Generally, for equipment operating with steady flow, the heat transfers and
               work transfers are separated in space. This greatly reduces the complexity
               of the machines.

               · The supply or extraction of heat preferably occurs without work transfer,
                 that is, at constant pressure (isobaric processes). Ideally, these transfers
                 occur at constant temperature (isothermal processes).

               · The supply or extraction of work, which requires a change in pressure
                 and the movement of mechanical parts within the fluid, preferably occurs
                 without heat transfer (adiabatic processes). Ideally, these transfers occur
                 without an increase in entropy (isentropic processes).

               9.3.2 Compressors and pumps

               Compressing a fluid without heat transfer in a steady flow requires a work

               transfer:

                                  compression =  (2 - 1)                          (9/3)

               In general, the more the volume of a fluid varies during compression, and the
               more complex the geometry and operation of the compressor. Two-phase
               mixtures are especially challenging because of the starkly differing behavior
               of the two fluids, and engineers generally prefer to compress either dry
               steam or subcooled liquid.

               Since the specific volume of liquid water is about a thousand times smaller
               than that of water vapor, a brief rereading of equation 3/22 leads us to prefer
               the compression of liquids to that of gases. This is why the compression
               phases in industrial plants are always done in the liquid state, using pumps
               (figures 9.1 and 9.2). These are more compact and geometrically simple
               compared to gas compressors.

The specific power required to compress a fluid flow from a pressure A to
a pressure B, in a reversible process, is expressed from the relation 3/22.
Since the specific volume  of pure saturated liquid water (approximately
 = 1 × 10-3 m3 kg-1) varies very little with its pressure, we can write:

                                B  (9/4)

liquid pump    d = (B - A)

                             A

in the case of an approximately reversible pump operating with liquid
     water.

                                   Example 9.1

In a power plant, a pump is fed with a mass flow of 35 kg s-1 (77.2 lb/s)
of liquid saturated water at 0.5 bar (7.25 psi). The water is compressed
in an approximately isentropic manner until 40 bar (580.2 psi. What is
the required power?

The process can be drawn qualitatively on a temperature-entropy
diagram as shown below.

In Steam Table 3 at 0.05 MPa we read the inlet enthalpy A =
0.05 MPa = 340.5 kJ kg-1. The specific volume will remain almost
constant in the pump, at the value A = 0.05 MPa = 0.001 03 m3 kg-1.

Using equation 9/4 we calculate  pump   (B - A) = 35 ×
0.001 03(40 × 105 - 0.5 × 105) = +142.4 kW.

                    Since the compression is assumed to be isentropic, we could
               also start from the fact that A = B to obtain B by interpolation
               in Steam Table 1 and thus calculate the power of the pump. A
               calculation of B using this method allows us to see that the specific
               volume varies imperceptibly (less than 0.1 %) during this process.

               Since we have calculated the pump power, we are able to cal-

                pump                                         -1

               the water at the boiler inlet, a very useful information for later

               calculating the boiler power.

               9.3.3 Boiler

               In steam power plants, heat inputs occur at constant pressure. The water in
               the thermodynamic cycle is heated by contact with another pipeline: air in
               the case of combustion plants (waste, coal, gas), or water from a secondary
               circuit in the case of nuclear power plants (where the secondary circuit is
               used to avoid passing the high-pressure water from the thermodynamic
               cycle directly through the reactor core).

               The wondrous behavior of fluids when they change phase works to our
               advantage here: in two-phase mixtures, a process at constant pressure
               also occurs at constant temperature (§5.2.2), allowing us to approach the
               conditions prescribed by Carnot without the need for any moving parts.

               Because it operates at high pressure (beyond 60 bar in modern power plants)
               and is the scene of significant heat transfer and temperature gradients, the
               boiler is an expensive and heavy component (figures 9.3 and 9.4), even
               though its operating principle is simple.

               When the heat in the power plant comes from combustion, the thermal

               energy of the gases can only be transferred to the water in the circuit

               when the temperature of the water is lower. Thus, the higher the minimum

               temperature of the water, and the greater the amount of heat lost above the

               boiler. The efficiency boiler =    water      of a high-performance gas boiler is
                                                
                                                heat source
               typically around 80 %.

               Since no work is supplied in the boiler, the power  boiler supplied to the
               water by the boiler is expressed as:

                                        boiler =  (2 - 1)        (9/5)

               The difference in density between the two phases in the boiler makes it
               difficult to superheat the steam in the presence of liquid (the liquid, being

Figure 9.4: Schematic representation of a fire-tube boiler. Water enters in the liquid
state on the left and exits at the top right in the form of saturated steam. In fire-tube
boilers, the gas pipes pass through the heat exchanger filled with water. In more recent
water-tube boilers, it is the water pipes that pass through the heat exchanger filled
with hot gases. The latter technique is not detailed in this book, but its thermodynamic
working principle is identical.

                                                                              Diagram CC-by-sa by Olivier Cleynen

denser and therefore at the bottom of the boiler, is more likely to absorb
heat at high temperature). We will therefore always consider that the water
is in the form of saturated vapor (index  ) at the outlet of the boiler.

9.3.4 Turbine

The turbine (figures 9.5 and 9.6) is the centerpiece of any steam power plant.
Several tens of meters long in modern power plants, it is carefully balanced,
installed in its casing, and, if given adequate attention (minimization of
temperature gradients, advanced lubrication), can deliver mechanical power
for several decades without any interruption.

The efficiency of a turbine is measured by comparing its power with that of
an ideal turbine (a turbine that would be isentropic). We call this parameter
the isentropic efficiency T:

         actual turbine    (9/6)
T 

       isentropic turbine

where  actual turbine is the actual power supplied by the turbine,
and  isentropic turbine is the power of an isentropic turbine operating with the
same mass flow rate and between the same pressures.

               The actual power is expressed in terms of the properties of the fluid at the
               inlet and outlet of the turbine:

                actual turbine =  (2 actual - 1) =  T (2 - 1)  (9/7)

               We use equation 9/7 to predict the state of the steam at the outlet of any
               turbine whose power and isentropic efficiency are known.

               An important parameter that must be monitored is the dryness fraction of
               the water, especially in the final stages. Indeed, as we have already seen
               in section §5.4.5 p. 138, the isentropic curves always end up crossing the
               saturation curve: in an isentropic expansion, the steam always ends up
               condensing. The liquid droplets, much denser than the steam surrounding
               them, then violently impact the blades, causing erosion. The thermodynamic
               engineer will therefore ensure to maintain a high dryness fraction, typically
               not dropping below 95 %.

                                   Example 9.2
A turbine with an isentropic efficiency of 85 % receives 35 kg s-1 of
water at 40 bar and 600 C. It expands the water to 0.5 bar. What is the
delivered power?

The process can be drawn qualitatively on a temperature-entropy
diagram as follows:

We start by imagining that we are equipped -a thermodynamicist's
irrepressible dream!- with an isentropic turbine between these same
pressures. In Steam Table 1 at 4 MPa, we read A = 3674.9 kJ kg-1 and
A = 7.3705 kJ K-1 kg-1. The steam at the outlet of this hypothetical
turbine (at B') has the same entropy: B = A, and we observe that
B <  0.05 MPa: the water is partially condensed. The calculation of the
dryness fraction (§5.3.3) allows us to calculate the value of its enthalpy:
B = 0.05 MPa +  0.05 MPa  0.05 MPa = 2566.3 kJ kg B -0.05 MPa -1.

We can now return to the the painful reality: the actual turbine delivers
only 85 % of the power of this hypothetical turbine, so  real turbine =
 T (B -A) = 35×0.85×(2566.3×103 -3674.9×103) = -32 980 kW =
-32.98 MW.

Equation 9/7 allows us to calculate the enthalpy B actually ob-

tained  at  the  outlet  of  the  turbine:  B  =   turbine  + A  =  2732.6 kJ kg-1,
                                                     

which is very useful for later calculating the power of the condenser.

A glance at Steam Table 2 shows us that B >  0.05 MPa: the steam

is dry throughout its expansion.

    The 15 % of missing power in the mechanical shaft of the turbine
is transferred as heat (through turbulence) to the water during its
expansion in the turbine.

    The power of the turbine is two hundred times greater than the
power supplied to the pump in example 9.1 on page 245 between
these same pressures.

               9.3.5 Condenser

               The condenser (figures 9.7, 9.8 and 9.9), the least glorious component of the
               power plant, is responsible for rejecting all the heat that the engineer no
               longer knows how to use (§7.2). The water is always cooled at constant
               pressure, which does not require any moving parts.

               Figure 9.7: Schematic representation of a condenser. Water from the thermodynamic
               cycle enters at the top, in a state close to saturated vapor. It exits at the bottom in
               the liquid state. The heat extraction is usually ensured by a secondary water circuit
               (illustrated in dark blue) which is in contact with the atmosphere.

                                                                                                 Diagram CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen

               Technologically, the condenser is a simple element: the steam pipeline is
               simply brought into contact with a low-temperature circuit. Usually, this
               cooling circuit consists of external water from a river or the sea, which is
               then itself cooled by evaporation in the large towers seen around power
               plants. Using a secondary cooling circuit has two benefits. Firstly, the
               pressure in the condenser can be lowered to a level lower than atmospheric
               pressure, thereby reducing the minimum temperature of the cycle. Secondly,
               the water from the thermodynamic cycle, purified at considerable effort, is
               not lost to the atmosphere.
               Since the pressure of the steam inside the condenser is often very low (down
               to 0.1 bar or 0.15 psi) so as to reduce the minimum temperature of the power
               plant cycle, care must be taken to ensure the tightness of the condenser to
               prevent external air or water from entering the main circuit.

9.4 Steam Engine Cycles

9.4.1 The Carnot cycle

Since the Carnot cycle which we studied in §7.3 serves as a reference in
the design of engines, we start our study with it. The temperature of a
liquid-vapor mixture remains constant when heated at constant pressure,
so achieving isothermal heat transfers (an important characteristic of the
Carnot cycle) is relatively easy with steam. A steam engine based on a
Carnot cycle is schematized in figures 9.10 and 9.11.
The efficiency of the Carnot engine cycle (7/6) is only reached if the turbine
and compressor operate isentropically. In practice, as we have seen, the
power of the turbine is always lower, and that of the compressor always
higher, than if they were isentropic.

                                     ties:
                                      · Compressing a two-phase mixture is challenging (§9.3.2 p. 244);

· In the condenser, it is difficult to stop condensation at a specific point
  (point A in figures 9.10 and 9.11 above), where the dryness fraction is
   close but not equal to zero).

In 1859, English engineer William Rankine proposed a modification of the
cycle by continuing the condensation until saturation and by compressing
the water only in the liquid state. A machine based on this cycle is described
in figures 9.12 and 9.13.

Figure 9.12: Diagram of a steam power plant operating on a Rankine cycle. The water
at the outlet of the condenser is in the form of saturated liquid; it enters the boiler at a
lower temperature.

                                                                                  Diagram CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen

The Rankine cycle thus uses a liquid water pump instead of a compressor
dealing with a liquid-vapor mixture. Technologically, a pump is simpler to
design, manufacture, and operate than a compressor. Another advantage is
that compressing a liquid is several tens of times more energy-efficient than
compressing a mixture (§9.3.2).

This energy saving, however, is not without consequence: at the outlet
of the pump (point B), the water is at a much lower temperature than it
was at the outlet of the compressor in figure 9.10. It is the boiler that will
have to return the water to the state of saturated liquid. In other words, a
considerable additional expenditure of heat must be supplied to compensate
for the decrease in compression power.

It can be noticed that a significant part of the heat supplied by the boiler
(that is, boiler = C - B) is no longer supplied at the maximum tempera-
ture of the cycle. We saw in chapters 7 and 8 that supplying heat at low
temperature always results in a lower efficiency.

                                     However, in practice, this heat input can make it possible to exploit low-
                                     temperature heat sources, such as exhaust gases that were previously dis-
                                     charged above the boiler. Thus, in some cases, the drop in thermodynamic
                                     efficiency (engine) can be compensated by an increase in the boiler efficiency
                                     (boiler), which can extract more energy from the fuel to transfer it to the
                                     steam.
                                     Rankine thus deliberately deviated from the Carnot cycle and, in doing so,
                                     reduced the thermodynamic efficiency (although this decrease can often be
                                     offset by an increase in boiler efficiency). On the other hand, by eliminating
                                     the compressor, his modification greatly reduces the size and complexity of
                                     the machine.

                            9.4.3 Superheating

                                     In order to reduce the specific steam consumption (ssc, see §9.2.2 p. 242) of
                                     a power plant, it is desirable to increase the power delivered by the turbine
                                     for a given steam flow rate. To achieve this, there are several options:
                                      · Increase the enthalpy at the inlet of the turbine (in other words, increase

                                        the saturation pressure in the boiler).
                                        Unfortunately, this requires the boiler to be more resistant and more
                                        expensive; moreover, it reduces the amount of specific heat that can
                                        be supplied in it, since the enthalpy of vaporization  decreases with
                                        temperature;
                                      · Reduce the enthalpy at the outlet of the turbine (in other words, decrease
                                        the pressure in the condenser).
                                        This requires a larger turbine, promotes the entry of air bubbles into the
                                        steam circuit, and above all, reduces the steam dryness fraction at the
                                        turbine outlet;
                                      · Increase the enthalpy (and thus the temperature of the steam) after its
                                        exit from the boiler.

   This allows for fully utilizing the turbine's capacities, whose metallurgical
   limits (generally around 1000 K) often already exceed those of the boilers.

It is this last option that is very often chosen. This modification is called
superheating: the steam is superheated at the outlet of the boiler, at con-
stant pressure, through a series of tubes heated to a higher temperature
(figures 9.14 and 9.15). Superheating could theoretically be done in the boiler
itself; however, since the density of dry steam is relatively low, it is easier to
bring it in contact with the hottest gases outside (and below) the boiler.

Figure 9.14: Diagram of a steam power plant operating on a superheated Rankine
cycle. The water at the outlet of the boiler is heated to a higher temperature (section
C  D) before entering the turbine.

The main advantage of this modification is that it allows for a reduction in
specific consumption that is relatively simple to implement. Additionally, in-
creasing the average temperature at which heat is supplied tends to increase
thermodynamic efficiency. Finally, it becomes possible to shift the operating
range of the turbine entirely into the realm of dry steam: erosion of the
blades by liquid water is thus avoided. All modern steam power plants now
use a superheating circuit.

                                     (figures 9.16 and 9.17). This is called reheat.

With this modification, the expansion in the turbine is interrupted, and the
steam is led into a new series of tubes to raise its temperature back to a high
level (usually to the metallurgical limits of the turbine). The expansion is
then finally completed down the condenser pressure.
Providing that the average heating temperature is increased, the overall
efficiency of the power plant is increased too; therefore, the choice of the
reheat pressure matters. The specific consumption is reduced in all cases,
with the advantages described above.

9.4.5 Regeneration

When Rankine modified the Carnot cycle, he reduced the work required
to compress the water and increased the heat necessary to bring it to the
turbine inlet. However, the thermodynamic efficiency went down: indeed,
the water temperature at the boiler entry was reduced. The reversibility of
the heat transfer was thus reduced.
In order to increase the reversibility of the cycle (and therefore its efficiency),
it is possible to gradually heat the water, using the heat from the turbine
(where the steam temperature varies). This technique is called regeneration.
One can imagine a cycle as described in figures 9.18 and 9.19 below, where
the liquid water at the pump outlet is gradually heated by cooling the
turbine.
In the limit case where all the heat used during regeneration is transferred
with an infinitely small temperature difference, the cycle is reversible and
the Carnot engine efficiency is reached even if one does not strictly follow
the Carnot cycle.

               In practice, such a device is difficult to implement, because it requires adding
               a non-uniform-temperature cooling system to the turbine, an element whose
               design and manufacturing are already very costly. Moreover, cooling the
               steam reduces its dryness fraction, increasing the amount of liquid water
               eroding the turbine components.

In order to implement regeneration, the turbine bleed technique is used.
Steam is drawn off from the turbine and mixed with the liquid feedwater at
the pump outlet (figures 9.20 and 9.21). This results in a heat transfer that is
easier to implement.

extracted from the turbine is used to heat the liquid water during pumping.

In practice, many bleeds (sometimes called steam extractions) are performed
in steam power plant circuits in order to control the heat flows (figure 9.22).
They also allow, through discharge valves, to precisely regulate turbine mass
flows and thus quickly adjust the power of the plant to the demand.

An engineer proposes to modify the cycle and make it
regenerative by extracting steam from the turbine to
insert it into the compression circuit.
S/he suggests separating the compression into two
stages, one from 0.5 bar to 6 bar, and the second from
6 bar to 30 bar; and then inserting the extracted steam
into the feedwater between the two pumps. The steam
extraction rate is such that the water at the outlet of the
mixer is exactly at the saturation point.

  1. Make a sketch of the proposed setup (that is, the
      physical circuit followed by the steam).

  2. Draw the cycle qualitatively (that is, without show-
      ing numerical values) on a temperature-entropy
      diagram, showing the saturation curve.

  3. What percentage of the turbine steam flow rate
      would need to be extracted at 6 bar in order to heat
      the water to saturation between the two pumps?

  4. Does the shaft power increase or decrease, and by
      how much?

  5. Does the efficiency of the power plant increase or
      decrease, and by how much?

Introduction

In this final chapter, we cover the cycles of engines that use air a as a
working fluid. These are sometimes called gas power cycles, although
because the term gas engine is understood differently in different contexts,
we choose the term air-based engine in this book. This chapter 10 aims to
answer the same two questions as its predecessor with liquids/vapors:
· Why and how are air-based engines used today?
· Why are we moving away from ideal cycles and how do we quantify

   these compromises?

10.1 Why Use an Air-Based Engine?

The use of air as a working fluid, rather than water, brings several advan-
tages.
· First, it is possible to completely dispense with condensers and coolers.

   The cooling phase (§7.2.1) takes place directly in the atmosphere, which
   easily accommodates all the hot gases that are rejected, and which serves
   as a reservoir from which to draw fresh air to feed into the engine.

   For an equal power level, the mass, volume, and often the cost of air-
   based engines are therefore greatly reduced compared to their steam
   counterparts. This is particularly interesting when the engine must
   contribute to carrying its own weight.
· Second, the heat input is carried out without loss. It is now possible to
   have the combustion occur directly within the working fluid - this is why
   we speak of internal combustion engines - and thus to avoid the heat loss
   associated with a boiler (§9.3.3).
The main drawback of air-based engines is that internal combustion requires
a high-quality fuel. Since the combustion residues must flow inside the
thermodynamic part of the machine, we cannot use economical or otherwise
advantageous heat sources such as the combustion of waste, wood, or coal.

Ultimately, the relatively lower weight of air engines compared to their
steam counterparts means that they are systematically used when mass
plays an important role, such as in air or road transport.

10.2 Criteria for Evaluating Air-Based
        Engines

10.2.1 Thermal efficiency

It now goes without saying that we always seek to achieve a high thermal

efficiency  engine    |  net  |  (6/4),  while  keeping  in  mind  that  it  cannot  exceed

its theoretical maximum Carnot engine = 1 - min. max. (7/6).

270 Chapter 10

                As we have already suggested in §9.2, thermal efficiency should not, however,
                be maximized at the expense of other important parameters, the most
                notable of which we present below for air-based engines.

                10.2.2 Work ratio

                In a running engine, the irreversibility of compressions and expansions is
                not independent of speed. When they operate outside their optimal operat-
                ing range, engines thus see their specific power decrease. Irreversibilities
                can even reduce efficiency to zero, with the engine running without pro-
                ducing useful work (as would a disengaged car engine). The work ratio is
                a concept that assesses the robustness of a cycle to the increase of these
                irreversibilities.

                In order to address this concept, let us first study the case of an engine
                whose arbitrarily-chosen energy flows are described in figure 10.1; in this
                engine, compressions and expansions are reversible. Now, if instead of being
                ideal, the turbine suddenly saw its isentropic efficiency drop down to 95 %,
                it would supply 95 W. The net power of the engine would then decrease
                from 10 to 5 W - a reduction of 50 %.

                Figure 10.1: The cycle of a hypothetical engine with low work ratio. The delivered
                power is  net =  compression +  expansion = +90 + (-100) = -10 W, and the efficiency
                engine = -  = - 20 = 50 %  net -10 .

                                               in

                                                                                                       Diagram CC-0 Olivier Cleynen

                Let us now compare this case with an engine of the same efficiency, same
                power, but with a different cycle, as shown in figure 10.2. In that new engine,
                if the isentropic efficiency of the turbine went from 100 % to 95 %, the net
                power would decrease from 10 to 9 W - a decrease of only 10 %.

                We can see here that the larger the share of the turbine power in the net
                power delivered, and the less the cycle efficiency is affected by irreversibili-
                ties. We generalize and formalize this "turbine share" with the concept of
                work ratio , defined as the ratio between the net power and the gross
                power of an engine:

                            net  expansions +  compressions                         (10/1)
                                   =

                            gross      expansions

                where   is the work ratio (dimensionless);

                 expansions is the shaft power released during expansions;

                and  compressions is the shaft power received during compressions.

A machine with a large work ratio loses less of its efficiency when operating
outside its optimal speed range: it is therefore more flexible in use. The
work ratio is one of the indicators of a engine's responsiveness, namely, its
ability to change power and speed quickly. A parallel can be drawn with the
concept of net profit margin in economics: all else being equal, it is more
interesting to sell items bought at 2AC for 3AC than items bought at 100AC for
101AC, notably because the profit of 1AC is then less sensitive to a change in
price or cost imposed by the market.

The Carnot engine is the typical example of a thermodynamic cycle with
high efficiency but low work ratio. By plotting the cycle on a pressure-
volume diagram (figure 7.10 p. 188), this weakness is evident: the curves
during the compression and expansion phases are very close to each other.
Rankine, when he modified this cycle (§9.4.2), significantly increased the
work ratio.

In general, obtaining high thermal efficiency requires a high compression
ratio (so as to achieve a high temperature before heat transfer is initiated).
Obtaining a high work ratio requires low compression work (so as to min-
imize the engine's sensitivity to irreversibilities). These two objectives
are often contradictory, and it will be up to the engineer to find the best
compromise.

10.2.3 Specific thrust and specific power

We  use    the  concepts  of  specific  thrust    and  specific  power  net,    in  other
                                                

words, the thrust and power of the engine divided by the mass flow rate of

air passing through it, to compare engine cycles succinctly. Increasing these

parameters is often desirable in applications where a high power-to-weight

ratio is sought.

For example, a heavier aircraft must provide greater lift, which increases
drag, and in turn the thrust, and finally and the power required to generate

272 Chapter 10

                it - so in that case, an increase in efficiency is not always justified if it results
                in an increase in weight or size.

                10.2.4 Other evaluation criteria

                Many more criteria need to be considered in the design of an engine, which
                we will not explore in this book. They include:

                · purchase cost, which is directly related to the complexity and size of the
                   engine;

                · ecological impact;

                · ease of maintenance and reliability;

                · responsiveness;

                · the level of vibration generated.

                Taking into account each of these factors can justify deliberately limiting the
                efficiency of the engine. Indeed, when the student acquires their first motor
                vehicle, they will likely attach more importance to the purchase cost than to
                the energy consumption - and in the same way, they may not choose to fit
                it with a racing engine requiring constant maintenance.

                Truth be told, there is very little to add to what our eminent and favorite
                theorist already explained in 1824:

                        One must not flatter oneself for ever exploiting, in practice,
                        the entirety of the motive power contained in combustibles.
                        Attempts that one would make to to approach this result would
                        prove more harmful than beneficial, if they led to the neglect
                        of other important considerations. The economy of fuel is
                        but one of the conditions to be fulfilled by fire machines; in
                        many circumstances, it is but secondary, and must often yield
                        precedence to the safety, the solidity, the durability of the
                        machine, to the small amount of space that it must be made to
                        occupy, the low cost of its establishment, etc. Knowing how to
                        appreciate, in each case, at their true value, the considerations
                        of convenience and economy that may present themselves;
                        knowing how to discern the most important from those that
                        are merely accessory, weighing them all properly against one
                        another, so as to attain by the easiest means the best possible
                        result, such must be the principal talent of the man [or woman]

10.3 Reciprocating Engines

Reciprocating engines, often called piston engines, take in a finite amount
of air and perform their thermodynamic cycle on this mass. The cycle is
repeated several times over time, and often several times in parallel, in order
to provide continuous power. An automobile engine typically performs
about fifty cycles per second.

10.3.1 Advantages of piston engines

From a thermodynamic perspective, the main advantage of these engines is
that it is much easier to manipulate a fixed mass of air than a continuous
flow. Manufacturing a cylindrical piston to fit tightly in a cylindrical bore is
comparatively simple, and this allows the volume and pressure of the fluid to
be precisely controlled. For example, it is possible to carry out combustion
at a constant temperature (as prescribed by Carnot) by varying the volume
during combustion. The same operation in a steady flow machine would
require combustion to take place in a turbine (§4.4.4 p. 98), which is much
more challenging.

Another advantage of piston engines is that the maximum temperature of the
cycle is only reached sporadically (periodically, but always briefly). During
combustion, it is thus possible to reach gas temperatures that exceed the
metallurgical limits of the engine, which, as we saw in chapter 7 (the second
law), improves efficiency.

On the other hand, the weight and complexity of mechanisms of piston
engines (connecting rods, crankshaft, valves, and the various circuitry to
and from the cylinders) become major disadvantages in applications very
high powers and rotational speeds are required.

10.3.2 The Otto cycle

The German engineer Nicolaus Otto is credited with the development of
the engine known today as the petrol or gasoline engine in 1864. The basic
cycle of this engine, called the Otto cycle, consists of two isentropic phases
framed by two isochoric phases; it is described in figure 10.3.

entropy diagrams. These diagrams depict the ideal path, without irreversibilities in

                The Otto cycle is designed to allow for a simple implementation of the heat
                addition phase. The fuel is mixed with air before being inserted into the
                engine, and a very rapid combustion is triggered with a spark when the
                volume in the cylinder is minimal: this is known as spark ignition. Otto
                originally intended his engine for stationary applications, but its relative
                simplicity and responsiveness would ensure its success in transportation
                (notably through his son Gustav Otto, an aircraft manufacturer whose
                company would later become bmw).

                The efficiency of the theoretical Otto cycle is easily calculable. The heat
                input combustion = (C - B) is performed at constant volume (4/22). The
                heat rejection, in practice, is done outside the engine, after exiting the
                exhaust pipe. From a thermodynamic point of view, the air continues its
                cycle in the atmosphere before re-entering the engine (§6.2.1), and thus the
                heat rejected is cooling = (A - D). Thus, since in theory no heat transfer
                takes place in the compression and expansion phases, and if we consider
                that the properties () of the gas do not change during combustion, the
                efficiency Otto of the theoretical cycle is simply given by:

                        |  -combustion  -  cooling  |      cooling          A - D
                        |                           |
                Otto = |                             |=1+              =1+             (10/2)

                        |       combustion          |      combustion       ( C - B )

                By defining the compression ratio  as:

                                                            A                          (10/3)
                                                       

                                                            B

                it is possible to show that Equation 10/2 can be reformulated to express the

                efficiency as:

                                                            1                          (10/4)
                                            Otto = 1 -  -1

                                                          

                This equation indicates that the efficiency of the Otto engine depends solely
                on the compression ratio, and not on the amount of heat supplied during
                combustion. This may at first be surprising: why does C, the maximum
                temperature of the cycle, no longer appear here? The answer is that in this
                cycle, as the amount of burned fuel is increased, the increase in the average
                temperature during heat addition is exactly offset by the increase in the
                average temperature during heat rejection.

                Equation 10/4 owes its simplicity to the the fact that we neglected the change
                in air properties during combustion, as well as the irreversibilities during
                compression and expansion. It should therefore be used with great caution;
                however, the trend it describes remains valid. Engineers are constantly seek-
                ing to increase the compression ratio of their engines to enhance efficiency.
                An immediate limit to this ratio is the temperature at which the air-fuel
                mixture spontaneously ignites, causing premature combustion.

                10.3.3 The Diesel cycle

                The Diesel engine, the child of his patient and hard-working inventor,
                German engineer Rudolf Diesel (§7.6), powers today the overwhelming
                majority of commercial road and marine transportation.

From a strictly thermodynamic point of view, the theoretical Diesel cycle
differs from the Otto cycle only in its combustion mode: heat addition occurs
at constant pressure and not at constant volume, as shown in figure 10.4.

compression or expansion irreversibilities.

· combustion at a constant temperature.

To achieve this, Diesel had to wait until the end of compression to inject
the fuel, in order to avoid premature ignition. The isothermal heat addition
requires a progressive combustion. Thus, the original Diesel engine is
inherently equipped with direct fuel injection, independent of air intake.
The Diesel cycle is interesting because it enables a higher compression ratio
and combustion quality compared to the Otto cycle.

Diesel's engine evolved continuously from the impractical concept described
in the 1893 Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Engine Intended to
Replace the Steam Engines and Combustion Engines Known to Date [23, 24]
(400 bar and isothermal combustion of coal powder) to the first production
models he developed at the manufacturer man (40 bar and isobaric combus-
tion of petroleum). Like Otto, Diesel initially focused on stationary engines
(his first prototypes were single-cylinder and over three meters high), but
it was ultimately applications in commercial transportation, where its ex-

                spark-ignition engines, that brought his work fame.

                10.3.4 Implementation of the cycles

                The two cycles described above are only idealizations - they serve as con-
                ceptual standards for comparing actual cycles. Their implementation in a
                real engine requires taking into account numerous factors, including:

                · the need to purge the air and combustion products from inside the
                   cylinder after the cycle, and the impossibility of doing it completely;

                · the fact that the volume occupied by the gas is linked to the rotation
                   of the engine shaft, and that it therefore is not possible to control it
                   independently of the engine's operating speed;

                · irreversibilities during compressions and expansions caused by fast piston
                   movements;

                · heat transfers to and from the cylinders during the cycle;
                · gas leaks (blow-by) in the clearances between pistons and cylinders.

                Once these factors, as well as the pursuit of objectives related to user
                comfort and control of air pollution, are taken into account, the cycle
                obtained inside a cylinder of a practical engine may for example resemble
                the one represented in figure 10.5. In the automotive sector in particular,
                the adoption of direct injection and the increase in compression ratios for
                gasoline engines to reduce fuel consumption and emissions has blurred
                the gasoline/Diesel distinction - gasoline engines are now closer to Rudolf
                Diesel's concept than to Nikolaus Otto's.

                10.3.5 Number of cylinders and turbocharging

                An important drawback of reciprocating engines is that the irreversibility
                of compressions and expansions increases significantly with the piston

speed in the cylinders. The traditional approach to overcome this issue
is to increase the number of cylinders operating simultaneously in the
engine (figure 10.6). This way, the stroke traveled by each piston for a given
displacement volume can be reduced. An advantage associated with this
approach is that the motion of mechanical parts is better balanced (and the
engine sounds more harmonious!).

Unfortunately, the mechanical complexity, size, and manufacturing and
maintenance costs of engines increase rapidly with the number of cylinders;
therefore, in applications where these factors are crucial (such as the major-
ity of the automotive sector, for example), usually only four, or even three
or two cylinders are used. It is nevertheless expected that these engines
operate efficiently over a wide range of power outputs.

A commonly adopted solution for this is turbocharging. It involves del-
egating some of the compression and expansion work to a small device
called a turbocharger or simply turbo, which is compact and lightweight
(figure 10.7). The turbo's compressor is powered by its turbine, which op-
erates with exhaust gases (we will study this system further in §10.5.2).
Turbocharging helps increase the specific power (that is to say, it reduces
the size and speed of an engine for a given power output).

Since the use of a turbocharger negatively affects the responsiveness of an
engine, it is possible to allow the intake air to bypass it while the engine
speed is changing. Furthermore, temperature changes in the turbo can
be compensated for by cooling before insertion into the cylinders (this
technique is studied further in §10.6.1). These processes make modern
engines complex thermodynamic systems capable of performing a wide
range of very different cycles depending on operating conditions.

                                             here), very high rotation speeds can be achieved, typically exceeding 200 000 rpm.

                                             operation of their main components. Since turbomachines operate with
                                             steady fluid flow, we will consistently refer to the concepts of chapter 3

Just as we did for the turbine (9/6), we quantify the efficiency of a compressor

by comparing its power with that of an ideal compressor (one that would

be isentropic). We call this parameter the isentropic efficiency C of the

compressor:

where  actual compressor is the actual shaft power received by the compressor,
and  isentropic compressor is the power of an isentropic compressor that would
operate with the same mass flow rate and between the same pressures.

Like that of a turbine, the isentropic efficiency of a compressor is always
less than 1. If this efficiency is known, we can compare the actual properties
of the air at the inlet and outlet of the compressor with those that would be
measured in the ideal case:

where compressor is the specific power of the compressor (J kg-1),

        ideal is the ideal outlet temperature (isentropic compressor) (K),
and actual is the actual outlet temperature (K).

             Example 10.1

For air, we have  (air) = 1005 J kg-1 K-1,  (air) = 718 J kg-1 K-1, air =
287 J kg-1 K-1, and air = 1.4.
The compressor of a turbofan jet engine has an isentropic efficiency of
85 %; it takes in air at a rate of 38 kg s-1 at 1 bar and 5 C. The outlet
pressure is 40 bar. What is the required power?

The process can be qualitatively represented on a  -  diagram as
shown below.

We start by calculating the power of an ideal (isentropic) compressor:

                                                                             -1

the outlet temperature in that case would be (4/37):                B       

                                                      B  =  A ( A )              =

                                     0.4

(5 + 273.15) (40) 1.4 = 798 K = 524.9 C = 976.7 °F. The ideal compressor

would then receive isentropic compressor = (air) (B - A) = 1005 (798 -
278.15) = +5.225 × 105 J kg-1 = +522.5 kJ kg-1.

                With equation 10/5, the power of the compressor naturally comes

                as:   compressor  =    1   isentropic compressor  =  38 ×   1    × 5.225 × 105     =
                                       C                                   0.85

                2.336 × 107 W = 23.36 MW.

                          Note that unlike for turbines, the actual power is greater than
                     the theoretical power, and we must divide by the efficiency in the
                     final calculation.

                     Equation 10/6 would allow us to calculate the actual outlet

                     temperature:  B real  =  1   (B  - A) + A       =      1    (798  -  278.15)  +
                                                                           0.85
                                              C 
                     278.15 = 889.7 K = 616.6 C = 1141.8 °F. Here, the 92 C (165 °F)

                     difference from the isentropic case are the result of converting work

                     into heat due to friction in the compressor, an unnecessary expense

                     representing   (B - B) = +3.5 MW.

                In practice, several air bleeds can be made within the compressor to feed
                other equipment and to cool the turbine (10.6.3). During transitional phases,
                the compressor can also be relieved of part of the mass flow by allowing air
                to leak through discharge valves.

                10.4.2 Combustion chamber

                The heat input of turbomachines takes place in one or more combustion
                chambers (figures 10.10 and 10.11). The air is heated at constant pressure by
                combustion; its temperature and specific volume greatly increase.

                left to right. The photo shows a section of a Rolls-Royce Turboméca Adour, a small

No work is done in the combustion chamber, and the pressure remains
approximately constant. Since the heat input occurs within the gas itself, the
maximum temperature of the cycle is not limited by heat transfer through
a solid wall. The maximum temperature of the air can even exceed that of
the melting point of the chamber walls, which are insulated with several
layers of compressed air. Compared to steam power plants, this allows for a
temperature increase of about 200 K.

The power delivered in the combustion chamber is quantified rather easily
by modifying equation 4/19 to account for the change in air properties
during combustion, which increases the value of  by about 10 %:

chamber = B - A = (gases)B - (air)A                 (10/7)

Fluid flow within the combustion chamber depends in a correlated manner
on combustion chemistry and the spatial distribution of velocities and
pressure: it is therefore difficult to model. In practice, a slight pressure drop
is generated between the inlet and outlet of the chambers. The influence on
the turbine power of the fuel mass flow rate  fuel, always much lower than
that of air, can be safely neglected.

10.4.3 Turbine

The primary role of the turbine (figures 10.12 and 10.13) is to power the
compressor: it must therefore extract enough power from the air to operate
the latter and compensate for any transmission losses. Depending on the
configuration of the turbomachine, the turbine may then be designed to
further extract energy from the gases in order to power other components,
as we will see in §10.5 below.

Just like for liquids/vapors (eq. 9/6 p. 247), we measure the performance of a
turbine by quantifying its isentropic efficiency  :

         actual turbine                             (10/8)
 

        isentropic turbine

The power extracted by the turbine is thus easily expressed in terms of the
actual 2 real and ideal 2 temperatures at its outlet:

turbine = (gases)(2 actual - 1) =  (gases) (2 - 1)  (10/9)

As the gases flow downstream through the turbine, they expand and their
specific volume increases. The size of the blades (hence their weight and
cost) must also increase, while the power they can extract decreases. Gases
are often rejected at the outlet of a turbomachine with residual pressure
because it is not economically viable to extract any more work from them.

In the case of an ideal nozzle, the expansion is isentropic, and we can relate
the temperatures A and B just like in a turbine or a compressor, using the
dreadful relations 4/36 to 4/38. Thus, knowing the inlet conditions A and
A, for a given outlet pressure B (atmospheric pressure), we can quantify
the change in gas velocity:

  2  -    2  =  -2  (gas)  (B                        -  A)  (10/11)

B       A

Ideally, the nozzle expands the gases to ambient pressure and converts all
the change in enthalpy of the gases into kinetic energy. In practice, of course,
some of this energy is converted into heat due to friction. The efficiency of
nozzles is quantified in a similar way to that of compressors and turbines,
and is not studied in this book.

For burnt gases, we have  (gases) = 1150 J kg-1 K-1,  (gases) =
823 J kg-1 K-1, gases = 327 J kg-1 K-1, and gases = 1.333.
A nozzle is fed with a steady flow of combustion gases at 2 bar, 10 m s-1,

                  = 496.2 m s-1 = 1786 km/h = 1110 mph.

                            In practice, the gases would never reach this speed. Indeed, a
                      large part of the expansion takes place downstream of the nozzle,
                      where it is very turbulent and therefore highly irreversible. This
                      nevertheless does not influence the thrust generated by the nozzle,
                      whose outlet orifice pressure is in fact higher than atmospheric
                      pressure. The speed calculation performed here remains a good ther-
                      modynamic "indicator" of the phenomena at play. A full description
                      of the fluid dynamics of the nozzle is outside of the scope of this
                      book.

                           In most cases, it is reasonable to consider that the kinetic energy
                      of the gases at the outlet of the turbine (and therefore at the inlet
                      of the nozzle) is negligible. The 10 m s-1 at A have no significant
                      influence here.

                Finally, we note that the air intake of aeronautical engines often serves as a
                diffuser: the mirror opposite of a nozzle in function. It thus slows down the
                air and increases its pressure. On supersonic aircraft, a well-designed inlet
                can generate a compression ratio of 2, with a corresponding temperature
                increase.

                10.5 Gas Turbine Configurations

                10.5.1 Advantages of gas turbines

                Within the realm of turbomachinery (machines which transfer power be-
                tween a fluid and a rotating shaft), we call gas turbine the complete internal-
                combustion, turbine-powered machine, and not merely the component of
                the same name. The word "gas" here refers to the working fluid, not to the
                fuel, which may be any kind of combustible liquid or gas. Gas turbines have
                two major advantages over piston engines:

Thus, gas turbines are used in applications where high power is required
with significant weight or space constraints.                                                     Aurel Stodola, 1904, [26, 27]

The major drawback of gas turbines is that their efficiency and responsive-
ness drop very quickly at low power levels. At partial load, the compression
ratio and isentropic efficiency of turbines and compressors collapse, because
it is hard to control fluid flow when the velocity of the rotor blades relative
to stator blades is suboptimal. Gas turbines are therefore only useful in
applications where high powers are required continuously. A gas turbine
would be for example very poorly suited for road transport, because changes
in power there are frequent and must be instantaneously acted on.

10.5.2 The gas generator

The heart of any gas turbine engine is called the gas generator. It contains
only one shaft and one turbine (figure 10.16). This machine section has no
use in itself, but the gases at its outlet, whose pressure is higher than at the
inlet, can be used in a multitude of applications.

Figure 10.16: A "gas generator" (schematic drawing and temperature-entropy di-

agram). This machine has no interest in itself but has many derived applications.

One of them is the turbocharger, for which a piston engine acts as the combustion

chamber, as described in §10.3.5.  Schematic CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen

                In this configuration, the turbine extracts exactly enough power to power
                the compressor. At its outlet, the air is still compressed and can be used in a
                multitude of ways, as explored below.

                10.5.3 Turbojet

                The turbojet engine (figure 10.17) is the first application that has been made
                of gas generator. At the outlet of the turbine, the air is expanded in a nozzle,
                which accelerates it and provides net thrust. It is the working fluid itself
                that is used to generate thrust.

                Turbojet engines are extremely compact and mainly used in military aircraft.

                10.5.4 Turboprop and turboshaft

                Instead of using a nozzle as in a turbojet, it is possible to continue the
                expansion in the turbine until the gases reach atmospheric pressure. The
                power supplied by the turbine is then greater than the power supplied to
                the compressor.
                This surplus work in the the engine shaft can then be used to power a
                propeller (in the case of a turboprop) or an external element such as a
                generator or a pump (in the case of a turboshaft), as shown in figure 10.18.
                The cycle of these machines is sometimes called Brayton cycle.
                For a given engine mass flow, powering a propeller or the fan of a turbofan
                engine instead of merely expanding the gases in a nozzle increases thrust

(this is quantified as the propulsive efficiency). The associated disadvantages
are, of course, bulk and weight: the diameter of propellers and fans of
modern engines often exceeds three meters, which translates into significant
structural and mechanical constraints on the engine.
As for turboshaft engines, they find applications in helicopters, military
ships, auxiliary electric generators, and gas turbine power plants. They
are most often configured using the cycle modifications described in the
following sections.

10.5.5 Turbofan

From a thermodynamic point of view, a turbofan (figure 10.19), is equivalent
to a turboprop with a nacelle placed around it.
There are two separate air flows within a turbofan:

                                         (A  E) mechanically powers the fan, which allows the bypass flow (A  G) to
                                         provide the majority of the thrust.

                                                                                                                                      Diagram CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen

                                      · the core flow is the flow through the thermodynamic engine. After
                                        combustion, it passes through a turbine whose power far exceeds that of
                                        the compressor. This excess power is transferred to the fan;

                                      · the bypass flow is lightly compressed by the fan and directly expanded in
                                        the nozzle surrounding the hot core of the engine. It is never heated.
                                        It is this "cold" air which makes for the majority of the thrust. It can be
                                        shown that the greater the ratio of bypass to core air flow (the bypass
                                        ratio), and the more efficient the engine. The bypass ratio of modern
                                        engines is around 12.

                            10.5.6 Free turbine and multiple turbines

                                     Depending on the applications, various arrangements of turbines and
                                     compressors can be used.
                                     In a free turbine (also called free spool) configuration, the mechanical power
                                     supplied by the engine is transmitted by a dedicated turbine (figure 10.20).
                                     This allows each of the two shafts to be maintained at different speeds.
                                     Since the speed of the turbine/compressor shaft is not constrained by the
                                     load imposed on the free shaft, it can operate at speeds closer to its optimum
                                     point and accelerate more easily. This advantage compensates for the
                                     increased mechanical complexity in applications such as helicopter engines,
                                     where significant power changes are sometimes required.
                                     In a configuration with multiple spools, the compressor and turbine are each
                                     divided into several parts, thus forming two co-axial systems incorporated
                                     one into the other (figure 10.21).
                                     The high-pressure turbine drives the high-pressure compressor (high-speed
                                     spool), and the low-pressure turbine drives the low-pressure compressor
                                     (low-speed spool).

                Just like for the free turbine, this arrangement allows each spool to operate
                at its own speed. Indeed, as the air pressure increases in the compressor, its
                density and temperature also increase. This configuration allows the blades
                to be operated at higher speeds, thus reducing their size.

                10.6 Modification of Gas Turbine Cycles

                10.6.1 Intercooling and reheat

                It is sometimes desirable to increase the work ratio and specific power, even
                at the cost of a decrease in total efficiency, as mentioned in §10.2 above.
                In order reduce the power absorbed by the compressor, intercooling is
                sometimes used. The compression is interrupted and the air is cooled before
                the compression process is completed (figure 10.22).

                Figure 10.22: A turboshaft generator with intercooler and reheat system (schematic
                and temperature-entropy diagram).
                The intercooler cools the air in the midst of compression; while the second combustion
                chamber reheats the gases it in the midst of the expansion. The two modifications are
                independent of each other and each can be installed alone.

                                                                                                Schematic CC-by-sa Olivier Cleynen

                The compression of a gas between two given pressures imposes a ratio
                between the initial and final temperatures (4/36). On the other hand, the

                                                                                                                    Chapter 10 291

power required to compress a gas between these two pressures depends on
the difference between these two temperatures (10/6). Therefore, the lower
the initial temperature, and the lower the power required to reach a given
pressure.

In the same vein, we can increase the specific power supplied by the turbine
by carrying out a second combustion with the gases before the end of the
expansion: this is called reheat. The process is similar to the reheating of
steam in steam power plants (§9.4.4 p. 256).

It will not have escaped the student that the efficiency is inevitably reduced
by the use of intercooling. Indeed, the combustion chamber must supply
more heat, at a lower average temperature. This reduction in efficiency will
be balanced against the reduction in the size of the compressor (usually
the largest component of an engine) and the increase in specific power.
Intercooling and reheat are typical of machines where the power-to-size
ratio must be maximized.

In order to partially offset the loss of efficiency in stationary engines, it is
sometimes possible to recover heat from the exhaust gases and use it to heat
the air at the compressor outlet, thus relieving the combustion chamber.
The heat exchanger is sometimes called economizer (figure 10.23); it is left
to the student to trace the cycle followed on a temperature-entropy diagram
and to find the conditions required for its operation.

Figure 10.23: Turboshaft generator with an intercooler and an economizer heat
exchanger. The exhaust gases are redirected inside the engine to supply heat to the
gases at the entrance of the combustion chamber. It is left to the student to determine
the limits of the process.

10.6.2 Afterburning

Afterburning (or reheat in British English) is the addition of a second com-
bustion phase in a jet engine, downstream of the turbine and upstream of
the nozzle (figure 10.24). The principle is exactly the same as that of reheat:
increase the specific thrust of the machine (at the expense of its efficiency).
Like reheat, afterburning alters the properties (specific volume in particular)
of the gases and requires resizing of downstream components. The geometry
of the nozzle is adapted according to whether the post-combustion is active
or not. Adding an afterburner system to a turbojet engine merely requires
the installation of burners and a system for varying the geometry of the

                                     power.
                                     The outrageous loss of efficiency caused by the use of afterburners, as well
                                     as the deafening levels of noise and pollution they generate, limit their use
                                     to the military sector (especially on combat aircraft).

                            10.6.3 Turbine cooling

                                     Because an increase in combustion temperature increases efficiency and
                                     specific power, engine designers are driven to develop technologies to
                                     maximize the temperature at the outlet of the combustion chamber (tet, for
                                     turbine entry temperature).
                                     One of the used strategies is to cool the turbine with bleed air from the
                                     compressor (figure 10.25). The bleed air is passed through the turbine blades
                                     themselves, allowing for an increase in combustion temperature without
                                     risking damage to the blades. The most efficient and advanced cooling
                                     systems wrap the turbine blades with this cooler air. This allows, in modern
                                     engines, the tet temperature exceeds the melting temperature of the blades
                                     by more than 100 C, or 180 °F!
                                     Such turbine cooling comes at a significant cost. First, in a real engine, less
                                     work is recovered from the expansion of this bleed air than was required

for its compression (in the limiting case where compression and expansion
are isentropic, this energy cost is zero). The circulation of this air therefore
represents a burden that must be offset by the increase in efficiency it
generates. Secondly, the compressor and the turbine must be oversized to
accommodate a larger air flow.
Turbine cooling is a major research area in aeronautical propulsion. Tech-
niques from a handful of fields (materials, fluid mechanics, mechanical
design, combustion chemistry) are combined there in order to improve the
thermodynamics of the engines.

ever, the two units were mounted in series: the air first
passed through the compressors, then through the cylin-
ders, and finally through the turbine(s). The engine power,
as was customary in 1950, was controlled using a single
mechanical control lever!

The performance of the Nomad II was indeed im-
pressive --with its efficiency of 40 %, it used a third
less fuel than its contemporaries-- but its commer-
cial failure was brutal: the project was abandoned in
1955 without a single sale. The engine was terribly
heavy (with over 1600 kg for 2 MW, its power-to-
weight ratio was three times lower than that of a
turboprop), which erased a large part of the fuel
savings it could have generated. Also, it was both
too complex for regional aircraft and far too slow
for jet airliners, and aircraft manufacturers were
never interested.

The curious arrangement conceived by Napier &
Son fell into obscurity but, sixty years later, it made
a thunderous comeback in racing cars. In 2014, the
International Automobile Federation, organizer of
the Formula One races, sought to make it easier for
new teams to join the sport, by limiting develop-
ment expenses, increasing technological spin-offs
applicable to the industry, and finding itself a (new-
found) ecological conscience. The regulations were
thus modified: turbocharging would be allowed, but
the cars' fuel consumption was limited to 100 L/h.
Most importantly, engine manufacturers would be
allowed to use the turbocharger to recover energy
in the form of electricity, as well as, conversely,
accelerate the turbo by reinvesting this electrical
energy into it (figure 10.30). Thus, the engine ef-
ficiency (and therefore, given the regulatory con-
sumption limit, its power) can be increased at all
speeds without sacrificing responsiveness. The sys-

Isentropic efficiency of turbines:  85 %
Exhaust gas discharge pressure:     1.1 bar

In order to convert the turbofan into a turboshaft engine,
you have the nacelle and the fan removed, and mechan-
ically connect the low-pressure spool to the generator
(figure 10.38). The turboshaft engine is started at atmo-
spheric conditions of 1 bar and 18 C. At full throttle, it
uses an air flow rate of 80 kg s-1.

1. Draw the thermodynamic cycle undergone by the
   air on a pressure-volume diagram, qualitatively.

2. What is the net power delivered by the machine?
3. What is its work ratio?
4. What is its efficiency?

The client company receives your engine but wishes to
increase its power. Since the engine is already operating
at full capacity, you are unable to increase either the air
mass flow rate or the combustion temperature.

In order to increase the power, you install an intercooling
system (figure 10.38). The air compression is interrupted
at a pressure of 7 bar; the air is led into a large heat
exchanger where it is cooled at constant pressure. Once
its temperature has dropped back to 40 C, compression
resumes in the compressor, which has not been modified.

A1 Steam Tables

The following tables quantify the thermodynamic state of pure water across a large range
of properties, as calculated according to the nist-iapws 1995 model [44].
The notation used is detailed on page 319. The values of  and  are arbitrarily set to zero
at the triple point of water, so that all values of ,  and  elsewhere are expressed relative
to this point.
Data in these tables were produced by the US National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy and are in the public domain. These tables were prepared by Olivier Cleynen and are
released under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-by) license.
These tables are available for download in various formats and with different notation

A2 Gauge Pressure and Real Pressure

It is necessary to distinguish the real pressure real or simply  of a fluid, which we use
for our calculations throughout this book, from the gauge pressure often indicated by
barometers and manometers.

Indeed, it is common for a pressure instrument to be calibrated to atmospheric pressure.
For example, when inflating a car tire at a gas station, the dial reads 0 bar at ambient
pressure - all of the values that it displays will be offset by the value of the atmospheric
pressure at that time. The value indicated by such a manometer is called gauge pressure,
denoted by g and defined as follows:

                                         g  real - atm.                                  (A2/1)

where g is gauge pressure, shown by the device (Pa),
        real is the real pressure where the measurement is made, generally noted  (Pa),

and atm. is the ambient atmospheric pressure (Pa).

A pressure gauge left exposed to the atmosphere will therefore read 0 bar regardless of
ambient pressure. The pressure indicated during a measurement will depend on the
ambient atmospheric pressure; it can be positive (for example, in a car tire) or sometimes
negative (for example, in a water or oil pipeline).

Gauge pressure is interesting because it indicates the difference in pressure between each
side of the reservoir walls (tire, pipeline); it is therefore indicative of the stresses they
undergo.

However, it is the actual, real pressure that we need to predict the state of fluids. In our
thermodynamic calculations, we always use real pressure, simply noted .

A3 Additive Quantities

Quantities in thermodynamics can be classified into the following categories:
· A quantity is additive or extensive if its value depends on the size of the system. For

   example, if an object is split into two parts, its mass and volume (additive quantities) are
   also split. The additive quantities used in this book are ,  , , ,  , and  (see the list
   of symbols on page 327).
· A quantity is non-additive or intensive if its value does not depend on the size of
   the system. For example, if an object is split into two parts, its temperature remains
   unchanged. Specific (or mass-related) quantities are all non-additive.
  The non-additive quantities used in this book are , , , , , ,  , , , , ,  , and 
  (see the list of symbols on page 327).
· Some quantities are neither additive nor non-additive; so is, for example, the area of the
   surface surrounding a system.

A4 State Quantities and Process Quantities

Definition

Thermodynamic quantities can be classified into the following categories:

· A quantity is called a state quantity if its value depends only on the current state of the
   system. Temperature  is an example of a state quantity.

· A quantity is called a path quantity or if its value depends on the path taken. Heat
   transfer  and work  are the only two path quantities used in this book.

Using the example provided by Rogers & Mayhew [37], one can illustrate the distinction
as follows: a cyclist travels from A to B. Their altitude at the start A and at the end B
are state quantities ( being a state function), and we can quantify   B - A without
knowing anything about the route. However, the work AB expended to go from A to B
depends on the process: it will be larger, for example, if the route is longer or if there
is wind. Quantifying  (a path function) requires knowledge of all intermediate states
between A and B.

Quantities are sometimes referred to as variables; state quantities are sometimes referred to
as physical properties. Process quantities and functions are sometimes also called transfer
or path quantities.

Notation

Infinitesimal changes in state quantities are denoted by the symbol d; these are exact
differentials and can be integrated by only knowing their initial and final values. For
example, for temperature  :

                     B                                     (A4/1)

                  d =  = B - A

                   A

Infinitesimal transfers of path quantities are denoted by the symbol ; these are inexact
differentials and their integral can only be quantified by knowing all states encountered
along the path. For example, for work  , one cannot write "B - A", or " ", but only:

                     B                                     (A4/2)

                   = AB

                   A

This notation can be confusing, since it is d and not  that becomes  upon integration.
It may also appear as a complicated way to avoid using partial derivatives. Clifford
Truesdell [36] mischievously remarks that because of this notation, equation 8/1 on page 211
might make us believe that some types of differentials are larger than others. . . Although
this notation is widely used in French literature (which is why it is adopted in this book,
which is translated from French [51]), it must be recognized that one can fully cover
the field of engineering thermodynamics [37, 38] or physical thermodynamics and its
history [36] without ever having to use the symbol  in the above sense.

indices

       · In upright characters: points in time or in space (temperature A at point A). The
         index "cst." denotes a quantity that remains constant, the index "rev." indicates that
         the calculation is carried out along a reversible process, "in" denotes "incoming"
         and "out" denotes "outgoing".

       · In italics:  , , and the indices   and   denote respectively a high and low
         temperature, as detailed in section §7.2.2 p. 179. The indices  and  indicate the
         saturation points of a liquid-vapor mixture, as detailed in section §5.3.2 p. 126.

lowercase Specific values (energy or power). See section §1.1.5 p. 14.

operators Exponential exp   , natural logarithm ln   log ;

units Units are in upright characters and colored in gray (1 kg). In sentences, units
      are written out in full and in lowercase (one hundred watts). The liter is noted as
      L to make it more readable (1 L  10-3 m3). The units in equations are from the
      International System of Units (SI) [50] unless otherwise indicated, and non-si units
      are listed in Appendix A5 p. 317.

numbers Numbers are written according to the recommendations of the bipm in the 9th
      edition of the SI Brochure [50]. The decimal separator is a dot, digits are grouped
      by three (12.3456 × 103 = 12 345.6). When only four digits are present, grouping
      is omitted. In tables, integers are always grouped, and decimals never grouped, to
      increase readability. Rounding is done as late as possible and never in series; leading
      and trailing zeros are not indicated.

                Bibliography

This book was originally written in French [51] and first published in 2015, so the
bibliography naturally reflects this. The author's reading recommendations are:
To study engineering thermodynamics:
· Çengel, Boles & Lacroix 2007 [48, 49], provide accessible, comprehensive, and solid

   coverage of the topics addressed here;
· Eastop & McConkey 1993 [38], an essential reference (itself based on the very robust

   Rogers & Mayhew 1992 [37]);
To explore thermodynamics in physics:
· Depondt 2001 [43], a playful exploration of our favorite discipline (Philippe Depondt

   wrote the sections §1.6, §3.6, §4.5, and §8.6 of this manual) ;
· Feynman 1963 [30, 35] addresses thermodynamics several times in his reference in-

   troductory physics book, in particular with a beautiful exploration of the concept of
   irreversibility.
For a short time travel:
· Gay-Lussac 1807 [3] and Joule 1845 [8] for a glimpse of the meticulous work that laid
   the foundations of what is now called the first law;
· Carnot 1824 [4], the stunningly modern booklet written by the first thermodynamics
   engineer in history;
· Clausius 1854 [13] to witness the birth of the term "entropy" and see its father's self-
   confidence.

« We have studied this subject with all the interest, we might say,

with all the ardor that it awakened in us. For what a marvelous
tableau, indeed, is this triumph of human intelligence! What an im-
posing spectacle is a locomotive moving forward without apparent
effort, drawing behind it a train of 40 or 50 loaded carriages, each
weighing ten thousand pounds! What, henceforth, are the heaviest
burdens, when machines exist that can set such prodigious weights
in motion; what are distances, when engines can traverse daily an
interval of 12 leagues in 1½ of an hour? The very ground seems as
it were to vanish beneath your eyes; trees, houses, mountains are
swept away behind you with the swiftness of a stroke; and when
you cross another train, with a relative speed of 15 to 20 leagues
per hour, you see it in an instant appear, grow, and reach you; and
scarcely have you seen it flash by with a shudder, before it is already

» borne far from you, reduced to a point, and vanished once more into

the distance.
