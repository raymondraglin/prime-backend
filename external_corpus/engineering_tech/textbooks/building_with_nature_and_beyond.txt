                                                         The Asian Tsunami on December 26, 2004 that resulted in
                                                         the deaths of over 300 000 people and left hundreds of thou-

                                                           Think of Hurricane Katrina, striking the Gulf Coast of Amer-

                                                           Or, what about, the destructive force of Hurricane Sandy
                                                         impacting on New York in October 2012?

                                                         Can you also remember the distressing images of the Jap-

                                                         All of these disastrous floods have happened fairly recently.

                                                         I expected a similar response to the recent flooding disasters.
                                                         What do you think? I expected the different countries to de-

                                                         defences. But, let's examine what actually happened. How
                                                         did these countries respond?

                                                         Well, we see a number of newspaper headlines showing that
                                                         natural or ecosystem-based alternatives are considered in
                                                         addition to hydraulic structures.

                                                         In the Philippines a town was saved by their mangroves. This
                                                         made such an impression that mangrove areas are being re-
                                                         stored as part of the flood defences in the Philippines, and in

            located, they also opted for a combined strategy - building
            levees and restoring marsh areas, to bring their flood defenc-
            es up to acceptable levels.

            What about the Dutch? They are moving from building hard
            hydraulic structures to including nature-based alternatives.
            Look at the Sand Engine in South-Holland. It uses natural
            dynamics to distribute a huge sand nourishment along the
            coast, preventing erosion and improving flood safety.

            Clearly, "Building with Nature" is a worldwide trend in hydrau-
            lic engineering. But what is it exactly? And how can you de-
            sign Building with Nature solutions?

            Well, in the 4th chapter of the course you'll be making your
            own Building with Nature design by applying the engineering
            and ecological principles you've learnt.

            I'm looking forward to a great course!

      During the course, you will learn that Building with Nature is an
      issue of trade-offs within the design process. This means that
      when an infrastructure exhibits both Building with Nature and
      conventional engineering properties, ecosystem-based trade-
      offs were made in the design process. In contrast, when an infra-
      structure only exhibits sound engineering properties, the trade-
      offs involved in the design process were orientated to societal
      needs and reasonable costs rather than the ecosystem.

Engineering Design Principles
                                               The Dutch are famous for their storm surge barriers, but how
                                               do they really design them? Well, I am Ad van der Toorn, I
                                               am a lecturer on storm surge barriers here in the Technical
                                               University. I want to tell you something about a storm surge
                                               barrier. How to design it, and let me sketch a first drawing of
                                               the situation.

                                               Maybe this is a river with a certain discharge coming from
                                               maybe Germany. You have the sea on the other side with a
                                               certain tide, but of course you have some spring tide over it,
                                               and maybe there is some sea level rise in the future. So you
                                               have an extra high tide within a few years. Maybe there is
                                               some subsidence, so there could be an extra level added to it.
                                               And then of course the first question is: Do we have a problem
                                               if the sea level rises?

                                               And we have this situation with dunes on the outside and
                                               some dikes on the inside. Maybe this is a city like Rotterdam.
                                               This is the harbour inside and some new harbours outside.

                                                 If the sea level rises, then of course we have the problem
                                               of flooding. So, we could have two main options on the mac-

                                                                                                                                                              2-55

                                               ro-system level. We could balance them. Maybe we raise the
                                               dikes and of course this is problematic, because here you
                                               have to raise the dikes in the city, which costs you a lot more
                                               per meter to raise the dikes. And the second option is to build
                                               a kind of barrier, which could be open under normal condi-
                                               tions, but it could be closed if the high tide is there, and there
                                               is some storm surge with an extra height.

                                               If you make a kind of decision about these two options, of
                                               course you could find out in a cost benefit analysis that maybe
                                               the barrier is the best option. So, because you have to raise a
                                               long stretch of dike and you only have to build a few small bar-
                                               riers in this situation. If you decide, you then come to the next
                                               system level. First you decide on the macro-system level, but
                                               now you come to the system level. And then the question is:
                                               what kind of barrier do you need?

                                               And of course you have to think about the vessels, which en-
                                               ter the ports in this city. And, you have to think about the dis-

                                                                                                     Engineering Design Process

            tide which comes in and out and, of course, gives you a nice               2-13. Three variants for storm surge barriers. Ad van der Toorn
            environment. So what kind of barrier should we build there?
            And there are a few options. Build a kind of barrier, which                2-14. Multi-criteria evaluation.  Ad van der Toorn
            looks like the barrier in Rotterdam, with two big arms swing-                                                           Engineering Design Process
            ing around the vertical axis, which has some parking docks,
            where you can maintain them. So they are strong barriers - a
            proven technology.

            We have another option, which is more like a simple stretch
            solution with a rolling door in this direction. With a kind of
            recess on the opposite side. So, connecting these two sides
            in times of storm. And we have the other option, which gives
            a kind of barge swinging, or barge door. It swings around
            one axis, a vertical axis, and closes also the river in times of
            storm. And of course if you have these three alternatives you
            have to work them out.

            First you have to work them out on a certain technical level,
            so that you have some idea about the amount of steel and
            concrete and what the price should be. And then you have to
            look to other criteria like reliability. So the first variant is a little
            bit complex, because you have to float the barrier, the arms
            of the barrier, up and then swing them in and then lower them
            down. So that is a complex movement, which gives you a low

2-56

            reliability. So reliability is not that high, but of course this is
            easy to maintain. So, it is easy to maintain.

            If we look to the second option, we have a very simple struc-
            ture. So that is a plus - simple structure. But of course there
            is always some negative side. There is a lot of bending mo-
            ment, if this is for instance 300 meter, like in Rotterdam, then
            you have a lot of bending moments in your solution. So, the
            strength of this structure could be a problem.

            And of course this swinging door - the third option - is a sim-
            ple one, because it looks like a very big crude oil carrier, but
            it has to swing around one point. And of course you have to
            guide it, by cables etcetera to bring it in the right position. So,
            the swing is a little bit problematic, but it is a simple structure.
            And of course there are more arguments to give, but at the
            end you have to make a kind of multi-criteria evaluation, with
            three variants on one side and some criteria on the other side,
            which could be reliability etcetera. These are the criteria. And,

           Engineering Design Principles
                                                                at the end you can give them some grades and end up with
                                                                one or two favourites, which you want to work out.

                                                                So that is the way you try to come up with barrier design. You
                                                                start at macro-level, then you go to a system level and at the
                                                                end, of course, you have to work out all the different details.
                                                                And maybe some elements, and at the end maybe, you can
                                                                find that you have a wrong solution and, you have to go back,
                                                                and look around, till you find the right solution in all details.
                                                                After the first look you have a first sketch for your barrier.

                                                                                                                           Engineering Design Process
            Hello, my name is Mark Voorendt, I'm a researcher and lec-
            turer at the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Delft Uni-
            versity of Technology. I will explain the basics of dike design.
            I will concentrate on the hydraulic engineering part. In reality,
            urban, spatial quality, urban and ecological aspects have also
            to be taken into account.

            The purpose of a dike is to reduce flood risks by protecting
            land from being covered by water. The higher the dike, the
            better it can resist higher water levels, and the lower the flood
            risk becomes. To determine how high the dike should be, the
            consequences of the flood are compared with investments
            needed to prevent it. A maximum acceptable flood probability
            level comes out. Because there is a relation between flood
            probability and extreme water level, the design height of a
            dike can then be determined.

            The height of a dike is the basic design parameter. Other
            properties such as the geometry, the shape and materials
            have to be designed in such a way to ensure the dike is suffi-
            ciently stable. So we start with determining the crest height of

2-60

            a dike, it should be higher than the design water level.
              So I start painting foreland - actually the bed of the river

            or the sea, and then here is the slope, the outer slope of the
            dike. Somewhere here is the water level, which we indicate
            like this.

            This water level shows some variations, of course, because
            there is some tidal differences. So we have a minimum which
            we call ebb, and we have a flood level, and even these astro-
            nomical tides show differences, because sometimes we have
            a larger flood, called a spring tide, and we have a neap tide
            - depends on the position of the sun and moon relative to the
            earth. And we should of course design a dike in such a way
            that it resists the higher water levels and then it will resist the
            lower water levels as well. So we could extend this line to the
            dike here.

            It can even be higher than this highest astronomical level be-
            cause during storms there is lots of wind, which blows over

                                                                       to restrict the amount of water flowing over a dike because

                                                                       the still water level, extreme water level plus some overtop-

                                                                       the subsoil (this level), you have extra weight because of the
                                                                       mass of all the soil in the dike body, you get some settlements
                                                                       of the soil below the dike a compaction of this soil, and when it

                                                                       compensate for this during construction - so you have to put
                                                                       extra height on top of the dike so that at the end of the lifetime
                                                                       it will reach the design crest height.

                                                                       The height of a dike can be lower if the waves are dissipated.
                                                                       You can do that by constructing an outer berm, so in front of

            same allowable overtopping discharge you can lower the
            crest height of a dike, so you can save this part - save costs                                                       Engineering Design Process
            because you have this height - but you have extra costs by
            constructing the berm over here. So you have to balance also
            here the costs of reduction that you gain by lowering the dike,
            by constructing the berm, including the revetment.

            And of course you have better view over the flood defence, of
            course here, so that has extra value by lowering it, but that is
            difficult to quantify in the cost-benefit calculation.

            I think I should start with a new drawing now. I have drawn the
            outer-berm as you can see here, and it is applicable to sea
            dikes mainly because along the coast we get a lot of waves -
            it can be really high waves - and the overtopping height can
            be up to 5 meters, so it could double the height of the crest of
            the sea dike. But along rivers we don't have those high waves
            - it can be up to half a meter, so we don't need an outer-berm
            along rivers. But sometimes we even see berms on the inner
            slope of a dike and these are mainly used for stability. After
            heavy rainfall or after a high water level, the soil becomes
            saturated here and because of its weight, it starts sliding in a

2-62

            rotational way. So you could say this is the centre of the rota-
            tional movement (the radians), and the berm counter-acts this
            movement. So it is extra weight on that side of the slope and
            it provides extra stability. Sometimes we need a piping berm,
            it is much lower and much longer, also on the inside of the
            dike, and that prevents seepage under a dike. So it makes the
            seepage length much longer, and seepage is actually a failure
            mechanism when water flows under a dike from one side to
            the other side, and seepage is not a problem, but when small
            grains start extruding from these small tunnels, you could say,
            that could undermine a dike, so you get failure and you have
            a breach, and then the polder will flood. So actually we have
            3 kinds of berms on a dike - so in sea dikes we have a berm
            on the outer slope, and we can have a stability berm on the
            inner slope, or a much lower and longer piping berm also on
            the inner slope.

            design principles - the essence of engineering design.

              When designing, each engineer seeks to reconcile the func-
            tion required of the infrastructure with the hydraulic boundary
            conditions and load that it will experience. They do this

              · to a required standard, and
              · at reasonable cost.

            So, these represent 2 principles of engineering design.
              · First, designing to meet a Requisite standard. That is,
                    the structure should withstand all conditions apart from
                    those exceeding the design criteria. Examples are dikes
                    built to withstand a certain water level, or breakwaters
                    built to withstand particular wave conditions.

              · Second, Reasonable cost. This is a pragmatic consid-
                    eration that it behoves an engineer to take into account.
                    After all, an unnecessarily expensive structure won't
                    get built. And, a cost-cutting version may not continue
                    to meet the safety standard in the long term. A profes-
                    sional engineer is responsible for minimising cost, while
                    maintaining standards.

            But how is this done? Well, each engineer considers how the
            hydraulic structure can fail - the failure mechanisms - and
            the means to prevent such failure. This leads to 2 further en-
            gineering design principles:

              · The third principle, Structural integrity. That is, the struc-
                    ture should be built of appropriate material and in an
                    appropriate fashion, so that it doesn't become unsteady
                    or unbalanced, but retains its resistance to loading: that
                    is its structural integrity - its strength, stability, stiffness
                    - its position. Not like at Peacehaven in England. So,

                                                                     simpler the structure, the more likely it is to be reliable.
                                                                     This principle incorporates the idea of maintenance -
                                                                     that a structure can be maintained so that it remains

                                                             here is Implementibility. Tried and tested methods are gen-

                                                             principle entails checking whether it is feasible and reasona-

                                                             aptability. This means taking potential future changes in the

            Each principle requires you to think about the abiotic environ-
            ment and its variability. Maybe by withstanding, controlling or
            regulating the variability, or considering the types of materials
            at the site or nearby. This brings us to the 9th and most funda-
            mental engineering design principle, understanding the abiot-
            ic environment sufficiently to determine appropriate hydraulic
            boundary conditions and loads.

            For the non-engineers amongst you - Its all about FAILURE!
            And, for the engineers - you may not have realised that other
            disciples just don't know that engineers think like this, and
            that you care that infrastructures don't fail.

              So, to return to the original question: "what is the essence
            of engineering design?" Engineers apply design principles to

           Engineering Design Principles
Reading Material: Engineering Design Principles (H-Principles)

What is the essence of engineering design? What are the princi-
ples upon which it is based? Answering these two questions en-
ables the connection to ecological design, or nature-friendly de-
sign. If engineers can explain why they think and act in a particular
way when designing, and if other professionals understand
what motivates engineers, a multi-disciplinary negotiation space
emerges. Therefore, this document attempts to answer the ques-
tions by expounding a set of eight Engineering Design Principles.
Each of these principles describes an aspect that an engineer
considers when designing infrastructure.

1. Requisite standard                                                                                                                                                                    2-71

                                          A structure should withstand all conditions apart from those exceeding the
                                          design criteria. Examples include Dutch dikes which are built to withstand a 1
                                          in 10 000 year storm surge.

           2. Control of (environmental)  Control of environmental variability to ensure access, connection or supply.
                        variability       For instance, a lock is designed to connect two bodies of water in such a way
                                          that ships can move from one body of water to the other, by the control of the
Engineering Design Principles             water level within the lock. A breakwater has a dual function - withstanding
                                          variability (to a requisite safety standard) and ensuring accessibility by con-
                                          trolling the variability of the wave conditions behind the breakwater. A major
                                          dam in a river is designed to control the variability in river flow by storing it to
                                          ensure supply. The more variable the river flow, the larger the dam needed to
                                          provide a particular assurance of supply.

                                                                                                                          Engineering Design Principles
      3. Reasonable Cost

                                        A pragmatic consideration of the costs and the benefits of certain infrastruc-
                                        ture. While an unnecessarily expensive structure is not likely to be built, a
                                        cost-cutting version may not continue to meet the safety standard in the long
                                        term. A professional engineer is responsible for the trade-off between minimis-
                                        ing costs while maintaining standards.

      4. Structural integrity, such as  A structure should be built of appropriate material and in an appropriate fashion
            strength and stability      to prevent unsteadiness or imbalance, yet retaining its resistance to loading.
                                        This requires the maintenance of structural integrity: strength, stabilityand stiff-
                                        ness. The structure should remain in position. For example, when large rocks
                                        or concrete blocks of a breakwater are placed directly on a sandy substrate, the
                                        structure can become unstable and subsides or slumps as time passes.

      5. Reliability

                                        A structure should continue to function smoothly and well, and should not
                                        require many repairs. In general, the simpler the structure, the more likely it
                                        is to be reliable. This principle also incorporates the idea of maintenance: a
                                        structure can be maintained so that it remains reliable.

      6. Implementability

                                        Checking whether an infrastructure is feasible and reasonable to construct
                                        and operate. Tried and tested methods are generally preferred above entirely
                                        novel ones. An exception is the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier, for which

structures by their names: a sea groyne, a breakwater, sluices
and a quay wall. In Block 2, we asked you to identify, from a given
set of functions, those that the infrastructure in the image provid-

       The third block of the assignment presented you with two hydrau-
       lic infrastructures and a natural coastal defence. Did you notice
       that the storm surge barrier and the dam fulfilled almost all the
       Engineering Design Principles? This means that engineers do
       their jobs well by designing to prevent failure. The resulting hy-
       draulic infrastructures meet the requisite standards, optimise the
       control of variability, ensure structural integrity, are implementa-
       ble and select appropriate boundary conditions and loads. When
       designing conventional hydraulic infrastructures, there is often a
       trade-off between achieving the previous principles and keeping
       costs low, maximising resilience and enhancing adaptability. This
       poses two major types of challenges: the first one is economic
       and the second one is ecological. You will learn more about the
       second trade-off in the next chapter.

   2.6 Assignment 2.2

    Introduction

       In Chapter 4 you will be working on your own Building with Na-
       ture Design. The assignment in this section acts as practice for
       the assignment in Chapter 4, in which you will need to report
       and explain how you apply the Engineering Design Principles
       in your proposed / sketched design. The reporting format that
       you use in Assignment 2.2 forms a component of your Chapter
       4 Assignment when you will apply it to your own Building with
       Nature design.

       To get ready for Assignment 4, we ask you to practise by com-
       pleting the exercise in the next section.

                                                generally require maintenance as they age.

                                                The design of the infrastructure is not new; it has
                                                been built many times.

                                                                                                                                                    2-87

                                                The structure appears able to withstand more than

    Video: Oyster Reefs - An Inspiring Example

       Now for an example of eco-engineering - an oyster reef.

       In the following video, Dr. Brenda Walles will take you to an
       estuary in the southern part of the Netherlands. She will explain
       how oyster reefs can protect tidal flats from erosion, and how
       they can be employed for this purpose. You will learn how oyster
       reefs grow with nature through annual recruitment, and so suc-
       ceed in controlling erosion, and how the heights of the reef and
       tidal flats are monitored. The need for system understanding, the
       use of species and the role of monitoring are emphasised in this
       Building with Nature example.

       This section contains a video presented by Prof. Tinka Murk
       from Wageningen University. She is head of the Marine Animal
       Ecology research group and specialises in the adaptation of ma-
       rine organisms to changes in their environment. In this video, she
       will explain which non-living (abiotic) conditions are important for
       the formation and health of an ecosystem.

                           Polar            as plants, animals and microorganisms that live in interaction
                                            with each other and with their non-living, abiotic environment.

                                            the abiotic boundary conditions for ecosystem development

        Left: WUR. Right:                   mines ecosystem development is temperature. For example,
                                            most mangrove species do not tolerate temperatures below
Ecological Design Principles                zero degrees Celsius and reef building corals can't tolerate
                                            water temperatures below 18 degrees Celsius. We can rough-
                                            ly distinguish three climatic zones, a polar zone, a temperate
                                            zone and a tropical zone, each zone having its own character-
                                            istic ecosystems. If we zoom in to a more detailed scale, the
                                            second main determinant of ecosystem type is salinity.

                                            Ecologist distinguish the following salinity classes, namely
                                            fresh, brackish and salt water ecosystems. Each of these en-

                                                                                                                                                           3-97

                                            vironments is inhabited by different species, dependent on
                                            their salinity tolerance. The salinity tolerance of some species
                                            is very narrow and for others, such as salmon or eel, it is
                                            very broad. Along coasts, river banks and lake shores a third
                                            determinant is wave exposure. Systems with limited wave ex-
                                            posure, so called sheltered systems, are dominated by fine
                                            sediments. The salt marsh is an examples of an ecosystem
                                            that requires a sheltered environment. In wave exposed are-
                                            as, mostly sandy or rocky shores occur.

                                            A fourth abiotic factor relevant to ecosystem development is
                                            submergence time. Submergence time is reflected in tidal
                                            zonation. The lower tidal area that is constantly submerged
                                            is termed `subtidal'. Here we can find seagrasses and coral
                                            reefs. The upper area that is rarely submerged is called the
                                            `supratidal' area. Here we can find species that can tolerate
                                            an occasional salty bath such as the purple sea lavender. The
                                            area in between is the intertidal. This area is air-exposed dur-
                                            ing low tides and submerged during high tides. Oysters and

            availability in water is correlated with water depth and turbid-
            ity. The amount of light absorbing materials in the water is
            turbidity. In clear and shallow waters, light availability is high,
            promoting the formation of coral reefs, seagrass beds and
            other types of submerged vegetation.

            Finally, the sixth important abiotic factor is nutrient availability.
            Inorganic nutrients and minerals such as nitrogen, phospho-
            rous and iron are necessary for the growth and survival of
            plants and phytoplankton. The amount of nutrients in the sys-
            tem can depend on the soil type, the upwelling of nutrient-rich
            deep waters, and river run-off. Systems with a high amount
            of nutrients are termed eutrophic, and systems with a low
            amount of nutrients are termed oligotrophic. These systems
            are usually associated with clear water.

            We have distinguished six abiotic factors that determine the
            abiotic boundary conditions for ecosystem development in

3-98

            coastal and riverine areas: temperature, salinity, wave expo-
            sure, submergence time, light availability and nutrient availa-
            bility. These factors can vary greatly over different seasons.
            In particular, temperature and the availability of light and nu-
            trients can vary from summer to winter.

              The six abiotic factors and their seasonal variations primari-
            ly determine which species are able to survive at a specific lo-
            cality. So, they determine what type of ecosystem can devel-
            op. In practice, this means that not every ecosystem can be
            created everywhere, simply because we are not able to con-
            trol all these abiotic factors. However, if abiotic conditions are
            suitable, we can use ecosystem functions for `building with
            nature'. Oyster reefs and coral reefs for instance are effective
            in breaking waves. And sea grass beds, salt marshes and
            mangrove forests are very effective in protecting sediment
            against erosion. The appropriate ecosystems to consider in
            a building with nature design process will depend on both the
            abiotic boundary conditions and the desired functions of the
            ecosystems within your engineering design.

       This section contains a video presented by Dr. Ronald Osinga
       from Wageningen University. He is a marine biologist, special-
       ised in corals and sponges. He will explain how ecosystems are
       formed by biota (animals, plants and micro-organisms), introduc-
       ing the ecological concepts of succession and zonation. He will
       also illustrate ecosystem maintenance using examples of key-

                                                 Within abiotic boundary conditions, ecosystems are formed and
                                                 maintained by biota, the living organisms. Every ecosystem is
                                                 unique, as it contains its own specific combination of plants,
                                                 animals and microorganisms that interact with each other.

                                                 neer plant species often are annual species. They ameliorate
                                                 the environment so that other species, that are secondary in
                                                 succession, can start establishing themselves, too. These
                                                 secondary succession species are often perennial plants,
                                                 such as herbs and small woody plants. They are followed by
                                                 shrubs and the final stage of succession often contains trees.

                                                                                                                                  3-101

                                                 The final stage of succession is generally called the climax
                                                 stage. Animals depend on plants for food and habitat, there-
                                                 fore also animal species composition often changes with the
                                                 succession process. Often, succession can be visible as
                                                 zonation in ecosystems. We speak of succession zonation
                                                 when the different stages of succession can be seen in spa-
                                                 tially separated zones. For instance, succession zonation of-
                                                 ten occurs within temperate saltmarshes, from the intertidal
                                                 flat towards the land.

                                                 The closest zone to the intertidal flat is called the pioneer
                                                 zone and is inhabited by pioneer species such as English
                                                 cord-grass and glasswort. Next to the pioneer zone comes
                                                 the lower marsh zone, which is inhabited by secondary
                                                 succession species. This is followed by a very diverse mid-
                                                 dle marsh, which contains a lot of different species and
                                                 colourful flowers.

                                                                                                        Understanding Ecosystems
       Most land inwards we find the high marsh, which is often
       dominated by grass species that form a rather homogeneous
       vegetation cover. This zone is only submerged a couple of
       times per year by really high tides. In the end the high marsh
       will naturally develop into land with herbaceous forest on it.

        Here, a different ecosystem develops as it is no longer oc-
       casionally submerged under sea water. Zonation also often
       is visible on sandy and rocky shores where submersion time,
       salinity and temperature determine which plant and animal
       species are able to survive in that area.

       An example is the barnacle that is able to withstand hours of     3-12. Species in middle and high intertidal marsh. Samantha DeWitt

       keystone species.

       The keystone species are crucial for ecosystem functioning.
       Their effect on the ecosystem is often larger than one would
       expect based on their abundance. The term originates from
       architecture. In big arch constructions, there is a single stone
       in the middle that holds together the entire arch. If this stone
       is removed, the arch collapses.

3-102

        Similarly, if keystone species are removed from an ecosystem
        due to for example a disease or overfishing, the ecosystem
        collapses and shifts towards a different type of ecosystem.
        Keystone species can fulfil a crucial role in the food web.
        They can be small predators or herbivores that prevent fast
        growing species to overwhelm the system. A good example
        are sea urchins on coral reefs. Fast growing macro-algae live
        on coral reefs; they can overgrow and smother coral.

        Fortunately sea urchins graze on these algae, thus keeping
        the coral clean and healthy. Due to mass mortality of sea ur-
        chins, algae became dominant on many reefs in the Caribbe-

                                                                       The number of species within an ecosystem is called Biodi-

                                                                       The blue species is more productive when it is colder and the

                                                                       will lose productivity under sub-optimal, warm, temperatures.
                                                                       However, in mixed grasslands, the other species can take

                                                                       Additionally, overall annual productivity of the mixed species

                                                                       biodiversity increases ecological resilience: a forest with only

       back to its original position. However, if this ball is pushed too
       hard, it will be pushed out of the bowl. In analogy, if the dis-    1             2
       turbance is too strong, the ecosystem cannot recover and will
       shift towards another state. This is also called a phase shift.

       In the previous video, we have already discussed such a
       phase shift. When small herbivores were removed from a cor-
       al reef, the ecosystem shifted from a coral dominated system,
       to an algae dominated system. We have talked about produc-
       tivity, stability and resilience of ecosystems in the light of bi-
       odiversity. However, ecosystems are never entirely constant.
       They adapt to perturbations and changes in conditions. Eco-
       systems are not engineering structures that are solid and stay
       in place. Dynamics form an intrinsic part of ecosystems and
       large disturbances of these dynamics could lead to a phase
       shift towards formation of a different ecosystem.

       You have now learned about the abiotic conditions that set the          Abiotic                Biotic
       boundaries for ecosystem development and biotic aspects
       that determine the formation and resilience of ecosystems.             Temperature            Succession

                                                                                                      · Stability
                                                                                                      · Resilience

       A crucial consideration is the size of the desired ecosystem.
       Ecosystem size should be considered from an engineering
       perspective as well as from an ecological point of view. The
       ecosystem should be large enough to sufficiently attenuate
       wave action. In addition it must provide enough space for eco-
       logical succession and the formation of suitable habitats. This
       allows development of a stable and resilient ecosystem.

       Related to ecosystem size is the principle of ecosystem con-
       nectivity. Ecosystems are often functionally related. For ex-
       ample, they need to be connected because of early life stages

       of animals. They develop in one ecosystem while adults of the      3-23. Connected ecosystems. eismannhans
       species live in another.
                                                                          3-24. Parrot fish. Rling / IdLoveOne
       A good example is the nursery function of seagrass beds, which                                                         Understanding Ecosystems
       is home to the juveniles of many coral fish species, such as the
       parrot fish. Without the presence of a healthy seagrass bed,
       coral reef fishes might not be present to maintain a healthy
       coral reef. Also, ecosystems need to be able to exchange
       genetic resources. This gene flow prevents inbreeding, thus
       contributes to healthy populations. Hence, if connected eco-
       systems become physically separated, or when the necessary
       connecting ecosystems are absent, the success of ecological
       engineering may be seriously compromised.

       You now know what is important for ecosystem development
       and functioning. Once you have decided what system you
       want to develop, a first challenge is: how to kick-start the for-
       mation of the desired ecosystem?

                                                                       to make room for aquaculture ponds. The loss of mangroves,
                                                                       however, resulted in massive land erosion and total villages
                                                                       were forced to move inland. In addition, the important nursery

                                                                  principles. If each of these principles are applied fully across
                                                                  multiple time and space scales, the inherent character and
                                                                  functional integrity of the ecosystem should be maintained.

                                                                  First, the principle of Continuity. This relates to the continui-
                                                                  ty of water and sediment flows and land-water interfaces in the
                                                                  ecosystem. An ecosystem could be well connected or very frag-
                                                                  mented. For instance, dams can interrupt the continuum of a riv-
                                                                  er, and alter the quantity of water and sediments available in the
                                                                  downstream river. Or, coastal defences such as closed groynes
                                                                  can interrupt the longshore transport of sediments, whereas an
                                                                  open groyne system continues to allow sediment transport.

                                                                  Second, the principle of No direct human disturbance.
                                                                  This aims to minimise or prevent direct human disturbance
                                                                  on the ecosystem. Where direct disturbance is allowed, the
                                                                  health of the ecosystem may be affected.

                                                                                                                        Ecological Design Principles
            The third principle of endogeneity relates to the level of           3-48. Invasive species: Zebra mussel in Europe and North America.
            invasion of an ecosystem by exotic species. A high level of                      F Lamiot
            indigenous species is preferred above invasive colonisation.

            vasive species above indigenous species.

            Fourth, the principle of Viability of Populations. A species
            is viable when it has the ability to persist. That is, its size ex-
            ceeds a critical threshold. When its size is below the thresh-
            old, the population might face extinction. An infrastructure
            should not threaten the ability of populations to persist, but
            instead should provide opportunities for endangered popula-
            tions and particular species.

            This brings us to the fifth principle of providing Opportuni-
            ty for Threatened Species. Because the ability of threatened
            species to thrive is compromised, particular attention can be
            paid to creating opportunities for their survival and restora-
            tion. Hydraulic infrastructures can help by offering, rather than
            denying, new habitats, restoring connectivity and improving
            circulation, for instance.

            Sixth, the principle of Trophic Web Integrity. Ecosystems
            are complex networks in which matter, energy and living beings
            interact.A fully representative trophic web has all levels and all
            species interacting in a healthy way. When critical species, also
            known as keystone species, are missing the integrity of the
            trophic web is harmed and the ecosystem is no longer healthy.
            For example, when urchins are missing from a coral reef envi-
            ronment, algae take over and smother the coral.

            The seventh principle is Opportunity for Ecological Suc-
            cession. Ecological succession is the natural change in spe-
            cies present in an ecosystem over time. For instance, pioneer
            plant species that grow on a newly forming dune are later
            replaced by secondary vegetation as the dune becomes more
            stable. Finally, the ecosystem achieves its climax state when
            tertiary vegetation such as woodland is fully established. Ac-
            cording to this principle, opportunities for the process of dy-
            namic change should be ongoing and need to be offered for
            each and every stage from pioneer to climax.

                                                              The eighth principle of Zone integrity aims to ensure that
                                                              the natural mosaic of the ecosystem is fully represented. For
                                                              instance, an estuarine salt marsh is characterised by a con-
                                                              tinuum from submerged mud flat to the upland zone that is
                                                              only occasionally inundated.The presence of the full range of
                                                              zonal diversity is a condition for ecosystem health. When one
                                                              or more zones are missing, the integrity of the ecosystem is
                                                              compromised.

                                                              disrupted or pushed outside their natural ranges, the charac-

                                                              when dunes receive an excessive supply of nitrogen via air

                                                              and the natural dynamic movement of sand is limited.

                                                              The tenth principle of Characteristic physical-chemical
                                                              water quality aims to ensure that the natural distribution of
                                                              water quality states is maintained over time and space. When

                                                                                                                                                  3-121

                                                              water quality parameters are within their dynamic natural
                                                              ranges, ecosystem functions are supported. Otherwise, atypi-
                                                              cal events can be triggered. For example, when oxygen levels
                                                              become depleted, algal blooms and even fish kills can occur.

                                                              The last principle is that of Resilience. Resilience is the ca-
                                                              pacity of the ecosystem to maintain its integrity following con-
                                                              secutive disturbances. So, an ecosystem is resilient when it is
                                                              able to withstand and even benefit from reasonable, foresee-
                                                              able disturbances. An ecosystem is vulnerable when its char-
                                                              acter and functional integrity will alter after single disturbances.

                                                              To recap, there are 11 ecological design principles:

Now that you have learned about ecological design principles               8                          5
- for the non-environmental scientists amongst you - did you                         7       6
notice that it's all about conserving and restoring the dynamics
of ecological networks and landscapes over time and space!
And, for the environmental scientists - you may not have re-
alised that engineers can help in this endeavour. Engineers
can learn to design for healthy and functional ecosystems.
They can apply these ecological design principles to deliver
nature-friendly design!

Thank you for your attention.

Ecological Design Principles                                                                 Ecological Design Principles
    1. Continuity             Continuity of water and sediment flows and land-water inter-       Vold and Buffett (2008)
                              faces in the ecosystem. An ecosystem can be well connected         Freeman (1987)
2. No direct human            or very fragmented. A connected ecosystem allows the ex-           Sheaves (2009)
     disturbance              change of both living and non-living resources.                    Bélisle (2005)

  3. Endogeneity              For instance, dams can interrupt the continuum of a river,
                              and alter the quantity of water and sediments available in the
                              downstream river. This can also impair the migration of fish
                              species such as salmon and trout. Populations of salmon can
                              only thrive when they have access to both fresh and salt wa-
                              ter habitats.

                              In another example, coastal defences such as closed groynes
                              can interrupt the longshore transport of sediments, whereas
                              an open groyne system continues to allow some sediment
                              transport.

                              This aims to minimise or prevent direct human disturbance on       Vold and Buffett (2008)
                              the ecosystem.                                                     Lotze et al. (2006)
                                                                                                 Hannah, Lohse,
                              Where direct disturbance occurs, the health of the ecosystem       Hutchinson, Carr, &
                              may be affected. For instance, when dunes are forming, it is       Lankerani, 1994
                              important that colonising pioneer plants are not stepped upon
                              and damaged.                                                                                     3-123

                              Level of invasion of an ecosystem by exotic species, as re-        Vold and Buffett (2008)
                              flected by the relative abundance of indigenous and invasive       Lotze et al. (2006)
                              species. A high number of indigenous species, that belong          Alpert, Bone, and
                              in the local environment, is preferred above invasive coloni-      Holzapfel (2000)
                              sation. Invasive species can limit the survival opportunities      Suarez, Bolger, and
                              of native species. Therefore, a hydraulic structure or its as-     Case (1998)
                              sociated activities should preferably not advantage invasive       Gordon (1998)
                              species above indigenous species. For example, the Zebra           D'Antonio and Meyerson
                              mussel is an invasive species in European and North Ameri-         (2002)
                              can waters.                                                        Stohlgren et al. (1999)

                              Also, in restoring mangroves areas indigenous mangrove
                              species are preferred above non-indigenous species. This
                              has two main reasons; (1) the survival rates of non-indige-
                              nous species might differ significantly, and (2) the introduction
                              of non-indigenous species can lead to unwanted `invasion' of
                              the original ecosystems.

       4. Population viability       A population is a local, connected group of individuals of the
                                     same species that inhabits a specific area. A population is
                                     considered viable when it has the ability to persist. The viabil-     Vold and Buffett (2008)
                                     ity of a population is determined by reproduction, growth and         Boyce (1992)
                                     death rates and population size. The population size must             Akçakaya and Sjögren-
                                     exceed a critical threshold to be viable. When its size falls be-     Gulve (2000)
                                     low the critical threshold, the population may face extinction
                                     owing to a lower reproduction rate (and slow growth rate) in
                                     relation to the death rate.

                                       An infrastructure should not threaten the ability of popula-
                                     tions to persist, but instead should provide opportunities for
                                     endangered populations.

       5. Opportunity for            Threatened species are species specifically identified (on the        Cullen, Fairburn, and
            threatened               IUCN-red list, for example) as those whose ability to maintain        Hughey (2001)
              species                viable populations is compromised. This can be due to habi-           Wearn, Reuman, and
                                     tat loss. Hydraulic infrastructures can help threatened species       Ewers (2012)
                                     by offering new habitats, restoring connectivity and improving        Possingham,
                                     circulation, for instance.                                            Lindenmayer, and Norton
                                                                                                           (1993)
                                     This criterion focuses specifically on species whose survival is      Foin et al. (1998)
                                     known to be threatened and not on ensuring the viability of the

                                     (food web) exhibits interactions between producers (plants            McDonald (2009)

                                                                                                           Pusceddu, Gambi,

                                     system is no longer healthy. For example, when herbivores
                                     (plant eating organisms) are missing from a coral reef envi-
                                     ronment, algae take over and smother the coral.

       Ecological Design Principles                                                                        Ecological Design Principles
  7. Opportunities for        Ecological succession is the natural change in the species        Vold and Buffett (2008)
ecological succession         composition of an ecosystem over time. Succession occurs          Sousa (1979)
                              when organisms alter the environment in such a way that they      Sklar, Costanza, and Day
                              create habitats for other species. For instance, pioneer plant    (1985)
                              species that grow on a newly forming dune facilitate habitat      Ashkannejhad and Hor-
                              formation for secondary vegetation as the dune becomes            ton (2006)
                              more stable. The ecosystem achieves its climax state when         Doing (1985)
                              tertiary vegetation such as woodland is fully established.        Mitsch, Zhang, Anderson,
                                                                                                Altor, and Hernández
                              According to this principle, opportunities for the process of     (2005)
                              dynamic change should be ongoing and need to be offered
                              for each and every stage from pioneer to climax.

  8. Zone integrity           Zone integrity aims to ensure that the natural mosaic of the      Doing (1985)                  3-125
                              ecosystem is fully represented. The presence of the full range
9. Characteristic (in)        of zonal diversity is a condition for ecosystem health. When      Lotze et al. (2006)
    organic cycles            one or more zones are missing, the integrity of the ecosystem     Karr and Dudley (1981)
                              is compromised.                                                   Mengak et al. (2009)
                                                                                                Rabouille, Mackenzie,
                              For instance, an estuarine salt marsh is characterised by a       and
                              continuum from submerged mud flat to the upland zone that         Ver (2001)
                              is only occasionally inundated. A missing or underrepresent-
                              ed zone signals an imbalance in the ecosystem, possibly in
                              response to atypical abiotic forcing or habitat disturbance.

                              This principle relates to the integrity of the throughputs of
                              carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and silicon in an ecosystem.
                              Inorganic and organic cycles that are fully representative
                              and that function at all levels within their natural ranges, act
                              to support and enable ecosystem character and functioning.
                              When the throughputs are disrupted or pushed outside their
                              natural ranges, the character and functioning of the ecosys-
                              tem can alter.

                              For instance, when dunes receive an excessive supply of
                              nitrogen via air pollution, tertiary dune vegetation growth is
                              overstimulated and the natural dynamic movement of sand
                              is limited.

Ecological Design Principles                                                                    Ecological Design Principles
       10. Characteristic phys-      Water quality parameters such as temperature, salinity and
          ical-chemical water        dissolved oxygen strongly influence aquatic ecosystem func-
                   quality           tioning. This principle aims to maintain the water quality states
                                     within their natural range of variability over time and space.
                                     When water quality parameters are within their dynamic nat-        Lotze et al. (2006)
                                     ural ranges, ecosystem functions are supported. Otherwise,         Karr and Dudley (1981)
                                     harmful atypical events can be triggered.

                                     For example, when water exchange is limited, hypoxic (low
                                     levels of dissolved oxygen) or anoxic (no dissolved oxygen)
                                     areas can develop. In the ocean, areas in which the dissolved
                                     oxygen levels are not sufficient for the crabs, clams and fish
                                     to survive are termed "dead zones".

       11. Resilience                Resilience is the capacity of the ecosystem to recover and
                                     maintain its integrity after disturbance(s). Therefore, an eco-
                                     system is resilient when it is able to withstand and even ben-     Vold and Buffett (2008)
                                     efit from reasonable, foreseeable disturbances. The effects        Holling (1973)
                                     of disturbances depend on their duration, magnitude and fre-       Peterson, Allen, and

       As ecosystems are networks in which matter, energy and living
       beings interact, the 11 Ecological Design Principles can never be
       fully independent of one another. For instance, limiting human
       disturbance (principle 2) can improve opportunities for ecolog-
       ical succession (principle 7), and improving the population vi-
       ability (principle 4) of a keystone species can have effects on
       the trophic web integrity (principle 6). In a similar vein, ensuring
       that characteristic (in)organic cycles (principle 9) are maintained
       can assist in ensuring that dissolved oxygen levels remain with-
       in their naturally occurring ranges, and so ensure characteristic
       physical-chemical water quality (principle 10).

       By applying the 11 Ecological Design Principles fully across mul-
       tiple time and scales, however, you can connect your hydraulic
       engineering design choices with choices to conserve, restore or
       provide opportunities for the ecosystem.

Feedback on Assignment 3.1

By Prof. Jill Slinger and Ir. Graciela del Carmen Nava Guerrero

Assignment 3.1 consisted of three blocks: Form, Functioning and
Character. In Block 1, Form, you identified six wetland ecosys-
tems by their names: freshwater tree dominated wetland, sandy
shore, intertidal mud, estuarine waters, intertidal forested wet-
land and permanent river. In Block 2, we asked you to identify,
from a given set, the items that represented the functioning of the
wetland ecosystem in the image. You can compare your answers
by consulting the material of Section 3.2. Finally, in Block 3, we
asked you to select the Ecological Design Principles that were
integrated in the design of the hydraulic infrastructure or coastal
defence in the image.

In this feedback document, we share our thoughts on Block 3.
We will provide reasons to include, or exclude, functions for
each image.

                                                  The beach and dunes are unimpeded in their exposure to winds, waves and surges.

                                                  dense. However, there is little evidence for this effect in the image.

                                                  The high mobility of non-stabilised dunes enables the dune ecosystem to maintain
                                                  its integrity and even benefit from disturbances. The two dune rows evident in the
                                                  image, mean that the dunes could withstand foreseeable consecutive disturbances

In reality, determining whether the design of a hydraulic infra-
structure or a coastal defence adheres to the Ecological Design
Principles is not straightforward. It requires the knowledge of an
ecologist to complete fully, and usually cannot be answered with
"Yes" or "No". To account for this complexity, in Assignment 4, we
will ask you to analyse your own design using a slightly different
approach. You can learn about it at the end of this chapter, in

Introduction

Assignment 3.2 acts as practice for the Assignment in chapter
4, in which you will need to report and explain how you apply
the Ecological Design Principles in your proposed / sketched de-
sign. The reporting format that you use in Assignment 3.2 forms
a component of your chapter 4 Assignment when you will apply it
to your own Building with Nature design.
To get ready for the chapter, we ask you to practise by complet-

In short, the primary problem owner or client is the Dutch Minis-
try of Infrastructure and Water Management, who is tasked with
ensuring that appropriate planning is undertaken to ensure the
safety from flooding in the Netherlands. It is they who commis-
sion studies to determine the predicted flood levels, and they
who then determine the desired reduction in flood level that must
be achieved through actions like de-poldering.

Good luck!

Where is the Noordwaard Polder located?
The Noordwaard Polder, depicted by the purple polygon (area),
is situated in the western part of the Netherlands, close to the cit-
ies of Dordrecht and Gorichem. The black polygon (area) in the

Hints and Information for Building with Nature Design

By Prof. Jill Slinger and Ir. Graciela del Carmen Nava Guerrero

As part of the Room for the River programme, several altera-
tive interventions were considered for the City with Nature Case.
These alternatives were screened using the Dutch planning kit
"Blokkendoos" to simulate the effects of different potential inter-
ventions on high water level during floods in the Waal River in
Nijmegen.

In Figure 4-29, a screen shot of the Dutch planning kit "Blok-          4-29. Planning kit output for the River Waal. Ruimte voor de Rivier
kendoos" is depicted. The red line represents the predicted high
water level which has to be lowered by an average of 30 cm
over the whole branch of the river Waal near Nijmegen (to reach
the orange line - the desired high water level). The planning kit
allows the user to test different interventions and to learn about

the Netherlands of the necessity to approve a key planning de-
cision and law that brought the Room for the River programme
into being. In particular, the planning tool helped with the difficult
decision of how to address the bottleneck at Nijmegen. A num-
ber of options were investigated, including deepening of the river
bed, raising the dikes along the Waal, and the construction of
a secondary channel to increase the discharge capacity of this
reach of the Waal river.

However, because it is important that the IJssel Lake remains
fresh, water can only be discharged to the Wadden Sea when the
water level in the Lake is higher than the water level in the Wad-
den Sea. As can be seen in Figure 4-34, this occurs for about
one third of the tidal cycle, when the water level in the sea is low,

       dike (see Figure 4-37) would have consequences for properties
       on the coast with accompanying costly and lengthy procedures.
       Seaward there are very few legal issues. There is a strategic
       environmental decision regarding sand mining from the seabed
       on the Dutch continental shelf. Particular areas are designated
       for sand mining, and there are prescriptions on the manner in
       which this is undertaken. So there are no practical limitations on
       the availability of sand.

       Potential Solutions
       A number of potential solutions have been explored for strength-
       ening the coast. Beach nourishment rather than reinforcing or
       raising the existing sea wall is seen as delivering more opportu-
       nities for recreation, tourism, nature and the economy. Similar-
       ly, high costs and delays are anticipated with managed retreat.
       Potential solutions could therefore involve reinforcing the coast
       with sand. The range of alternatives, depicted in Figure 4-37,
       includes:

          · Raising the dike. This conventional solution would also
                require dike heightening and broadening of the base of the

       The Wadden Sea coast stretches from Den Helder in the west,

Where is the Demak coast located?
Demak is a district located in the province of Central Java, In-
donesia, and lies on the northern coast of the island. As can be
seen from the map, the district has a ragged coastline of about
20 km, approximated by the dark blue line. Click on the map to

situation regarding coastal development in Demak.

Some hints
  · The Demak coast, Java, has a muddy substrate and many
        naturally occurring mangrove forests. However many man-
        grove areas have been lost in recent years owing to devel-
        opment, breaching of aquaculture ponds and groundwater
        extraction, among other influences.
  · Since 2000, severe coastal erosion of up to 1 km has oc-
        curred in places.
  · There is ongoing subsidence and the average sea level is
        rising, exacerbating the problems.
  · An effective design to combat ongoing erosion and pro-
        tect coastal communities from flooding is a challenging
        task that requires knowledge of how muddy coasts accrete
        rather than erode, and that takes the flood protection role
        of mangrove forests into account.

Safety level     A 3 km long ancillary channel 10 m below the crest height of the dike, with a total width of 200 m
                 (150 m at normal water levels) was created in a new floodplain area by relocating the dike at Lent
                 350 m inland of its previous location. The upstream end of the channel is not connected directly to
                 the River Waal so that it does not take too much water from the main channel. Water from the main
                 channel can flow over the barrier separating the river and ancillary channel only at high water lev-
                 els, increasing the discharge capacity of the river. At the downstream end of the ancillary channel,
                 there is a permanent connection with the river, and the ancillary channel is filled with water, creating
                 an island. The island offers excellent opportunities for the development of specific river biotopes. It
                 can also be used for purposes other than nature development, namely: work and leisure activities.

Abstract
Location               The Fish Migration River is an innovative plan to make the barrier of the Afsluitdijk passable to fish by
                       re-connecting the Wadden Sea and the IJssel Lake. This route will allow many migratory fish species
                       to pass between the marine and riverine environments and so reach their spawning and living areas
                       once again.

Safety level           The 3 kilometer long fish migration route connects the main channels in the Wadden Sea with the
                       IJssel Lake. The direction of flow in this migratory route depends on the tide. On the ebb tide, fresh-
                       water flows from the IJssel Lake into the Wadden Sea. On the flood tide, salt water flows from the
                       Wadden Sea into the IJssel Lake. The length of the connecting stream, and the fact that both ends
                       can be closed off, will prevent a high volume of salt water from flowing into the IJssel Lake. However,
                       the intention is that the opening can be used by fish every day of the year.
                       The dimensions of the opening in the Afsluitdijk will be:
                       · Height: 10 meter
                       · Width: 15 meter
                       · Length: 100 meter (the width of the Afsluitdijk)
                       · Water depth: 4 meters.
                       The opening in the Afsluitdijk can be closed under storm surge conditions.
                       The migratory route includes elements such as a soft sand bank and a straight stone dike. There will
                       be a gradual transition from marine to brackish to freshwater to allow the fish to become accustomed
                       to water of different salinity. It is estimated that 300 000 tons of stone, 1 million m³ of sand and 3000
                       wooden poles will be needed.

       A resilient mangrove-based
       economy has been created;
       people make optimal use of
       mangrove resources and are
       protected by a mangrove buffer
       zone. This buffer zone harbours
       rich biodiversity and stores
       substantial amounts of carbon.
       To avoid future mangrove losses,
       communities are supported to
       develop sustainable alternatives
       to harmful livelihood activities.

                       To achieve coastal safety in Demak, the choice was made to implement a hybrid engineering ap-
                       proach in which a healthy mangrove ecosystem is restored in combination with smaller flood defenc-
                       es. The solutions differ according to the variation in erosion intensity experienced along the 7.8 km
                       stretch of the southern Demak coast, and are specified per coastal stretch as described briefly below.
                       More detail can be found in Winterwerp et al. (2014).

                       Coast I (mild erosion): In the areas where erosion is still limited, the aquaculture ponds, channeli-
                       sation and degradation of tidal creeks have impacted on the hydrology of the area. This hampers
                       mangrove recovery and functioning. Here the focus lies on restoring the hydrology (river flows) and
                       the sediment balance and no permeable dams or mud nourishment occurs.

                       Coast II (severe erosion) and Coast III (severe erosion and land subsidence): In these severely
                       eroding settings, the sediment balance will be restored using permeable dams (Figure 1) and mud
                       nourishments. Once the erosion process has stopped and the shoreline has accreted to a sufficient
                       elevation, mangroves will colonise naturally. The mangroves then dissipate the wave energy further,
                       enhancing the capture of sediment in the sheltered waters behind the permeable dams. The man-
                       groves will eventually take over the wave dissipation, sediment accretion and flood defence functions
                       of these dams.

                     The measures are expected to halt the 100 m per annum erosion rate, successfully preventing the
                     loss of 6000 Ha of aquaculture ponds in the Demak district that are expected to flood by 2100 owing
                     to sea level rise.

       expansion was approved by the high court in 2009, 4 years
       after the original prohibition, and the Maasvlakte II, now the
       red area, was realised by 2013.

       Our learning on the importance of listening to stakeholders in
       designing and realising the extension to the Port of Rotterdam
       in the Rhine-Meuse Delta runs as a thread through the course
       in the hope that it will inspire you to undertake stakeholder-in-
       clusive, nature-friendly design, just as it inspired us.

       This course therefore explores why stakeholder-inclusive,
       ecosystem-based designs are needed in moving beyond
       standard hydraulic engineering. We draw on a number of in-
       ternational examples:

       · from the Volta Delta and its nearest port city, Tema, in
            Ghana,

         · to the Crocodile River,
         · the Tsitsa Catchment, and
         · the Great Brak Estuary in South Africa,
         · to Sierra Leone,
         · and Semarang in Indonesia.

       All of these cases have in common that standard engineering
       designs do not realise the opportunities to be found by work-
       ing with people and with nature. In this course we build on
       the previous Building with Nature MOOC, which distilled the
       Hydraulic Engineering and Ecological Design Principles - the
       H-E principles. In this course, the missing element of the So-
       cial Design Principles - the S principles - are developed and
       taught. So, this course moves from the HE - principles to the
       SHE - principles. It teaches you how to use Social Design
       Principles in developing more effective and sustainable hy-
       draulic infrastructure, with an emphasis on delta, coastal and
       port environments.

me that there's a great deal of interest in this way of thinking.

       Today I'm going to be asking you a really important question.        6-19. We all live on this planet of land and water together and what we do

       that if you do, that there are different ways of doing this. But
       importantly we want to co-create knowledge from diverse              6-20. Academic disciplinary knowledge. IWR, Rhodes University
       sources of knowledge and we call this commitment to drawing
       in different knowledges the transdisciplinary approach. The          6-21. Problems caused by us living in catchments. IWR, Rhodes University
       transdisciplinary approach is important because it locates us                                                                     Making a Difference?
       in the real world that we know. It's problem-focused. It is also
       importantly integrating different knowledge disciplines, our
       training and what we have learned to know. And fundamental-
       ly it is with and for society. It takes account of the fact that we
       live together on this planet. This planet of land and water. As
       we live we cause problems. We know we do. We know what
       those problems are. They include industrial and agricultural
       pollution, climate change, erosion.

       We know that we are trained in academic knowledge. We
       learn to be ecologists. We learn to be anthropologists. We
       learn to be engineers and we also each of us - and we don't
       take account of this as much as we should - we each of us
       have a lived knowledge. We have a contextual knowledge of

6-256

        the places we live in, of the way they work of who knows to
        do what. But what we're trying to do in the transdisciplinary
        approach is pull all of these things together.

        Now one of the first people who tried to do this formally was
        Max Neef and he looked at the foundations of knowledge,
        the empirical knowledge of what we know, mathematics,
        ecology, anthropology. The work that we do to get the knowl-
        edge. And then he said out of that knowledge that we have
        gathered we learn how to do things, we can do things like
        design and engineering.

        And there are so many things that we learn what to do that
        we have to select them. We have to choose which of those
        applies to the particular problem we're working with. And so
        we have these selective knowledges - we learn how to plan,
        we learn strategic adaptive management.

        But at the heart of it what do we actually do? How do we act?

            added some new and exciting ideas that helped pull things                        IWR, Rhodes University. Adapted from Steyaert and Jiggins (2007).
            together. Things like complexity, resilience, social learning,                                                                    Making a Difference?
            transformative social learning. And by doing this we have cre-
            ated a new language, a new way of talking about problems.
            But in order to talk you have to talk to somebody. You also
            have to listen to them. You have to have conversations so
            who are you having conversations with? You're having con-
            versations with government at all levels. You're having con-
            versations with industry. You're having conversations with
            people who manage resources and also people who live in
            resources. And it's important then to think about the way in
            which you're having these conversations. You're consciously
            trying to integrate. You're taking time to reflect in those reflec-
            tive spaces where you learn. You're learning how to collabo-
            rate and work with people that you never thought you might
            have to or be able to collaborate with. And out of all that you're
            paying attention to design, to the style, the shape of different
            interventions and you use case studies to do this. And out of
            all of this you build the transdisciplinary approach.

6-258

            So fundamentally, we worked in many different spaces and
            they all had all of them had a different feel, from a city hall to
            a rural hut. Out of all of these experiences and all of these dif-
            ferent contexts and all of these different knowledges we have
            to have ways of pulling things together.

            And so, if I'm going to ask you the question `Do you really
            want to make a difference?' I need to be able to give you
            some pathway some way of doing that and I'm going to sug-
            gest that this transformative pathway of pulling things togeth-
            er is through learning by doing. When we're faced with a prob-
            lem we do something, we watch what happens and we learn
            from that and our learning changes our doing. And so we do

            by doing takes us along a transformative space, where the
            situation we started with with all of its history takes us to a
            new place and addresses the problems that we were trying to
            grapple with right in the beginning.

The five diagnostic questions are:
  1. Can the problem be solved and the solution decided upon
        essentially by one actor (i.e. authoritarian) or by a consen-
        sual process of multiple actors (i.e., network)?
  2. Are the interests and objectives of the actors involved
        closely aligned?
  3. Is there consensus on the scientific and engineering knowl-
        edge?
  4. Is the issue considered vitally important to the people af-
        fected by the problem and potential solutions?
  5. Is there agreement that the decision is urgent?

    Video: Stakeholders and the Power-Interest Grid

       Dr. Alexander de Haan starts this video by explaining why we
       need to include and listen to stakeholders in complex problem
       solving. He then moves on to describe briefly how you identify
       stakeholders and what a power interest grid is.

       ers and the value of working with stakeholders. We're going
       to be talking about what it means to co-create knowledge and
       to learn together in wide groups of people who have different
       ways of knowing. We're going to be talking about the Croco-
       dile River in South Africa which like many rivers in southern
       Africa arise in highly industrialised areas with many urban
       areas and agriculture around them but also people discharg-
       ing sewage. There are two main water-quality impacts in this
       kind of a catchment. The water quality impacts come from
       salts which come mainly from the industries, and also from
       irrigated agriculture. And, also increased nutrients coming
       from fertilised agricultural fields and from Wastewater Treat-
       ment Works that maybe aren't working as well as they should,

       is the way rivers work. And you have rainfall. Rainfall falling
       on agricultural fields that have abstracted water in order to
       irrigate, and there are return flows with salts and fertilisers.

        our most prestigious national park and a protected area. So
        obviously we are wanting to improve water quality to maintain
        the kinds of things you want to happen in a national park. So
        we came in as a transdisciplinary team. I was the team lead-

        water quality and then had the opportunity in South Africa to
        work on an emerging water law and policy and out of that var-

Step 2 - Power-Interest Grid
Which of the stakeholders are highly interested in the situation
and have the power to influence it? Alternatively, who has a great
deal of interest, but no power or influence? And, who has power,
but no interest in the situation? The answer to these questions is
depicted in a Power-Interest grid.

You will need to have watched the introductory video by Dr. Al-
exander de Haan in 7.2. Stakeholders and the Power-Interest
Grid before attempting to complete Step 2. He explains how to
categorise stakeholders based on their power and interest in the
problem situation.

Now, take your key stakeholders from Step 1, and position them
one by one in the Power-Interest grid in figure 7-12 by consider-
ing their `power' and `interest'. The vertical axis is the power axis.

Step 4 - Visualising Resource Dependencies
What are the interdependencies amongst stakeholders?
A stakeholder A is said to be resource dependent on stakeholder
B, if B through their actions can enable (or prohibit) A to achieve
objectives. The figure below shows that A is resource dependent
on B for funds since the resources flow from B to A.

To answer, check as many boxes as you consider appropriate.

Mismatches in the scale preferences of the actors in the Be-
uningen/Ewijk pilot project impacted the design of potential
interventions by:

          constraining the size of the potential intervention
          to prevent effects on navigation
          avoiding complexity by limiting the number of
          actors involved
          connecting the intervention to similar actions
          elsewhere
          considering interventions on nearby or
          downstream floodplains
          limiting the location to the floodplain at
          Beuningen/Ewijk

Agreement
Joint research on further air quality improvement towards a 10%
lower target for the emission ceiling and the commitment of the
Port of Rotterdam harbour authority to act to realise the identified
and mutually agreed additional measures. Friends of the Earth NL
agreed to withdraw their appeal in court against the plans and in-
stead agreed to cooperate in the realisation of the plans.

The complicating situation preceding this agreement was that it
started with a negative relationship between parties. Friends of
the Earth NL had started an advertising campaign to fund the
legal costs of protesting against the port expansion plans (Figure
1). To bring the opposing parties together, an independent medi-
ating party was engaged.

       Today I want to tell you about a game-based analysis that was
       used to unravel the interactions amongst various stakehold-
       ers - or role players - following a decision by the South African
       national government to build a new dam just upstream of a
       small estuary.

       The playing field was the Great Brak Estuary, a relatively small   8-12. Great Brak Estuary. Susan Taljaard

       to strong wave action, and requires river flow to open again.
       The area is also a popular holiday destination, where many                                                  Applying Cooperative Game Theory
       of the houses and commercial properties lie within the flood-
       plain, making them vulnerable to flooding. To meet the water
       demands of a strategically important petroleum refinery in the
       area, the government decided to build the Wolwedans dam
       about 7 km upstream of this estuary.

       So, the playing field comprised an estuary of which the mouth
       closed from time to time, needing river flow to open, a pop-
       ular holiday destination where low-lying developments were
       vulnerable to flooding, and then came the decision to build a

        dam that would affect both river flow and flooding.

        Who were then were the role players? First, those who were
        in favour of building the dam, including both the national and
        regional authorities responsible for water planning, the petro-
        leum industry that needed the water, and also local farmers
        that could benefit from the dam during droughts.

        These role players formed what we can refer to as the Wa-
        ter Security coalition, with secure water supply as their main
        goal. They also had the power and financial resources to build
        the dam and so realise their goal.

        Then, there were the local role players comprising the resi-
        dents of the town, the local municipality and smaller indus-
        tries situated on the floodplain, for example small shops and a
        shoe factory. They formed the Local Citizen coalition that had
        the health and safety of the community at heart. As many of
        them were living in the area for years, they had local knowl-

       All in all, we can distinguish three games. The first one hap-
       pened during the early stages in the 1980's, characterised by
       conflict and distrust. So we named this "Defiance".

       Then followed the good times when there was enough water                                Water security
       for all, trust was built and everyone worked together. So we                       Onset
       called this game "Co-managing the estuary".
                                                                                                                        Outcome
       This was followed by a bleak period with drought, water was
       scarce and conflicts surfaced again. So we call this game
       "The Drought".

       Let's now analyse the dynamics amongst the various role
       players and their coalitions during each of the games. We
       schematise the corners of a triangle as representing the
       stakeholder (or actor) coalitions and their goals. So, any posi-
       tion in the triangle reflects the degree to which one or more of
       the coalitions has dominated the game. The closer to a cor-
       ner, the more that coalition's goals were achieved. The closer
       to the center, the more balanced the outcome.

                                                                          Local citizens                                    Environment

        With the Environment coalition gaining influence in Game 1,
        they started gaining the trust of the Local Citizens coalition.
        They shared their scientific knowledge with the local commu-
        nity and so all learned together. A hugely important factor dur-
        ing Game 2 was enough rain filled the dam fast so there was
        plenty of water for all.

                                                         outcome of this game was a revised environmental manage-
          Onset                                          ment plan in 2004. The plan adopted the newly gained scien-
                                                         tific knowledge and so they had learned by doing. The influ-
                                                         ence of the local citizens increased towards the end of this
                                                         game, reaching almost the perfect co-management balance!

                                                         But then in Game 3, the tables turn! First, new scientific
                                                         knowledge reveals that the minimum water requirements of
                                                         the system were much higher than initially estimated, and on
                                                         top of this, a severe unanticipated drought hits the area. The
                                                         Water Security coalition feared that they could not meet their
                                                         commitment to industry to guarantee water supply. So they
                                                         chose the route of least resistance, or so they thought, cutting
                                                         the water supply to the estuary.

                                                         unhappiness and an estuary without freshwater! To date
                                                         collaboration in the Great Brak still has not returned to its
                                                         heyday in the 2000's, mainly due to instability within the coa-
                                                         litions, and uncertainty in the implementation of government

                                                         So, we have applied game theory, using concepts like a play-
                                                         ing field, role-players, their goals, coalitions and the decision
                                                         outcomes to explore a real-life situation. But, what does this
                                                         example teach us? We learn that game theory is a useful tool
                                                         to apply in understanding decision making on complex envi-
                                                         ronmental issues, especially where a diversity of stakehold-
                                                         ers are involved. It allows us to distinguish value-based actor
                                                         coalitions and to explore how influences in decision making
                                                         shift over time - showing us who is dominant when. So, how
                                                         can game theory and coalition building contribute to sustaina-

       holders ready to adopt the innovation? And if not, what still
       needs to be done? Knowing this, a plan was then made of
       how to take the idea further. This often involves knowledge
       development, connecting people together and improving the
       innovation by increasing its benefits and reducing the costs.
       Pilot projects are a powerful instrument to facilitate such a
       process. So the Innovation Team initiated and organised sev-
       eral pilot projects.

        Here you see some examples of the pilot projects. First there     8-27. Flexible Groynes. SSRS Innovation Team

        sheep in this way, is part of the cultural heritage of the Neth-
        erlands, and could potentially boost the biodiversity. Here
        you see a bubble barrier designed to divert plastic onto the
        river bank so that the plastic can be removed. Here it's being
        tested. With regular river maintenance, a lot of tree trunks
        are collected from forests along the river. Instead of having
        to dispose of these, they can be used in the area itself. Here,
        three wooden screens have been constructed that reduce the
        impacts of waves on the banks and so prevent bank erosion.
        Another innovation is the semi-autonomous aquatic drone
        that can be used for monitoring the river. It has also been
        used for monitoring at the other pilot project sites.

Supplementary Reading

A supplementary reading for Chapter 8 is the journal paper "The
usefulness of game theory as a method for policy evaluation" by
Hermans et al. (2014). This paper has been selected because it
reviews and discusses the use of game theory in public policy
evaluation. It also presents an application of cooperative game
theory to the evaluation of Dutch coastal policy implementation.
When policy implementation depends on several interdependent
actors, the results suggest that game theory helps in opening up
the `black-box' of policy implementation by adding structure and
rigour to the study of social processes.

       Comments on Question 4
       The outcomes of a cooperative game are the different forms of
       collaboration that are possible between players of the game and
       the actors in real life. See the example of a 3 player game and its
       eight outcomes in the table below. The solutions are what each
       player can expect to receive, and the solution concept of the core
       is the potential space of collaborative agreements.

Social Design Principles  Principles for the Transdisciplinary Engagement process
       Video Transcript

       Presented by Prof. Tally Palmer and Dr. Athina Copteros

       A: We are speaking with Tally Palmer today. She is a trans-
       disciplinary researcher with a lot of experience of working
       within complex systems, and underlying complex systems
       are certain fundamental principles that have emerged through
       practice that she will be sharing with us today. Tally, let's start
       with the first principle around tolerating discomfort and unre-
       solved tensions and how these are a gateway to a new level
       of knowledge.

       T: We don't like everybody and not everybody likes us and it's       9-2. Principle 1. Tolerate discomfort and unresolved tensions as they are
       uncomfortable. But in the moments of discomfort there are                    often a gateway to a new level of knowledge, understanding and trust.
       little cues for yourself to learn to allow the discomfort to open                IWR, Rhodes University
       up something new for yourself.
                                                                            9-3. Principle 2. Be sensitive to "Aha!" moments of insights.
       A: And speaking of something new there are the `aha' mo-                         IWR, Rhodes University
       ments speak to us about those.
                                                                            9-4. Principle 3. Engage with balanced generosity: enquiring, listening and

       generous in sharing what happened in your head as you went
       `aha' is a really helpful thing.

       A: And inherent to that I would think is also this principle of
       generosity that you have.

       T: You see there are people like me who talk a lot and who
       don't find it difficult to intervene and say something that's in
       their head. There are also those people who are very quiet.
       And this notion of a balanced generosity is to cue yourself in
       to both listening and to speaking and sharing when you have
       something valuable to share.

       A: And in order for people to be comfortable to share there
       has to be a certain level of trust.

       T: Trust and building trust is the foundation and the glue of
       these processes. And trust comes from tolerance, people ex-
       perience you tolerating kindly and listening, and the trust that
       builds out of that is really important.

                                                                            A: And part of the arrivals is also that some people then

                                                                            T: I think this principle has been the heart and the anchor of

                                                                            this is going to happen helps you very much in just going for-

This section contains a video presented by Drs. Abel Knipping
and written by Abel Knipping, Jacobiene Ritsema, Cyntha Ni-
jmeijer and Jill Slinger. He explains the use of 8 themes for
assessing the implications of an infrastructural intervention in a
particular social context, drawing on an example from Semarang
in Indonesia. The design for the canal in the last slide was made
by Kuiper Compagnons.

            ter? Is its value only expressible in the number of floods it
            prevents or the number of boats that use it?                        9-14. Theme 3: Community. Witteveen+Bos
                                                                                                                  Themes for Assessing the Social Context
            We are in a paradigm shift. Projects with a singular 100%
            technical focus are getting smaller in number. Instead you see
            the focus is shifting from functional and financial aspects to
            societal aspects, added value and chances that arise besides
            the project's main goal.

            Integral projects also take the social aspects of infrastructural
            development into consideration. They provide an opportunity
            for the local community to participate, discuss and contribute
            ideas. But an infrastructure can have many effects on society
            as well, some positive and some being negative.

            Assessing these impacts of an infrastructure project on the natu-
            ral environment has been researched, institutionalised, regulat-
            ed and explained in text books for years. But how do we assess
            an infrastructure project's impact on the social environment?

9-342

            Well that's difficult. Because social structures are fluid, sub-
            jective and hard to grasp. Frank Vanclay identified 8 themes
            which we use to describe the social context. By assessing
            each of these themes and speaking to local stakeholders
            about the potential impact of an infrastructure project on these
            themes, we are able to assess potential social impacts in the
            early stages of a project. I will explain these themes through
            the example of a water as leverage project in Semarang Indo-
            nesia. Water as leverage proposed the rechannelling of parts
            of the city in order to increase its climate resilience.

              1. Theme 1 - Way of Life. Assessing the impact on this
                    theme involves asking questions like: How do you
                    spend your day? How do you earn your money? And
                    do you see economic opportunities when this infra-
                    structure development takes place? In Indonesia peo-
                    ple replied with `I sell rice on the market' to the second
                    question. Others identified a preferred new market
                    structure instead.

                                                                 the Wajang puppet theatre is an important cultural as-

                                                                 ple were not confident that the local authorities could

                                                            5. Environment - what are the main environmental issues
                                                                 in your community? We found that waste was disposed

                                                                 economically affected by this intervention? People in
                                                                 Semarang indeed feared that they would suffer loss of
                                                                 income after a potental relocation of this market. Others

                                                            8. For the theme - Fears & aspiration. What future do you
                                                                 see for your children in your community? The main as-
                                                                 pirations the people in Semarang had were to increase
                                                                 security, sanitation, waste management, and harmony
                                                                 in their community.

                                                                                              Themes for Assessing the Social Context
            And so we see that talking to people and gathering `subjec-        9-19. Theme 8. Fears and aspirations. Witteveen+Bos

            ture, helps in identifying potential opportunities for our infra-
            structure design - and these potential opportunities include
            local people, they help to avoid threats that are easily missed
            or disregarded when designing infrastructure only from be-
            hind our desk.

            Let us take this example of Semarang Indonesia. In the city
            we conducted interviews with local people. They told us they
            missed a communal area in their neighbourhood, a proper
            public place to meet.

            So instead of merely creating a big and broad canal that fulfils
            the need to drain flood waters rapidly, we designed the canal
            to also have space and facilities for this community to meet
            each other when the water level is low.

            So we see that a canal is more than just a functional flood
            drainage system. It can be a catalyst for social wellbeing,
            even a catalyst for a city's attractiveness!

                    on occasion, chimpanzees.

              2. And - there is also a surrounding population and hous-
                    ing near the river.

              3. There is river use for laundry and sanitation purposes.
              4. There is sand mining
              5. And there is diamond and gold mining.
              6. Furthermore there is fishing.
              7. And there is farming.

            So, what we did - we performed modelling to identify the risk
            of flooding.

            And what happens upstream if you construct a weir of 3 me-
            ters or 6 or 9 meters high?

              And you can see from the shaded areas that there is flood-
            ing. And - our Impact assessment results showed that there
            are many consequences for people and their living environ-
            ment. So, the red areas indicate potential major negative im-
            pacts for fish migration, fish stock, and community safety.

            And, the impact assessment further shows that there is a
            major negative impact on the important gallery forest and a
            loss of livelihood for sand, diamond and gold miners. The
            full implications of the anticipated changes are explored
            with stakeholders to establish both the consequences, po-
            tential opportunities, and possible mitigation measures for
            the hydropower infrastructure.

       Presented by Drs. Jacobiene Ritsema

       Once the full implications of the anticipated changes are ex-
       plored with stakeholders, a number of mitigation measures
       were proposed.

         For instance, building fish-friendly turbines or restricting the
       design to acceptable weir heights so that upstream water lev-
       els are acceptable. This is not an easy decision: a lower weir
       height means less profit for the investor!

         Even with such mitigation measures in place, some of the
       effects on the community still remain severe and would imply
       resettlement.

         The overall conclusions of the Environmental and Social
       Impact Assessment indicate that some sites are suitable for
       hydropower infrastructure development and others are less
       suitable or not suitable at all.

         So, by involving the community in the assessment at the fea-
       sibility stage, the construction of infrastructure that is unfriendly
       to people and nature is avoided, minimised or mitigated.

       And this is one of the ways how we support the Sustainable
       Development Goals.

       case study and Dr. Heleen Vreugdenhil on the issue of scales
       and innovation along the IJssel River.

       So, we can distinguish three kinds of social design principles:

       · The principles that deal with the substantive content of
            the social environment - the fabric or local social con-
            text of the infrastructure development.

       · The principles that deal with the stakeholder engage-
            ment process.

       · The normative principles matching with the Building
            with Nature concept.

       We will begin by distilling the normative Social Design Prin-       9-42. Partial solutions along an ever-evolving development path. IWR,

       ity-informed stance that acknowledges intrinsic uncertainties
       in dealing with multiple stakeholders and a dynamic wetland
       environment. We embrace the notion of multiple perspectives
       and partial solutions along an ever-evolving development path.
       For a particular locality, with its local stakeholders, a Building
       with Nature infrastructure design becomes a place-based inter-
       vention (see de Boer et al. 2019 for additional insight on this).

       This means that the normative Social Design Principles include:           1

         1. Adopt a complexity-informed stance, a complex mul-             5           2

               their interactions and feedbacks at many scales.

         2. Adopt a stakeholder-inclusive approach, acknowledging
               diverse knowledge sources, from disciplinary knowledge,
               public administrative knowledge to lived experiences.

         3. Adopt a value-based approach to infrastructure design,
               recognising value differences from the outset.

         4. Realise that uncertainty is inherent and adopt an adap-
               tive approach.

         5. Recognising that the Building with Nature concept is
               ecosystem-based and that infrastructure development
               has place-based effects on both the natural and social
               environments, engage in co-creation, co-learning and
               co-design to build coalitions for nature-friendly design.

            We add another substantive Social Design Principle to ac-
            commodate the issue of scale and to take account of cumu-
            lative effects or opportunities that extend beyond the local
            context. So the ninth principle is:

              9. Identify cumulative effects and opportunities

            This completes the distillation of the Social Design Principles
            for Building with Nature. I am quite aware that these principles
            are not complete, nor necessarily universal. They derive from
            co-design, co-creation and co-learning activities in countries
            with western democracies, although there were often very
            high power differences between stakeholders.

            I encourage you to apply and test these principles in your
            Building with Nature practice to establish their degree of ap-
            plicability more widely.

Part 2 of the video presented by Drs. Jacobiene Ritsema in
which she explains what happened in Sierra Leone in real-life.
The severity of the anticipated social impacts at sites 1 and 2
meant that the river community would have had to undergo re-
settlement if a hydropower weir were built there. The socially and
ecosystem-friendly decision taken was not to build a hydropower
weir at either of these sites.

       Who are you?
       My name is Kwasi Appeaning Addo, professor of Marine and
       Fisheries Sciences, University of Ghana. In the Sustainable
       Ports in Africa project, I am co-ordinating research activities, ad-
       ministration and science in Ghana, and connecting the project to
       people within Ghana.

       How did you come to be involved with Tema Port and this
       project?
       The Netherlands African Business Council called me about po-
       tentially collaborating in an interesting project that involved ma-
       rine science. I started talking with other interested Ghanaian and
       Dutch parties and contributed to the research proposal. Finally
       we won the project, so here we are now.

Who are you?
My name is Edem Mahu. I am a lecturer in the Department of
Marine and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Ghana. My
research focuses on sediment dynamics, pollution in marine sys-
tems and the cycling of metals and nutrients in the coastal ma-
rine environment.

How did you come to be involved with Tema Port and this
project?
Professor Appeaning Addo, contacted me to ask if I was inter-
ested in a potential position in a project on Sustainable Ports in
Africa. I was very interested and my name was included in the
proposal. My focus lies on the sediment dynamics of the Ghana
coast, especially the project area of Tema. I collaborate in the ge-

How did you come to be involved with Tema Port and this

I am involved in climate modelling, hydrological modelling,
and work with Professor Appeaning Addo on coastal modelling
through the DECCMA project. Through him I heard about the
SMART ports project, the Sustainable Ports. This was a little new

Tema New Town is on the leeward side of the harbour in terms of
sand transport and the shoreline experiences ongoing erosion.
Nourishment of the beaches with sand, would serve to address
this ongoing problem and would restore the sandy beach and
dune habitat.

Concerted effort to deal with plastic pollution along the coast
Volumes of plastic are found along the shoreline of Ghana, car-
ried downstream from where it is thrown by the rivers and accu-
mulating on the beaches. This is considered a problem by fisher-
men, and other users of the coast and beaches.

Who are you and what is your professional background?
I am Edward Kofi Osei, a man of diverse background with a di-
verse education ranging from business to law, and internation-
al relations. I have six degrees and have lived in Ghana and
abroad, spending most of my working life in the United States.

How are you involved with Tema Port / this project?
In March 2017, I was appointed Director of Tema Port by the
President (Nana Akufo Addo). I was asked to come back to
Ghana for this position. It has been quite an adjustment.

What do you think of Sustainable Ports?
It is a very interesting concept in the sense of how do you define
sustainability. Is sustainability dealing with the main functions of

I am Azonko Simpi. I am a musician by my degree, a sound
engineer and acoustician, inventor, and the CEO of World
Time Limited.

How did you become involved with Tema Port?
We want to get world time from a passive state to an active state
by connecting the time clock to music. To give authenticity to the
world time clock, we realised we had to go to the Greenwich Me-
ridian, and in Ghana this is of course in Tema. But when I came
to Tema, I realised it was not fully clear where the meridian is. So
we developed a landmark that would signify the location of the
Greenwich Meridian at the last point on land towards the Equator
and the South Pole. We have called this point Terra Nihil Locus
Mundiale (Land Zero Global Position). It is located at Latitude
5.37N, Longitude 0 and is right at Tema Port.

What the landmark about?
We envision the landmark as a tower combined with a cruise
terminal. Part of that landmark is a pillar right on the Greenwich

       I have been involved as a focal person in a lot of stakeholder
       involvement for projects in the port and the water sector. For GN-
       BCC I also work with a lot of water organisations in Ghana, like
       Unicef and WaterAid. I have a broad overview of the water sec-
       tor: the rural stakeholders, the districts, the businesses, the rural
       communities and district assemblies, mostly bottom-up.

       How is GNBCC involved with the Tema port?
       GNBCC is a membership organisation and we work to resolve
       our member's challenges. Quite a lot of them are involved in
       export, logistics, and taking care of container shipments, for in-

Who are you?
I am Solomon Tetteh and I was born in this community. I used to
work as machinist on a tanker and as a fisherman.

Can you introduce your community?
This community consists of the indigenous people of Tema. We
had to move when the port was developed between 1958 and
1962, but we are not benefitting from the port. Barely any of us
works there. Many of us are fishermen, but it becomes harder to
catch fish, we now have to go further away and use four times as
much fuel and spend a full night and day at sea to fish.

The port has degraded our community; there is no more sand

My name is Faustina Afrah Yeboah. I live in Tema and for three
years now I've worked at the Cargo Center Ghana Ltd, a com-
pany that works on clearing cargo and the logistics linked to
this. We have an office just outside the port premises, and in
our company about 27 people are employed. I'm a data-entry
officer, I enter information into the system for goods going in
and out of the port.

How does the new port development affect your work?
The new port development is very good, because it cuts delays
and therefor minimises workers stress. As the port expands, the
trucks will have more physical space to turn and move around.
This will reduce much of the congestion within the port itself. Cur-
rently, when there's a lot of on and off loading, the trucks often
get blocked and have difficulty getting in and out of the port. Fur-
thermore, the new development is aimed at a paperless system.
This makes my work easier; I can enter information quicker, and

What is your business and how long have you lived here?
We are the owners and managing directors of the Crismon hotel
in Tema Community 5. We started this business in 1998. First
we had only two rooms, but we have consistently reinvested the
profits. We built it up to the current luxurious hotel with a pool,
lounge and dining area, and party and conference rooms.

Does the new port development affect your business?
Well, it will a little for sure, as we are here in Tema and close
to the port. Some contractors from the new port development
come here, which creates extra business for us. We are currently

       Does the new port development affect Sakumono village?
       Construction has come very close to our community, but it does
       not affect us directly because the water does not come all the
       way to this place. The road is still in between. But if the port is

Lagoon Crab Fishing
Sakumono Lagoon

What is the Sakumono Lagoon used for?
Some people come here to worship the gods of the lagoon; they
used to come every year around Easter before they started their
fishing season. But now I do not see them. I myself go to the
lagoon to fish for crab. I go around looking for the holes. When
I find a hole, I'll mark it with a red rubber and set the trap. First
you have to open the trap, then put some cassava in and set a
small broomstick on it. If the crab enters, it will pull the cassava
under the stick. The crab is the trigger, it catches itself! I know
how it works; I come here for a long time already, started crab
fishing in 1982.

Has the lagoon changed much since that time?
Yes, it has changed very much. Before, there were many, many

sometimes you don't. If more people come to the fishing harbour,
we will sell more fish. And the people that buy fish will also buy
tomatoes, so we all will sell more.

What could be done to make selling your fish better?
It would be much better for us if we could have better cooling for
our fish; we would like brand new fridges. Now we only use our
fridges as cooler-boxes. And we have to buy ice, much ice be-
cause it melts very fast. It would be much better if we could have
these good (polystyrene) boxes.

       outboard motor.

       Does the port expansion affect your business?
       No, it does not affect my work right now. It is no problem. It will
       bring more business to me, because I can go with the speedboat
       to the new vessels and that will make an even better business

       better for you? Well, I would like many more vessels to come,
       but preferably these should be smaller tankers and fishing ships,
       because that is better business for me. The very large (contain-

I've been working in the Volta delta for six years now, and my real
passion is about sustainable management, which involves conser-
vation, livelihoods and economic development. One of things I am
advocating for is complete land use. This means all the available
lands should be put to the use they are suitable for, and then there
should be spatial planning. That can be the beginning of sustaina-
ble management of all the resources.

How is the Development Institute involved with the Tema
port project?
We became involved trough the Delft University of Technology,

How is the work of GNBCC related to the port expansion?
In 2015 GNBCC was involved in a tender towards the port ex-
pansion, we acted as a facilitator for the Dutch partners that sub-

don't initiate, but facilitate. In the practical sense of organising
things for members, but also with relations and connections.

What is a Sustainable Port to you?
A sustainable port would be a port that is eco-friendly, inclusive
towards the people living in and around the area, and economi-
cally sustainable. With that I mean that the companies and peo-
ple working there can sustain a profit, can benefit. Furthermore
a sustainable port means that it is well connected to other areas
and actors around the port. Not only the port in itself should be
sustainable, but also the connections to the hinterland.

        with site selection, master planning and the initial stages of
        design all of these pro-active investigations into - "what might
        be possible". Environmental Impact Assessment is often a le-
        gal requirement prior to construction of any new development.
        So, it is usually performed in phase with a detailed stages of
        design. It also stipulates requirements to be met during the
        construction or infrastructure construction. Environmental Sys-
        tems align best with operations and maintenance, providing the
        structured platform within which to conduct ongoing environ-
        mental performance and compliance assessments. And final-
        ly, Sustainability Assessment, aligns best with the overarching
        monitoring and auditing phases, providing a means of assess-
        ing the overall social and ecological sustainability outcomes in
        a particular port. But, how - would a Building with Nature ap-

         both ecologically friendly processes looking for development
         opportunities through participatory approaches. While Build-
         ing with Nature - the process of Building with Nature - often
         enters from the engineering perspective, Strategic Environ-
         mental Assessment is more strongly grounded in the social
         and ecological opportunities of the new development.

         So, these processes are complementary and can mutually
         benefit if they align through their knowledge and participatory
         platforms. So why then do we want to bring a SEA and Build-
         ing with Nature design processes together, trying to use the
         one to inform and refine the other? What is the added value?
         Most social and ecological issues in port development only
         emerge during the EIA phase. So, by pro-actively identifying
         and addressing these in the early planning and design stag-

                                                     Diverse perspectives were explicitly introduced in the 1st Workshop in Tema Port.
                                                     Global-local mismatch in port expansion were explained.

2. Aha moments

                                             The stakeholder engagement was designed for 3 rounds, but did not extend intensively
                                             over a long time. This means that Aha moments were less apparent and possibly oc-

                                             the usual project-based way of acting.

                                             Reflective moments were designed into the process for the research team, but not with
                                             all stakeholders.

                                             Free expression of ideas was encouraged in all engagement activities.

 7. Discontinuities                          This is a critical component of evey stakeholder engagement process extending over a longer
                                             period of time. It is unlikely that all of the same people will be able to be present throughout and

                                             There was a relatively smooth process. Perseverence was required in delivering copies
                                             of the book "Voices on Sustainable Ports" to each of the interviewees as many did not

                                                     Accounting for effects on the way of life of the people of Tema is taken into account
            1. Way of life                           through the layered stakeholder engagement approach, first allowing key port stake-
                                                     holders to realise the ramifications of a port for all of Tema and her coastal environs
              2. Culture                             and then bringing in the voices of the people such as fisherman, migrants, who had not
                                                     yet been heard.

                                                     Explicit attention for culture is not a focus of the approach. Yet, the spiritual significance
                                                     of the rock in the harbour to animist believers and the Gao tribe came up in the stake-
                                                     holder engagement process and were discussed with the Tema Port Director.

        3. Community                                 First, the formally recognised stakeholders relevant to the port were engaged. Thereaf-
                                                     ter all communities were considered, not just those that are formally recognised. So, the
        4. Political systems                         traditional leaders of Sakumono Village were consulted, as were Tema Church Village
                                                     and Tema New Town leaders.
        5. Environment
                                                     The stakeholder engagement process extended beyond the formally recognised au-
10-418                                               thorities. Different rounds of engagement were used to accommodate power differ-
                                                     ences, which would have made face-to-face meetings between stakeholders awkward
        6. Health and wellbeing                      and potentially unhelpful. Instead we, as scientists and facilitators, moved between the
                                                     groups.
        7. Personal and property
                     rights                          A wide range of BwN measures were envisioned. State of the art scientific knowledge
                                                     on coastal dynamics, ecosytem-based design and environmental economics was
                                                     shared with stakeholders. Offering this type of knowledge exchange provided a major
                                                     reason for stakeholders to attend workshops.

                                                     The effects of Tema port expansion on fishing livelihoods, and the health and wellbeing
                                                     of people who depend on the Sakumono estuary was considered explicitly, as were
                                                     issues of flood safety. But, general health and safety in the harbour or safety from road
                                                     accidents were not considered.

                                                     Not dealt with explicitly. By considering the people of Tema Church Village, an illegal
                                                     settlement, human dignity is considered.

        8. Fears and aspirations                     This formed a focus of the stakeholder engagement. In the 1st workshop future visioning
          9. Cumulative effects                      (utopic and dystopic) was applied, allowing people to depict their fears and aspirations.
                                                     In the 2nd interview round, people were explicitly asked about the future and how they
                                                     imagined Tema and her port would look.

                                                     Again, this is a strength of the engagement process. Interdisciplinary science was ap-
                                                     plied throughout so that cumulative and interconnected effects would become apparent
                                                     rather than hidden.

Stage 4 - Cooperative Game Theory
Cooperative game theory is applied here to identify players, moves, pay-offs and outcomes, in the game of Sakumono Lagoon
Restoration.

  Translating real world elements into Game Theory equivalents:

  Players
  1. GPHA, MPS form the player Port Development
  2. Delta Alliance, RAMSAR, City Planning, Scientists form the player Environment
  3. Sakumono Fishing Village, Tema Church Village, Tourism form the player Sakumono Locals
  Moves
  1. Increase the common solution space (core) by lobbying Port Development to help in restoring Sakumono Lagoon,
  2. Persuade Port Development to negotiate better tidal interaction at the mouth when the coast road is renewed in 5 to 10 years
  Pay-offs
  Enhanced fishing, restoration of livelihood, increased tourism, better environmental protection, wetland habitat restored and conserved, less
  flooding, perceived benefit from the port expansion
  Potential Outcomes
  Coalition between Sakumono Locals and Environment; Potentially broad coalition with Port Development

                                                                                                                                                 10-419

                                            alternative, but less costly for Port Developers and maintenance free.

                                            Restoration of Sakumono Lagoon, beneficial to Environment and
                                            Sakumono Locals, but requiring Port Development to invest in
                                            relationships, lobbying and possibly maintenance.

Does this Change your Ideas for Potential Coalitions?:

Yes, a lot of work will have to go into such a Sakumono Lagoon restoration and it would probably require international pressure from Wetland
Associations to achieve. Perhaps the most likely coalition is the Freight Forwarding Training as this has strong commercial benefits and
would also help in alleviating a 'felt' problem of congestion by trucks in Tema City.

        Stage 5 - Issues of scale
        The choice of scale determines the issues associated with the expansion of the Port of Tema and the coalitions identified. It par-
        tially determines the 3-round engagement strategy.

          Reflection:

          If a narrow focus of Tema Port and its expansion had been chosen then all the BwN and stakeholder engagement would have
          focussed only within the port area. To gain benefits from the engagement the scale of analysis has to be wider. That is why
          we chose the focus of Tema City and its coastal environs. Only then can feasible options to share benefits be developed and
          can a focussed engagement process be applied. A still wider scale that included the Volta Delta is also possible, but then the
          focus on the port would be diluted.
          The choice of scale is a trade-off that brings some issues into focus and others not. Here we chose for a focus on the port
          and the city in which it is located.

This book is based upon the edX MOOCs Engineering: Building with Nature
and Beyond Engineering: Building with Nature. The Engineering: Building with
Nature MOOC explores the use of natural materials and ecological processes
in achieving effective and sustainable hydraulic infrastructure designs, distilling
Engineering and Ecological Design Principles. In the Beyond Engineering:
Building with Nature course, the missing element of Social Design Principles is
developed and taught.

Join us in exploring the interface between hydraulic engineering, nature
and society!
