Why Abstract

The doi registration of the book forced the examination of what is written in this book.
This abstract is the result of this examination.

Short Abstract

Broadly speaking there are several approaches to teaching this topic fluid mechanics.
This book takes the practical approach in which tools are provided and pedagogical
approach is subordinated to practical. One of the feature of this approach is to combine
advance material with introductory material so that the interested student can dive in
material that the student is interested or skip it if not incline to do so. Specifically it
means kinematic is taken a secondary role and large emphasis in given to the integral
approach. Those delicate topics like smoke path are less practical and even though
more pedagogical or logical are push to background. A great emphasis was made to
make the material more coherent.

       As mandatory topics like the material properties has to presented and discussed.
The discussion presents what are fluids and present the topic of viscosity and surface
tension in midst other properties. Of course, a discussion on pressure and derivatives
is provided. A review of the base material like mechanics etc are supplied. The most
extensive converged of static material is display in this book. The material is not only
the most extensive but provide innovative material that was not publish in other books
(at this moment) for example, it has breakthroughs on ship stability. For example,
the erroneous common equations are explained and the equations that control the ship
movement are assigned. This situation is a strange case where the readers of this book
will be more knowledge about ship stability than some of researchers in this area who
are still living in the flat Earth.

       The book allocates several chapters to the integral analysis. In addition, the ideal
flow is investigated and illustrated. A large portion dedicated to the differential analysis.
Additional chapter deals with not cover material like added mass and transfer properties.
The reason that these topics are covered is to exposed the students and many cases
even the instructors to important issues that appear in real life. There are two chapters
dealing with one deals with one-dimensional compressible and one chapter deals with
two-dimensional flow. There is a chapter deals with elementary multi-phase flow.

       While this topic is not abstract, it is interesting point out that the USA gov-

                                                     vii
viii  ABSTRACT

ernment and others pay to violet these books' copyrights. The USA government have
put large amount of money to university of California to make publish so it appear
as if the government or the university of California published this book. There are
other plagiarizers of the book(s) some of which were sponsored by the government and
private donors. There are people like Sandip Ghosal in hope that no one will know,
maybe? These books are open content they are not public domain! Do not netscape
this content.

Long Abstract

Before diving in the specific, the difference between this books and other book have to
be explained. This book is better than other books not because better English (how
really cares?) but because the explanations more complete and other books are missing.
Two examples exhibit this difference this book to other books which are pressure at a
great depth and ship stability. For the early topic, this is the only book that provide this
solution and the fact that Sandip Ghosal from Northwestern plagiarizes this material
in his class is a compliment1 The later topic is ship stability which is very interesting
because it starts as a summer project for my kids who are at time in elementary school.
To supplement the ODE material they study with an actual experiment. The experiment
was not successful but grow to be amazing discoveries. This point where the common
knowledge of the rotation of ship was discovered. Mistakenly, in the past it was assumed
that the rotation point is at the metacenter, an imaginary point which measures the
ship's stability. In fact, all the books on stability, that were examined, believe in this
mistake. This assumption is wrong! Even for stationary conditions! Furthermore, the
rotation point (line) is moving absolutely and relatively to the body (even for quasi-static
stability). In other words, the rotation point is floating, depending on the geometry, a
fact which was discovered by Bar-Meir. Even with all other mistakes infecting the ship
stability, this error can reach to 400% (would you would like to be in ship build with
design of error of 400%?). For any pendulum, the rotation point move relatively to the
body, creates two effects: the moment of inertia changes and the pendulum becomes
a double pendulum. The double pendulum has two rotating arms attached to each
other. The double pendulum has no regular period and exhibits chaotic behavior. Large
sums of money were spent on the finding the natural frequency something that does
not really exist consequence of erroneous belief. This book is the only book (currently)
describing these phenomena and many other.

       What these issues demonstrate that even unclear topics are covered by funda-
mentals. It is important to understanding the basic principles of the physics. In the
first chapter the presentation what is considered to be fluid and under what conditions.
Later it followed by the brief history of the fluid mechanics with favorite flavor about
the disputes. The chapter also demonstrate how to find the properties when they are
provided. Thermodynamics review is a very minimalist as it the required class for most
students (if not all). Yet, currently this author is working on thermodynamics book

    1This issue is complicate. When he confronted with this fact he avoided a discussion. Did he try
to claim this solution to himself?
LONG ABSTRACT  ix

which hopefully be summarized and replace the current thermodynamics chapter. A
review of mechanics is followed and it contains several innovative ideas that were not
published before like how find the centroid of circle segment (I/A). The next chapter
is the most extensive and many innovative material like pressure at deep ocean. This
material plagiarizes by Sandip Ghosal from Northwestern University which is viewed as
a compliment.

       The next part (not a chapter) deals with integral analysis with mass, momentum,
moment of momentum, energy conservation chapters. The next part is followed by
differential analysis which present conservation of mass, and any quantity. The next
chapter deals with dimensional analysis which this author view as the pinnacle of the is
books. The chapter and external flow and internal flow the dimensional analysis. The
potential flow is a traditional material that can be skip for underground as it complicated
and less useful. Yet it is provided in this book and it is mostly to self study material.
The last three chapters deal with one dimensional compressible flow, two dimensional
flow, and multi-phase flow.

       The appendixes provide some mathematical background.
x  ABSTRACT
                        Prologue For This Book

Version 0.6.9 May 31, 2023

pages (873 pages, size 15M

Adding many questions or examples from GATE. Fining several topics from added mass.
Still more work to do with the published papers in the next version. This version was
rushed published because request to get more material on GATE.

Version 0.6.7 July 5, 2022

pages 831 size 13.3M

New chapter on the open channel flow was added (over 30 pages). There was no time
to continue working on the added mass to finish the theory. From the work on fish
propulsion by this undersign several examples were added to various chapters. Several
images got face lift to improve the quality. It is so confusing to see the phenomenon
that critics of the book has two opposing point of views. One hand, Jiarong Hong
from University of Minnesota claims that Pushka equation should be eliminated from
the book on the ground that it is too complicated while on the other hand, Sandip
Ghosal from Northwestern University plagiarized the material and spent most of a week
to teach the Pushka equation in his class. Dr. Ghosal even had a question in final
about this material. Personally, I would disdain from individuals like Jiarong who hate
progress as my professor as far as I can. It would be nice to hear and get input on this
topic from others. Should only old material remain as exclusive material? What if the
old material leads to mistakes, should it be maintained as exclusive material?

Version 0.6.2 April 13, 2022

pages 795 size 12.0M

This section deals with added mass again. The reaction to the previous version was
overwhelming so many respond to it. As results of these discussions a clarity appeared.
The added mass was thought to be many small depending added mass elements the
velocity components that can be triggered on and off. None could explain what this
existence happened. Until it was realized in this book that the mass is a scalar with
value depend on the direction. Something that one should grateful to be able to explain.

xii  PROLOGUE FOR THIS BOOK

The only question to take the whole field to except it. It is hoped that the new area
of the open channel can be commenced even though the added mass is rewording. It
seems that area was infested with reporting like CNN and BBC reporting; never know
when they are telling the true.

Version 0.6.0 March 22, 2022

pages 773 size 11.8M

The more the added mass was investigated the greater revolution has been made. Could
you imagine that large part the work that with added mass is wrong. Is it possible?
This work dealing with marine maneuvering calculations, build effects under wind (also
fluid-solid interactions), high speed planes. While the air solid interaction is not that
significant, the water solid (normally, is extremely important). All these discoveries
make this author nauseating, and wonder if he lost his mind. The feeling of change the
entire field while it make one exhilarating and put a fear that one cannot discover so
much. Then start to ask whether something is hallucination happened. Only few topics
remained in marine hydrodynamics that were not touched by this project. It strange
to see USA federal government spend money on reports and books that are basically
contradict physics. Many of the research works that have done in the area will have to
be redone.

Version 0.5.5 March 17, 2022

pages 767 size 12M

A new chapter was added on the added mass as it so misused and to give researchers
introduction to this material. Additional source for the erroneous governing equations
attempted to fix in section of this prologue (0.5.2) is the transfer mechanisms discovered
by yours truly. Perhaps in the same category, the existence of the transfer properties
which some referred to them as the invisible properties in plain sight. As the added
mass they are with the dimension of matrix of 6x6. Yet opposed to added mass they
where discovered by a single person, this undersign. This material in process to be
added to book.

Version 0.5.2 July 11, 2021

pages 743 size 11M

The rewrite of ship stability section was the most fascinating in this round. After reading
that section (in this book), the reader (mostly undergraduate) will know more about
the topic than the (probably almost all) top researchers in the area at time of writing
this point. To emphasis this point some of the specific errors common believe theory
and corrections of these errors spell out (more in the book "Stability of Ships and Other
Bodies."). The common governing equations of ship motion are erroneous (in some
VERSION 0.4 APRIL 6, 2020  xiii

cases the error reach about 400% or more). One of the main reasons for this error is
the wrong determination of of rotation point of the ship. It is not this author thinks that
the researchers in the field are/were incapable. On the contrary, of the researchers were
superb engineers with great physical mathematicians skills like Ali Hasan Nayfeh. This
author even discovered that one of his education root is with this group researchers.
This author mentor was Professor Micheal Bentwich who worked with Professor Ernest
Oliver (Ernie) Tuck who was a student of John Nicholas Newman from MIT and the
author of Marine Hydrodynamics. This author views the science progress by line of
student-professor and himself to be an off chute just to stray way from this doctrine.

       It is a phenomenon that people believe that because the material is open content,
the material can be taken away or/and it is worthless and can be ignored. When
several research groups were informed about these new discoveries, On one hand, some
simply ignore (well who want to acknowledge that their 30 years work is worthless2).
On the other hand, others claimed that the new discoveries are "just" improvements
on the existing material. Such a diplomatic answer a kin to stating that ignoring
gravity is equivalent to applying gravity for falling objects, and stating that it is just
a correction. Other approach to solve the problem, to alleged a new rotation location
and to ignore the physics, for example, Thor Fossen in his book "Handbook of Marine
Craft Hydrodynamics and Motion Control" asserts that rotation is around the gravity
centroid (Guessing locations along with equations salad is a new technique in science).
One more approach published by the USA government and author from MIT3 which
claims that the ship is rotated somewhere but utilized the gravity centroid. So much
money with so little utility.

Version 0.4 April 6, 2020

pages 749 size 11M

What a change and what a strange experience was to write this book. This author
got many publishers who told me that the undersign need to "hand over" them the
book's copyright and in return they will allow him to use 50% even more of the book.
The most bizarre "offer" was from University of Washington Seattle from mechanical
engineering department by Jonathan Posner. He informed this author that Bar-Meir
must hand over the copyright and that Bar-Meir should be happy if they take over
writing the book because they (he and individuals in his department) more qualify than
Bar-Meir because they have a member in the national academy. Yes, they are well
more connected to the establishment. Perhaps the strange of all was what occur in the
following. The theory Bar-Meir developed on great depth pressure (Pushka's equation)
was plagiarized and taught by Sandip Ghosal from Northwestern University for two or
three lectures in his standard fluid mechanics class. This author view this action as a
compliment and do not intend to act legally.

    2example of such approach is John F. Wallace from Case Western university, suggested to all his
colleagues that "We should ignore all his [Bar-Meir] work like it never exist." While not in ship stability
but in die casting, the same idea persists.

xiv  PROLOGUE FOR THIS BOOK

       The instructor from mechanical engineering taught this material (Pushka's Equa-
tion) and was using almost verbatim copy of the example including my nomenclature
(from this book) without acknowledgment. While is flattering that the instructor was
plagiarizing my material, it is disturbing that he and others like him violating the copy-
right of open content material.

Version 0.3.2.0 March 18, 2013

pages 617 size 4.8M

It is nice to see that the progress of the book is about 100 pages per year. As usual,
the book contains new material that was not published before. While in the near future
the focus will be on conversion to php, the main trust is planed to be on add several
missing chapters. potto.sty was improved and subUsefulEquaiton was defined. For the
content point of view two main chapters were add.

Version 0.3.0.5 March 1, 2011

pages 400 size 3.5M

A look on the progress which occur in the two and half years since the last time this
page has been changed, shows that the book scientific part almost tripled. Three
new chapters were added included that dealing with integral analysis and one chapter
on differential analysis. Pushka equation (equation describing the density variation in
great depth for slightly compressible material) was added yet not included in any other
textbook. While the chapter on the fluid static is the best in the world (according to
many including this author4), some material has to be expanded.

       The potto style file has improved and including figures inside examples. Beside
the Pushka equation, the book contains material that was not published in other books.
Recently, many heavy duty examples were enhanced and thus the book quality. The
meaning heavy duty example refers here to generalized cases. For example, showing the
instability of the upside cone versus dealing with upside cone with specific angle.

Version 0.1.8 August 6, 2008

pages 189 size 2.6M

When this author was an undergraduate student, he spend time to study the wave
phenomenon at the interface of open channel flow. This issue is related to renewal
energy of extracting energy from brine solution (think about the Dead Sea, so much
energy). The common explanation to the wave existence was that there is always a
disturbance which causes instability. This author was bothered by this explanation.

    4While this bragging is not appropriate in this kind of book it is to point the missing and additional
further improvements needed.
VERSION 0.1 APRIL 22, 2008  xv

Now, in this version, it was proven that this wavy interface is created due to the need to
satisfy the continuous velocity and shear stress at the interface and not a disturbance.

       Potto project books are characterized by high quality which marked by presenta-
tion of the new developments and clear explanations. This explanation (on the wavy
interface) demonstrates this characteristic of Potto project books. The introduction to
multi-phase is another example to this quality. While it is a hard work to discover and
develop and bring this information to the students, it is very satisfying for the author.
The number of downloads of this book results from this quality. Even in this early
development stage, number of downloads per month is about 5000 copies.

Version 0.1 April 22, 2008

The topic of fluid mechanics is common to several disciplines: mechanical engineering,
aerospace engineering, chemical engineering, and civil engineering. In fact, it is also
related to disciplines like industrial engineering, and electrical engineering. While the
emphasis is somewhat different in this book, the common material is presented and
hopefully can be used by all. One can only admire the wonderful advances done by the
previous geniuses who work in this field. In this book it is hoped to insert, what and
when a certain model is suitable than other models.

       One of the difference in this book is the insertion of the introduction to multiphase
flow. Clearly, multiphase is an advance topic. However, some minimal familiarity can
be helpful for many engineers who have to deal with non pure single phase fluid.

       This book is the third book in the series of POTTO project books. POTTO
project books are open content textbooks so everyone are welcome to joint in. The
topic of fluid mechanics was chosen just to fill the introduction chapter to compressible
flow. During the writing it became apparent that it should be a book in its own right.
In writing the chapter on fluid statics, there was a realization that it is the best chapter
written on this topic. It is hoped that the other chapters will be as good this one.

       This book is written in the spirit of my adviser and mentor E.R.G. Eckert. Eck-
ert, aside from his research activity, wrote the book that brought a revolution in the
education of the heat transfer. Up to Egret's book, the study of heat transfer was
without any dimensional analysis. He wrote his book because he realized that the di-
mensional analysis utilized by him and his adviser (for the post doc), Ernst Schmidt, and
their colleagues, must be taught in engineering classes. His book met strong criticism
in which some called to "burn" his book. Today, however, there is no known place
in world that does not teach according to Eckert's doctrine. It is assumed that the
same kind of individual(s) who criticized Eckert's work will criticize this work. Indeed,
the previous book, on compressible flow, met its opposition. For example, anonymous
Wikipedia user name EMBaero claimed that the material in the book is plagiarizing, he
just doesn't know from where and what. Maybe that was the reason that he felt that is
okay to plagiarize the book on Wikipedia. These criticisms will not change the future
or the success of the ideas in this work. As a wise person says "don't tell me that it is
wrong, show me what is wrong"; this is the only reply. With all the above, it must be
xvi  PROLOGUE FOR THIS BOOK

emphasized that this book is not expected to revolutionize the field but change some
of the way things are taught.

       The book is organized into several chapters which, as a traditional textbook, deals
with a basic introduction to the fluid properties and concepts (under construction).
The second chapter deals with Thermodynamics. The third book chapter is a review
of mechanics. The next topic is statics. When the Static Chapter was written, this
author did not realize that so many new ideas will be inserted into this topic. As
traditional texts in this field, ideal flow will be presented with the issues of added mass
and added forces (under construction). The classic issue of turbulence (and stability)
will be presented. An introduction to multi-phase flow, not a traditional topic, will
be presented next (again under construction). The next two chapters will deals with
open channel flow and gas dynamics. At this stage, dimensional analysis will be present
(again under construction).

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,
                                   but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to
copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or non-
commercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to
get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made
by others.

             This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of
the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

             We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with

                                                    xlix
l  LIST OF FIGURES

manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not
limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject
matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this
License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
requiring permission under copyright law.

             A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.

             A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of
the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is
in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathe-
matics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or
with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
regarding them.

             The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Doc-
ument is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of
Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may con-
tain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections
then there are none.

             The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document
is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a
Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

             A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is
suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely avail-
able drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made
in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been
arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE  li

that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
             Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII with-

out markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly
available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed
for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF
and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing
tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

             The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to
appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
"Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

             A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that trans-
lates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "His-
tory".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

             The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming
warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
has no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

             You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commer-
cially or non-commercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies,
and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may
not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange
for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
conditions in section 3.

             You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

             If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice
requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
lii                                                          LIST OF FIGURES

the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher
of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.

             If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and
continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

             If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each
Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard
network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time
you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

             It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Doc-
ument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     4. MODIFICATIONS

             You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version
under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document,
thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses
a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the
         Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any,
         be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as
         a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for
         authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least
         five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
         fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.

     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the
         publisher.

     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE         liii

E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
    copyright notices.

F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public
    permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the
    form shown in the Addendum below.

G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required
    Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

 I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item
    stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version
    as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Docu-
    ment, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document
    as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as
    stated in the previous sentence.

J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to
    a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in
    the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the
    "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published
    at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
    version it refers to gives permission.

K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
    Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each
    of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

 L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and
     in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the
     section titles.

M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included
     in the Modified Version.

N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict
     in title with any Invariant Section.

O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

             If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you
may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this,
add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
liv                          LIST OF FIGURES

             You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties-for example, statements
of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
definition of a standard.

             You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts
in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover
Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the
Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you
or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not
add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
publisher that added the old one.

             The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any
Modified Version.

     5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

             You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided
that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original
documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work
in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

             The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple
Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each
such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same
adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of
the combined work.

             In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine
any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".

     6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

             You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various
documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.

             You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the
extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
copying of that document.
GNU FREE DOCUMENTATION LICENSE         lv

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

             A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to
limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other
works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

             If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the
Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within
the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

             Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute trans-
lations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections
with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may
include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions

                              About This Author

Genick Bar-Meir is a world-renowned and leading scientist who holds a Ph.D. in Me-
chanical Engineering from University of Minnesota and a Master in Fluid Mechanics
from Tel Aviv University. Dr. Bar-Meir single handily revolutionized the ship stability
field and die casting fields. Until recently the ship stability understanding is based on
metacenter established 300 years ago. Bar-Meir demonstrated that previous hold theory
prevented the ability to write the correct governing equations of ship movement. He
built the governing equations and explained that floating bodies have in addition to the
added properties there are transfer properties. These transfer properties responsible for
the transfer mechanism between the various modes of movement of the floating body.
An example to the revolution in Die Casting is the critical plunger velocity about 350
different teams from different universities and countries had attempted to solve this
problem. Yet, Bar-Meir was able to obtain the solution while all the other teams failed
miserably. In fact, every team claims that they succeed while all others fail. How one
know that Bar-Meir is right? His equations simply works.

             Dr. Bar-Meir was the last student of the late Dr. R. G. E. Eckert (the same
one who that they named Ec is his honor.). Bar-Meir is responsible for major advance-
ments in Fluid mechanics (Pushka equation (deep ocean pressure), shock dynamics,
etc.), particularly in the pedagogy of Fluid Mechanics curriculum. Currently, he writes
books (there are currently five very popular books and new baby (book) on the way),
and provides freelance consulting of applications in various fields of fluid mechanics.

             Bar-Meir also introduced a new methodology of Dimensional Analysis. Tra-
ditionally, Buckingham's Pi theorem is used as an exclusive method of Dimensional
Analysis. Bar-Meir demonstrated that the Buckingham method provides only the min-
imum number of dimensionless parameters. This minimum number of parameters is
insufficient to understand almost any physical phenomenon. He showed that the im-
proved Nusselt's methods provides a complete number of dimensionless parameters and
thus the key to understand the physical phenomenon. He extended Nusselt's methods
and made it the cornerstone in the new standard curriculum of Fluid Mechanics class.

             Bar-Meir developed a new foundation (theory) so that improved shock tubes
can be built and utilized. This theory also contributes a new concept in thermody-
namics, that of the pressure potential. Before that, one of the open question that
remained in hydrostatics was what is the pressure at great depths. The previous com-
mon solution had been awkward and complex numerical methods. Bar-Meir provided
an elegant analytical foundation (Pushka Equation) to compute the parameters in this
phenomenon. This solution has practical applications in finding depth at great ocean

depths and answering questions of geological scale problems.
             In the latest version a new, more accurate and hopefully a simpler method

to calculate the stability was developed by Bar-Meir. Additionally, Bar-Meir has shown
that the potential method has limitations because stability is compartmental which the
way the potential energy structure. Bar-Meir provided a way to improves this limitation.

             In the area of compressible flow, it was commonly believed and taught that
there is only weak and strong shock and it is continued by the Prandtl-Meyer function.
Bar-Meir discovered the analytical solution for oblique shock and showed that there is
a "quiet" zone between the oblique shock and Prandtl-Meyer (isentropic expansion)
flow. He also built analytical solution to several moving shock cases. He described
and categorized the filling and evacuating of chamber by compressible fluid in which he
also found analytical solutions to cases where the working fluid was an ideal gas. The
common explanation to Prandtl-Meyer function shows that flow can turn in a sharp
corner. Engineers have constructed a design that is based on this conclusion. Bar-Meir
demonstrated that common Prandtl-Meyer explanation violates the conservation of
mass and therefore the turn must be a round and finite radius. The author's explanations
on missing diameter and other issues in Fanno flow and "naughty professor's question"
are commonly used in various industries.

             Earlier, Bar-Meir made many contributions to the manufacturing process and
economy and particularly in the die casting area. This work is used as a base in many
numerical works, in USA (for example, GM), British industries, Spain, and Canada.
Bar-Meir's contributions to the understanding of the die casting process made him the
main leading figure in that area. Initially in his career, Bar-Meir developed a new
understanding of Mass Transfer in high concentrations which are now standard building
blocks for more complex situations.

             For some time Bar-Meir has worked on a project like rain barrels design, ex-
traction energy form breaking system, die casting design improvement for some private
companies. While the extraction energy project provide interesting problems it did not
be produce as much academic advancement because commercial secrecy. In fact, if
you interested in developing these patents you can contact this author (for example
extraction of energy from breaking system has estimated value of hundred of Billions).
These hand-on projects where a great enjoyment and exposed various issues that oth-
erwise were not on the radar of this author. These "strange" projects leads to new
understanding in ship stability (floating bodies). For example, the stability of floating
cylinder is for the first time was solved analytically.

             The author used to live with his wife and three children. Now his kids are
in medical school or already pass that stage and are on medical career. This fact is a
demonstration that while you can get your kids to understand calculus and do AP in
elementary school, you still can fall in their education. A past project of his was building
a four stories house, practically from scratch. While he writes his programs and does
other computer chores, he often feels clueless about computers and programming. While
he is known to look like he knows about many things, the author just know how to
learn quickly. The author spent years working on the sea (ships) as a engine sea officer
but now the author prefers to remain on solid ground.
                  How This Book Was Written

2023 Version

It is strange that with over 5 billion dollars in research grants one would expect serious
breakthroughs the area ship navigation, motion, and stability. Yet most of the work such
as location of the pivot points of the ship rotation, change of the governing equations
and so forth were done by this author. One only can wonder how this can be happened.
It is overwhelming the feeling to be at this situation. The effects are profound and even
the exam like GATE has to change the questions about this topic such as the rolling of
ship.

2022 Version

All the breakthroughs that were made recently because of frustration with the poor
explanations that existed on marine or ship stability issues such as added mass. For
example, the calculations of research work done in this area on added mass are simply
wrong and has to be redone. This discoveries are important and were added to book.

2021 Version

Many of the programs that were used initially in the book matured like vim currently
version 8 and up. Some other programs like tgif were replaced by other like ipe and
blender. The main change is that the material comes more from the industry. There
are more examples that originated from problems that were encounter in the industry.
Well probably the engagement with one work reflects in its writing. It is a hope that
this material will be well received as before.

Initial

This book started because I needed an introduction to the compressible flow book.
After a while it seems that is easier to write a whole book than the two original planned
chapters. In writing this book, it was assumed that introductory book on fluid mechanics
should not contained many new ideas but should be modern in the material presentation.
There are numerous books on fluid mechanics but none is open content. The approach
adapted in this book is practical, and more hands-on approach. This statement really
meant that the book is intent to be used by students to solve their exams and also

lx  HOW THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN

used by practitioners when they search for solutions for practical problems. So, issue
of proofs so and so are here only either to explain a point or have a solution of exams.
Otherwise, this book avoids this kind of issues.

             The structure of Hansen, Streeter and Wylie, and Shames books were adapted
and used as a scaffolding for this book. This author was influenced by Streeter and
Wylie book which was his undergrad textbooks. The chapters are not written in order.
The first 4 chapters were written first because they were supposed to be modified and
used as fluid mechanics introduction in "Fundamentals of Compressible Flow." Later,
multi-phase flow chapter was written. The chapter on ideal flow was add in the later
stage.

             The presentation of some of the chapters is slightly different from other
books because the usability of the computers. The book does not provide the old style
graphical solution methods yet provides the graphical explanation of things.

             Of course, this book was written on Linux (Micro$oftLess book). This book
was written using the vim editor for editing (sorry never was able to be comfortable with
emacs). The graphics were done by TGIF, the best graphic program that this author
experienced so far. The figures were done by GLE. The spell checking was done by
ispell, and hope to find a way to use gaspell, a program that currently cannot be used
on new Linux systems. The figure in cover page was created by Genick Bar-Meir, and
is copyleft by him.

             Over the time the book introduced me to others and make me engaged in
topics that I was not aware off. For example, the issue rain barrels design leads to
several examples dimensional analyses in the book. Another example, work on how to
convert the breaking energy of cars (consider the change of millage per gallon between
the city and the highway). This brought to the realization the maximum temperature
theory. Unfortunately the work finished before it complete due to lack of funding.
                                           Preface

                 "In the beginning, the POTTO project was without form,
               and void; and emptiness was upon the face of the bits
               and files. And the Fingers of the Author moved upon
               the face of the keyboard. And the Author said, Let
               there be words, and there were words." 5.

       This book, Basics of Fluid Mechanics, describes the fundamentals of fluid me-
chanics phenomena for engineers and others. This book is designed to replace all
introductory textbook(s) or instructor's notes for the fluid mechanics in undergraduate
classes for engineering/science students but also for technical peoples. It is hoped that
the book could be used as a reference book for people who have at least some basics
knowledge of science areas such as calculus, physics, etc.

       The structure of this book is such that many of the chapters could be usable
independently. For example, if you need information about, say, statics' equations,
you can read just chapter (4). I hope this approach makes the book easier to use as
a reference manual. However, this manuscript is first and foremost a textbook, and
secondly a reference manual only as a lucky coincidence.

       I have tried to describe why the theories are the way they are, rather than just
listing "seven easy steps" for each task. This means that a lot of information is presented
which is not necessary for everyone. These explanations have been marked as such and
can be skipped.6 Reading everything will, naturally, increase your understanding of the
many aspects of fluid mechanics. Many in the industry, have called and emailed this
author with questions since this book is only source in the world of some information.
These questions have lead to more information and further explanation that is not found
anywhere else.

       This book is written and maintained on a volunteer basis. Like all volunteer
work, there is a limit on how much effort I was able to put into the book and its
organization. Moreover, due to the fact that English is my third language and time
limitations, the explanations are not as good as if I had a few years to perfect them.
Nevertheless, I believe professionals working in many engineering fields will benefit from
this information. This book contains many worked examples, which can be very useful
for many. In fact, this book contains material that was not published anywhere else.
As demonstration, some of the work was plagiarized in famous American universities.

       I have left some issues which have unsatisfactory explanations in the book, marked
with a Mata mark. I hope to improve or to add to these areas in the near future.

    5To the power and glory of the mighty God. This book is only attempt to explain his power.
    6At the present, the book is not well organized. You have to remember that this book is a work in
progress.

Furthermore, I hope that many others will participate of this project and will contribute
to this book (even small contributions such as providing examples or editing mistakes
are needed).

       I have tried to make this text of the highest quality possible and am interested in
your comments and ideas on how to make it better. Incorrect language, errors, ideas for
new areas to cover, rewritten sections, more fundamental material, more mathematics
(or less mathematics); I am interested in it all. I am particularly interested in the
best arrangement of the book. If you want to be involved in the editing, graphic
design, or proofreading, please drop me a line. You may contact me via Email at
"barmeir@gmail.com".

       Naturally, this book contains material that never was published before (sorry
cannot avoid it). This material never went through a close content review. While
close content peer review and publication in a professional publication is excellent idea
in theory. In practice, this process leaves a large room to blockage of novel ideas and
plagiarism. Currently there over 30 individual who publish review of the book and several
web site discuss this book in particular and potto's books in general. If you would like
be "review" or critic to my new ideas please send me your comment(s) or publish in
the your favorite your web site. Even reaction/comments from individuals like David
Marshall who stated that the author should review other people work before he write
any thing new (well, literature review is always good, isn't it?). While his comment
looks like unpleasant reaction, it brought or cause the expansion of the explanation for
the oblique shock.

       Several people have helped me with this book, directly or indirectly. I would like
to especially thank to my adviser, Dr. E. R. G. Eckert, whose work was the inspiration
for this book. I also would like to thank to Jannie McRotien (Open Channel Flow
chapter) and Tousher Yang for their advices, ideas, and assistance.

       The symbol META was added to provide typographical conventions to blurb as
needed. This is mostly for the author's purposes and also for your amusement. There
are also notes in the margin, but those are solely for the author's purposes, ignore them
please. They will be removed gradually as the version number advances.

       I encourage anyone with a penchant for writing, editing, graphic ability, LATEX
knowledge, and material knowledge and a desire to provide open content textbooks and
to improve them to join me in this project. If you have Internet e-mail access, you can
contact me at "barmeir@gmail.com".
                     To Do List and Road Map

This book isn't complete and probably never will be completed. There will always new
problems to add or to polish the explanations or include more new materials. Also issues
that associated with the book like the software has to be improved. It is hoped the
changes in TEX and LATEX related to this book in future will be minimal and minor. It is
hoped that the style file will be converged to the final form rapidly. Nevertheless, there
are specific issues which are on the "table" and they are described herein.

       At this stage, some chapters are missing. Specific missing parts from every chap-
ters are discussed below. These omissions, mistakes, approach problems are sometime
appears in the book when possible. You are always welcome to add a new material:
problem, question, illustration or photo of experiment. Material can be further illu-
minate. Additional material can be provided to give a different angle on the issue at
hand.

ii  HOW THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN
  1 Introduction to Fluid Mechanics

1.1 What is Fluid Mechanics?

Fluid mechanics deals with the study of all fluids under static and dynamic situations.
Fluid mechanics is a branch of continuous mechanics which deals with a relationship
between forces, motions, and statical conditions in a continuous material. This study
area deals with many and diversified problems such as surface tension, fluid statics,
flow in enclose bodies, or flow round bodies (solid or otherwise), flow stability, etc.
In fact, almost any action a person is doing involves some kind of a fluid mechanics
problem. Furthermore, the boundary between the solid mechanics and fluid mechanics
is some kind of gray shed and not a sharp distinction (see Figure 1.1 for the complex
relationships between the different branches which only part of it should be drawn in
the same time.). For example, glass appears as a solid material, but a closer look
reveals that the glass is a liquid with a large viscosity. A proof of the glass "liquidity" is
the change of the glass thickness in high windows in European Churches after hundred
years. The bottom part of the glass is thicker than the top part. Materials like sand
(some call it quick sand) and grains should be treated as liquids. It is known that these
materials have the ability to drown people. Even material such as aluminum just below
the mushy zone1 also behaves as a liquid similarly to butter. Furthermore, material
particles that "behaves" as solid mixed with liquid creates a mixture that behaves as a
complex2 liquid. After it was established that the boundaries of fluid mechanics aren't
sharp, most of the discussion in this book is limited to simple and (mostly) Newtonian
(sometimes power fluids) fluids which will be defined later.

    1Mushy zone refers to aluminum alloy with partially solid and partially liquid phases.
    2It can be viewed as liquid solid multiphase flow.

The fluid mechanics study involve many fields that have no clear boundaries between
them. Researchers distinguish between orderly flow and chaotic flow as the laminar
flow and the turbulent flow. The fluid mechanics can also be distinguish between
a single phase flow and multiphase flow (flow made more than one phase or single
distinguishable material). The last boundary (as all the boundaries in fluid mechanics)
isn't sharp because fluid can go through a phase change (condensation or evaporation)
in the middle or during the flow and switch from a single phase flow to a multi phase
flow. Moreover, flow with two phases (or materials) can be treated as a single phase
(for example, air with dust particle).

       After it was made clear that the boundaries of fluid mechanics aren't sharp, the
study must make arbitrary boundaries between fields. Then the dimensional analysis can
be used explain why in certain cases one distinguish area/principle is more relevant than
the other and some effects can be neglected. Or, when a general model is need because
more parameters are effecting the situation. It is this author's personal experience that
the knowledge and ability to know in what area the situation lay is one of the main
1.2. BRIEF HISTORY  3

problems. For example, engineers in software company (EKK Inc, http://ekkinc.
com/ ) analyzed a flow of a complete still liquid assuming a complex turbulent flow
model. Such absurd analysis are common among engineers who do not know which
model can be applied. Thus, one of the main goals of this book is to explain what
model should be applied. Before dealing with the boundaries, the simplified private
cases must be explained.

       There are two main approaches of presenting an introduction of fluid mechanics
materials. The first approach introduces the fluid kinematic and then the basic gov-
erning equations, to be followed by stability, turbulence, boundary layer and internal
and external flow. The second approach deals with the Integral Analysis to be followed
with Differential Analysis, and continue with Empirical Analysis. These two approaches
pose a dilemma to anyone who writes an introductory book for the fluid mechanics.
These two approaches have justifications and positive points. Reviewing many books
on fluid mechanics made it clear, there isn't a clear winner. This book attempts to find
a hybrid approach in which the kinematic is presented first (aside to standard initial four
chapters) follow by Integral analysis and continued by Differential analysis. The ideal
flow (frictionless flow) should be expanded compared to the regular treatment. This
book is unique in providing chapter on multiphase flow. Naturally, chapters on open
channel flow (as a sub class of the multiphase flow) and compressible flow (with the
latest developments) are provided.

1.2 Brief History

The need to have some understanding of fluid mechanics started with the need to obtain
water supply. For example, people realized that wells have to be dug and crude pumping
devices need to be constructed. Later, a large population created a need to solve waste
(sewage) and some basic understanding was created. At some point, people realized
that water can be used to move things and provide power. When cities increased to
a larger size, aqueducts were constructed. These aqueducts reached their greatest size
and grandeur in those of the City of Rome and China.

       Yet, almost all knowledge of the ancients can be summarized as application of
instincts, with the exception Archimedes (250 B.C.) on the principles of buoyancy. For
example, larger tunnels built for a larger water supply, etc. There were no calculations
even with the great need for water supply and transportation. The first progress in fluid
mechanics was made by Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519) who built the first chambered
canal lock near Milan. He also made several attempts to study the flight (birds) and
developed some concepts on the origin of the forces. After his initial work, the knowledge
of fluid mechanics (hydraulic) increasingly gained speed by the contributions of Galileo,
Torricelli, Euler, Newton, Bernoulli family, and D'Alembert. At that stage theory and
experiments had some discrepancy. This fact was acknowledged by D'Alembert who
stated that, "The theory of fluids must necessarily be based upon experiment." For
example the concept of ideal liquid that leads to motion with no resistance, conflicts
with the reality.

       This discrepancy between theory and practice is called the "D'Alembert paradox"
4  CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO FLUID MECHANICS

and serves to demonstrate the limitationsof theory alone in solving fluid problems. As
in thermodynamics, two different of school of thoughts were created: the first believed
that the solution will come from theoretical aspect alone, and the second believed
that solution is the pure practical (experimental) aspect of fluid mechanics. On the
theoretical side, considerable contributions were made by Euler, La Grange, Helmholtz,
Kirchhoff, Rayleigh, Rankine, and Kelvin. On the "experimental" side, mainly in pipes
and open channels area, were Brahms, Bossut, Chezy, Dubuat, Fabre, Coulomb, Dupuit,
d'Aubisson, Hagen, and Poiseuille.

       In the middle of the nineteen century, first Navier in the molecular level and
later Stokes from continuous point of view succeeded in creating governing equations
for real fluid motion. Thus, creating a matching between the two school of thoughts:
experimental and theoretical. But, as in thermodynamics, people cannot relinquish
control. As results it created today "strange" names: Hydrodynamics, Hydraulics, Gas
Dynamics, and Aeronautics.

       The Navier-Stokes equations, which describes the flow (or even Euler equations),
were considered unsolvable during the mid nineteen century because of the high com-
plexity. This problem led to two consequences. Theoreticians tried to simplify the
equations and arrive at approximated solutions representing specific cases. Examples
of such work are Hermann von Helmholtz's concept of vortexes (1858), Lanchester's
concept of circulatory flow (1894), and the Kutta-Joukowski circulation theory of lift
(1906). The experimentalists, at the same time proposed many correlations to many
fluid mechanics problems, for example, flow resistance by Darcy, Weisbach, Fanning,
Ganguillet, and Manning. The obvious happened without theoretical guidance, the
empirical formulas generated by fitting curves to experimental data (even sometime
merely presenting the results in tabular form) resulting in formulas that the relationship
between the physics and properties made very little sense.

       At the end of the twenty century, the demand for vigorous scientific knowledge
that can be applied to various liquids as opposed to formula for every fluid was created
by the expansion of many industries. This demand coupled with new several novel
concepts like the theoretical and experimental researches of Reynolds, the development
of dimensional analysis by Rayleigh, and Froude's idea of the use of models change
the science of the fluid mechanics. Perhaps the most radical concept that effects the
fluid mechanics is of Prandtl's idea of boundary layer which is a combination of the
modeling and dimensional analysis that leads to modern fluid mechanics. Therefore,
many call Prandtl as the father of modern fluid mechanics. This concept leads to
mathematical basis for many approximations. Thus, Prandtl and his students Blasius,
von Karman, Meyer, and Blasius and several other individuals as Nikuradse, Rose,
Taylor, Bhuckingham, Stanton, and many others, transformed the fluid mechanics to
today modern science.

       While the understanding of the fundamentals did not change much, after World
War Two, the way how it was calculated changed. The introduction of the computers
during the 60s and much more powerful personal computer has changed the field. There
are many open source programs that can analyze many fluid mechanics situations. To-
day many problems can be analyzed by using the numerical tools and provide reasonable
1.3. KINDS OF FLUIDS  5

results. These programs in many cases can capture all the appropriate parameters and
adequately provide a reasonable description of the physics. However, there are many
other cases that numerical analysis cannot provide any meaningful result (trends). For
example, no weather prediction program can produce good engineering quality results
(where the snow will fall within 50 kilometers accuracy. Building a car with this ac-
curacy is a disaster). In the best scenario, these programs are as good as the input
provided. Thus, assuming turbulent flow for still flow simply provides erroneous results
(see for example, EKK, Inc).

1.3 Kinds of Fluids

Some differentiate fluid from solid by the reaction to shear stress. The fluid continuously
and permanently deformed under shear stress while the solid exhibits a finite deformation
which does not change with time. It is also said that fluid cannot return to their original
state after the deformation. This differentiation leads to three groups of materials: solids
and liquids and all material between them. This test creates a new material group that
shows dual behaviors; under certain limits; it behaves like solid and under others it
behaves like fluid (see Fig. 1.1). The study of this kind of material called rheology and
it will (almost) not be discussed in this book. It is evident from this discussion that
when a fluid is at rest, no shear stress is applied.

       The fluid is mainly divided into two categories: liquids and gases.The main differ-
ence between the liquids and gases state is that gas will occupy the whole volume while
liquids has an almost fix volume. This difference can be, for most practical purposes
considered, sharp even though in reality this difference isn't sharp. The difference be-
tween a gas phase to a liquid phase above the critical point are practically minor. But
below the critical point, the change of water pressure by 1000% only change the volume
by less than 1 percent. For example, a change in the volume by more 5% will required
tens of thousands percent change of the pressure. So, if the change of pressure is sig-
nificantly less than that, then the change of volume is at best 5%. Hence, the pressure
will not affect the volume. In gaseous phase, any change in pressure directly affects the
volume. The gas fills the volume and liquid cannot. Gas has no free interface/surface
(since it does fill the entire volume).

       There are several quantities that have to be addressed in this discussion. The first
is force which was reviewed in physics. The unit used to measure is [N ]. It must be
remember that force is a vector, e.g it has a direction. The second quantity discussed
here is the area.This quantity was discussed in physics class but here it has an additional
meaning, and it is referred to the direction of the area. The direction of area is perpen-
dicular to the area. The area is measured in [m2]. Area of three-dimensional object
has no single direction. Thus, these kinds of areas should be addressed infinitesimally
and locally.

       The traditional quantity, which is force per area has a new meaning. This is a
result of division of a vector by a vector and it is referred to as tensor. In this book,
the emphasis is on the physics, so at this stage the tensor will have to be broken
into its components. Later, the discussion on the mathematical meaning is presented
6                 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO FLUID MECHANICS

(later version). For the discussion here, the pressure has three components, one in the

area direction and two perpendicular to the area. The pressure component in the area

direction is called pressure (great way to confuse, isn't it?). The other two components

are referred as the shear stresses. The units used for the pressure components is [N/m2].

   The density is a property which requires that            

liquid to be continuous. The density can be changed

and it is a function of time and space (location) but

must have a continues property. It doesn't mean that 
a sharp and abrupt change in the density cannot oc-

cur. It referred to the fact that density is independent

of the sampling size. Figure 1.2 shows the density as

a function of the sample size. After certain sample                                  log 

size, the density remains constant. Thus, the density

is defined as                                             Fig. 1.2 - Density as a function of

                              m                             the size of the sample.

 It must be noted that  is chosen so that the continuous assumption is not broken,
that is, it did not reach/reduced to the size where the atoms or molecular statistical
calculations are significant (see Figure 1.2 for point where the green lines converge to
constant density). When this assumption is broken, then, the principles of statistical
mechanics must be utilized.

1.4 Shear Stress

0x The shear stress is part of the pressure ten-  U F
sor. However, here, and many parts of the

book, it will be treated as a separate issue.                 h

In solid mechanics, the shear stress is consid- y
ered as the ratio of the force acting on area x

in the direction of the forces perpendicular to           Fig. 1.3 - Schematics to de-

dergoes a shear stress between a short distance of two plates as shown in Fig. 1.3.

   The upper plate velocity generally will be

Where A is the area, the F denotes the force, h is the distance between the plates.
In this discussion, the aim is to develop differential equation, thus the small distance
analysis is applicable. From solid mechanics study, it was shown that when the force
per area increases, the velocity of the plate increases also. Experiments show that the
increase of height will increase the velocity up to a certain range. Moving the plate with
a zero lubricant (h  0) results in a large force or conversely a large amount of lubricant

results in smaller force. For cases where the dependency is linear, the following can be
written

                                                hF                             (1.3)

Equations (1.3) can be rearranged to be

                                          hA

Shear stress was defined as

                                                  F                            (1.5)
                                          xy = A

 The index x represent the "direction of the shear stress while the y represent the
direction of the area(perpendicular to the area). From equations (1.4) and (1.5) it
follows that ratio of the velocity to height is proportional to shear stress. Hence,
applying the coefficient to obtain a new equality as

                                                    U                          (1.6)
                                          xy =  h

Where  is called the absolute viscosity or dynamic viscosity which will be discussed

later in this chapter in a great length.

In steady state, the distance the up-

per plate moves after small amount of                       t0 < t1 < t2 < t3
time, t is

d = U t                              (1.7)

From Figure 1.4 it can be noticed that for
a small angle,  = sin , the regular ap-

proximation provides

                                     (1.8)

From equation (1.8) it follows that

                                                                               (1.9)

                                                         t
Combining equation (1.9) with equation (1.6) yields

                                                                               (1.10)

8            CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO FLUID MECHANICS

If the velocity profile is linear between the plate (it will be shown later that it is consistent
with derivations of velocity), then it can be written for small a angel that

                        dU                                                     (1.11)

                       t dy

Materials which obey equation (1.10) referred to as Newtonian fluid. For this kind of
substance

                                 dU                                            (1.12)
                       xy =  dy

Newtonian fluids are fluids which the ratio is constant. Many fluids fall into this category
such as air, water etc. This approximation is appropriate for many other fluids but only
within some ranges.

       Equation (1.9) can be interpreted as momentum in the x direction transferred
into the y direction. Thus, the viscosity is the resistance to the flow (flux) or the
movement. The property of viscosity, which is exhibited by all fluids, is due to the
existence of cohesion and interaction between fluid molecules. These cohesion and
interactions hamper the flux in y-direction. Some referred to shear stress as viscous
flux of x-momentum in the y-direction. The units of shear stress are the same as flux
per time as following

             F kg m 1  m U kg m 1
             A sec2 m2 = A sec sec m2

Thus, the notation of xy is easier to understand and visualize. In fact, this interpretation
is more suitable to explain the molecular mechanism of the viscosity. The units of
absolute viscosity are [N sec/m2].

   Example 1.1: Shear Between Plane                 Level: Simple

   A space of 1 [cm] width between two large plane surfaces is filled with glycerin.
   Calculate the force that is required to drag a very thin plate of 1 [m2] at a
   speed of 0.5 m/sec. It can be assumed that the plates remains in equidistant
   from each other and steady state is achieved instantly.

   Assuming Newtonian flow, the following can be written (see equation (1.6))

                       Pavg =  g h

Assume steady state conditions.

The velocity is

Where rps is revolution per second.
The same way as in Example 1.1, the moment can be calculated as the force times
the distance as

increase with temperature. This reasoning

is a result of the considerations of the kinetic theory. This theory indicates that gas

viscosities vary directly with the square root of temperature. In liquids, the momentum

exchange due to molecular movement is small compared to the cohesive forces between

the molecules. Thus, the viscosity is primarily dependent on the magnitude of these

cohesive forces. Since these forces decrease rapidly with increases of temperature,

liquid viscosities decrease as temperature increases.

    Fig. 1.6a demonstrates that viscosity increases slightly with pressure, but this

variation is negligible for most engineering problems. Well above the critical point,

both phases are only a function of the temperature. On the liquid side below the

critical point, the pressure has minor effect on the viscosity. It must be stress that the
1.5. VISCOSITY                                         11

viscosity in the dome is meaningless. There is no such a thing of viscosity at 30% liquid.
It simply depends on the structure of the flow as will be discussed in the chapter on
multi phase flow. The lines in the above diagrams are only to show constant pressure
lines. Oils have the greatest increase of viscosity with pressure which is a good thing
for many engineering purposes.

                                                        the shear rate.
In equation (1.5), the relationship between the
velocity and the shear stress was assumed to be
linear. Not all the materials obey this relation-
ship. There is a large class of materials which
shows a non-linear relationship with velocity for
any shear stress. This class of materials can be
approximated by a single polynomial term that
is a = bxn. From the physical point of view,
the coefficient depends on the velocity gradi-
ent. This relationship is referred to as power
relationship and it can be written as

                     viscosity

                 =K      dU n-1 dU                     (1.13)

                         dx                        dx

The new coefficients (n, K) in equation (1.13) are constant. When n = 1 equation
represent Newtonian fluid and K becomes the familiar . The viscosity coefficient is
always positive. When n, is above one, the liquid is dilettante.When n is below one,
the fluid is pseudoplastic. The liquids which satisfy equation (1.13) are referred to as
purely viscous fluids. Many fluids satisfy the above equation. Fluids that show increase
in the viscosity (with increase of the shear) referred to as thixotropic and those that
show decrease are called rheopectic fluids (see Figure 1.5).

       Materials which behave up to a certain shear stress as a solid and above it as
a liquid are referred as Bingham liquids. In the simple case, the "liquid side" is like
Newtonian fluid for large shear stress. The general relationship for simple Bingham flow
is

                xy = -  0 if |yx| > 0                (1.14)

                dUx = 0      if |yx| < 0               (1.15)
                 dy

There are materials that simple Bingham model does not provide adequate explanation
and a more sophisticate model is required. The Newtonian part of the model has to be
replaced by power liquid. For example, according to Ferraris et al (Ferraris, De Larrard,

1.5.3 Kinematic Viscosity

The kinematic viscosity is another way to look at the viscosity. The reason for this
new definition is that some experimental data are given in this form. These results
also explained better using the new definition. The kinematic viscosity embraces both
the viscosity and density properties of a fluid. The above equation shows that the
dimensions of  to be square meter per second, [m2/sec], which are acceleration units
(a combination of kinematic terms). This fact explains the name "kinematic" viscosity.
The kinematic viscosity is defined as

                                                                                                                                                            (1.16)
                                                                                       =

       The gas density decreases with the temperature. However, The increase of the
absolute viscosity with the temperature is enough to overcome the increase of density
and thus, the kinematic viscosity also increase with the temperature for many materials.

1.5.4 Estimation of The Viscosity

The absolute viscosity of many fluids relatively doesn't change with the pressure but very
sensitive to temperature. For isothermal flow, the viscosity can be considered constant
in many cases. The variations of air and water as a function of the temperature at
atmospheric pressure are plotted in Figures Fig. 1.9.

       Some common materials (pure and mixture) have expressions that provide an
estimate. For many gases, Sutherland's equation is used and according to the literature,
provides reasonable results3 for the range of -40C to 1600C.

The kinetic viscosity affected strongly by the temperature and it depend on the chem-
istry of oils. The kinetic viscosity is generally by what is referred as Arrhenius-type
relationship which given by the following (Talavera-Prieto, Ferreira, Portugal, and Egas

                            = A eEa/R T                                   (1.18)

where  is kinetic viscosity, A initial factor, Ea is the activation energy, R the gas
constant, and T the absolute temperature. There are relationship between the initial
factor the the value at high temperature which related by A = ln .

       For wider range of temperature the viscosity three parameters are need and it is
given by Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation:

                     ln  = AV F T + BV F T                                                             (1.19)

where AV F T = ln  and constants AV F T , BV F T , and T0 are the fitting parameters.
When the situation is more complex more complex equations are required.

Liquid metal can be considered as a Newtonian fluid for many applications. Furthermore,
many aluminum alloys are behaving as a Newtonian liquid until the first solidification
appears (assuming steady state thermodynamics properties). Even when there is a so-
lidification (mushy zone), the metal behavior can be estimated as a Newtonian material
(further reading can be done in this author's book "Fundamentals of Die Casting De-
sign"). Figure 1.11 exhibits several liquid metals (from The Reactor Handbook, Vol.

D.C. May 1995 p. 258.).

The General Viscosity Graphs

       In case "ordinary" fluids where information is limit, Hougen et al suggested to use
graph similar to compressibility chart. In this graph, if one point is well documented,
other points can be estimated. Furthermore, this graph also shows the trends. In Figure
1.12a the relative viscosity 탍 = /킸 is plotted as a function of relative temperature,
Tr. 킸 is the viscosity at critical condition and  is the viscosity at any given condition.
The lines of constant relative pressure, Pr = P/Pc are drawn. The lower pressure is,
for practical purpose,  1[bar].

       The critical pressure can be evaluated in the following three ways. The simplest
way is by obtaining the data from Table 1.4 or similar information. The second way, if
the information is available and is close enough to the critical point, then the critical
viscosity is obtained as

                킸 =       given                                            (1.20)

Viscosity of Mixtures

       In general the viscosity of liquid mixture has to be evaluated experimentally. Even
for homogeneous mixture, there isn't silver bullet to estimate the viscosity. In this book,
only the mixture of low density gases is discussed for analytical expression. For most
cases, the following Wilke's correlation for gas at low density provides a result in a
reasonable range.

Here, n is the number of the chemical components in the mixture. xi is the mole
fraction of component i, and 킿 is the viscosity of component i. The subscript i should
be used for the j index. The dimensionless parameter ij is equal to one when i = j.
The mixture viscosity is highly nonlinear function of the fractions of the components.

       In very low pressure, in theory, the viscosity is only a function of the temperature
with a "simple" molecular structure. For gases with very long molecular structure or
complexity structure these formulas cannot be applied. For some mixtures of two liquids
it was observed that at a low shear stress, the viscosity is dominated by a liquid with
high viscosity and at high shear stress to be dominated by a liquid with the low viscosity
liquid. The higher viscosity is more dominate at low shear stress. Reiner and Phillippoff
20                     CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO FLUID MECHANICS

suggested the following formula

is the experimental viscosity at shear stress approaching zero. The term s is the

characteristic shear stress of the mixture. An example for values for this formula, for

cylinder of 0.101 [m] radius and the                               ri
cylinders length is 0.2 [m]. It is given                                            h
that a moment of 1 [N  m] is re-
quired to maintain an angular velocity of  Fig. 1.13 - Concentrating cylinders

ber represent only academic question
not real value of actual liquid). Esti-
mate the liquid viscosity used between
the cylinders.

Solution

The moment or the torque is transmitted through the liquid to the outer cylinder.
Control volume around the inner cylinder shows that moment is a function of the area
and shear stress. The shear stress calculations can be estimated as a linear between
the two concentric cylinders. The velocity at the inner cylinders surface is

                Ui = r  = 0.1  31.4[rad/second] = 3.14[m/s]  (1.6.a)

The velocity at the outer cylinder surface is zero. The velocity gradient may be
assumed to be linear, hence,

                     dU  0.1 - 0           = 100sec    -1     (1.6.b)

A square block weighing 1.0 [kN] with a side surfaces area of 0.1 [m2] slides
down an incline surface with an angle of 20C. The surface is covered with oil

film. The oil creates a distance between the block and the inclined surface of
1  10-6[m]. What is the speed of the block at steady state? Assuming a

linear velocity profile in the oil and that the whole oil is under steady state. The
viscosity of the oil is 3  10-5[m2/sec].

   Solution

The shear stress at the surface is estimated for steady state by

                     =  dU dx = 3  10-5  1  10-6 U = 30 U                      (1.7.a)

The total fiction force is then

The gravity force that acting against the friction is equal to the friction hence

and equal to  and the rotation

be assumed to be linear.

Solution

In this cases the shear stress is a function of the radius, r and an expression has to
be developed. Additionally, the differential area also increases and is a function of r.
The shear stress can be estimated as

                                   U       r                                       (1.8.a)

   Fig. 1.15 - Water density as a function of temperature for various pressure. This figure
         illustrates the typical situations like the one that appear in Example 1.9

The density is a property that is simple to analyzed and understand. The density is
related to the other state properties such temperature and pressure through the equation
of state or similar. Examples to describe the usage of property are provided.

       Example 1.9: Temperature Density Bulk Modulus Level: Advance
    A steel tank filled with water undergoes heating from 10C to 50C. The
    initial pressure can be assumed to atmospheric. Due to the change temperature
    the tank, (strong steel structure) undergoes linear expansion of 8  10-6 per
    C. Calculate the pressure at the end of the process. E denotes the Young's
    modulus4 Assume that the Young modulus of the water is 2.15  109(N/m2)a.
    State your assumptions.

          aThis value is actually of Bulk modulus.

   Solution

     The expansion of the steel tank will be due to two contributions: one due to the
     thermal expansion and one due to the pressure increase in the tank. For this example,
     it is assumed that the expansion due to pressure change is negligible. The tank volume

    It can be noticed that 1 = m/L13 and thus

                                      1     =             1

    The change is then                1 +  T = 1 - P                                  (1.9.d)
    Thus the final pressure is                               E                        (1.9.e)

                                       P2 = P1 - E   T

    In this case, what happen when the value of P1 - E   T becomes negative or very
    very small? The basic assumption falls and the water evaporates.
    If the expansion of the water is taken into account then the change (increase) of water
    volume has to be taken into account. The tank volume was calculated earlier and since
    the claim of "strong" steel the volume of the tank is only effected by the temperature.

                                   V1 tank

    The volume of the water undergoes also a change and is a function of the temperature

    and pressure. The water pressure at the end of the process is unknown but the volume

    is known. Thus, the density at end is also known

                                         2 = mw                                       (1.9.g)

    The pressure is a function volume and the temperature P = P (v, T ) thus

1.6.2 Bulk Modulus

Similar to solids (hook's law), liquids have a property that describes the volume change
as results of pressure change for constant temperature. It can be noted that this
property is not the result of the equation of state but related to it. Bulk modulus
is usually obtained from experimental or theoretical or semi theoretical (theory with
experimental work) to fit energy-volume data. Most (theoretical) studies are obtained
by uniformly changing the unit cells in global energy variations especially for isotropic
systems (where the molecules has a structure with cubic symmetries). The bulk modulus
is a measure of the energy can be stored in the liquid. This coefficient is analogous to
the coefficient of spring. The reason that liquid has different coefficient is because it is
three dimensional verse one dimension that appear in regular spring.

       The bulk modulus is defined as

                       BT = -v    P                                          (1.29)
                                  v T

Using the identity of v = 1/ transfers equation (1.29) into

                       BT =       P                                          (1.30)

The bulk modulus for several selected liquids is presented in Table 1.5.

       In the literature, additional expansions for similar parameters are defined. The
thermal expansion is defined as

                                           1  v                              (1.31)
                                   P = v      T P

This parameter indicates the change of volume due to temperature change when the
pressure is constant. Another definition is referred as coefficient of tension and it is
defined as

                                          1    P                             (1.32)
                                   v = P       T v

This parameter indicates the change of the pressure due to the change of temperature
(where v = constant). These definitions are related to each other. This relationship
is obtained by the observation that the pressure as a function of the temperature and
specific volume as

                                   P = f (T, v)                              (1.33)

The full pressure derivative is

    dP =                           P    dT +        P    dv                  (1.34)

                                   T v              v T

On constant pressure lines, dP = 0, and therefore equation (1.34) reduces

                     0=            P    dT +        P    dv                  (1.35)

                                   T v              v T

From equation (1.35) follows that

                                 dv                 P                        (1.36)
                                                =-  T v

                                 dT P =const        v T

Equation (1.36) indicates that relationship for these three coefficients is

                                      T = - v                                (1.37)

The last equation (1.37) sometimes is used in measurement of the bulk modulus.
       The increase of the pressure increases the bulk modulus due to the molecules

increase of the rejecting forces between each other when they are closer. In contrast, the
temperature increase results in reduction of the bulk of modulus because the molecular
are further away.

    In the Internet the following problem ( here with LATEX modification) was posted
    which related to Pushka equation.

    A cylindrical steel pressure vessel with volume 1.31 m3 is to be tested. The
    vessel is entirely filled with water, then a piston at one end of the cylinder
    is pushed in until the pressure inside the vessel has increased by 1000 kPa.
    Suddenly, a safety plug on the top bursts. How many liters of water come out?
    Relevant equations and data suggested by the user were: BT = 0.2 
    1010N/m2, P1 = P0 +  g h, P1 = -BT V /V with the suggested solution of
    "I am assuming that I have to look for V as that would be the water that
    comes out causing the change in volume."

    V = -V P = -1.31(1000)/(0.2  1010)V = 6.55  10-7

    Another user suggest that:
    We are supposed to use the bulk modulus from our textbook, and that one is
    0.2  1010. Anything else would give a wrong answer in the system. So with
    this bulk modulus, is 0.655L right?
    In this post several assumptions were made. What is a better way to solve this
    problem.

    Solution

    It is assumed that this process can be between two extremes: one isothermal and one

    isentropic. The assumption of isentropic process is applicable after a shock wave that

    travel in the tank. If the shock wave is ignored (too advance material for this book5).

    the process is isentropic. The process involve some thermodynamics identities to be

    connected. Since the pressure is related or a function of density and temperature it

    follows that

                                      P = P (, T )              (1.13.a)
1.6. FLUID PROPERTIES                                                                    29
     Hence the full differential is                             End of Ex. 1.13

Equation (1.13.b) can be multiplied by /P to be

                   PP                    T     

The definitions that were provided before can be used to write

                                      dP = 1 BT d +  v dT            (1.13.d)

The infinitesimal change of density will be then

                                     1 BT d =  dP -  v dT            (1.13.e)

Thus, the calculation that were provide on line need to have corrections by subtracting

the second terms.

1.6.2.1 Bulk Modulus of Mixtures

In the discussion above it was assumed that the liquid is pure. In this short section a
discussion about the bulk modulus averaged is presented. When more than one liquid
are exposed to pressure the value of these two (or more liquids) can have to be added
in special way. The definition of the bulk modulus is given by equation (1.29) or (1.30)
and can be written (where the partial derivative can looks as delta  as

                                        V =  V P  V P                (1.38)

                                             BT          BT

The total change is compromised by the change of individual liquids or phases if two
materials are present. Even in some cases of emulsion (a suspension of small globules
of one liquid in a second liquid with which the first will not mix) the total change is the
summation of the individuals change. In case the total change isn't, in special mixture,
another approach with taking into account the energy-volume is needed. Thus, the
total change is

    V = V1 + V2 +    Vi = V1 + V2 +    Vi                      (1.39)

    5The shock wave velocity is related to square of elasticity of the water. Thus, the characteristic
time for the shock is S/c when S is a typical dimension of the tank and c is speed of sound of the
water in the tank.
30                       CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO FLUID MECHANICS

Substituting equation (1.38) into equation (1.39) results in

       Under the main assumption in this model the total volume is comprised of the
individual volume hence,

                         V = x1 V + x1 V +    + xi V                      (1.41)

Where x1, x2 and xi are the fraction volume such as xi = Vi/V . Hence, using this
identity and the fact that the pressure is change for all the phase uniformly equation
(1.41) can be written as

    V = V P    x1  +     x2  +렁+  xi

Rearranging equation (1.42) yields                                           (1.45)

1.6.2.2 When the Bulk Modulus is Important? and Hydraulics System

There are only several situations in which the bulk modulus is important. These sit-
uations include hydraulic systems, deep ocean (on several occasions), geology system
like the Earth, Cosmology. The Pushka equation normally can address the situations
in deep ocean and geological system. This author is not aware of any special issues
that involve in Cosmology as opposed to geological system. The only issue that was

    6To be added in the future the effect of change of chemical composition on bulk modulus.

not addressed is the effect on hydraulic systems. The hydraulic system normally refers
to systems in which a liquid is used to transmit forces (pressure) for surface of moving
object (normally piston) to another object. In theoretical or hypothetical liquids the
moving one object (surface) results in movement of the other object under the condi-
tion that liquid volume is fix. The movement of the responsive object is unpredictable
when the liquid volume or density is a function of the pressure (and temperature due to
the friction). In very rapid systems the temperature and pressure varies during the op-
eration significantly. In practical situations, the commercial hydraulic fluid can change
due to friction by 50C. The bulk modulus or the volume for the hydraulic oil changes
by more 60%. The change of the bulk modulus by this amount can change the response
time significantly. Hence the analysis has to take into account the above effects.

tween two adjoined phases or materials. There is a common misconception for the

source of the surface tension. In many (physics, surface tension, and fluid mechanics)

books explained that the surface tension is a result from unbalanced molecular cohesive

forces. This explanation is wrong since it is in conflict with Newton's second law (see

Example 1.14). This erroneous explanation can be traced to Adam's book but earlier

source may be found7.

    7Finding the source of this error was a class project early 1990 in Chemical Engineering University
of Minnesota.
32  CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO FLUID MECHANICS

    Example 1.14: Surface Tension Misconception Level: Intermediate

    In several books the following ex-                   c.v.
    planation is offered for surface ten-
    sion. "The cohesive forces be-           Fig. 1.18 - Surface tension erroneous

    uid are shared with all neighboring
    atoms. Those on the surface have
    no neighboring atoms above, and ex-
    hibit stronger attractive forces upon
    their nearest neighbors on the sur-
    face. This enhancement of the in-
    termolecular attractive forces at the
    surface is called8." Explain the funda-
    mental error of this explanation (see
    Figure 1.18).

    Solution

    It amazing that this erroneous explanation is so prevalent in physics and chemistry
    (check the standard books for general chemistry in any college). No one today will
    believe that mountain were crated by a cooling of lava yet this was the material in
    the author elementary school class. On personal note, die casting and ship stability
    disciplines and others are plagued such nonsense (for example, in die casting it was
    believed that for the critical plunger velocity that physics can be ignored. It was done
    by over 300 research teams still in 2021.). In fact, even in Wikipedia contains this
    erroneous explanation. The explanation based on the unbalance of the top layer of
    molecules. Consider the control volume shown in Figure 1.18. The control volume
    is made from a molecule thickness and larger width. If this explanation was to be
    believed it must obey Newton's Laws. However, as it will be shown, this explanation
    violates Newton's Laws and hence it is not valid. The entire liquid domain is in a
    static equilibrium and hence every element is static equilibrium including the control
    volume. The pulling on the left of control volume is balanced with forcing that pulling
    to the right. However, the control volume is pulled by the molecules below while
    there counter force to balance it. There are no molecules about to balance it. If this
    explanation was correct the top layer (control volume) was supposed to be balanced.
    According to Newton second Law this layer should move down and the liquid cannot
    be at rest ever. Obviously, the liquid is at rest and this explanation violates Newton
    second law. In the Dimensional Analysis Chapter, provide another reason why this
    explanation violate all what is known experimentally about the surface tension.

       The relationship between the surface tension and the pressure on the two sides
of the surface is based on geometry. Consider a small element of surface. The pressure

on one side is Pi and the pressure on the other side is Po. When the surface tension
is constant, the horizontal forces cancel each other because symmetry. In the vertical
direction, the surface tension forces are puling the surface upward. Thus, the pressure
difference has to balance the surface tension. The forces in the vertical direction reads

(Pi - Po) d 1 d 2 =  P d 1 d 2 = 2 d 1 sin 1 + 2 d 2 sin 2  (1.46)

       For a very small area, the angles are very small and thus (sin   ). Furthermore,
it can be noticed that d i  2 Ri di. Thus, the equation (1.46) can be simplified as

                                  11                        (1.47)

                                  R1 R2

Equation (1.47) predicts that pressure difference increase with inverse of the radius.
There are two extreme cases: one) radius of infinite and radius of finite size. The
second with two equal radii. The first case is for an infinite long cylinder for which the
equation (1.47) is reduced to

                                                1           (1.48)

                                                R

Other extreme is for a sphere for which the main radii are the same and equation (1.47)
is reduced to

                                           2                (1.49)

Where R is the radius of the sphere. A soap bubble is made of two layers, inner and
outer, thus the pressure inside the bubble is

                                           4                (1.50)

    A Tank filled with liquid, which contains n bubbles with equal radii, r. Calculate

    the minimum work required to increase the pressure in tank by P . Assume

    that the liquid bulk modulus is infinity.

    Solution

    The work is due to the change of the bubbles volume. The work is

                             w=        rf                             (1.16.a)

                                     r0

    The minimum work will be for a reversible process. The reversible process requires very

    slow compression. It is worth noting that for very slow process, the temperature must

    remain constant due to heat transfer. The relationship between pressure difference

    and the radius is described by equation (1.49) for reversible process. Hence the work

    is

        w=            P dv             rf                             (1.16.b)

    Where, r0 is the radius at the initial stage and rf is the radius at the final stage.
    The work for n bubbles is then 4   n rf 2 - r02 . It can be noticed that the work

    is negative, that is the work is done on the system.

Solution

In Figure 1.20 exhibits the liquid under the current study. The vertical forces acting
on the body are the gravity, the pressure above and below and surface tension. It can
be noted that the pressure and above are the same with the exception of the curvature
on the upper part. Thus, the control volume is taken just above the liquid and the
air part is neglected. The question when the curvature should be answered in the
Dimensional analysis and for simplification this effect is neglected. The net forces in

Solution

The difference lie in the fact that "missing"cylinder add additional force and reduce the

amount of liquid that has to raise. The balance between gravity and surface tension

is                                                              (1.18.a)

1.7.1 Wetting of Surfaces

To explain the source of the contact angle, consider the point where three phases

became in contact. This contact point occurs due to free surface reaching a solid

boundary.

The surface tension occurs between gas phase (G)

to liquid phase (L) and also occurs between the solid

(S) and the liquid phases as well as between the gas     S            G (air/gas)
phase and the solid phase. In Figure 1.21, forces

that the masses of the solid, liquid, and gas can be

ignored. Regardless to the magnitude of the surface

tensions (except to zero) the forces cannot be bal-

anced for the description of straight lines. For exam-  Fig. 1.21 - Forces in Contact

and in the tangent direction to the solid line the forces balance is                 (1.52)
                                                                                     (1.53)
                                           Fsolid = lg sin 
substituting equation (1.52) into equation (1.51) yields

                                          gs - ls = Fsolid

is a molecular phenomenon, thus depend on the locale structure of the surface and it
provides the balance for these local structures.

       The connection of the three phases-materials-mediums creates two situations
which are categorized as wetting or non-wetting. There is a common definition of
wetting the surface. If the angle of the contact between three materials is larger than
90 then it is non-wetting. On the other hand, if the angle is below than 90 the
material is wetting the surface (see Figure 1.22). The angle is determined by properties
of the liquid, gas medium and the solid surface. And a small change on the solid surface
can change the wetting condition to non-wetting. In fact there are commercial sprays
that are intent to change the surface from wetting to non wetting. This fact is the
reason that no reliable data can be provided with the exception to pure substances and
perfect geometries. For example, water is described in many books as a wetting fluid.
This statement is correct in most cases, however, when solid surface is made or coated
with certain materials, the water is changed to be wetting (for example 3M selling
product to "change" water to non-wetting). So, the wetness of fluids is a function of
the solid as well.

the pressure in the liquid above the liquid line (the dotted line in the Fig. 1.24). The

in more details in Chapter 4). The pressure, on the gas side, is the atmospheric pres-

it. Appalling equation (1.48) and using the pressure difference yields

       Equation (1.55) can be derived either by forcing a circle at three points at (x,
x+dx, and x+2dx) and thus finding the diameter or by geometrical analysis of triangles
build on points x and x+dx (perpendicular to the tangent at these points). Substituting
equation (1.55) into equation (1.54) yields

alternative presentation of equation (1.56) is

Integrating equation (1.58) transforms into            h         (1.59)

The constant Lp = / g is referred to as Laplace's capillarity constant. The units of
this constant are meter squared. The differential dh is h . Using dummy variable and
the identities h =  and hence, h =  = d transforms equation (1.59) into

       The constant is determined by the boundary condition at x = 0. For example if
h(x - 0) = h0 then constant = h0. This equation is studied extensively in classes on
surface tension. Furthermore, this equation describes the dimensionless parameter that
affects this phenomenon and this parameter will be studied in Chapter 9. This book is
introductory, therefore this discussion on surface tension equation will be limited.

    9This equation has an analytical solution which is x = Lp 4 - (h/Lp)2 - Lp acosh(2 Lp/h) +
constant where Lp is the Laplace constant. Shamefully, this author doesn't know how to show it in a
two lines derivations.

1.7.1.1 Capillarity

The capillary forces referred to the fact that

surface tension causes liquid to rise or pen- etrate into area (volume), otherwise it will h

not be there. It can be shown that the

height that the liquid raised in a tube due

to the surface tension is                        (1.68)                                            A       T heory

       But this simplistic equation is

unusable and useless unless the contact angle (assuming that the contact angel is

constant or a repressive average can be found or provided or can be measured) is given.

However, in reality there is no readily information for contact angle10 and therefore

this equation is useful to show the treads. maximum that the contact angle can be

obtained in equation (1.68) when  = 0 and thus cos  = 1. This angle is obtained

when a perfect half a sphere shape exist of the liquid surface. In that case equation

(1.68) becomes

   10Actually, there are information about the contact angle. However, that information conflict each
other and no real information is available see Table Table 1.6.
42                  CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO FLUID MECHANICS

Figure 1.26 exhibits the height as a function of the radius of the tube. The height
based on equation (1.69) is shown in Figure 1.25 as blue line. The actual height is
shown in the red line. Equation (1.69) provides reasonable results only in a certain
range. For a small tube radius, equation (1.57) proved better results because the curve
approaches hemispherical sphere (small gravity effect). For large radii equation (1.57)
approaches the strait line (the liquid line) strong gravity effect. On the other hand, for
extremely small radii equation (1.69) indicates that the high height which indicates a
negative pressure. The liquid at a certain pressure will be vaporized and will breakdown
the model upon this equation was constructed. Furthermore, the small scale indicates
that the simplistic and continuous approach is not appropriate and a different model
is needed. The conclusion of this discussion are shown in Figure 1.25. The actual
dimension for many liquids (even water) is about 1-5 [mm].

       The discussion above was referred to "wetting" contact angle. The depression of
the liquid occurs in a "negative" contact angle similarly to "wetting." The depression
height, h is similar to equation (1.69) with a minus sign. However, the gravity is working
against the surface tension and reducing the range and quality of the predictions of
equation (1.69). The measurements of the height of distilled water and mercury are
presented in Figure 1.26. The experimental results of these materials are with agreement
with the discussion above. The surface tension of a selected material is given in Table
1.7.

       In conclusion, the surface tension issue is important only in case where the radius
is very small and gravity is negligible. The surface tension depends on the two materials
or mediums that it separates.

    Example 1.19: Water Droplet                                   Level: Simple

    Calculate the diameter of a water droplet to attain pressure difference of
    1000[N/m2]. You can assume that temperature is 20C.

    Solution

    The pressure inside the droplet is given by equation (1.49).

    Example 1.20: Droplet Pressure                                Level: Simple

    Calculate the pressure difference between a droplet of water at 20C when the

    droplet has a diameter of 0.02 cm.

    Solution

    using equation

                    P = 2   2  0.0728  728.0[N/m2]

Example 1.21: Ring Force                               Level: Simple

Calculate the maximum force necessary to lift a thin wire ring of 0.04[m] diam-
eter from a water surface at 20C. Neglect the weight of the ring.

Solution

                                          F = 2(2  r ) cos 

The actual force is unknown since the contact angle is unknown. However, the maxi-
mum Force is obtained when  = 0 and thus cos  = 1. Therefore,

          F = 4  r  = 4    0.04  0.0728  .0366[N ]

In this value the gravity is not accounted for.

Example 1.22: Surface Tension Pressure                 Level: Simple

A small liquid drop is surrounded with the air and has a diameter of 0.001
[m]. The pressure difference between the inside and outside droplet is 1[kPa].

The force in downward direction is the weight is W = 150[N] with the thickness of
0.003[m] and vesicosity of  = 10.5 [poise] or 1.05 [Pa s] and the area is 0.003[m2].

During the terminal velocity is moving with constant velocity and hence it is in equi-

2 Review of Thermodynamics

2.1 Introductory Remarks

In this chapter, a review of several definitions of common thermodynamics terms is
presented. This introduction is provided to bring the student back to current place with
the material.

2.2 Basic Definitions

The following basic definitions are common to thermodynamics and will be used in this
book.

Work
       In mechanics, the work was defined as

mechanical work = F  d = P dV  (2.1)

       This definition can be expanded to include two issues. The first issue that must
be addressed is the sign, that is the work done on the surroundings by the system
boundaries is considered positive. Two, there is distinction between a transfer of energy
so that its effect can cause work and this that is not. For example, the electrical current
is a work while pure conductive heat transfer isn't.

System

       This term will be used in this book and it is defined as a continuous (at least
partially) fixed quantity of matter. The dimensions of this material can be changed.

47
48        CHAPTER 2. REVIEW OF THERMODYNAMICS

In this definition, it is assumed that the system speed is significantly lower than that
of the speed of light. So, the mass can be assumed constant even though the true
conservation law applied to the combination of mass energy (see Einstein's law). In
fact for almost all engineering purposes, this law is reduced to two separate laws of
mass conservation and energy conservation. The system can receive energy, work, etc
as long the mass remain constant the definition is not broken.

2.3 Thermodynamics First Law

This law refers to conservation of energy in a non accelerating system. Since all the
systems can be calculated in a non accelerating systems, the conservation is applied to
all systems. The statement describing the law is the following.

          Q12 - W12 = E2 - E1                                           (2.2)

       The system energy is a state property. From the first law it directly implies that
for process without heat transfer (adiabatic process) the following is true

          W12 = E1 - E2                                                 (2.3)

Interesting results of equation (2.3) is that the way the work is done and/or intermediate
states are irrelevant to final results. There are several definitions/separations of the kind
of works and they include kinetic energy, potential energy (gravity), chemical potential,
and electrical energy, etc. The internal energy is the energy that depends on the
other properties of the system. For example for pure/homogeneous and simple gases it
depends on two properties like temperature and pressure. The internal energy is denoted
in this book as EU and it will be treated as a state property.

       The potential energy of the system is depended on the body force. A common
body force is the gravity. For such body force, the potential energy is mgz where g is
the gravity force (acceleration), m is the mass and the z is the vertical height from a
datum. The kinetic energy is

                     mU 2                                               (2.4)
          K.E. =

                       2

    Thus the energy equation can be written as

          Total Energy Equation

    mU12  mU22                                                          (2.5)
    2 + m g z1 + EU 1 + Q = 2 + m g z2 + EU 2 + W                       (2.6)

    For the unit mass of the system equation (2.5) is transformed into

                  Specific Energy Equation
    U12 U22

     2 + g z1 + Eu1 + q = 2 + g z2 + Eu2 + w
2.4. THERMODYNAMICS SECOND LAW                                      49

       where q is the energy per unit mass and w is the work per unit mass. The "new"
internal energy, Eu, is the internal energy per unit mass.

       Since the above equations are true between arbitrary points, choosing any point in
time will make it correct. Thus differentiating the energy equation with respect to time
yields the rate of change energy equation. The rate of change of the energy transfer is

           DQ                                                       (2.7)
                 =Q

           Dt

In the same manner, the work change rate transferred through the boundaries of the
system is

                                                DW                  (2.8)
                                                       =W

                                                 Dt
Since the system is with a fixed mass, the rate energy equation is

  D EU                          DU  D Bf z                          (2.9)
Q-W =      +mU +m
       Dt                       Dt  Dt

 For the case were the body force, Bf , is constant with time like in the case of gravity
equation (2.9) reduced to

Time Dependent Energy Equation

  D EU                          DU  Dz                              (2.10)
Q-W =      +mU +mg
       Dt                       Dt  Dt

       The time derivative operator, D/Dt is used instead of the common notation
because it referred to system property derivative.

2.4 Thermodynamics Second Law

There are several definitions of the second law. No matter which definition is used
to describe the second law it will end in a mathematical form. The most common
mathematical form is Clausius inequality which state that

           Q                                                        (2.11)
                0

           T

The integration symbol with the circle represent integral of cycle (therefor circle) in
with system return to the same condition. If there is no lost, it is referred as a reversible
process and the inequality change to equality.

           Q                                                        (2.12)
                =0

           T

The last integral can go though several states. These states are independent of the
path the system goes through. Hence, the integral is independent of the path. This
50  CHAPTER 2. REVIEW OF THERMODYNAMICS

observation leads to the definition of entropy and designated as S and the derivative of
entropy is

             Q                                                      (2.13)
    ds 

              T rev

Performing integration between two states results in

                            2  Q                      2

    S2 - S1 =                                     = dS              (2.14)
                               T rev 1
                          1

       One of the conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis is for reversible and
adiabatic process dS = 0. Thus, the process in which it is reversible and adiabatic, the
entropy remains constant and referred to as isentropic process. It can be noted that
there is a possibility that a process can be irreversible and the right amount of heat
transfer to have zero change entropy change. Thus, the reverse conclusion that zero
change of entropy leads to reversible process, isn't correct.

       For reversible process equation (2.12) can be written as

    Q = T dS                                                        (2.15)

and the work that the system is doing on the surroundings is

    W = P dV                                                        (2.16)

Substituting equations (2.15) (2.16) into (2.10) results in

    T dS = d EU + P dV                                              (2.17)

       Even though the derivation of the above equations were done assuming that
there is no change of kinetic or potential energy, it still remain valid for all situations.
Furthermore, it can be shown that it is valid for reversible and irreversible processes.

Enthalpy
       It is a common practice to define a new property, which is the combination of

already defined properties, the enthalpy of the system.

    H = EU + P V                                                    (2.18)

The specific enthalpy is enthalpy per unit mass and denoted as, h.
      Or in a differential form as

    dH = dEU + dP V + P dV                                          (2.19)

    Combining equations (2.18) the (2.17) yields

    (one form of) Gibbs Equation                                    (2.20)
          T dS = dH - V dP
2.4. THERMODYNAMICS SECOND LAW        51

For isentropic process, equation (2.17) is reduced to dH = V dP . The equation (2.17)
in mass unit is

                                  dP  (2.21)
T ds = du + P dv = dh -

                                   

when the density enters through the relationship of  = 1/v.

Specific Heats
       The change of internal energy and enthalpy requires new definitions. The first

change of the internal energy and it is defined as the following

Specific Volume Heat                  (2.22)
    Cv  Eu
               T

And since the change of the enthalpy involve some kind of boundary work is defined as

Specific Pressure Heat                (2.23)
                h

     Cp  T

       The ratio between the specific pressure heat and the specific volume heat is called
the ratio of the specific heat and it is denoted as, k.

Specific Heats Ratio                  (2.24)
        k  Cp
              Cv

       For solid, the ratio of the specific heats is almost 1 and therefore the difference
between them is almost zero. Commonly the difference for solid is ignored and both are
assumed to be the same and therefore referred as C. This approximation less strong
for liquid but not by that much and in most cases it applied to the calculations. The
ratio the specific heat of gases is larger than one.

Equation of state

       Equation of state is a relation between state variables. Normally the relationship
of temperature, pressure, and specific volume define the equation of state for gases.
The simplest equation of state referred to as ideal gas. And it is defined as

P = RT                                (2.25)

Application of Avogadro's law, that "all gases at the same pressures and temperatures
have the same number of molecules per unit of volume," allows the calculation of a
52                         CHAPTER 2. REVIEW OF THERMODYNAMICS

"universal gas constant." This constant to match the standard units results in

                  R = 8.3145                             kj                    (2.26)

                               kmol K

     Thus, the specific gas can be calculate as                                 (2.27)
                                                      R

                                              R=
                                                     M

     From equation (2.25) of state for perfect gas it follows                   (2.28)
                                          d (P v) = R dT
2.4. THERMODYNAMICS SECOND LAW                                               53

For perfect gas

              dh = dEu + d(P v) = dEu + d(R T ) = f (T ) (only)              (2.29)
From the definition of enthalpy it follows that

                    d(P v) = dh - dEu                                        (2.30)

Utilizing equation (2.28) and subsisting into equation (2.30) and dividing by dT yields

                                              Cp - Cv = R                    (2.31)

This relationship is valid only for ideal/perfect gases.
       The ratio of the specific heats can be expressed in several forms as

                 Cv to Specific Heats Ratio                                  (2.32)

                          Cv = k - 1

                          Cp = k - 1

The specific heat ratio, k value ranges from unity to about 1.667. These values depend
on the molecular degrees of freedom (more explanation can be obtained in Van Wylen
"F. of Classical thermodynamics." The values of several gases can be approximated as
ideal gas and are provided in Table 2.1.

       The entropy for ideal gas can be simplified as the following

3.1 Introductory Remarks

This chapter provides a review of important definitions and concepts from Mechanics
(statics and dynamics). These concepts and definitions will be used in this book and a
review is needed.

A point body is location at time, t in a location, R. The velocity is derivative of
the change of the location and using the chain role (for the direction and one for the
magnitude) results,

    Example 3.1: Remeo Jet                                                 Level: Basic

    A water jet is supposed be used to extinguish the fire in a building as depicted
    in Figure 3.11. For given velocity, at what angle the jet has to be shot so that

    velocity will be horizontal at the window. Assume that gravity is g and the

    Solution

    The initial velocity is unknown and denoted as U which two components. The velocity

    at x is Ux = U cos  and the velocity in y direction is Uy = U sin . There there are

    three unknowns, U , , and time, t and three equations. The equation for the x

    coordinate is

                                           a = U cos( t)                             (3.1.a)

    The distance for y equation for coordinate (zero is at the window) is

                                                  g t2                               (3.1.b)
                                         0 = - + U sin( t) - b

                                                   2
    The velocity for the y coordinate at the window is zero

                                  u(t) = 0 = -g t + U sin()                          (3.1.c)

    These nonlinear equations (3.1.a), (3.1.b) and (3.1.c) can be solved explicitly. Isolating
    t from (3.1.a) and substituting into equations (3.1.b) and (3.1.c)

                                            -g a2                                    (3.1.d)
                                  b = 2 U 2 cos2() + a tan()

    and equation (3.1.a) becomes

                        0=        -g a     + U cos() = U =      a g                  (3.1.e)

3.2.1 Forces and Moments

This section was added to sublimate researchers and engineers who not ware of several
basics concepts in mechanics. Thus, this section was added to fill some of the gaps.

3.2.1.1 Moment of a Force                                         F

Moment of a force around a point or axis                               r
is the quantity that cause the body to ro-                              o
tate. The moment is the product of force
and distance vector, r. In practically only
the distance is important. The moment
M O of the force about point O is defined
as the cross product of force vector and dis-
tance vector:

M =r F  (3.3)                                 Fig. 3.2 - Moment of force at a pivot
                                                    point.

The direction of moment is determined by the right hand rule. The magnitude of the
moment is obtained by

         MO = r F sin                                                      (3.4)

where  is the angle between r and F.
       There are several theorem such as Varignon's theorem that deal with relationship

of vectors and representation of several vectors. Without vigorous proofs, it can be
stated that a moment of a force about any point equal to the sum of moments of
its components about that point. The principle of moments is a theorem based on the
Varignon's theorem, which states that a system of coplanar forces is in equilibrium, then
the combined sum of their moments about any point in their plane is zero. Moment of
the couple is equal to the cross product of any vector by the distance. It indicates that
moment of a couple is independent of location of the vectors. This freedom is apposed
to the force which requires a definite axis. A derivative of these conclusion is that a
force can be "moved" to a new location (line of action) with a moment.

    1While the simple example does not provide exact use of the above equation, it provides experience
of going over the motions of kinematics.
58  CHAPTER 3. REVIEW OF MECHANICS

       A necessary and sufficient conditions to body in static condition sum of forces is
zero net force in any direction

     N                                             (3.5)

        F =0

    i=0

The sum of all moment is zero in any direction as

     N                                             (3.6)

        M =0

    i=0

       The consequence of the above statements is that the force that acting anywhere
on a system of particles or a rigid body can be replaced by a force that acts on mass
centroid (see next section) and a moment. This result is not intuitive yet it proved
numerously in the literature. The fact or equation is very relevant to ship stability when
supposed to be research agree with in one part of the equation and disagree to it in
another part of the equation.

3.3 Center of Mass

The center of mass is divided into two sections, first, center of the mass and two,
center of area (two-dimensional body with equal distribution mass). Additionally, the
change of center of mass due to addition or subtraction of mass plus discrete areas are
presented.

3.3.1 Actual Center of Mass

In many engineering problems, the knowledge of center of mass is required to make
the calculations. This concept is derived from the fact that a body has a center of
mass/gravity which interacts with other bodies and that this force acts on the center
(equivalent force). It turns out that this concept is very useful in calculating rotations,
moment of inertia, etc. The center of mass doesn't depend on the coordinate system
and on the way it is calculated. The physical meaning of the center of mass is that if
a straight line force acts on the body in away through the center of gravity, the body
will not rotate. In other words, if a body will be held by one point it will be enough to
hold the body in the direction of the center of mass.
3.3. CENTER OF MASS                                                                         59

Note, if the body isn't be held through the           y
center of mass, then a moment in additional
to force is required (to prevent the body for                          z
rotating). It is convenient to use the Carte-                             dV
sian system to explain this concept. Sup-                                         x
pose that the body has a distribution of the
mass (density, rho) as a function of the lo-   Fig. 3.3 - Description of how the center

mass per volume. Here, the line density is
referred to density mass per unit length in
the x direction.
In x coordinate, the center will be defined
as

                                               dm

x=  1                                          x (x) dV  (3.7)

    mV

Here, the dV element has finite dimensions in y-z plane and infinitesimal dimension in
x direction see Figure 3.3. Also, the mass, m is the total mass of the object. It can be
noticed that center of mass in the x-direction isn't affected by the distribution in the
y nor by z directions. In same fashion the center of mass can be defined in the other
directions as following

   xi of Center Mass                                     (3.8)
       1

x칒 = m V xi (xi)dV

where xi is the direction of either, x, y or z. The density, (xi) is the line density as
function of xi. Thus, even for solid and uniform density the line density is a function of
the geometry. When finite masses are combine the total mass Eq. (3.8) converted into

    x = xi mi                                           (3.9)
               mi

where i denotes every mass in the system.

3.3.2  Approximate Center of Area

                                                          dA  t

In the previous case, the body was a three             y
dimensional shape. There are cases where
the body can be approximated as a two-                       z
dimensional shape because the body is with                                      x
a thin with uniform density. Consider a
uniform thin body with constant thickness   Fig. 3.4 - Thin body center of mass/area
shown in Figure 3.4 which has density, .         schematic.
Thus, equation (3.7) can be transferred
into

                                                   dm

       x =     1                           x  t dA              (3.10)

             tA  V

             V

The density,  and the thickness, t, are constant and can be canceled. Thus equation
(3.10) can be transferred into

                x칒 = A A xidA

when the integral now over only the area as oppose over the volume. Eq. (3.11) can
also be written for discrete areas as

             x칒 =                          xi Ai                (3.12)
                                             Ai

It must be noted that area Ai can be positive or negative. The meaning of negative
area in this context is subtraction of area.

3.3.3 Change of Centroid Location Due to Added/Subtracted
          Area
3.3. CENTER OF MASS                                                                   61

This section deals with a change cen-        r          a
troid location when an area is add or sub-
tracted from a given area with a know               on
centroid (or unknown). This topic is
important when a centroid of area was        Fig. 3.5 - Solid body with one

       The centroid of body in Fig. 3.5 is

denoted at point "o" (old). The centroid of the added and removed areas are at points
"a" (added) and "r" (removed), respectively. The point "n" (new) is the centroid after
modification. A special case when the added area is equal to the subtracted area and
its application will be discussed in an example below. It has to be noted that added and
subtracted areas do not have to be continuous. Utilizing Eq. (3.12) for the identical
areas reads for this case as

                     xn = xo Ao + xr Ar - xa Aa                                       (3.13)
                                  Ao + Ar - Aa

In a special case where subtracted area is equal to added area (Ar = Aa) Eq. (3.13) is
reduced to

                     xn = xo + xr Ar - xa Aa 
                     Ao                         Ao
                                                                                      (3.14)
                     x - xo = Ar (xr - xa)
                                 Ao

Finding the centroid location should be done in the most convenient coordinate system
since the location is coordinate independent. There should be a sign convention to
determine the centroid direction movement so that the direction should be immedi-
ately expressed in the result. However, faults were found in several options that were
considered2.

       Example 3.2: Sub Circle                                Level: Simple

A circle with a radius, r has a cut out                                        R
from a larger circle with radius, R where                      r
R > r. The distance between the cen-
ter of the larger circle and the small cir-                       x
cle is x. Calculate the centroid of the
circle that a smaller circle was cut out     Fig. 3.6 - Subtraction of circle from
of it. Assume that x is small enough so           a large circle for calculating the
that the small circle is whole.                   new center.

Solution

The change in the centroid is only the direction of x. It should be noted that for
x = 0, the centroid is at x = 0 and y = 0 that is the centroid is at the center of the
larger circle. For larger distance up to the x = R - r the centroid can be calculated
utilizing Eq. (3.13) reads

          r2                                 r2                           (3.2.a)
x =  2 (x - 0) = x                          R

         R

Notice that x is the distance between the two centers while x is the change in the
centroid location. Additionally, if the removed circle is not on the x coordinate then
these calculations can be reused. For instance, if the cut is at angle, , the change
will be along straight line from the center of the large circle at the distance that was
obtained in Eq. (3.2.a). The conversion to a regular coordinate system could be done
by utilizing simple trigonometric functions.

3.3.4 Change of Mass Centroid Due to Addition or Subtraction
          of Mass in 3D

This innovative topic (as witting it) is extension of the previous topic of two dimensions
change of centroid. All bodies are three dimensions thus when no symmetry or extru-
dation3 exist the full analysis has to be done. Furthermore, it is interesting to point to
the phenomenon none symmetrical body the change and be in a third dimension. This
topic to be discussed in stability issue.

and the subtracted mass "r" and again the new location of centroid is at "n."

3.3.4.1 A Small Change in Angle of Rotation

This section is dealing with a special topic

The term in the nominator is called the Moment of Inertia and will be discussed in the
following section. The Moment of Inertia symbolized by Ixx and Eq. (3.18) by

                                   xi = tan  Ixx                                  (3.19)
                                              V

Notice that Ixx is a function of the cross section only and is half of the cross section.
Hence for the total moment of inertia double the half (see next section for explanation).

The volume of the small wedge is calculated below. The total change is defined in
Eq. (3.17)

                           2 x1

It is remarkable that the change location of centroid can be determined from knowing/-
calculating the moment of inertia of the cross section and by the displaced volume.

    Repeat example with using Eq. (3.20).

    Solution

    As a side kick, the integral that was canceled before can be calculated as following

              dV = x tan dA = tan  x dA = tan x A  (3.21)

The value of tan  is constant in the integration and the value x is the average height
of wedge. The value of x is a function of  but not its location and the A cross area is
not function of . Sometime of values x are tabulated and hence the integration can
be readily available.

In the course of study of stability of floating bodies by this author, it was discovered
that centroid of the segment can be found in a easier way. The physics of the floating
body dictates (see Fig. 3.8) that (this equation is adapted without a proof which can
be found in the Bar-Meir's on Stability)

                           yc = Ixx/s               (3.22)

This equation is reduced from a complicated equation where A substitutes the extruded
volume of cylinder (the darken portion of the cylinder). The equation is based on the
argument of neutral stable body.

Calculate the centroid of semi-circle with a radius r.

Solution

In this case b (check for the definition) in the Fig. 3.8 is 2 r. Hence, the moment of
inertia (in the next section) is s b3/12. The area of segment (it is the dark green area

marked pointed by the arrow. Yet, note that b himself refers to width of the segment)
 r2/2. Utilizing equation (3.22) reads

3.4 Moment of Inertia

As it was divided for the body center of mass, the moment of inertia is divided into
moment of inertia of mass and area.

3.4.1 Moment of Inertia for Mass

The moment of inertia turns out to be an essential part for the calculations of ro-
tating bodies. Furthermore, it turns out that the moment of inertia has much wider
applicability. Moment of inertia of mass is defined as

                                    Moment of Inertia                    (3.24)

                                    Irrm = r2dV

                                                      V

If the density is constant then equation (3.24) can be transformed into

                                    Irrm =  r2 dV                        (3.25)

                                                       V

The moment of inertia is independent of the coordinate system used for the calculation,
but dependent on the location of axis of rotation relative to the body. Some people
define the radius of gyration as an equivalent concepts for the center of mass concept
66                                       CHAPTER 3. REVIEW OF MECHANICS

and which means if all the mass were to locate in the one point/distance and to obtain
the same of moment of inertia.

                        rk = Im                                                          (3.26)
                                  m

The body has a different moment of inertia for every coordinate/axis and they are

           Ixx =        V rx2dm =          V (y2 + z2) dm                                (3.27)
           Iyy =        V ry2dm =          V (x2 + z2) dm
           Izz =        V rz2dm =          V (x2 + y2) dm

3.4.2 Moment of Inertia for Area

3.4.2.1 General Discussion

For body with thickness, t and uniform density the following can be written

                                           moment of iner-
                                           tia for area

           Ixxm = r2dm =  t                  r2dA                                        (3.28)
                                                                                         (3.29)
                            m              A

The moment of inertia about axis is x can be defined as

                        Moment of Inertia

                        Ixx = r2dA = Ixxm

                        A

where r is distance of dA from the axis x and t is the thickness.
Any point distance can be calculated from

axis x as

3.4.2.2 The Parallel Axis Theorem

The moment of inertial can be calculated for any axis. The knowledge about one axis
can help calculating the moment of inertia for a parallel axis. Let Ixx the moment of
inertia about axis xx which is at the center of mass/area.

       The moment of inertia for axis x is

Ix x =        2             2       2             (y + y)2 + (z + z)2 dA (3.34)
                      y + z dA =
           r dA =

        A          A                           A

equation (3.34) can be expended as

           Ixx                         =0

Ix x = y2 + z2 dA + 2 (y y + z z) dA + (y)2 + (z)2 dA (3.35)

        A                      A                       A

       The first term in equation (3.35) on the right hand side is the moment of inertia
about axis x and the second them is zero. The second therm is zero because it integral
of center about center thus is zero. The third term is a new term and can be written
as

                constant                          r2        A

               (y)2 + (z)2 dA = (y)2 + (z)                 2               (3.36)

           A                                                 dA = r2 A

                                                          A

       Hence, the relationship between the moment of inertia at xx and parallel axis
x x is

                               Parallel Axis Equation                      (3.37)
                                 Ix x = Ixx + r2 A

The moment of inertia of several areas is
the sum of moment inertia of each area see
Figure 3.10 and therefore,

                        n                              y  z

           Ixx = Ixxi                  (3.38)                2

    Solution

    The right wedge line equation can be calculated as

                   y = 1- x
                   h       a

    or             x = 1- y

                   a       h

    Now using the moment of inertia of rectangle on the side (y) coordinate (see example

    For two triangles attached to each other the moment of inertia will be sum as

In addition to the moment of inertia, the product of inertia is commonly used. Here
only the product of the area is defined and discussed. The product of inertia defined as

                                          Ixi xj = xi xj dA                         (3.41)

For example, the product of inertia for x and y axis is

              Ixy = x ydA                                                           (3.42)

                            A

       Product of inertia can be positive or negative value as oppose the moment of
inertia. The calculation of the product of inertia isn't different much for the calculation
3.4. MOMENT OF INERTIA                                                                    73

of the moment of inertia. The units of the product of inertia are the same as for moment
of inertia.

Transfer of Axis Theorem
       Same as for moment of inertia there is also similar theorem.

                   Ix y = x y dA = (x + x) (y + y)dA                 (3.43)

                           A                A

expanding equation (3.43) results in

                                         0           0

                              y x dA x y dA

                      Ixy             A           A           x y A

Ix y = x ydA + x ydA + x ydA + x ydA                                 (3.44)

                   A          A                A           A

The final form is

                                       Ix y = Ixy + x y A            (3.45)
There are several relationships should be mentioned

                                      Ixy = Iyx                      (3.46)

Symmetrical area has zero product of inertia because integration of odd function (asym-
metrical function) left part cancel the right part.

3.4.5 Principal Axes of Inertia

The inertia matrix or inertia tensor is         -Ixy                               (3.47)
                                                 Iyy  -Ixz
                                           Ixx  -Izy  -Iyz 
                                       -Iyx            Izz
                                          -Izx

      In linear algebra it was shown that for some angle equation (3.47) can be transform

into

                                                                                   (3.48)

System which creates equation (3.48) referred as principle system.

3.5 Newton's Laws of Motion

These laws can be summarized in two statements one, for every action by body A on
Body B there is opposite reaction by body B on body A. Two, which can expressed in
mathematical form as

                                          D (m U )                                 (3.49)
                                    F=

                                              Dt

       It can be noted that D replaces the traditional d since the additional meaning
which be added. Yet, it can be treated as the regular derivative. This law apply to any
body and any body can "broken" into many small bodies which connected to each other.
These small "bodies" when became small enough equation (3.49) can be transformed
to a continuous form as

                                 F=             D ( U )   dV                       (3.50)

                                                V Dt

The external forces are equal to internal forces the forces between the "small" bodies
are cancel each other. Yet this examination provides a tool to study what happened in
the fluid during operation of the forces.
3.6. ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND TORQUE                                             75

       Since the derivative with respect to time is independent of the volume, the deriva-
tive can be taken out of the integral and the alternative form can be written as

   F=  D      U dV                                                           (3.51)

       Dt V

The velocity, U is a derivative of the location with respect to time, thus,

          D2                                                                 (3.52)
   F = Dt2 V  rdV

where r is the location of the particles from the origin.
       The external forces are typically divided into two categories: body forces and

surface forces. The body forces are forces that act from a distance like magnetic field
or gravity. The surface forces are forces that act on the surface of the body (pressure,
stresses). The same as in the dynamic class, the system acceleration called the inter-
nal forces. The acceleration is divided into three categories: Centrifugal, (r  ),
Angular, r   , Coriolis, 2 (Ur  ). The radial velocity is denoted as Ur.

3.6 Angular Momentum and Torque

The angular momentum of body, dm, is defined as

   L = r  Udm                                                               (3.53)

The angular momentum of the entire system is calculated by integration (summation)
of all the particles in the system as

   Ls = r  U dm                                                             (3.54)

               m

The change with time of angular momentum is called torque, in analogous to the
momentum change of time which is the force.

                                           DL D                              (3.55)
                                   T = Dt = Dt (r  Udm)
where T is the torque. The torque of entire system is

             DL D                                                            (3.56)
m T s = Dt = Dt m (r  Udm)

It can be noticed (well, it can be proved utilizing vector mechanics) that

D         D                       D r D2r                                    (3.57)
T = Dt (r  U) = Dt (r  Dt ) = Dt2

To understand these equations a bit better, consider a particle moving in x-y plane.
A force is acting on the particle in the same plane (x-y) plane. The velocity can be
76                                                 CHAPTER 3. REVIEW OF MECHANICS

written as U = u^i + v^j and the location from the origin can be written as r = x^i + y^j.
The force can be written, in the same fashion, as F = Fx^i + Fy^j. Utilizing equation

(3.53) provides

                              ^i ^j k^                                       (3.58)
            L = r  U =  x y 0  = (x v - y u)k^

                                   uv0

    Utilizing equation (3.55) to calculate the torque as

                               ^i  ^j k^                                     (3.59)
            T = r  F =  x         y 0  = (x Fx - y Fy)k^

                              Fx Fy 0

Since the torque is a derivative with respect to the time of the angular momentum it is
also can be written as

                                                D                            (3.60)
                              xFx - yFy = Dt [(xv - yu) dm]

    The torque is a vector and the various components can be represented as

                                     T x = ^i  D r  U dm                   (3.61)
                                                  Dt m

In the same way the component in y and z can be obtained.

    Example 3.13: Leaf in Whirlpool                                     Level: GATE 2005

    A leaf is caught in a whirlpool. At a given instant, the leaf is at a distance of

    120 m from the center of the whirlpool. The whirlpool can be described by the

    following velocity distribution:

                                 60  103                                  (3.13.a)

                       Ut = 2  r [m/sec]

    where r (in meters) is the distance from the center of the whirlpool. What will
    be the distance of the leaf from the center when it has moved through half a
    revolution?

          (a) 49 [m]                                     (b) 64 [m]

    Solution

    The angle the leaf travel for very small radius

                                                  =                        (3.13.c)

    The infinitesimal distance that the leaf travels into the center is    (3.13.d)
                                                              60  103 dt

    The condition imposed is the angle must be  = . Hence

                                           r = -  0 2r

    These are two integral equations that needed to be solved. The distance to the center

    r is                                                 t 60  103 dt

These equations are a Volterra integral equation of the first kind that does not have

a typically simple analytical solution.

The K is referred as the kernel and if it is polynomials or similar there is analytical
solved. However, this is not easily can transferred but can be shown that it converged
by guessing arbitrary function and repeating the process until no significant change
occur.

        However, this question is given in GATE and there is no sufficient time solve
in this method and a quick estimate is needed. It can be noticed that the tangential
velocity is 5 times larger than the velocity radial velocity. Yet the time for tangential
lap is the same magnitude as the radial time. Thus, for the first iteration one the fix

4.1 Introduction

The simplest situation that can occur in the study of fluid is when the fluid is at rest or
quasi rest. This topic was introduced to most students in previous study of rigid body.
However, here this topic will be more vigorously examined. Furthermore, the student
will be exposed to stability analysis probably for the first time. Later, the methods
discussed here will be expanded to more complicated dynamics situations.

gG - a = geff  (4.1)

       Equation (4.1) can be reduced and simplified for the case of zero acceleration,
a = 0.

       In these derivations, several assumptions must be made. The first assumption
is that the change in the pressure is a continuous function. There is no requirement
that the pressure has to be a monotonous function e.g. that pressure can increase

                                             83
84                        CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

and later decrease. The changes of the second derivative pressure are not significant
compared to the first derivative (P/n  d >> 2P/n2). Where n is the steepest
direction of the pressure derivative and d is the infinitesimal length. This mathematical
statement simply requires that the pressure can deviate in such a way that the average
on infinitesimal area can be found and expressed as only one direction. The net pressure
force on the faces in the x direction results in

    dF = -       P        dydx i^                             (4.2)

                 x

       In the same fashion, the calculations of the three directions result in the total net
pressure force as

           F =-  P ^ P ^ P ^                                  (4.3)
                      i+ j+ k
    surface
                 x y y

       The term in the parentheses in equation (4.3) referred to in the literature as
the pressure gradient (see for more explanation in the Mathematics Appendix). This
mathematical operation has a geometrical interpretation. If the pressure, P , was a
two-dimensional height (that is only a function of x and y) then the gradient is the
steepest ascent of the height (to the valley). The second point is that the gradient is a
vector (that is, it has a direction). Even though, the pressure is treated, now, as a scalar
function (there no reference to the shear stress in part of the pressure) the gradient is
a vector. For example, the dot product of the following is

                                P                             (4.4)
    i  gradP = i  P =

                                 x

       In general, if the coordinates were to "rotate/transform" to a new system which
has a different orientation, the dot product results in

                                    P                         (4.5)
    in  gradP = in  P = n

where in is the unit vector in the n direction and /n is a derivative in that direction.
       As before, the effective gravity force is utilized in case where the gravity is the only

body force and in an accelerated system. The body (element) is in rest and therefore
the net force is zero

Some refer to equation (4.8) as the Fluid Static Equation. This equation can be
integrated and therefore solved. However, there are several physical implications to this
equation which should be discussed and are presented here. First, a discussion on a
simple condition and will continue in more challenging situations.

4.3 Pressure and Density in a Gravitational Field

In this section, a discussion on the pressure and the density in various conditions is
presented.

4.3.1 Constant Density in Gravitational Field

The simplest case is when the density, , pressure, P , and temperature, T (in a way

no function of the location) are constant. Traditionally, the z coordinate is used as the
(negative) direction of the gravity1. The effective body force is

          geff = -g k^                                                (4.10)

       Utilizing equation (4.10) and substituting it into equation (4.8) results into three
simple partial differential equations. These equations are

          P P                                                         (4.11)
               = =0

          x y

and
                                            Pressure Change

          P                                                           (4.12)
               = - g

          z

Equations (4.11) can be integrated to yield

          P (x, y) = constant                                         (4.13)

    1This situation were the tradition is appropriated, it will be used. There are fields where x or y are
designed to the direction of the gravity and opposite direction. For this reason sometime there will be
a deviation from the above statement.
86                                              CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

and constant in equation (4.13) can be absorbed by the integration of equation (4.12)
and therefore

    P (x, y, z) = - g z + constant              (4.14)

The integration constant is determined from the initial conditions or another point. For
example, if at point z0 the pressure is P0 then the equation (4.14) becomes

    P (z) - P0 = - g (z - z0)                   (4.15)

       It is evident from equation (4.14) that the pressure depends only on z and/or the
constant pressure lines are in the plane of x and y.

Figure 4.2 describes the constant pressure                                                  gh
lines in the container under the gravity body
force. The pressure lines are continuous                         a
even in area where there is a discontinu-
ous fluid. The reason that a solid boundary     Fig. 4.3 - A schematic to explain the
doesn't break the continuity of the pressure         measure of the atmospheric pressure.
lines is because there is always a path to
some of the planes.
It is convenient to reverse the direction of z
to get rid of the negative sign and to define
h as the dependent of the fluid that is h 
-(z - z0) so equation (4.15) becomes

    Pressure relationship                       (4.16)
     P (h) - P0 =  g h

       In the literature, the right hand side of the equation (4.16) is defined as piezo-
metric pressure.

The following question is a very nice qualitative question of understanding this concept.

        Example 4.2: Two liquid Piezometric                       Level: Simple

    A tank with opening at the top to                          h1
    the atmosphere contains two immis-                         h2 hH hL

    uid). Which piezometric tube will be
    higher? why? and how much higher?
    What is the pressure at the bottom of
    the tank?

    Solution

    The common instinct is to find that the lower tube will contain the higher liquids. For
    the case, the lighter liquid is on the top the heavier liquid the top tube is the same as
    the surface. However, the lower tube will raise only to (notice that g is canceled)

                           hL = 1 h1 + 2 h2                       (4.2.a)
                                          2

    Since 1 > 1 the mathematics dictate that the height of the second is lower. The

    difference is

                       hH - hL = hH -       1 h1 + 2 h2           (4.2.b)
                       h2        h2            hr21 2

    It can be noticed that hH = h1 + h - 2 hence,

        hH - hL = h1 + h2 -      1 h1 + 2 h2       = h1   1 - 1   (4.2.c)
                   h2  h2             h2 2            h2       2

    or

                           hH - hL = h1     1 - 1                 (4.2.d)
                                                 2

    The only way the hL to be higher of hH is if the heavy liquid is on the top if the
    stability allow it. The pressure at the bottom is

                       P = Patmos + g (1 h1 + 2 h2)               (4.2.e)

        Example 4.3: Water Care                                   Level: Simple

    The effect of the water in the car tank is more than the possibility that water
    freeze in fuel lines. The water also can change measurement of fuel gage. The
    way the interpretation of an automobile fuel gage is proportional to the pressure
    at the bottom of the fuel tank. Part of the tank height is filled with the water
    at the bottom (due to the larger density). Calculate the error for a give ratio
4.3. PRESSURE AND DENSITY IN A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD                                      89

between the fuel density to the water.                      End of Ex. 4.3

Solution

The ratio of the fuel density to water density is  = f /w and the ratio of the total
height to the water height is x = hw/htotal. Thus the pressure at the bottom when
the tank is full with only fuel

                             Pfull = f htotal g             (4.3.a)

But when water is present the pressure will be the same at

                             Pfull = (w x +  f ) g htotal   (4.3.b)

and if the two are equal at

          f $hto$t$al 죊 = (w x +  f ) 죊 $hto$t$al         (4.3.c)

where  in this case the ratio of the full height (on the fake) to the total height.

Hence,                        = f - x w
                                        f
                                                            (4.3.d)

4.3.2 Pressure Measurement

4.3.2.1 Measuring the Atmospheric Pressure

One of the application of this concept is the idea of measuring the atmospheric pressure.
Consider a situation described in Figure 4.3. The liquid is filling the tube and is brought
into a steady state. The pressure above the liquid on the right side is the vapor pressure.
Using liquid with a very low vapor pressure like mercury, will result in a device that can
measure the pressure without additional information (the temperature).

Example 4.4: Mercury Pressure                               Level: Basic

Calculate the atmospheric pressure at 20C. The high of the Mercury is 0.76

[m] and the gravity acceleration is 9.82[m/sec]. Assume that the mercury vapor

pressure is 0.000179264[kPa]. The description of the height is given in Figure

4.3. The mercury density is 13545.85[kg/m3].

Solution

The pressure is uniform or constant plane perpendicular to the gravity. Hence, knowing
any point on this plane provides the pressure anywhere on the plane. The atmospheric
pressure at point a is the same as the pressure on the right hand side of the tube.
Equation (4.16) can be utilized and it can be noticed that pressure at point a is

                             Pa =  g h + Pvapor             (4.17)
90                                                       CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

                                                                                 End of Ex. 4.4
    The density of the mercury is given along with the gravity and therefore,

                    Pa = 13545.85  9.82  0.76  101095.39[P a]  1.01[Bar]
    The vapor pressure is about 1  10-4 percent of the total results.

large density and the fact that it is in a liquid phase
in most of the measurement range. The third reason       valve
is the low vapor (partial) pressure of the mercury.
The partial pressure of mercury is in the range of the                      1
0.000001793[Bar] which is insignificant compared to
the total measurement as can be observed from the        Fig. 4.6 - Schematic of gas

                                                              "U" tube.

    Example 4.5: Liquid Interface                        Level: Intermediate

    A liquid2 a in amount Ha and a liquid b in amount Hb in to an U tube. The
    ratio of the liquid densities is  = 1/2. The width of the U tube is L. Locate
    the liquids surfaces.

    Solution

    The question is to find the equilibrium point where two liquids balance each other. If
    the width of the U tube is equal or larger than total length of the two liquids then the
    whole liquid will be in bottom part. For smaller width, L, the ratio between two sides
    will be as

                                         1 h1 = 2 h2  h2 =  h1

    The mass conservation results in

    Ha + Hb = L + h1 + h2

    Thus two equations and two unknowns provide the solution which is

                                              h1 = Ha + Hb - L
                                                           1+

    When Ha > L and a (Ha - L)  b (or the opposite) the liquid a will be on the
    two sides of the U tube. Thus, the balance is

    h1 b + h2 a = h3 a

    where h1 is the height of liquid b where h2 is the height of "extra" liquid a and same
    side as liquid b and where h3 is the height of liquid b on the other side. When in this
    case h1 is equal to Hb. The additional equation is the mass conservation as

    Ha = h2 + L + h3

                 h2 = (Ha - L) a - Hbb

extended to measure the pressure             1                           1

sure can be measured with a min-

imal interference to the gas (some gas enters to the tube).

The gas density is significantly lower than the liquid density and therefore can be

neglected. The pressure at point "1" is

                 P1 = Patmos +  g h                                             (4.18)

       Since the atmospheric pressure was measured previously (the technique was shown
in the previous section) the pressure of the chamber can be measured.

4.3.2.3 Magnified Pressure Measurement

For situations where the pressure difference is very small, engineers invented more sensi-
tive measuring device. This device is build around the fact that the height is a function
of the densities difference. In the previous technique, the density of one side was ne-
glected (the gas side) compared to other side (liquid). This technique utilizes the
opposite range. The densities of the two sides are very close to each other, thus the
height become large. Figure 4.7 shows a typical and simple schematic of such an in-
strument. If the pressure differences between P1 and P2 is small this instrument can
"magnified" height, h1 and provide "better" accuracy reading. This device is based on
the following mathematical explanation.

       In steady state, the pressure balance (only differences) is

                 P1 + g 1(h1 + h2) = P2 + g h2 2                                (4.19)

It can be noticed that the "missing height" is canceled between the two sides. It can
be noticed that h1 can be positive or negative or zero and it depends on the ratio that

    2This example was requested by several students who found their instructor solution unsatisfactory.
92                                                      CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

two containers filled with the light density liquid. Additionally, it can be observed that
h1 is relatively small because A1 >> A2. The densities of the liquid are chosen so that
they are close to each other but not equal. The densities of the liquids are chosen to
be much heavier than the measured gas density. Thus, in writing equation (4.19) the
gas density was neglected. The pressure difference can be expressed as

                    P1 - P2 = g [2 h2 - 1(h1 + h2)]                                     (4.20)

If the light liquid volume in the two containers is known, it provides the relationship
between h1 and h2. For example, if the volumes in two containers are equal then

                    -h1 A1 = h2 A2 - h1 = - h2 A2                                       (4.21)
                                                           A1

Liquid volumes do not necessarily have to be equal. Additional parameter, the volume
ratio, will be introduced when the volumes ratio isn't equal. The calculations as results
of this additional parameter does not cause a significant complications. Here, this ratio
equals to one and it simplify the equation (4.21). But this ratio can be inserted easily
into the derivations. With the equation for height (4.21) equation (4.19) becomes

                    P1 - P2 = g h2 2 - 1 1 - A2                                         (4.22)
                                                            A1                          (4.23)

or the height is

                    h2 =                       P1 - P2

                          g (2 - 1) + 1 AA21

For the small value of the area ratio, A2/A1L1, then equation (4.23) becomes

                          h2 = P1 - P2                                                  (4.24)
                                 g (2 - 1)

Some refer to the density difference shown in equation (4.24) as "magnification factor"
since it replace the regular density, 2.

Inclined Manometer

    One of the old methods of pressure

measurement is the inclined manometer.                  P1      dy d  Poutside
In this method, the tube leg is inclined rel-
atively to gravity (depicted in Figure 4.8).                    
This method is an attempt to increase the
accuracy by "extending" length visible of

the tube. The equation (4.18) is then                   Fig. 4.8 - Inclined manometer.

                    P1 - Poutside =  g d                                                (4.25)

If there is a insignificant change in volume (the area ratio between tube and inclined
leg is significant), a location can be calibrated on the inclined leg as zero3.

    3This author's personal experience while working in a ship that use this manometer which is signifi-
cantly inaccurate (first thing to be replaced on the ship). Due to surface tension, caused air entrapment
especially in rapid change of the pressure or height.

4.3.3 Varying Density in a Gravity Field

There are several cases that will be discussed here which are categorized as gases,
liquids and other. In the gas phase, the equation of state is simply the ideal gas model
or the ideal gas with the compressibility factor (sometime referred to as real gas).
The equation of state for liquid can be approximated or replaced by utilizing the bulk
modulus. These relationships will be used to find the functionality between pressure,
density and location.

4.3.3.1 Gas Phase under Hydrostatic Pressure

Ideal Gas under Hydrostatic Pressure

The gas density vary gradually with the pressure. As first approximation, the ideal gas
model can be employed to describe the density. Thus equation (4.12) becomes

                                      P  =-  gP                                (4.29)

                                      z      RT

Separating the variables and changing the partial derivatives to full derivative (just a
notation for this case) results in

                                      dP g dz                                  (4.30)

94                                                CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

Equation (4.30) can be integrated from point "0" to any point to yield

                              P           g                             (4.31)
                              ln P0 = - R T (z - z0)

It is convenient to rearrange equation (4.31) to the following

                              e P    - g(z-zo)                          (4.32)

                              P0

Here the pressure ratio is related to the height exponentially. Equation (4.32) can be
expanded to show the difference to standard assumption of constant pressure as

                              - P0 h 0 g

Equation (4.34) is useful in mathematical derivations but should be ignored for practical
use4.

Real Gas under Hydrostatic Pressure

       The mathematical derivations for ideal gas can be reused as a foundation for the
real gas model (P = ZRT ). For a large range of P/Pc and T /Tc, the value of the
compressibility factor, Z, can be assumed constant and therefore can be swallowed into
equations (4.32) and (4.33). The compressibility is defined in equation (2.39). The
modified equation is

                              e P    - g (z-zo)                         (4.35)
                                  =         ZRT
                              P0

Or in a series form which is

    P (z - z0) g (z - z0)2 g                                            (4.36)

    P0                        ZRT            6Z RT

Without going through the mathematics, the first approximation should be noticed that
the compressibility factor, Z enter the equation as h/Z and not just h. Another point
that is worth discussing is the relationship of Z to other gas properties. In general, the
relationship is very complicated and in some ranges Z cannot be assumed constant. In
these cases, a numerical integration must be carried out.

    4These derivations are left for a mathematical mind person. These deviations have a limited practical
purpose. However, they are presented here for students who need to answer questions on this issue.

4.3.3.2 Liquid Phase Under Hydrostatic Pressure

The bulk modulus was defined in equation (1.30). The simplest approach is to assume
that the bulk modulus is constant (or has some representative average). For these cases,
there are two differential equations that needed to be solved. Fortunately, here, only
one hydrostatic equation depends on density equation. So, the differential equation for
density should be solved first. The governing differential density equation is

                                                                  (4.37)
 = BT P

The variables for equation (4.37) should be separated and then the integration can be
carried out as

 P                                            d                   (4.38)
                                            0 BT 
   dP =

P0

The integration of equation (4.38) yields                         (4.39)
                                                                

                                          P - P0 = BT ln 0

Equation (4.39) can be represented in a more convenient form as

Density variation

e  = 0                                      P -P0                 (4.40)
                                              BT

Equation (4.40) is the counterpart for the equation of state of ideal gas for the liquid
phase. Utilizing equation (4.40) in equation (4.12) transformed into

e P                                         P -P0                 (4.41)
                                              BT
z = -g 0

Equation (4.41) can be integrated to yield

e BT P-P0 BT = z + Constant                                       (4.42)

g 0

It can be noted that BT has units of pressure and therefore the ratio in front of the
exponent in equation (4.42) has units of length. The integration constant, with units
of length, can be evaluated at any specific point. If at z = 0 the pressure is P0 and the
density is 0 then the constant is

Constant = BT                                                     (4.43)

    This constant, BT /g 0, is a typical         P -P0
length of the problem. Additional discus-          BT
sion will be presented in the dimensionless

tion). The solution becomes

Or in a dimensionless form

The solution is presented in equation (4.44) and is plotted in Figure 4.10. The solution
is a reverse function (that is not P = f (z) but z = f (P)) it is a monotonous function
which is easy to solve for any numerical value (that is only one z corresponds to any
Pressure). Sometimes, the solution is presented as

                             P = BT ln g 0z + 1 + 1                               (4.46)
                             P0 P0           BT

    An approximation of equation (4.45) is presented for historical reasons and in

order to compare the constant density assumption. The exponent can be expanded as

    piezometric                      corrections 

    pressure          + BT   P - P0  2 BT        P - P0 3         +렁   = z g 0  (4.47)

                                           6     BT

It can be noticed that equation (4.47) is reduced to the standard equation when the
normalized pressure ratio, P/BT is small (<< 1). Additionally, it can be observed that
the correction is on the left hand side and not as the "traditional" correction on the
piezometric pressure side.

       After the above approach was developed, new approached was developed to an-
swer questions raised by hydraulic engineers. In the new approach is summarized by the
following example.

    Example 4.6: Deep Ocean Pressure                              Level: Intermediate

    The hydrostatic pressure was neglected in example 1.12. In some places the

    ocean depth is many kilometers (the deepest places is more than 10 kilometers).

    For this example, calculate the density change in the bottom of 10 kilometers

    using two methods. In one method assume that the density is remain constant

    until the bottom. In the second method assume that the density is a function

    of the pressure.

Solution                                                                                                   continue Ex. 4.6

For the first method the density is

                             P          = V = V                                                    P
                            BT =                                                                                     (4.6.a)
                                  V /V                                                             BT

The density at the surface is  = m/V and the density at point x from the surface

the density is     (x) = m = (x) = m

                            V - V                                                              V - V P               (4.6.b)

                                                                                                       BT

In this Chapter it was shown (integration of equation (4.8)) that the change pressure

for constant gravity is

                                                                                      z

                                  P = g (z)dz                                                                        (4.6.c)

                                           0

Combining equation (4.6.b) with equation (4.6.c) yields

                            (z) =                                                        m

                                                                                            z

Equation (4.6.e) is an integral equation which is discussed in the appendixa. It is
convenient to rearrange further equation (4.6.e) to

                                     g z 0
                            1-          (z)dz =                                                                      (4.6.f )

The integral equation (4.6.f) can be converted to a differential equation form when
the two sides are differentiated as

                            g           0 d (z)
                                  (z) + 2                                                      =0                    (4.6.g)

equation (4.6.g) is first order non-linear differential equation which can be transformed

into                              g (z)3 d (z)

    The integration constant can be found by the fact that at z = 0 the density is 0 and

Calculate the time it take for a sound wave to propagate perpendicularly to the
surface to a depth D (perpendicular to the straight surface). Assume that no
variation of the temperature exist. For the purpose of this exercise, the salinity
can be completely ignored.

Solution

The equation for the sound speed is taken here as correct for very local point. However,
the density is different for every point since the density varies and the density is a
function of the depth. The speed of sound at any depth point, z, can be expressed
utilizing equation (4.6.m) to obtain

                            c = BT         2 g 0 z + 1               (4.7.b)

The time the sound travel a small interval distance, dz is

                            d = dz = dz

The time takes for the sound the travel the whole distance is the integration of in-

finitesimal time. The integration can be easily carried by changing to the dummy
variable to u = 2 gB0 z T + 1. Under this transform equation (4.7.c) changes to

       In Example 4.6 ratio of the density was expressed by equations (4.6.l) while here
the ratio is expressed by different equations. The difference between the two equations
is the fact that Example 4.6 use the integral equation without using any "equation of
state." The method described in the Example 4.6 is more general which provided a
simple solution5. The equation of state suggests that P = g 0 f (P ) dz while the
integral equation is P = g  dz where no assumption is made on the relationship
between the pressure and density. However, the integral equation uses the fact that the
pressure is function of location.

4.3.4 The Pressure Effects Due To Temperature Variations

4.3.4.1 The Basic Analysis

There are situations when the main change of the density results from other effects.
For example, when the temperature field is not uniform, the density is affected and thus
the pressure is a location function (for example, the temperature in the atmosphere is
assumed to be a linear with the height under certain conditions.). A bit more complicate
case is when the gas is a function of the pressure and another parameter. Air can be a
function of the temperature field and the pressure. For the atmosphere, it is commonly
assumed that the temperature is a linear function of the height.

       Here, a simple case is examined for which the temperature is a linear function of
the height as

             dT                                                                (4.49)
             dh = -Cx

where h here referred to height or distance. Hence, the temperature-distance function

of any of these solutions or similar, please pass this information to this author.
4.3. PRESSURE AND DENSITY IN A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD            101

can be written as

                   T = Constant - Cx h                        (4.50)

where the Constant is the integration constant which can be obtained by utilizing the
initial condition. For h = 0, the temperature is T0 and using it leads to

                                 Temp variations              (4.51)
                                 T = T0 - Cx h

Combining equation (4.51) with (4.12) results in

                   P             =-  gP                       (4.52)

                   h                 R (T0 - Cx h)

Separating the variables in equation (4.52) and changing the formal  to the informal
d to obtain

                   dP            =-  g dh                     (4.53)

                   P                 R (T0 - Cx h)

Defining a new variable6 as  = (T0 - Cx h) for which 0 = T0 - Cx h0 and d/d =
-Cx d/dh. Using these definitions results in

                                 d P g d                      (4.54)

                                  P RCx 

After the integration of equation (4.53) and reusing (the reverse definitions) the variables
transformed the result into

                   ln P = g ln T0 - Cx h                      (4.55)
                   P0 R Cx                        T0

Or in a more convenient form as

                   Pressure in Atmosphere

                   P             T0 - Cx h        ( R Cx g )
                       =             T0
                                                              (4.56)
                   P0

It can be noticed that equation (4.56) is a monotonous function which decreases with
height because the term in the brackets is less than one. This situation is roughly
representing the pressure in the atmosphere and results in a temperature decrease.
It can be observed that Cx has a "double role" which can change the pressure ratio.
Equation (4.56) can be approximated by two approaches/ideas. The first approximation

simple, please, just ignore it.

for a small distance, h, and the second approximation for a small temperature gradient.

It can be recalled that the following expansions are

                                         g h 0                   correction factor

         = lim       T0                                   2 T02 R2                      -렁
                          = R Cx 1 - g h T - 0 R
     P0 h->0

Equation (4.57) shows that the first two terms are the standard terms (negative sign is
as expected i.e. negative direction). The correction factor occurs only at the third term
which is important for larger heights. It is worth to point out that the above statement
has a qualitative meaning when additional parameter is added. However, this kind of
analysis will be presented in the dimensional analysis chapter7.

       The second approximation for small Cx is

         = lim       T0
                          R Cx                                   - R T0 -   
     P0 Cx->0
                                =

Equation (4.58) shows that the correction factor (lapse coefficient), Cx, influences at
only large values of height. It has to be noted that these equations (4.57) and (4.58)

are not properly represented without the characteristic height. It has to be inserted to

make the physical significance clearer.

     Equation (4.56) represents only the pressure ratio. For engineering purposes, it

is sometimes important to obtain the density ratio. This relationship can be obtained

from combining equations (4.56) and (4.51). The simplest assumption to combine these

equations is by assuming the ideal gas model, equation (2.25), to yield

                 = P T0 =                         P  ( R Cx g )           T0                  (4.59)

    7These concepts are very essential in all the thermo-fluid science. The author is grateful to his
adviser E.R.G. Eckert who was the pioneer of the dimensional analysis in heat transfer and was kind to
show me some of his ideas.
4.3. PRESSURE AND DENSITY IN A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD   103

The first case is referred to as the stable condition and the second case referred to as
the unstable condition. The whole system falls apart and does not stay if the analysis
predicts unstable conditions. A weak wind or other disturbances can make the unstable
system to move to a new condition.

       This question is determined by the net forces acting on the slab. Whether these
forces are toward the original layer or not. The two forces that act on the slab are
the gravity force and the surroundings pressure (buoyant forces). Clearly, the slab
is in equilibrium with its surroundings before the movement (not necessarily stable).
Under equilibrium, the body forces that acting on the slab are equal to zero. That is,
the surroundings "pressure" forces (buoyancy forces) are equal to gravity forces. The
buoyancy forces are proportional to the ratio of the density of the slab to surrounding
layer density. Thus, the stability question is whether the slab density from layer h,  (h)
undergoing a free expansion is higher or lower than the density of the layer h + dh. If
 (h) > (h + dh) then the situation is stable. The term  (h) is slab from layer h that
had undergone the free expansion.

       The reason that the free expansion is chosen to explain the process that the slab
undergoes when it moves from layer h to layer h + dh is because it is the simplest. In
reality, the free expansion is not far way from the actual process. The two processes
that occurred here are thermal and the change of pressure (at the speed of sound).
The thermal process is in the range of [cm/sec] while the speed of sound is about
300 [m/sec]. That is, the pressure process is about thousands times faster than the
thermal process. The second issue that occurs during the "expansion" is the shock (in
the reverse case [h + dh]  h). However, this shock is insignificant (check book on
Fundamentals of Compressible Flow Mechanics by this author on the French problem).

       The slab density at layer h+dh can be obtained using equation (4.59) as following

(h + dh) = P T0 =  1 - Cx dh  ( R Cx g )  1 + Cx dh
                          T0                      T
(h)  P0 T                                            (4.60)

The pressure and temperature change when the slab moves from layer at h to layer
h + dh. The process, under the above discussion and simplifications, can be assumed to
be adiabatic (that is, no significant heat transfer occurs in the short period of time). The
little slab undergoes isentropic expansion as following for which (see equation (2.25))

      (h + dh)        P (h + dh) 1/k                 (4.61)
                   =     P (h)

        (h)

When the symbol denotes the slab that moves from layer h to layer h + dh. The
pressure ratio is given by equation (4.56) but can be approximated by equation (4.57)
and thus

      (h + dh)     = 1-  g dh 1/k                    (4.62)

     (h)                 T (h) R
104                                       CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

Again using the ideal gas model for equation (4.63) transformed into

               (h + dh)     = 1-   gdh 1/k                                     (4.63)
                                                                               (4.64)
                      (h)         P

Expanding equation (4.63) in Taylor series results in

           gdh 1/k         g  dh g2 2 k - g2 2 dh2
          1 - P = 1 - P k - 2 P 2 k2 - ...

       The density at layer h + dh can be obtained from (4.60) and then it is expanded
in taylor series as

(h + dh) = 1 - Cx dh    g   1 + Cx dh                  1-  g  - Cx             dh +   
                      R Cx          T                      PT                        (4.65)

     (h)  T0

       The comparison of the right hand terms of equations (4.65) and (4.64) provides
the conditions to determine the stability. From a mathematical point of view, to keep
the inequality for a small dh only the first term need to be compared as

                      g  > g  - Cx                                             (4.66)
                      Pk P T

After rearrangement of the inequality (4.66) and using the ideal gas identity, it trans-
formed to

                      Cx > (k - 1) g 
                      T     kP

                                   k-1 g                                       (4.67)
                           Cx < k R

       The analysis shows that the maximum amount depends on the gravity and gas
properties. It should be noted that this value should be changed a bit since the k should
be replaced by polytrophic expansion n. When lapse rate Cx is equal to the right hand
side of the inequality, it is said that situation is neutral. However, one has to bear in
mind that this analysis only provides a range and isn't exact. Thus, around this value
additional analysis is needed 8.

       One of the common question this author has been asked is about the forces
of continuation. What is the source of the force(s) that make this situation when
unstable continue to be unstable? Supposed that the situation became unstable and
the layers have been exchanged, would the situation become stable now? One has to
remember that temperature gradient forces continuous heat transfer which the source
temperature change after the movement to the new layer. Thus, the unstable situation
is continuously unstable.

deviated when the distance from the body source

is significantly change. At first glance, the body

force is independent of the fluid. The source of

the gravity force in gas is another body, while the       Fig. 4.12 - The varying gravity effects

Thus, the discussion is separated into two different

issues. The issues of magnetohydrodynamics are

too advance for undergraduate student and therefore,will not be introduced here.

4.3.5.1 Ideal Gas in Varying Gravity

In physics, it was explained that the gravity is a function of the distance from the center
of the plant/body. Assuming that the pressure is affected by this gravity/body force.
The gravity force is reversely proportional to r2. The gravity force can be assumed that
for infinity, r   the pressure is about zero. Again, equation (4.12) can be used
(semi one directional situation) when r is used as direction and thus

                                P          G                                                      (4.68)
                                r = - r2

 where G denotes the general gravity constant. The regular method of separation is
employed to obtain

                            P dP  =-    G      r dr                                               (4.69)
                                              rb r2
                            Pb P        RT

where the subscript b denotes the conditions at the body surface. The integration of
equation (4.69) results in

                            P       G      11                                                     (4.70)

                            Pb      RT
                                           rb r

Or in a simplified form as

                            e  P        - G r-rb RT r rb                                          (4.71)
                               ==
                            b Pb

Equation (4.71) demonstrates that the pressure is reduced with the distance. It can be
noticed that for r  rb the pressure is approaching P  Pb. This equation confirms
that the density in outer space is zero () = 0. As before, equation (4.71) can be

Notice that G isn't our beloved and familiar g and also that G rb/RT is a dimensionless

number (later in the Chapter (9) a discussion about the definition of the dimensionless

number and its meaning was added).

4.3.5.2 Real Gas in Varying Gravity

The regular assumption of constant compressibility, Z, is employed. It has to remember
when this assumption isn't accurate enough, numerical integration is a possible solution.
Thus, equation (4.69) is transformed into

                                                      P dP  =-  G     r dr                    (4.73)
                                                                     rb r2
                                                      Pb P      ZRT

With the same process as before for ideal gas case, one can obtain

                            e  P                                - G r-rb Z R T r rb           (4.74)
                               ==
                            b Pb

Equation (4.71) demonstrates that the pressure is reduced with the distance. It can be

observed that for r  rb the pressure is approaching P  Pb. This equation confirms

that the density in outer space is zero () = 0. As before Taylor series for equation

(4.71) is

It can be noted that compressibility factor can act as increase or decrease of the ideal

gas model depending on whether it is above one or below one. This issue is related to

Pushka equation that will be discussed later.

4.3.5.3 Liquid Under Varying Gravity

For comparison reason consider the deepest location in the ocean which is about 11,000

[m]. If the liquid "equation of state" (4.40) is used with the hydrostatic fluid equation

results in

                                                      e P       P - P0                        (4.76)

which the solution of equation (4.76) is

                  e P0-P BT = Constant - BT g 0                                               (4.77)

Since this author is not aware to which practical situation this solution should be applied,

it is left for the reader to apply according to problem, if applicable.

4.3.6 Liquid Phase

While for most practical purposes, the Cartesian coordinates provides sufficient treat-
ment to the problem, there are situations where the spherical coordinates must be
considered and used.

       Derivations of the fluid static in spherical coordinates are

                        r2 dr   dr

Or in a vector form as

                                1                                    (4.79)
                          P + 4  G = 0

                               

4.4 Fluid in a Accelerated System

Up to this stage, body forces were considered as one-dimensional. In general, the
linear acceleration have three components as opposed to the previous case of only
one. However, the previous derivations can be easily extended. Equation (4.8) can
be transformed into a different coordinate system where the main coordinate is in the
direction of the effective gravity. Thus, the previous method can be used and there
is no need to solve new three (or two) different equations. As before, the constant
pressure plane is perpendicular to the direction of the effective gravity. Generally the
acceleration is divided into two categories: linear and angular and they will be discussed
in this order.

4.4.1 Fluid in a Linearly Accelerated System                         (4.80)

For example, in a two dimensional system, for the effective gravity
                                            geff = a^i + g k^

where the magnitude of the effective gravity is

                        |geff | = g2 + a2                            (4.81)

and the angle/direction can be obtained from

                                         a                           (4.82)
                               tan =

                                         g

       Perhaps the best way to explain the linear acceleration is by examples. Consider
the following example to illustrate the situation.
108                                               CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

a = 5[m/sec]?

Solution

This question is one of the traditional question of the fluid static and is straight forward.

The solution is obtained by finding the effective angle body force. The effective angle

is obtained by adding vectors. The change of the acceleration from the right to left is

like subtracting vector (addition negative vector). This angle/direction can be found

using the following

                     tan-1  = tan-1 a = 5  27.01
                                            g 9.81

The magnitude of the effective acceleration is

                     |geff | = 52 + 9.812 = 11.015[m/sec2]

Solution

(a)

The angle can be found when the acceleration of the cart is found. If there is no
resistance, the acceleration in the cart direction is determined from

                     a = g sin                                        (4.83)

The effective body force is acting perpendicular to the slope. Thus, the liquid surface

is parallel to the surface of the inclination surface.

(b)

In case of resistance force (either of friction due to the air or resistance in the wheels)
reduces the acceleration of the cart. In that case the effective body moves closer to
the gravity forces. The net body force depends on the mass of the liquid and the net
acceleration is

                                     a = g - Fnet                                             (4.84)

The angle of the surface,  < , is now

                  tan  = g - Fnet m                                                           (4.85)

difference can be found. So, the
pressure at any point in the liquid                     g
is the same and equal to the at-
mospheric pressure.                  Fig. 4.15 - Forces diagram of cart sliding on

4.4.2 Angular Acceleration Systems: Constant Density

For simplification reasons, the first case deals with a rotation in a perpendicular to the
gravity. That effective body force can be written as

                  geff = -g k^ + 2r r^                                                        (4.86)

       The lines of constant pressure are               center of
not straight lines but lines of parabolic
shape. The angle of the line depends on                 circulation unit

Solution

It is first assumed that the height is uniform at the tube (see for the open question on
this assumption). The pressure at the interface at the two sides of the tube is same.
Thus, equation (4.88) represents the pressure line. Taking the "left" wing of U tube

                                          zr - z0 = 2 g

Thus subtracting the two equations above from each each other results in

             L 2 1 - x2
zr - zl = 2 g

It can be noticed that this kind equipment can be used to find the gravity.

would you suggest to define the height in the tube?

Solution

of the infinitesimal area from the rotation center is ?. The height of the infinitesimal

4.4.3 Fluid Statics in Geological System

            This author would like to express his gratitude to
          Ralph Menikoff for suggesting this topic.

In geological systems such as the Earth provide cases to be used for fluid static for
estimating pressure. It is common in geology to assume that the Earth is made of
several layers. If this assumption is accepted, these layers assumption will be used to
do some estimates. The assumption states that the Earth is made from the following
layers: solid inner core, outer core, and two layers in the liquid phase with a thin crust.
For the purpose of this book, the interest is the calculate the pressure at bottom of the
liquid phase.

Earth layers not to scale. This explanation is provided to understand how to use the
bulk modulus and the effect of rotation. In reality, there might be an additional effects
which affecting the situation but these effects are not the concern of this discussion.
Two different extremes can recognized in fluids between the outer core to the crust. In
one extreme, the equator rotation plays the most significant role. In the other extreme,
at the north-south poles, the rotation effect is diminished since the radius of rotation is
relatively very small (see Figure 4.19). In that case, the pressure at the bottom of the
liquid layer can be estimated using the equation (4.45) or in approximation of equation
(4.6.j). In this case it also can be noticed that g is a function of r.

In equation (4.91) it is assumed that BT is a function of pressure and the pressure is a
function of the location. Thus, the bulk modulus can be written as a function of the
location radius, r. Again, for simplicity the bulk modulus is assumed to be constant.
Hence,

             (r) = 1                       0                                (4.92)

The governing equation (4.92) can be written using the famous relation for the gravity10
as

             0 = 1 - 1                     r                                (4.93)

The integral can evaluated numerically or analytically as

    P = 02 G      R03 - 6 0 G R02 + 12 02 G2 R0 - 8 03 G3

                             + 2 R02 - 8 0 G R0 + 8 02 G2

       The related issue to this topic is, the pressure at the equator when the rotation is
taken into account. The rotation affects the density since the pressure changes. Thus,
mathematical complications caused by the coupling creates additionally difficulty. The
integral in equation (4.93) has to include the rotation effects. It can be noticed that
the rotation acts in the opposite direction to the gravity. The pressure difference is

                                              r                                 (4.101)

                             P =  g(r) -  r2 dr

                                            R0

Thus the approximated density ratio can be written as

                        0 = 1 - 1           r                                   (4.102)

Where the pressure is obtained by integration as previously was done. The conclusion is
that the pressure at the "equator" is substantially lower than the pressure in the north
or the south "poles" of the solid core. The pressure difference is due to the large radius.
In the range between the two extreme, the effect of rotation is reduced because the
radius is reduced. In real liquid, the flow is much more complicated because it is not
stationary but have cells in which the liquid flows around. Nevertheless, this analysis
gives some indication on the pressure and density in the core.

4.5 Fluid Forces on Surfaces

The forces that fluids (at static conditions) extracts on surfaces are very important for
engineering purposes. This section deals with these calculations. These calculations are
divided into two categories, straight surfaces and curved surfaces.

4.5.1 Fluid Forces on Straight Surfaces

A motivation is needed before going through the routine of derivations. Initially, a
simple case will be examined. Later, how the calculations can be simplified will be
shown.

Consider a rectangular shape gate as shown in Figure 4.20. Calculate the min-
imum forces, F1 and F2 to maintain the gate in position. Assuming that the
atmospheric pressure can be ignored.

Solution

The forces can be calculated by looking at                           "0"

The integral can be simplified as

                                             0

The solution of the above integral is

M = g  a sin                                 3 b l2 + 3 b2 l + b3
                                                       3

This value provides the moment that F1 and F2 should extract. Additional equation
is needed. It is the total force, which is

Ftotal =                                 b

                                          g  ( + ) sin  a d

                                       0

The total force integration provides

Ftotal = g  a sin                    b                             2 b + b2
                                                                        2
                                     ( + )d = g  a sin 

                                   0

The forces on the gate have to provide

F1 + F2 = g  a sin                           2 b + b2
                                                  2

Additionally, the moment of forces around point "O" is

F1 + F2( + b) = g  a sin                     3 b l2 + 3 b2 l + b3
                                                       3

The solution of these equations is

F1 =

Symmetrical Shapes

       Consider the two-dimensional symmetrical area that are under pressure as shown
in Figure 4.21. The symmetry is around any axes parallel to axis x. The total force and
moment that the liquid extracting on the area need to be calculated. First, the force is

F = P dA =          (Patmos +  g h)dA
                                        = A Patmos +  g
           A

                                                                         h()      (4.105)

                                                              1

                                                               ( + 0) sin  dA

In this case, the atmospheric pressure can include any additional liquid layer above

layer "touching" area. The "atmospheric" pressure can be set to zero.

       The moment of inertia, Ix x , is about the axis through point "O" into the page.
Equation (4.110) can be written in more compact form as

                     My = Patmos xc A + g  sin Ix x

Example 4.13 can be generalized to solve any two forces needed to balance the area/-
gate. Consider the general symmetrical body shown in figure 4.22 which has two forces
that balance the body. Equations (4.107) and (4.111) can be combined the moment
and force acting on the general area. If the "atmospheric pressure" can be zero or
include additional layer of liquid. The forces balance reads

                           F1 + F2 = A [Patmos +  g sin  ( 0 + xc)]        (4.112)
and moments balance reads

                           F1 a + F2 b = Patmos xc A + g  sin Ix x         (4.113)
The solution of these equations is

F1 =   sin  - Patmos g b  xc + 0  sin  + Patmos g     b A - Ix x  sin      (4.114)
                                   g (b - a)

and

       Ix x  sin  -   sin  - Patmos g a xc + 0  sin  + Patmos g a A        (4.115)
F2 =                              g (b - a)

       In the solution, the forces can be negative or positive, and the distance a or b can
be positive or negative. Additionally, the atmospheric pressure can contain either an
additional liquid layer above the "touching" area or even atmospheric pressure simply
can be set up to zero. In symmetrical area only two forces are required since the
moment is one dimensional. However, in non-symmetrical area there are two different
moments and therefor three forces are required. Thus, additional equation is required.
This equation is for the additional moment around the x axis (see for explanation in
Figure 4.23). The moment around the y axis is given by equation (4.111) and the total

     The moment around y axis is                                                            End of Ex. 4.14

The right hand side of these equations are given before in equations (4.107), (4.111)
and (4.119).
The moment of inertia of the triangle around x is made of two triangles (as shown in
the Figure (4.24) for triangle 1 and 2). Triangle 1 can be calculated as the moment of
inertia around its center which is 0 +2( 1 - 0)/3. The height of triangle 1 is ( 1 - 0)
and its width b and thus, moment of inertia about its center is Ixx = b( 1 - 0)3/36.
The moment of inertia for triangle 1 about y is

                                                                  A1                 x1 2

                       Ixx1 = 36 b( 1- 0)3 + 3 b( 1- 0)                       0 + 3 2( 1- 0) 2

The height of the triangle 2 is a - ( 1 - 0) and its width b and thus, the moment of
inertia about its center is

                                                                          A2            x2 2

                    Ixx2 = 36 b[a-( 1- 0)]3 + 3 b[a-( 1- 0)]                  1 + 3 [a-( 1- 0)] 2

and the total moment of inertia

              Ixx = Ixx1 + Ixx2                                                     y    b            0

4.5.1.1 Pressure Center

In the literature, pressure centers are commonly defined. These definitions are math-
ematical in nature and has physical meaning of equivalent force that will act through
this center. The definition is derived or obtained from Eq. (4.111) and Eq. (4.119).
The pressure center is the distance that will create the moment with the hydrostatic
force on point "O." Thus, the pressure center in the x direction is

                                1                                      (4.123)
                         xp = F A x P dA

In the same way, the pressure center in the y direction is defined as

                                1                                      (4.124)
                         yp = F A y P dA

To show relationship between the pressure center and the other properties, it can be
found by setting the atmospheric pressure and 0 to zero as following

                         xp = g  sin  Ix x                             (4.125)
                                A  g sin  xc

Expanding Ix x according to equation (3.34) results in

                         xp = Ixx + xc                                 (4.126)
                                xc A

and in the same fashion in y direction

                         yp = Ixy + yc                                 (4.127)
                                yc A

It has to emphasis that these definitions are useful only for case where the atmospheric
pressure can be neglected or canceled and where 0 is zero. Thus, these limitations
diminish the usefulness of pressure center definitions. In fact, the reader can find that
direct calculations can sometimes simplify the problem.

4.5.1.2 Multiply Layers

In the previous sections, the density was assumed to be constant. For non constant
density the derivations aren't "clean" but are similar. Consider straight/flat body that
is under liquid with a varying density11. If density can be represented by average density,
the force that is acting on the body is

Ftotal = g  h dA   g h dA                                             (4.128)

                         A              A

   11This statement also means that density is a monotonous function. Why? Because of the buoyancy
issue. It also means that the density can be a non-continuous function.
122                                           CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

In cases where average density cannot be represented reasonably12, the integral has be
carried out. In cases where density is non-continuous, but constant in segments, the
following can be said

Ftotal = g  h dA = g 1 h dA + g 2 h dA +    + g n h dA                                             (4.129)
                                                                                                      (4.130)
            A  A1                     A2                    An

As before for single density, the following can be written

                xc1 A1                xc2 A2                xcn An 
                                                                     
                               dA +2      dA +    + n

where the density, i is the density of the layer i and Ai and xci are geometrical
properties of the area which is in contact with that layer. The atmospheric pressure can
be entered into the calculation in the same way as before. Moreover, the atmospheric
pressure can include all the layer(s) that do(es) not with the "contact" area.

       The moment around axis y, My under the same considerations as before is

After similar separation of the total integral, one can find that

In the same fashion one can obtain the moment for x axis as                                           (4.135)

   12A qualitative discussion on what is reasonably is not presented here, however, if the variation of
the density is within 10% and/or the accuracy of the calculation is minimal, the reasonable average
can be used.

To illustrate how to work with these equations the following example is provided.

Consider the hypothetical Figure 4.25. The last layer is made of water with

density of 1000[kg/m3]. The densities are 1 = 500[kg/m3], 2 =

800[kg/m3], 3 = 850[kg/m3],                              y                    "O"

b1 = 4.5[m]. The angle of incli-
nation is is  = 45.

Solution

Since there are only two unknowns, only two equations are needed, which are (4.134)
and (4.131). The solution method of this example is applied for cases with less layers
(for example by setting the specific height difference to be zero). Equation (4.134)
can be used by modifying it, as it can be noticed that instead of using the regular
atmospheric pressure the new "atmospheric" pressure can be used as

                          Patmos = Patmos + 1 g h1

The distance for the center for each area is at the middle of each of the "small"
rectangular. The geometries of each areas are

             a2+ sin  h2                                       h2          3

xc1 = 2                   A1 = sin  h2 - a2    Ix x 1 =        sin    -a2              2
xc2 = 2 sin  h2+h3        A2 = sin  (h3 - h2)                       36        + (xc1) A1
xc3 = 2 sin  h3+h4        A3 = sin  (h4 - h3)
                                               Ix x 2 = 36 sin  (h3-h2)3 + (xc2)2 A2

                                               Ix x 3 = 36 sin  (h4-h3)3 + (xc3)2 A3

After inserting the values, the following equations are obtained
Thus, the first equation is

     The solution provided isn't in the complete long form since it will makes things messy.

     It is simpler to compute the terms separately. A mini source code for the calculations
     is provided in the text source. The intermediate results in SI units ([m], [m2], [m4])

     are:

           xc1 = 2.2892                xc2 = 3.5355                                         xc3 = 4.9497

           A1 = 2.696                  A2 = 3.535                                           A3 = 3.535

           Ix x 1 = 14.215 Ix x 2 = 44.292 Ix x 3 = 86.718

     The final answer is

                                       F1 = 304809.79[N ]

     and

Here, the conventional notation is used                                                     Fig. 4.26 - The forces on curved area.

which is to denote the area, dA, outward

as positive. The total force on the area will be the integral of the unit force

4.5. FLUID FORCES ON SURFACES                                                                 125

 The result of the integral is a vector. So, if the y component of the force is needed,
only a dot product is needed as

                                 dFy = dF  ^j                                                (4.138)

From this analysis (equation (4.138)) it can be observed that the force in the direction
of y, for example, is simply the integral of the area perpendicular to y as

                                            Fy = P dAy                                        (4.139)

                                                                             A

The same can be said for the x direction.
       The force in the z direction is

                                           Fz = h g dAz                                       (4.140)

                                                                          A

       The force which acting on the z di-
rection is the weight of the liquid above the
projected area plus the atmospheric pres-
sure. This force component can be com-
bined with the other components in the
other directions to be

   Ftotal = Fz2 + Fx2 + Fy2      (4.141)                                        only the

The moment due to the curved surface require integration to obtain the value. There
are no readily made expressions for these 3-dimensional geometries. However, for some
geometries there are readily calculated center of mass and when combined with two
other components provide the moment (force with direction line).

Cut-Out Shapes Effects

       There are bodies with a shape that the vertical direction (z direction) is "cut-
out" aren't continuous. Equation (4.140) implicitly means that the net force on the
body is z direction is only the actual liquid above it. For example, Figure 4.27 shows a
floating body with cut-out slot into it. The atmospheric pressure acts on the area with
continuous lines. Inside the slot, the atmospheric pressure with it piezometric pressure
is canceled by the upper part of the slot. Thus, only the net force is the actual liquid
in the slot which is acting on the body. Additional point that is worth mentioning is
that the depth where the cut-out occur is insignificant (neglecting the change in the
density).

        Here, the traditional approach was presented first, and the direct approach
second. It is much simpler now to use the second method. In fact, there are many
programs or hand held devices that can carry numerical integration by inserting the
function and the boundaries.

       To demonstrate this point further, consider a more general case of a polynomial
function. The reason that a polynomial function was chosen is that almost all the
continuous functions can be represented by a Taylor series, and thus, this example
provides for practical purposes of the general solution for curved surfaces.

     The right side can be evaluated for any given function.
     For example, in this case describing the dam function is

     The value of xb is where y = b and can be obtained by finding the first and positive

     To evaluate the moment, expression of the distance and angle to point "O" are needed
     (see Figure 4.33). The distance between the point on the dam at x to the point "O"
     is

           (x) = (b - y)2 + (xb - x)2

     The angle between the force and the distance to point "O" is

     The element moment in this case is

                                                                         dF

     To make this example less abstract, consider the specific case of y = 2 x6. In this
     case, only one term is provided and xb can be calculated as following

with units of [1/m5]. The derivative at x is

The angle can be expressed as

                      = tan-1 12 x5 - tan-1   b - 2 x6

This integral doesn't have a analytical solution. However, for a given value b this
integral can be evaluate. The horizontal force is

In going over these calculations, the calculations of the center of the area were not
carried out. This omission saves considerable time. In fact, trying to find the cen-
ter of the area will double the work. This author find this method to be simpler
for complicated geometries while the indirect method has advantage for very simple
geometries.

4.6 Buoyancy and Stability

One of the oldest known scientific research

on fluid mechanics relates to buoyancy                                            h0
                                                                         r0
due to question of money was carried by

Archimedes. Archimedes principle14is re-          a

lated to question of density and volume.

While Archimedes did not know much about

integrals, yet he was able to capture the                         b

essence. Here, because this material is           Fig. 4.34 - Schematic of Immersed
presented in a different era, more advance             Cylinder.
mathematics will be used. While the

question of the stability was not scientifically examined in the past, the floating vessels

structure (more than 300 years ago) show some understanding.

The total net forces the liquid and gravity exact on a body are considered as

a buoyancy issue while the moment these force considered as a stability issue. The

buoyancy issue was solved by Archimedes and for all practical purposes topic should

be considered really solved issue. Furthermore, as a derivative, the stability in the

perpendicular direction liquid surface is a solved problem did not give to any real question

(like oscillating of body is solved problem). While there are recent papers which deal

the issue but they do solve any issue in this respect. However, the rotation stability is

issue that continue to be evolved even after this work. There three approaches that

deal with issue which are in historical order are Metacenter, potential, and moment
examination15.

To understand this issue, consider a cuboid and a cylindrical bodies that is im-

mersed in liquid and center in a depth of, h0 as shown (only for the cuboid shape)

in Fig. 4.35. The force to hold the cylinder at the place must be made of integration

of the pressure around the surface of the cuboidal and cylinder bodies. The forces on

cuboid geometry body are made only of vertical forces because the two sides cancel each

other. However, on the vertical direction, the pressure on the two surfaces are different.

On the upper surface the pressure is  g (h0 -

a/2). On the lower surface the pressure is

 g (h0 + a/2). The force due to the liquid pres-                     h0

sure per unit depth (into the page) is

                                                               a

F =  g ((h0 - a/2) - (h0 + a/2)) b =

                -  g a b = - g V (4.144) b

In this case the represents a depth (into the     Fig. 4.35 - The forces on immersed
page). Rearranging equation (4.144) to be              cuboid from the top and bottom.

   14This topic was the author's high school class name (ship stability). It was taught by people like
these, 300 years ago and more, ship builders who knew how to calculate GM but weren't aware of
scientific principles behind it. If the reader wonders why such a class is taught in a high school, perhaps
the name can explain it: Sea Officers High School ( or Acco Nautical College).

. The force on the immersed body is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid.

This analysis can be generalized by noticing two things. All the horizontal forces are

canceled. Any body that has a projected area that has two sides, those will cancel

each other in the perpendicular to surface di-

rection. Another way to look at this point

is by approximation. Every body can be bro-

ken theoretically into to infinitesimal thickness                     h0

of rectangular. For any two rectangle bodies,

the horizontal forces are canceling each other.

The forces on the top and bottom ended up                                 r

to be just the weight of the displace liquid.                             

The sum all these infinitesimal small rectan-

gles become the displaced volume of the en-

tire body. Thus even these bodies which are

in contact with each other, the imaginary pres-

sure make it so that they cancel each other.        Fig. 4.36 - The forces on cylinder
On the other hand it also can demonstrated di-           and can be represented by in-
rect integration. To illustration of this concept,       finitesimal cuboid
consider the cylindrical shape in Figure 4.34.

The force per area (see Figure 4.36) is

                                         P          dAvertical

dF =  g (h0 - r sin ) sin  r d                                               (4.146)

The total force will be the integral of the equation (4.146)

                                                          2                  (4.147)

                               F =  g (h0 - r sin ) r d sin 

                                                        0

Rearranging equation (4.146) transforms it to

                                                                   2         (4.148)
                                                                             (4.149)
                               F = r g  (h0 - r sin ) sin  d

                                                                 0

The solution of equation (4.148) is

                                             F = - r2  g

The negative sign indicate that the force acting upwards. While the horizontal force is

     Example 4.18: Long Long                                           Level: Basic

     What depth will a long log with radius, r, a length, and density, w in liquid
     with density, l will be heavier the surrounding liquid. Assume that l > w.
     You can provide that the angle or the depth?

     Solution

     The depth does not affect the weight of log.

       Typical examples to explain the buoyancy are of the vessel with thin walls put
upside down into liquid. The second example of the speed of the floating bodies. Since
there are no better examples, these examples are a must.

     Example 4.19: Upside down Bucket Floating                  Level: Advance

     A cylindrical body, shown in Figure 4.37                 h1 w
     ,is floating in liquid with density, l.
     The body was inserted into liquid in a                     t hin  h
     such a way that the air had remained
     in it. Express the maximum wall thick-        Fig. 4.37 - Schematic of a thin wall

     the wall, s liquid density, l and the
     surroundings air temperature, T1 for the
     body to float. In the case where thick-
     ness is half the maximum, calculate the
     pressure inside the container. The con-
     tainer diameter is w. Assume that the
     wall thickness is small compared with
     the other dimensions (t << w and
     t << h).

     Solution

     The air mass in the container is

                                                       V air

                                                        RT

     The mass of the container is

     The liquid amount enters into the cavity is such that the air pressure in the cavity
     equals to the pressure at the interface (in the cavity). Note that for the maximum
     thickness, the height, h1 has to be zero. Thus, the pressure at the interface can be

written as

                                Pin = l g hin

On the other hand, the pressure at the interface from the air point of view (ideal gas

model) should be

                                Pin =   mair R T1

                                        hin  w  2

                                                                                        V

Since the air mass didn't change and it is known, it can be inserted into the above
equation.

                                                                                                                

                      l g hin + Patmos = Pin =   w2 h Patmos R T1
The last equation can be simplified into                    R T1

                                                       hin  w2

                                   l g hin + Patmos = h Patmos

And the solution for hin is

                              Patmos +  4 g h Patmos l + Patmos2
                   hin = -                  2 g l

and

                   hin =   4 g h Patmos l + Patmos2 - Patmos
                                            2 g l

The solution must be positive, so that the last solution is the only physical solution.

Calculate the minimum density an infinitely long equilateral triangle (three equal

sides) has to be so that the sharp end is in the water.

Solution

The solution demonstrates that when h - 0 then hin - 0. When the gravity
approaches zero (macro gravity) then

                   Patmos       h2 l g 2 h3 l2 g2 5 h4 l3 g3
            hin =          +h-          +               2-                     3 +렁

This "strange" result shows that bodies don't float in the normal sense. When the
floating is under vacuum condition, the following height can be expanded into

                        hin =   h Patmos + Patmos +   
                                g l             2 g l

which shows that the large quantity of liquid enters into the container as it is expected.

     Archimedes theorem states that the force balance is at displaced weight liquid (of the

     same volume) should be the same as the container, the air. Thus,

                 net displayed                   container                                air

     If air mass is neglected the maximum thickness is

               tmax =      2 g h w l + Patmos w - w 4 gh Patmos l + Patmos2

                                            (2 g w + 4 g h) l s

     The condition to have physical value for the maximum thickness is

                       2 g h l + Patmos  4 gh Patmos l + Patmos2

     The full solution is

                                                 (2 g w+4 g h) R l s T1

     In this analysis the air temperature in the container immediately after insertion in
     the liquid has different value from the final temperature. It is reasonable as the
     first approximation to assume that the process is adiabatic and isentropic. Thus, the
     temperature in the cavity immediately after the insertion is

                                            Ti = Pi
                                            Tf   Pf

     The final temperature and pressure were calculated previously. The equation of state
     is

     The new unknown must provide additional equation which is

Example 4.21: Acceleration of Floating Body                                                              Level: Advance

A body is pushed into the liquid to a distance, h0 and left at rest. Calculate
acceleration and time for a body to reach the surface. The body's density

is  l , where  is ratio between the body density to the liquid density and
(0 <  < 1). Is the body volume important?

Solution

The net force is

                        weight    weight

                  F = V g l     - V g  l = V g l (1 - )

But on the other side the internal force is

                                                                                           m

                                          F = m a = V l a

Thus, the acceleration is
                                             a=g 1-
                                                          

If the object is left at rest (no movement) thus time will be (h = 1/2 a t2)

                                t = 2 h
                                         g(1 - )

If the object is very light ( - 0) then

                                3                                                             5          7

From the above equation, it can be observed that only the density ratio is important.
This idea can lead to experiment in "large gravity" because the acceleration can be
magnified and it is much more than the reverse of free falling.

Example 4.22: Equivalent Force                                                                     Level: Intermediate

In some situations, it is desired to find equivalent of force of a certain shape

to be replaced by another force of a "standard" shape. Consider the force that

acts on a half sphere. Find equivalent cylinder that has the same diameter that

has the same force.

Solution

The force act on the half sphere can be found by integrating the forces around the

          dF = (L - S) g r cos  cos  cos  cos  r2 d d

The total force is then

                           

                     Fx =          (L - S) g cos2  cos2  r3 d d

                           00

The result of the integration the force on sphere is

                                          2 (L - S ) r3
                                   Fs = 4

The force on equivalent cylinder is

                                   Fc =  r2 (L - S ) h

These forces have to be equivalent and thus

                                      1

                                   4

Thus, the height is

Example 4.23: Two forces Body                                   Level: Intermediate

In the introduction to this section, it was assumed that above liquid is a gas

with inconsequential density. Suppose that the above layer is another liquid

which has a bit lighter density. Body with density between the two liquids,

l < s < rhoh is floating between the two liquids. Develop the relationship
between the densities of liquids and solid and the location of the solid cubical.

There are situations where density is a function of the depth. What will be the

location of solid body if the liquid density varied parabolically.

Solution

In the discussion to this section, it was shown that net force is the body volume times
the density of the liquid. In the same vein, the body can be separated into two: one
in first liquid and one in the second liquid. In this case there are two different liquid
densities. The net force down is the weight of the body c h A. Where h is the
height of the body and A is its cross section. This force is balance according to above
explanation by the two liquid as

                           c 쮐쭭 = 쭭쮐 ( l + (1 - )h)

Where  is the fraction that is in low liquid. After rearrangement it became

                                        = c - h
                                             l - h

The second part deals with the case where the density varied parabolically. The density
as a function of x coordinate along h starting at point h is

                                        x2
                     (x) = h - h (h - l)

Thus the equilibration will be achieved, A is canceled on both sides, when

              c h =             x1 +h  h -     x2
                              x1               h (h - l) dx

After the integration the equation transferred into

         (3 l - 3 h) x12 + (3 h l - 3 h h) x1 + h2 l + 2 h2 h
c h = 3 h

And the location where the lower point of the body (the physical), x1, will be at

              3 h2 l2 + (4 c - 6 h2 h) l + 3 h2 h2 - 12 c h + 3 h l - 3 h h
           3                                   6 h - 2 l

X1 =

For linear relationship the following results can be obtained.

                              x1 = h l + h h - 6 c
                                          2 l - 2 h

In many cases in reality the variations occur in small zone compare to the size of
the body. Thus, the calculations can be carried out under the assumption of sharp
change. However, if the body is smaller compare to the zone of variation, they have
to accounted for.

The first two solutions are imaginary thus not valid for the physical world. The last
solution is the solution that was needed. The depth that sphere will be located depends
on the ratio of t/R which similar analysis to the above. For a given ratio of t/R, the
weight displaced by the sphere has to be same as the sphere weight. The volume of
a sphere cap (segment) is given by

    Example 4.25: Variable Weight                  Level: Intermediate

One of the common questions in buoyancy is the weight with variable cross

section and fix load. For example, a wood wedge of wood with a fix weight/load.

The general question is at what the depth of the object (i.e. wedge) will be

located. For simplicity, assume that the body is of a solid material.

Solution

It is assumed that the volume can be written as a function of the depth. As it was

shown in the previous example, the relationship between the depth and the displaced

liquid volume of the sphere. Here it is assumed that this relationship can be written

as

cess assume that liquid level is fixed and buoy
is moving. In this case also assume that that
there is a resistance to the buoy movement and
neglect other effects like added mass, stability
etc. Write the governing equation.

Solution

The description of the buoy is given in Fig. 4.38. The internal force is the regular m a
pointing up (not known at this stage). The external forces are the gravity and the
damping force. The damping force acting on buoy as oppose the movement of the
buoy. The buoy is assume to move the direction of the coordinate hence the resistance
point downward. The gravity is pointing downward. The trick here is to recognize
that actual force is the change from the equilibrium. Thus the net gravity force is

Where m is the mass of the buoy, D is the damping coefficient, A is the cross area of

the buoy, and g the gravity acceleration. Eq. (4.26.a) can be written in a clean form

This equation can be solved analytically if the coefficients are constant. However, in

reality these coefficients are depended on the location and the velocity. The solution

is left others.

Where T is the tension in the string. When there is no string h is at equilibrium.
The difference h - h is responsible for the tension in rope. At equilibrium the tension
in the rope is zero and buoyancy is equal to gravity.

                               s H =  h                                  (4.151)

Denote the extra rope as h so

                               h = h + h                                 (4.28.b)

Hence substituting Eq. (4.28.b) and Eq. (4.151) into Eq. (4.28.a) reads

Solution

The point that the question makes that the measurement of pressure are relative or
difference between two points. Denote pa = 1.01 [bar] as the atmospheric pressure.
The pressure differences according Fig. 4.40 are:

                            pG1 = p - p2                                  (4.30.a)

                            pG2 = p2 - pa                                 (4.30.b)
                            p2 = pG2 - pa                                 (4.30.c)

Thus,

p = p2 + pG1 = pG1 + pG2 + pa = 5.00 + 1.00 + 1.01 = 7.01[bar] (4.30.d)

4.6.1 Stability

Simplistically, the stability of floating body is divided into three categories. When

moments/forces are such that they returned the immerse body to its original position

state is referred to as the stable body

and vice versa. The third state is when            empty

ment, it is referred to as the neutral

stable. An example of such situation

is a rounded body, like a marble, on              gravity   b      c

herently "unstable." Only at extreme

case where liquid density is almost equal to the density of solid body it will be neutral

stability. Bodies with none uniform densities can be both situations, in stable and none

stable. The bodies with none uniform density can be arranged so the mass centroid in

lower position. The discussion here will be focused on uniformed bodies as they provide

more complicated situations. The none uniformed bodies are like uniform bodies but

with a different center of gravity. To understand the unstable zone consider Fig. 4.41

which shows a body made of a hollow balloon and a heavy sphere connected by a

thin and light rod in three different configurations. The left one (a) shows the sphere

just under the balloon in middle (b) there is a slight deviation from the previous case.

Case 3 depicts (right side) almost opposite to case (a). This arrangement has a mass

centroid close to the middle of the sphere. The buoyant centroid is below the middle of

the balloon. If this arrangement is inserted into liquid and will be floating, the balloon

will be on the top and sphere on the bottom Fig. 4.41a. Tilting the body with a small

angle from its resting position creates a shift in the forces direction to return original

state (examine Fig. 4.41a). These forces create a moment which wants to return the

body to the resting (original) position. When the body is at the position shown in

Fig. 4.41c, the body is unstable and any tilt from the original position creates moment

that will further continue to move the body from its original position. This analysis

doesn't violate the second law of thermodynamics because it takes energy to move the

body to the unstable situation.

4.6.1.1 Centroid of Floating Body or Buoyancy Centroid

troduce, the center or centroid of floating body               GA

lustrate this point consider an arbitrary shape floats on liquid shown in Fig. 4.42. It was

shown, in this book, that the force acting on floating body must be only in the vertical
146                                                CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

direction. Furthermore, the liquid pressure must be balanced the displaced liquid. The
equivalent force of the pressure acting on the body in equilibrium can be obtained from
calculating the center mass of the displaced liquid. Note that the above statement is
correct for arbitrary density (for example, if the density,  = f (h)). If the body is not in
equilibrium with the floating force does not act at the center of mass. The location and
direction of the force is some distance from the center of the mass yet in the vertical
direction. Before diving into the stability issues a short history of the topic is provided.

4.6.1.2 History of the Stability Analysis

The history of the stability analysis is reflective of general physics and fluid mechanics

science. A good summary is given by (Nowacki and Ferreiro 2003) but lacking major

developments that occurred in the last 30 years. The highlights of stability analysis

research show that it was important topic for a long time. Clearly having ship that

do not flipped in the sea (or other water body) was important since the early time.

The test was done by having some individuals moving on the floating body to examine

how the stable it is. The real understanding of the stability is tied to more advance

mathematics and fluid mechanics there was no ability to examine this issue. For example,

Archimedes did not know about the concept of pressure hence he lack a major tool in

his understanding.

     The early work was done by Huygens

(Huygens 1967) by that time the concept of

pressure and some knowledge of early calcu-

lus was available. Even the concept of "spe-

cific gravity" (specific density) was introduced

by that time (density was introduced 1586 by Si-

mon Stevin). Stevin also discover that the forces

(gravity and buoyancy) have to act in the same

line as prerequisite for stability. French mathe-

matics Paul Hoste, (1652-1700) made attempt        Fig. 4.43 - Bouguer Showing Meta-

did know about the calculus.

       In Euler was requested by the Russian (at the time he was Russian Tzer kids
tutor, what a lucky students) to review the work of La Croix's work (Euler 1735; Euler
1736). As usual money was the reason pushing the science forward. That was the age
of discovery and ability to project power especially with a marine power was essential.
During that era the ship's gunport was developed The need to find the water line and
maximum turning point before water get into the ship were important. Hence the
importance of developing the science behind the stability.

       Pierre Bouguer French Hydrologist (fluid mechanics) got his father royal professor
post at age of 15 after his father pass away (must be very smart kid). He improved the
numerical integration methods (trapezoid method)16. Later he derived the Metacenter

   16This method is widely used in stability study even though there are simpler and better methods
like Simpson's rule
4.6. BUOYANCY AND STABILITY                                       147

concept (Bouguer 1746) see Fig. 4.43. This Metacenter method is the most used
method today. Yet, when one tries to use it, it is found to be complicated and graphical
representation (or numerical modeling) is commonly required. The main drawback
metacenter methods is that it leads people to miss several effects and thus write wrong
stability equations or equation with hundred of percent errors without understanding
the physics.

       As results, another method namely          Yaw              Roll

be used. In this method the energy or the

was first proposed by Huygens and again                side view
because lack of calculus developed at that

       Paul Erd쮗s et al was the first (this author is not aware other who worked the
details) to have used this approach successfully (Erd쮗s, Schibler, and Herndon 1992).
Amazingly the authors were not aware the centroid calculations are well established
topic and used complex integral calculations to find the centroid of trapezoid (and
these calculations were done 1992!). Additionally they have made some nonessential
assumptions which Mohammad Abolhassani was able to fix. The calculations of centroid
were not explained in the last paper (Abolhassani 2004). The potential method will be
explained briefly later on. This approach utilizes mathematics creates an abstraction to
examine what cause what and why. In way, the methods abstract the physics and convert
it a pure mathematical creation. The method is seeking to find the angle(s) for which
the shortest vertical distance between buoyancy centroid and the gravity/mass centroid.
Numerous mathematical papers (dealing with the mathematics) where published later
dealing with abstract. It is the opinion of this undersign that many of these papers
are without any real meaning to the stability of floating body field. It is interesting to
point out that because lack of physical observation ability or because the underline the
equilibrium analysis it was assumed that it is a dimensional compartmental. In stability
of floating bodies, the stability is compartmental under very unique cases where the body
is symmetrical and extruded body. For example, using marine terminology, roll rotation
creates yaw rotations because change of Centroid location in x,y, and z directions.
Recently Abolhassani made advances in the area and show that it is equivalent to
metacenter.

       The newest approach is the Direct Examination approach and it is suggested by
this undersign. The Metacenter method is probably the closest to the Direct Examina-
tion.

     Solution

     On of the favorite question that this undersign bring to engineers. Assume that G is
     not the same vertical action line as the B. In that case, a moment is created and the
     body will rotate until G and B will be on the same vertical action line.

situation is similar to Fig. 4.41c. However,

any experiment of this cubic shows that the cubic is stable only under special conditions.

Small amount of tilting of the cubic results in immediate returning away from the

original position. For example, under the conditions where wood (solid) density is half

of the liquid, the distance between GB (also AB) is exactly quarter of the side (a/4)

as it can be observed from the drawing. The location of center of gravity is constant

and centroid of the immersed part is a/4 and hence a/2 - a/4 = a/4. The buoyancy

force will be the weight of the cubic. When the centroid is exactly under the center of

mass of the cubic it can be in equilibrium. What happen when the buoyancy force and

gravity force are slightly deviate from the equilibrium? This question is the question of

stability.

the body is stable and conversely (to be on the right hand side of the purple line

 < ). In this case as it will be shown the body is unstable and the cubic will tilted

away.

       When the cubic is floating at 45 degree the mass gravity centroid (point G) is

in the same location. But as it will be shown, the angle  is large and therefore the

body is stable. It has to emphasis that this discussion refers to a specific density ratio,

in other words, that body density is half of the liquid.

       From geometrical consideration (see Table 3.1 page 76) center is 1/3 of the
height. The height is b/ 2 and hence the GB (more importantly AB) is b/3 2. It

can be noticed that in this case the value GB is smaller than the GB distance in the
upright situation, that is b/4 > b/3 2. The value of GB (or AB) in the upright is about

0.01429774 b larger than the tilted case but any other configuration.

Yet for both cases the forces are identical

(why? Because body has the same mass

yet the moment is smaller due to a small

leverage.). This point is actually the base

for the energy method.

       In this case, all the situations are "un-                       G

Also note body has the smallest moment (the force is the same). This topic is related

to curve of dynamical stability and Moseley's formula (for stability not rays). Yet, this

topic will not be covered in this book.

       In other geometries and/or other densities of liquid and floating body, this kind of

analysis has to done to determine the least "unstable" situation. This analysis can be

done in a conventional way which will presented first and in new innovative approach.

The conventional method introduces a new geometrical location which used to describe
the stability while this location is physical it requires calculations and it is not "visible."
While the conventional approach is used by many, now this undersign recommends
to utilize the new direct examination method. The potential method is simpler and
practical but requires some theoretical understanding and abstraction of the physics.

After the rotation, the gravity will be in the new coordinate system pointing to negative
y ordinate. In that case the buoyancy for small  will rotate the body to restore to the
original location. For large  the buoyancy center will rotate the body further from the
original state.

       Example 4.32: Minimum 3 D Effects                  Level: Intermediate
     What are the minimum conditions for 3D effects.

     Solution

     The cause of 3D effect is the asymmetry in two directions "opposite to the motion at
     question." That is a ship that perfectly symmetrical along the length of the ship but
     "front" ( bow) and "back" (stern) are asymmetrical (for various reasons) the centroid
     of the ship move along back and forth (between the bow and the stern) as result ship
     has yaw rotation. (that is for example, roll creates yaw).

It can be noticed that the right hand side depends only on the volume and surface at
the immersed side while the left hand side depends on the difference between the entire

Example 4.33: Rectangular Body Stability                                          Level: Intermediate

What are the conditions that extruded rectangular shape (cuboid) will be float-

ing stable in a liquid (see Fig. 4.49). Assume that the dimensions of the rect-

angular are s >> b long and the crosse section is b the width and D the height

are same magnitude.

     The results of Eq. (4.33.e) are depicted in Fig. 4.50. It can be noticed that (as

     expected) for large values of b/D the body is stable. However, when the densities
     ratios are very small ( s - 0) or very large ( s - 1) (solid density is close to
     liquid density) even for small value the ratio of geometries the body is stable (not

     intuitive). In the mid range of densities requires a larger ratio of b/D. Note that edge

     close range s/ - 0 or s/ - 1 this analysis is not applied.

     later) and first was published in this book.

       From the dome shown the Fig. 4.50 it is expect body with density ratio of about
0.5 (closer to 0.6) to less stable than the body extremely light density. As it can be
observed in Fig. 4.51b The difference is so significant that the light body is extremely
stable while heavier body like wooden squire is unstable.

     heavier bodies. In fact the even smaller ratio of b/D are stable for the foam as shown

     phone even (1:2) is stable. This experiment was not done before and it demonstrates the
     Direct Examination model showing the dome applicability.

Most modern ships are build like a square for example the Ever giving Ship. This kind
of ship with their displacement is unstable. Thus, it requires the gravity center to move
below the center of the body. This topic that will be discussed later.

1, 2, and 3 corners in the liquid

       This topic should not be fluid mechanics book but the stability book. Neverthe-
less, it is add to here as a temporary place holder.

       This discussion deals with uniform density dealing with number of immersed cor-
ners. When cuboid floating body there is two possible regimes. These two regimes are
separated by half point (s = 0.5 ).

       At this limiting case when a square turning to 45 there are three corners (or one
if half corner is considered to be out) immersed in the liquid. Otherwise, there are two
corners in the liquid at all time. When (s > 0.5 ) then there are situations where two
corners or three corners inside the liquid. There are no situations with only one corner.
Conversely, in the case (s < 0.5 ) there are only one corner or two corners immersed
in the liquid.

     that the base and the height of the tri-

     The mass centroid of the triangle is 1/3 of the height. The location of buoyancy
     centroid is 1/3 of the immersed part for case of the tip in the liquid. Archimedes's

Eq. (4.34.f) has significance which was not explored in this section. The relationship
is different from those obtained in a rectangular extrusion shape, no dome. It can
be said that here heavier the body the more stable it become. It indicate that if you
are on boat that has triangle shape you should make it heavier. And the body will
"fail" if it is very light. This phenomenon is oppose the squire shape shown before. In
"regular" rectangular extrusion does not have a singular point as in triangle extrusion.
In the "regular" rectangular and cylinder the relationship was with the densities ratio
while here it is with square root and this factor was not examined yet.

        The most important point is that for metacenter Oblivion to the cross section
change. Hence, the sensitivity of the Direct Method to change of the location of the
rotating point is important as it will be discussed later for floating bodies maneuver-
ability.

A cylinder is floating on a liquid when z coordinate is upright. Under what

conditions the cylinder is stable. Is 3-D effects appears in the stability analysis

of the cylinder under the condition in this question.

Solution

There is no 3-D effects because the cylinder is symmetrical in both directions around
the x axis and the y axis. The condition for stability is

                               BA  Ixx                            (4.35.a)
                                        V0

The moment of inertia of circle is given in table 3.1 Ixx =  r4/4. The volume of
the submerged part is  r2 d. The location of point A A = D/2 and the location of

B = d/2. The last part is to related between submerged volume to total volume as

                              d  = D s                            (4.35.b)

Armed with all the components Eq. (4.35.a) can be written as

                                                           r2

It can be observed that the smallest possible value of the Eq. (4.35.c) when the ratio
(s/ = 0.5) and in that case, r > 2D. The results are presented in Fig. 4.54
The strange fact is the stability line appears symmetrical as the rectangular shape in
regard to densities ratio.

There is no 3-D effect in extruded bodies.

       Example of utility of the dome can be demonstrated by the following example.
In Ex. 4.26 a possible of energy harvesting from the wave energy by utilizing the liquid
surface change. The stability dome shown for the cylinder (Fig. 4.54) also determine the
dimension of the buoy. The mechanical conditions requires that the buoy must move
the vertical path only without rotation. This condition necessitates the requirements
on the geometry of the buoy. The buoy diameter must be in the same magnitude as
the buoy stroke. In fact several companies build these buoys and determine that they
have to large when they did know about the stability dome. One can wonder if it is not
cheaper to hire a good researcher instead.

4.6.1.5 Potential Energy Approach

This method was suggested by Erd쮗s et al and was slightly improved by Abolhassani.
This method based on the idea that a derivative of potential energy can provide a loca-
tion or locations where a system has a minimum (or maximum) and thus it is potential
location of stability point17. The energy used in this scenario is the gravitational energy
that is expressed as

Usys = (M + m) g hM+m = g (m hm + M hM )                                         (4.154)

   17This topic should be discussed elementary physics class and not fluid mechanics textbook. However,
if there will be a significant request it will be briefly discussed.

Where subscript sys referred to the entire system. The m is referred to floating body
and M is referred to the displaced liquid in other words to the mass if the liquid was
filling the submerged volume. The logic to the last definition is that it represents the
potential of the buoyancy force acting in the center immersed part. The change in the
potential is due to the change in the angle

To correct the energy method, it suggested that a new stability potential energy should
build similar to velocity potential that is discussed in this book on potential flow. The
following definition should be adapted. The stability potential is defined as

f = Ffx^i + Ffy^j + Ffzk^               (4.156)

Where f is the stability function. Ffx and Ffy are the components in the x (yaw) y
(pitch). The main component which roll is Ffz and the difference that this main/mostly
movement that cause the movement in the other two directions. Fig. 4.55 depicts a
body in a shape of the "T" that is symmetrical along it length. However the body is not
symmetrical in any other direction. The top (out stretch segment) is thin enough so
that it just at the liquid level. If there any roll the material suddenly at the thin section
will enter the liquid. In fact under this configuration, the force and the moment will be
the largest at thin segment. Since the force acting on the body from non symmetrical
location. That is, there are two different moments one the roll direction and one in the
yaw direction.

The two methods that previously discussed are the direct (Direct Examination) and the
abstract (potential energy). There is another method which is older and still prevail
in the field of marine engineering and it is referred as the meta center. Metacenter
method is based on the difference between the body's local positions gravity centroid
and imaginary point that is referred to as Metacenter. These points are results from
the buoyant force and can be obtained by following analysis. Assuming a general body
is floating and it is at a certain configuration. To check if the body is stable at this
situation the body is tilted at a small angle, , and the force (momentum) is examined.
Notice the starting point is similar to the Direct Examination method. The immersed
part of the body center changes to a new location, B' as shown in Figure 4.56. The
center of the mass (gravity) is still in the same old location since the body did not
change.

       The body, shown in Figure 4.56, when given a tilted position, move to a new
buoyant center, B'. This deviation of the buoyant center from the old buoyant center
location, B, is calculated. This analysis is based on the difference of the displaced liquid.
The right brown area (volume) in Fig. 4.56 is displaced by the same area (really the
volume) on left since the weight of the body didn't change18so the total immersed area
(volume) is constant. For small angle, , the moment is calculated as the integration
of the small force shown in the Figure 4.56 as F . The displacement of the buoyant
center can be calculated by examining the moment these forces creates. The body
weight creates opposite moment to balance the moment of the displaced liquid volume.

                             BB W = M  (4.157)

Where M is the moment created by the displaced areas (volumes), BB is the distance
between points B and point B', and, W referred to the weight of the body. It can

   18It is correct to state: area only when the body is extruded. However, when the body is not extruded,
the analysis is still correct because the volume and not the area should be used.

be noticed that the distance BB is an approximation for small angles (neglecting the
vertical component.). So the perpendicular distance, BB , should be

                                   BB = M                             (4.158)

The moment M can be calculated as

M=                                F                             x2dA

       The integral in the right side of equation (4.159) is referred to as the area moment
of inertia and was discussed in Chapter 3. The distance, BB can be written from
equation (4.159) as

                       BB = g  Ixx                                    (4.160)

       The point where the gravity force direction is intersecting with the center line of
the cross section is referred as metacentric point, M. The location of the metacentric
point can be obtained from the geometry as

                                                        BB            (4.161)
                                              BM =

                                                        sin 
And combining equations (4.160) with (4.161) yields

                       BM = g lIxx = l Ixx                           (4.162)

For small angle (  0)

                       0 

It is remarkable that the results is independent of the angle. Looking at Fig. 4.56, the
geometrical quantities can be related as

                                        BM                            (4.164)

It can be noticed that the combination of Vbodys/ = V0 and additionally the notation

     that the body is solid with density below the liquid density, calculate the GM

     for various dimensions. The governing equation is

The rectangular has larger GM when floating on very heavy liquid. It is more
stable if it is lighter. The blue line differentiate between positive and to negative
GM values The Fig. 4.58 exhibits the GM as function of the density ratio for
various ratio of b/D. The figure demonstrates that there is a minimum with
every graph that is around the s = 0.5 . For some ratios of b/D the figure
demonstrates that GM is negative. As solid density approaches to liquid density,
the body becomes more stable and even with positive GM for some b/D ratios.
At mid range density range the body is less stable.

Solution

Example 4.37: What to do                                                                                                                                             Level: Simple

Assume that you are on a floating body (boat or ship) and it is about turn to
it side. what should you in order to save the floating body? Throw items over
board or bring more things to ship like your raft that is normally tied to your
boat?

Solution

If the ship or the boat is light that throwing items will make more stable. On the other
the boat is almost full and you should add more items and make it as heavy as you
can (even pump water into the ship). It is common to have a maximum load marking
on the ship or boat. Normally this point should be design in about 30% of the ship
displacement. Thus, if the convention is applied that it better to throw as much as

     possible. The reason that maximum mark exist is or should be for stability reasons.

     Load about that point will the ship unstable (below safety factor).

     As anecdote of this author, on his ship mechanic duty exam (on a missile boat) a com-

     mon question was what to do when ship shows signs of turning. The proper answer was

     to pump and throw overboard everything as possible out. The question was originated

     by someone experienced it first hand without any the theoretical understanding.

Unstable Bodies

       What happen when one increases the height ratio above the maximum height
ratio? The body will flip into the side and turn to the next stable point (angle).
This is not a hypothetical question, but rather practical. This happens when a ship is
overloaded with containers above the maximum height. In commercial ships, the fuel is
stored at the bottom of the ship and thus the mass center (point G) is changing during
the voyage. So, the ship that was a stable (positive GM) leaving the initial port might
became unstable (negative GM) before reaching the destination port (see what happen
to Vasa (Swedish flag Ship ).

       In fact, most large containers ship today sails with a negative GM if they where
with uniform density. Hence, these ships require to have a significant weight to be
placed below insure that ship be stable. Image how much can be save dragging this
extra weight around.

                            Mrighting = WtotalGM new                     (4.167)

Where, Wtotal, is the total weight of the floating body including measuring weight.
The angle, , is measured as the difference in the orientation of the floating body. The
metacentric height is

                                             Td                          (4.168)

                                          Wtotal 

If the change in the GM can be neglected, equation (4.168) provides the solution. The
calculation of GM can be improved by taking into account the effect of the measuring
weight. The change in height of G is

                             g mtotal Gnew = g mship Gactual + g T h  (4.169)
Combining equation (4.169) with equation (4.168) results in

GMactual = GMnew mtotal - h T                                            (4.170)
                            mship                  mship

The weight of the ship is obtained from looking at the ship depth (displacement).

4.6.2.2 Stability of Submerged Bodies

The analysis of submerged bodied is different from the stability of surface vessels when
the body lays between two fluid layers with different density. When the body is sub-
merged in a single fluid layer, then none of the changes of buoyant centroid occurs.
Thus, the mass centroid must be below than buoyant centroid in order to have stable
condition.

       However, all fluids have density varied in some degree. In cases where the density
changes significantly, it must be taken into account. For an example of such a case is
an object floating in a solar pond where the upper layer is made of water with lower
salinity than the bottom layer(change up to 20% of the density). When the floating
object is immersed into two layers, the stability analysis must take into account the
changes of the displaced liquids of the two liquid layers. The calculations for such cases
are a bit more complicated but based on the similar principles. Generally, this density
change helps to increase the stability of the floating bodies. This analysis is out of the
scope of this book (for now).

4.6.2.3 Stability of None Systematical or "Strange" Bodies

While most floating bodies are symmetrical or semi-symmetrical, there are situations
where the body has a "strange" and/or un-symmetrical body. Consider the first strange
body that has an abrupt step change as shown in Figure 4.62. The body weight

                                                                   a

To have these requiring demand satisfied                            G

is question of geometry.

       If the situation is opposite, that is the narrow part is immersed in liquid and wide
part is out, the axis of the rotation moves the left. And in this case, the rotation moves
the regular buoyancy center further the left and by doing so make the ship or the body
less stable.

4.6.2.4 Neutral frequency of Floating Bodies

This case is similar to pendulum (or mass attached to spring). The governing equation
for the pendulum is

                              - g  = 0                                        (4.171)

Where here is length of the rode (or the line/wire) connecting the mass with the

rotation point.  Thus, the frequency of pendulum is       1  g which measured in Hz.
                                                         2

The period of the cycle is 2  /g. Similar situation exists in the case of floating

bodies. The basic differential equation is used to balance and is

       In general, the larger GM the more stable the floating body is. Increase in GM
increases the frequency of the floating body. If the floating body is used to transport
humans and/or other creatures or sensitive cargo it requires to reduce the GM so that
the traveling will be smoother.

     Example 4.39: GM statement Old                    Level: GATE 2010

     For the stability of a floating body, under the influence of gravity alone, which

     of the following is TRUE?

     (a) Metacentre should be below center of gravity

     (b) Metacentre should be above center of gravity

     (c) Metacentre and center of gravity must lie on the same horizontal line

     (d) Metacentre and center of gravity must lie on the same vertical line

     Solution

     As it was shown this chapter GM must be positive. That means to be G must be
     below M location. This is old technology and method and this book explain the new
     technology and thus the geometry immediately to calculated the stability.

4.6.3 Surface Tension

The surface tension is one of the mathematically complex topic and related to many
phenomena like boiling, coating, etc. In this section, only simplified topics like constant
value will be discussed.

       In one of the early studies of the surface tension/pressure was done by Torricelli19.
In this study he suggest construction of the early barometer. In barometer is made from
a tube sealed on one side. The tube is filled with a liquid and turned upside down into
the liquid container. The main effect is the pressure difference between the two surfaces
(in the tube and out side the tune). However, the surface tension affects the high. This
effect is large for very small diameters.

Example 4.40: Surface Tension Error  Level: Intermediate

In interaction of the molecules shown in Figure ? describe the existence of

surface tension. Explain why this description is erroneous?

Solution

The upper layer of the molecules have unbalanced force towards the liquid phase.
Newton's law states when there is unbalanced force, the body should be accelerate.
However, in this case, the liquid is not in motion. Thus, the common explanation is
wrong.

However, the surface tension between the needle and the liquid hold the needle

above the liquid. After certain diameter, the needle cannot be held by the liquid.

4.7 Rayleigh-Taylor Instability

Rayleigh-Taylor instability (or RT instability) is named after Lord Rayleigh and G. I.

Taylor. There are situations where a heavy liquid layer is placed over a lighter fluid

layer. This situation has engineering implications in several industries. For example in

die casting, liquid metal is injected in a cavity filled with air. In poor designs or other

situations, some air is not evacuated and stay in small cavity on the edges of the shape

to be casted. Thus, it can create a situation where the liquid metal is above the air but

cannot penetrate into the cavity because of instability.

     This instability deals with a dense, heavy fluid that is being placed above a lighter

fluid in a gravity field perpendicular to interface. Example for such systems are dense

water over oil (liquid-liquid), or water over air(gas-liquid). The original Rayleigh's

paper deals with the dynamics and density variations. For example, density variations

according to the bulk modulus (see section 4.3.3.2) are always stable but unstable of

the density is in the reversed order.

     Supposed that a liquid density is arbitrary function of the height. This distortion

can be as a result of heavy fluid above the lighter liquid. This analysis asks the question

of what happen when a small amount of liquid from the above layer enter into the

lower layer? Whether this liquid continue and will grow or will it return to its original

conditions? The surface tension is the opposite mechanism that will returns the liquid

to its original place. This analysis is referred to the case of infinite or very large surface.

The simplified case is the two different uniform densities. For example a heavy fluid

density, L, above lower fluid with lower density, G.

     For perfectly straight interface, the heavy fluid will stay above the lighter fluid. If

the surface will be disturbed, some of heavy liquid moves down. This disturbance can

grow or returned to its original situation. This condition is determined by competing

forces, the surface density, and the buoyancy forces. The fluid above the depression

is in equilibrium with the sounding pressure since the material is extending to infinity.

Thus, the force that acting to get the above fluid down is the buoyancy force of the

fluid in the depression.

     The depression is returned to its

original position if the surface forces are                 Lh
large enough. In that case, this situation
is considered to be stable. On the other                        x

hand, if the surface forces (surface ten-

sion) are not sufficient, the situation is Fig. 4.64 - Description of depression to explain

                                                the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

the liquid fluid zone and vice versa. As

usual there is the neutral stable when the forces are equal. Any continues function can

be expanded in series of cosines. Thus, example of a cosine function will be exam-

ined. The conditions that required from this function will be required from all the other

functions. The disturbance is of the following

                                              2x                                  (4.175)
                          h = -hmax cos L
4.7. RAYLEIGH-TAYLOR INSTABILITY                                                   169

where hmax is the maximum depression and L is the characteristic length of the de-
pression. The depression has different radius as a function of distance from the center
of the depression, x. The weakest point is at x = 0 because symmetrical reasons the
surface tension does not act against the gravity as shown in Figure (4.64). Thus, if the
center point of the depression can "hold" the intrusive fluid then the whole system is
stable.

       The radius of any equation is expressed by equation (1.55). The first derivative
of cos around zero is sin which is approaching zero or equal to zero. Thus, equation
(1.55) can be approximated as

                                       1 d2h                              (4.176)
                                       R = dx2

For equation (4.175) the radius is

                                    1  =-  4 2 hmax                       (4.177)

                                    R      L2

According to equation (1.48) the pressure difference or the pressure jump is due to the
surface tension at this point must be

PH - PL =                                  4 hmax  2                      (4.178)

                                                L  2

The pressure difference due to the gravity at the edge of the disturbance is then

PH - PL = g (H - L) hmax                                                  (4.179)

Comparing equations (4.178) and (4.179) show that if the relationship is

4  2                                                                      (4.180)
  L2 > g (H - L)

It should be noted that hmax is irrelevant for this analysis as it is canceled. The point
where the situation is neutral stable

Lc =                                       4 2                            (4.181)
                                       g (H - L)

       An alternative approach to analyze this instability is suggested here. Consider the
situation described in Figure 4.65. If all the heavy liquid "attempts" to move straight
down, the lighter liquid will "prevent" it. The lighter liquid needs to move up at the
same time but in a different place. The heavier liquid needs to move in one side and the
lighter liquid in another location. In this process the heavier liquid "enter" the lighter
liquid in one point and creates a depression as shown in Figure 4.65.
170                                                         CHAPTER 4. FLUIDS STATICS

       To analyze it, considered two con-

trol volumes bounded by the blue lines in                              2r

Figure 4.65. The first control volume is                               
made of a cylinder with a radius r and
the second is the depression below it. The                                

"extra" lines of the depression should be

ignored, they are not part of the control

volume. The horizontal forces around the

control volume are canceling each other.

At the top, the force is atmospheric pres-  Fig. 4.65 - Description of depression to explain

tom, the force is  g h  A. This acts

against the gravity force which make the

cylinder to be in equilibrium with its surroundings if the pressure at bottom is indeed

 g h.

       For the depression, the force at the top is the same force at the bottom of the

cylinder. At the bottom, the force is the integral around the depression. It can be

approximated as a flat cylinder that has depth of r /4 (read the explanation in the

example 4.22) This value is exact if the shape is a perfect half sphere. In reality, the error

is not significant. Additionally when the depression occurs, the liquid level is reduced a

bit and the lighter liquid is filling the missing portion. Thus, the force at the bottom is

       Fbottom   r2    r                                                    (4.182)
                        4 + h (L - G) g + Patmos

The net force is then

                       Fbottom   r2  r (L - G) g                            (4.183)
                                             4

The force that hold this column is the surface tension. As shown in Figure 4.65, the
total force is then

                       F = 2  r  cos                                        (4.184)

The forces balance on the depression is then                (L - G) g       (4.185)

Fig. 4.66 - The cross section of the interface. The purple color represents the maximum
     heavy liquid raising area. The yellow color represents the maximum lighter liquid that
     "goes down."

       The maximum possible radius of the depression depends on the geometry of the
container. For the cylindrical geometry, the maximum depression radius is about half
for the container radius (see Figure 4.66). This radius is limited because the lighter
liquid has to enter at the same time into the heavier liquid zone. Since the "exchange"
volumes of these two process are the same, the specific radius is limited. Thus, it can
be written that the minimum radius is

rmintube = 2                          2      (4.188)
                                  g (L - G)

       The actual radius will be much larger. The heavier liquid can stay on top of the
lighter liquid without being turned upside down when the radius is smaller than the
Eq. (4.188). This analysis introduces a new dimensional number that will be discussed
in a greater length in the Dimensionless chapter. In equation (4.188) the angle was
assumed to be 90 degrees. However, this angle is never can be obtained. The actual
value of this angle is about /4 to /3 and in only extreme cases the angle exceed
this value (considering dynamics). In Figure 4.66, it was shown that the depression and
the raised area are the same. The actual area of the depression is only a fraction of
the interfacial cross section and is a function. For example,the depression is larger for
square area. These two scenarios should be inserting into equation 4.168 by introducing
experimental coefficient.

5 The Control Volume and Mass Conservation

5.1 Introduction

This chapter presents a discussion on the control volume and will be focused on the

conservation of the mass. When the fluid system moves or changes, one wants to find

or predict the velocities in the system. The main target of such analysis is to find the

value of certain variables. This kind of analysis is reasonable and it referred to in the

literature as the Lagrangian Analysis. This name is in honored Joseph-Louis Lagrange

(1736-1813) who formulated the equations of motion for the moving fluid particles

(Pulte 2005).

Even though this system

looks reasonable, the Lagrangian

system turned out to be difficult to       system i
solve and to analyze. This method
applied and used in very few cases.

The main difficulty lies in the fact                    ii
that every particle has to be traced                iii
to its original state Leonard. Euler
(1707-1783) suggested an alterna-          control
                                           volume

tive approach. In Euler's approach

the focus is on a defined point or    Fig. 5.1 - Control volume and system before and
a defined volume. This methods is          after motion.
referred as Eulerian method.

                                      177
178  CHAPTER 5. MASS CONSERVATION

       The Eulerian method focuses on a defined area or location to find the needed
information. The use of the Eulerian methods leads to a set differentiation equations
that is referred to as Navier-Stokes equations which are commonly used. These differ-
ential equations will be used in the later part of this book. Additionally, the Eulerian
system leads to integral equations which are the focus of this part of the book. The
Eulerian method plays well with the physical intuition of most people. This methods has
its limitations and for some cases the Lagrangian is preferred (and sometimes the only
possibility). Therefore a limited discussion on the Lagrangian system will be presented
(later version).

       Lagrangian equations are associated with the system while the Eulerian equation
are associated with the control volume. The difference between the system and the
control volume is shown in Figure 5.1. The green lines in Figure 5.1 represent the
system. The red dotted lines are the control volume. At certain time the system and
the control volume are identical location. After a certain time, some of the mass in the
system exited the control volume which are marked "a" in Figure 5.1. The material
that remained in the control volume is marked as "b". At the same time, the control
gains some material which is marked as "c".

5.2 Control Volume

The Eulerian method requires to define a control volume (some time more than one).
The control volume is a defined volume that was discussed earlier. The control volume
is differentiated into two categories of control volumes, non-deformable and deformable.

     Non-deformable control volume is a control volume which is fixed in
     space relatively to an one coordinate system. This coordinate system may
     be in a relative motion to another (almost absolute) coordinate system.

     Deformable control volume is a volume having part of all of its bound-
     aries in motion during the process at hand.

       In the case where no mass crosses the bound-               out
aries, the control volume is a system. Every control                    in
volume is the focus of the certain interest and will
be dealt with the basic equations, mass, momentum,     Fig. 5.2 - Control volume of a
energy, entropy etc.                                        moving piston with in and
                                                            out flow.
       Two examples of control volume are presented
to illustrate difference between a deformable control
volume and non-deformable control volume. Flow
in conduits can be analyzed by looking in a con-
trol volume between two locations. The coordinate
system could be fixed to the conduit. The control
volume chosen is non-deformable control volume.
5.3. CONTINUITY EQUATION                                                           179

The control volume should be chosen so that the analysis should be simple and dealt
with as less as possible issues which are not in question. When a piston pushing gases
a good choice of control volume is a deformable control volume that is a head the
piston inside the cylinder as shown in Fig. 5.2.

5.3 Continuity Equation

In this chapter and the next three chapters, the conservation equations will be applied
to the control volume. In this chapter, the mass conservation will be discussed. The
system mass change is

D msys = D                                        dV = 0                           (5.1)
              Dt              Dt Vsys

The system mass after some time, according Fig. 5.1, is made of

msys = mc.v. + ma - mc                                                             (5.2)

The change of the system mass is by definition is zero. The change with time (time
derivative of equation (5.2)) results in

0 = D msys = d mc.v. + d ma - d mc                                                 (5.3)
Dt                            dt                  dt      dt

The first term in equation (5.3) is the derivative of the mass in the control volume and
at any given time is

d mc.v.(t) = d  dV                                                                 (5.4)
                          dt  dt Vc.v.
                                                                                   -Ub
and is a function of the time.                                 Ub n^ Uf
       The interface of the control volume can

move. The actual velocity of the fluid leaving
the control volume is the relative velocity (see                          Uf - Ub

- - -                         (5.5)

Where n^ is an unit vector perpendicular to the surface. The convention of direction
is taken positive if flow out the control volume and negative if the flow is into the

control volume. The mass flow out of the control volume is the system mass that is
not included in the control volume. Thus, the flow out is

         d ma =                                s UrndA        (5.7)
         dt
                 Scv

It has to be emphasized that the density is taken at the surface thus the subscript s. In
the same manner, the flow rate in is

         d mb =       s UrndA                                 (5.8)
          dt
                 Sc.v.

It can be noticed that the two equations (5.8) and (5.7) are similar and can be combined,
taking the positive or negative value of Urn with integration of the entire system as

     d ma - d mb =                                  s Urn dA  (5.9)
     dt      dt
                                               Scv

applying negative value to keep the convention. Substituting equation (5.9) into equa-
tion (5.3) results in

                  Continuity                                  (5.10)

trate this concept.

     The density changes in a pipe, due to temperature variation and other reasons,
     can be approximated as

    expression for the mass change in the pipe.                             End of Ex. 5.1

Solution

Here it is very convenient to choose a non-deformable control volume that is inside
the conduit dV is chosen as  R2 dx. Using equation (5.10), the flow out (or in) is

                                                 (t)
                                                                                dV

                  d        dV =  d        0 1 -  x2  cos  t                 2               (5.1.b)
                                                                R dx
             dt c.v.             dt c.v.         L        t0

The density is not a function of radius, r and angle,  and they can be taken out the

integral as

                  d        dV =  R  2d       0 1 -   x2   cos           t           dx      (5.1.c)

                  dt c.v.           dt c.v.          L                  t0

which results in

                     A  2d L

Flow Out =  R                        x2 t                  R2 L 0           sin         t   (5.1.d)

The flow out is a function of length, L, and time, t, and is the change of the mass in
the control volume.

                                             "armpit     Control V olume

As usual the control volume has to be                                  rU
drawn for water between the pectoral fin
and the body (see Fig. 5.6). The for sim-                              x
plicity assume that fin is straight and two
dimensional. The mass conservation of the                   R
control volume shown in Fig. 5.6 reads
                                             Fig. 5.6 - Pectoral fin control vol-
  d                                               ume for the analysis of the veloc-
            sdV = -  Urn dA (5.2.a)               ity. The red dashed line repre-
                                                  sents the small mass control vol-
  dt c.v. Scv                                     ume.

This control volume has only one exit, the volume varies with time, and the change
is due to the pectoral fin movement. There are two main ways to calculate the left
term of Eq. (5.2.a) are using the physical intuition or formal derivations. First the
physical intuition is presented, it can be noticed that the velocity computed as it
simple rotation movement, hence, U =  r and total can be calculated integral of
the total from zero to R as

                     dV = -     R  R2                                       (5.2.b)
                     dt          r dr = -
                                             2
                             0

It can be noticed that if the control volume is limited to r as well and the change of

the "red" control volume is the same then

                     dv = -     r  r2
                     dt           d = -                                     (5.2.c)
                                             2
                             0

in this case the dummy variable  is replacement of r for the integration. The formal
way is to right down the volume as function of time

                        R t  R2                                             (5.2.d)
                V = V0  - t   r dr = V0  -
                                                      2
                     0

Eq. (5.2.d) is basically identical to equation Eq. (5.2.b) with some math.

    The velocity at the exit is not uniform and has a small component in y direction.

For simplicity, it is assumed that the velocity is uniform. Hence, Eq. (5.2.a) is reduced

to               R2

             -       = -U R  (1 -  t) -- U =             R                  (5.2.e)

                2                               2(1 -  t)

where t, time, is measured from the fin at 1 to t . The t is the time that it takes the

fin to reach the body from 1. The height h is canceled out in the analysis. According

to Eq. (5.2.e), the jet velocity increases as the fin approaches to body. Normally when

the velocity approaches to infinity, something breaks in the model either  decreases

or something else happening. Additional point, the velocity as a function of r or x

can be obtained from a similar concept as the smaller control volume.

                     U (r) = r                                              (5.11)

                                                                             End of Ex. 5.2
and for small angles, the velocity can be considered as U (x). The velocity close to

"armpit" is zero and increases linearly with distance from it. These facts of zero

and linearly of the velocity is close to realty. Yet when building model one should

remember the assumptions that allow the model to exist. In this case, as far one from

the "armpit" the two dimension is losing its validity and velocity is decrease (not linear

but closer to constant).

5.3.1 Non Deformable Control Volume

When the control volume is fixed with time, the derivative in equation (5.10) can enter
the integral since the boundaries are fixed in time and hence,

                            Continuity with Fixed b.c.          (5.12)

Equation (5.12) is simpler than equation (5.10).

5.3.2 Constant Density Fluids

Further simplifications of equations (5.10) can be obtained by assuming constant density
and the equation (5.10) become conservation of the volume.

5.3.2.1 Non Deformable Control Volume

For this case the volume is constant therefore the mass is constant, and hence the mass
change of the control volume is zero. Hence, the net flow (in and out) is zero. This
condition can be written mathematically as

                                =0                              (5.13)

                               dt Sc.v. - VrndA = 0

or in a more explicit form as

                               Steady State Continuity

                                    Vrn dA =        Vrn dA = 0  (5.14)

                               Sin            Sout

Notice that the density does not play a role in this equation since it is canceled out.
Physically, the meaning is that volume flow rate in and the volume flow rate out have
to equal.

The meaning of the equation (5.16) is the net growth (or decrease) of the Control
volume is by net volume flow into it. Example 5.3 illustrates this point.

     Example 5.3: Bucket Velocity                     Level: Simple

     Liquid fills a bucket as shown in Figure 5.7. The average velocity of the liquid
     at the exit of the filling pipe is Up and cross section of the pipe is Ap. The
     liquid fills a bucket with cross section area of A and instantaneous height is h.
     Find the height as a function of the other parameters. Assume that the density
     is constant and at the boundary interface Aj = 0.7 Ap. And where Aj is the
     area of jet when touching the liquid boundary in bucket. The last assumption
     is result of the energy equation (with some influence of momentum equation).
     The relationship is function of the distance of the pipe from the boundary of the
5.3. CONTINUITY EQUATION                                                                     185

                                                                           continue Ex. 5.3
liquid. However, this effect can be neglected for this range which this problem.

In reality, the ratio is determined by height of the pipe from the liquid surface

in the bucket. Calculate the bucket liquid interface velocity.

Solution

This problem requires two deformable control volumes. The first control is around the
jet and second is around the liquid in the bucket. In this analysis, several assumptions
must be made. First, no liquid leaves the jet and enters the air. Second, the liquid in
the bucket has a straight surface. This assumption is a strong assumption for certain
conditions but it will be not discussed here since it is advance topic. Third, there are
no evaporation or condensation processes. Fourth, the air effects are negligible. The
control volume around the jet is deformable because the length of the jet shrinks with
the time. The mass conservation of the liquid in the bucket is

           boundary change                   flow in

                   Ubn dA                 =            Urn dA

               c.v.                          c.v.

where Ubn is the perpendicular component of velocity of the boundary. Substituting
the known values for Urn results in

               Ub dA =                           Urn

           c.v.                         (Uj + Ub) dA

                                    c.v.

The integration can be carried when the area of jet is assumed to be known as

                          Ub A = Aj (Uj + Ub)                                  (5..a)

To find the jet velocity, Uj, the second control volume around the jet is used as the

following

           flow                     flow        boundary

           in                       out         change                         (5..b)

           Up Ap - Aj (Ub + Uj ) = -Aj Ub

The above two equations (5..a) and (5..b) are enough to solve for the two unknowns.

Substituting the first equation, (5..a) into (5..b) and using the ratio of Aj = 0.7 Ap

results

           Up Ap - Ub A = -0.7 Ap Ub                                           (5..c)

The solution of equation (5..c) is

                                    Ub = Ap
                                           A - 0.7 Ap

It is interesting that many individuals intuitively will suggest that the solution is
UbAp/A. When examining solution there are two limits. The first limit is when
Ap = A/0.7 which is

                                    Ub = Ap = 
                                             0

     The physical meaning is that surface is filled instantly. The other limit is that and

     Ap/A - 0 then

                                                      Ub = Ap
                                                              A

     which is the result for the "intuitive" solution. It also interesting to point out that if
     the filling was from other surface (not the top surface), e.g the side, the velocity will
     be Ub = Up in the limiting case and not infinity. The reason for this difference is that
     the liquid already fill the bucket and has not to move into bucket.

     Example 5.4: Moving Bucket                                 Level: Advanced

     The bucket is filled by single stream of liquid. The velocity of the stream down

     at 3[m/sec]. The bucket is moving up at velocity of 2[m/sec] calculate the flow

     rate into bucket. If the bucket radius is -0.1[m] what is the velocity of liquid

     surface relative to bucket bottom?

     Solution

     Confidential to be given for exams.

     Example 5.5: Balloon In Flow                               Level: Simple

     Balloon is attached to a rigid supply in which is supplied by a constant the mass
     rate, mi. Calculate the velocity of the balloon boundaries assuming constant
     density.

     Solution

     The applicable equation is

                                       Ubn dA =        Urn dA   (5.5.a)
                                                                (5.5.b)
                                 c.v.            c.v.

     The entrance is fixed, thus the relative velocity, Urn is

                                                 @ the valve
                             -Up                  every else
                    Urn =  0

     Assume equal distribution of the velocity in balloon surface and that the center of the
     balloon is moving, thus the velocity has the following form

                                       Ub = Ux x^ + Ubr r^      (5.5.c)

     Where x^ is unit coordinate in x direction and Ux is the velocity of the center and
     where r^ is unit coordinate in radius from the center of the balloon and Ubr is the
     velocity in that direction. The right side of equation (5.16) is the net change due to

The first integral is zero because it is like movement of solid body and also yield this
value mathematically (excises for mathematical oriented student). The second integral
(notice n^ = r^) yields

                                          (Ubr r^)  n^ dA = 4  r2 Ubr                    (5.5.e)

                                                     Sc.v.

Substituting into the general equation yields

                A                                                                         (5.5.f )

         4  r2 Ubr =  Up Ap = mi

Hence,                                         mi

                                    Ubr =             2                                   (5.5.g)

The center velocity is (also) exactly Ubr. The total velocity of boundary is

                          Ut =             mi  2 (x^ + r^)

                                    4r

It can be noticed that the velocity at the opposite to the connection to the rigid pipe
which is double of the center velocity.

5.3.2.3 One-Dimensional Control Volume

Additional simplification of the continuity equation is of one dimensional flow. This
simplification provides very useful description for many fluid flow phenomena. The
main assumption made in this model is that the proprieties in the across section are
only function of x coordinate . This assumptions leads

           2 U2 dA -                         d                                 dV         (5.17)
                          A1 1 U1 dA = dt
        A2                                                    (x) A(x) dx

                                                         V (x)

When the density can be considered constant equation (5.17) is reduced to

                                         d                    A(x)dx                      (5.18)
        A2 A1 U2 dA - U1 dA = dt

For steady state but with variations of the velocity and variation of the density reduces
equation (5.17) to become

                      2 U2 dA = 1 U1 dA                                                   (5.19)

For steady state and uniform density and velocity equation (5.19) reduces further to

                         1 A1 U1 = 2 A2 U2                                          (5.20)

For incompressible flow (constant density), continuity equation is at its minimum form
of

                              U1 A1 = A2 U2                                         (5.21)

     out is function of the height. First assume that qout = b h second Assume as
     qout = b h. For the first case, determine the height, h as function of the time.
     Is there a critical value and then if exist find the critical value of the system

     parameters. Assume that the height at time zero is h0. What happen if the
     h0 = 0?

     Solution

     The control volume for both cases is the same and it is around the liquid in the tank.

     It can be noticed that control volume satisfy the demand of one dimensional since

     the flow is only function of x coordinate. For case one the right hand side term in

     equation (5.17) is

                           d L dh                                                   (5.6.a)
                                 h dx =  L
                           dt 0                        dt

     Substituting into equation equation (5.17) is

                                      flow out flow in                              (5.6.b)
                          L d h = b1 h - mi                                         (5.6.c)

                              dt

     solution is

                                                                             End of Ex. 5.6
The solution has the homogeneous solution (solution without the mi) and the solution
of the mi part. The solution can rearranged to a new form (a discussion why this
form is preferred will be provided in dimensional chapter).

                              e e h b1 = -  L + c  L b1 t b1 t              (5.6.d)

                              m1

With the initial condition that at h(t = 0) = h0 the constant coefficient can be found

as                       h0 b1 = 1 - c = c = 1 - h0 b1

                           m1                                   mi          (5.6.e)

which the solution is

                       e h b1 =  -  L b1 t +  1 - h0 b1         e b1 t      (5.6.f )
                                                     mi              L
                       m1

It can be observed that if 1 = hm0 b1 i is the critical point of this solution. If the term
hm0 b1 i is larger than one then the solution reduced to a negative number. However,
negative number for height is not possible and the height solution approach zero. If

the reverse case appeared, the height will increase. Essentially, the critical ratio state

if the flow in is larger or lower than the flow out determine the condition of the height.

For second case, the governing equation (5.17) is

                                   d h  flow out flow in                    (5.6.g)
                               L d t = b h - mi                             (5.6.h)

with the general solution of

                                                                        
    ln h b - 1 mi + h b - 1 = (t + c) h b
                       mi        L            mi                        2L

The constant is obtained when the initial condition that at h(t = 0) = h0 and it left
as exercise for the reader.

5.4 Reynolds Transport Theorem

It can be noticed that the same derivations carried for the density can be carried for
other intensive properties such as specific entropy, specific enthalpy. Suppose that g is
intensive property (which can be a scalar or a vector) undergoes change with time. The
change of accumulative property will be then

    D                            d                                          (5.22)
    Dt sys f dV = dt c.v. c.v f dV + f  UrndA

 This theorem named after Reynolds, Osborne, (1842-1912) which is actually a three
dimensional generalization of Leibniz integral rule1. To make the previous derivation

clearer, the Reynolds Transport Theorem will be reproofed and discussed. The ideas

are the similar but extended some what.
       Leibniz integral rule2is an one dimensional and it is defined as

     d x2(y)  x2(y) f                            dx2      dx1         (5.23)
     dy x1(y) x1(y) f (x, y) dx = y dx + f (x2, y) dy - f (x1, y) dy

Initially, a proof will be provided and the physical meaning will be explained. Assume
that there is a function that satisfy the following

                                     x                                (5.24)

              G(x, y) = f (, y) d

Notice that lower boundary of the integral is missing and is only the upper limit of the
function is present3. For its derivative of equation (5.24) is

                              G                                       (5.25)
                 f (x, y) =

                              x

differentiating (chain rule d uv = u dv + v du) by part of left hand side of the Leibniz
integral rule (it can be shown which are identical) is

              1                           2      3        4

     d [G(x2, y) - G(x1, y)] = G dx2 + G (x2, y) - G dx1 - G (x1, y)  (5.26)
     dy       x2 dy y                            x1 dy y

The terms 2 and 4 in Eq. (5.26) are actually (the x2 is treated as a different variable)

                 x2(y)  f (x, y)             dx                       (5.27)

              x1 (y )                     y

The first term (1) in equation (5.26) is

              G dx2 = f (x2, y) dx2                                   (5.28)
              x2 dy                          dy

The same can be said for the third term (3). Thus this explanation is a proof the Leibniz
rule.

       The above "proof" is mathematical in nature and physical explanation is also
provided. Suppose that a fluid is flowing in a conduit. The intensive property, f is in-
vestigated or the accumulative property, F . The interesting information that commonly

    2This material is not necessary but is added here for completeness. This author find material just
given so no questions will be asked.

    3There was a suggestion to insert arbitrary constant which will be canceled and will a provide
rigorous proof. This is engineering book and thus, the exact mathematical proof is not the concern
here. Nevertheless, if there will be a demand for such, it will be provided.
5.5. EXAMPLES FOR MASS CONSERVATION                                               191

needed is the change of the accumulative property, F , with time. The change with time
is

   DF D                                                 (5.29)
      =        f dV
   Dt Dt sys

For one dimensional situation the change with time is

   DF D                                                 (5.30)
   =           f A(x)dx
   Dt Dt sys

If two limiting points (for the one dimensional) are moving with a different coordinate
system, the mass will be different and it will not be a system. This limiting condition
is the control volume for which some of the mass will leave or enter. Since the change
is very short (differential), the flow in (or out) will be the velocity of fluid minus the
boundary at x1, Urn = U1 - Ub. The same can be said for the other side. The
accumulative flow of the property in, F , is then

                 F1 dt dx1                              (5.31)

   Fin = f1  Urn

The accumulative flow of the property out, F , is then

                  F2 dt dx2                             (5.32)

   Fout = f2  Urn

The change with time of the accumulative property, F , between the boundaries is

   d                                                    (5.33)
            (x) f A(x) dA

   dt c.v.

When put together it brings back the Leibniz integral rule. Since the time variable, t,
is arbitrary and it can be replaced by any letter. The above discussion is one of the
physical meaning the Leibniz rule.

       Reynolds Transport theorem is a generalization of the Leibniz rule and thus the
same arguments are used. The only difference is that the velocity has three components
and only the perpendicular component enters into the calculations.

5.5 Examples For Mass Conservation

Several examples are provided to illustrate the topic.

     Example 5.7: Mixing Streams Pipe                                     Level: Simple

     Liquid enters a circular pipe with a linear velocity profile as a function of the
     radius with maximum velocity of Umax. After magical mixing, the velocity be-
     came uniform. Write the equation which describes the velocity at the entrance.
     What is the magical averaged velocity at the exit? Assume no-slip condition.

     Solution

     The velocity profile is linear with radius. Additionally, later a discussion on relationship
     between velocity at interface to solid also referred as the (no) slip condition will be
     provided. This assumption is good for most cases with very few exceptions. It will be
     assumed that the velocity at the interface is zero. Thus, the boundary condition is
     U (r = R) = 0 and U (r = 0) = Umax Therefore the velocity profile is

                 U (r) = Umax 1 - r
                                           R

     Where R is radius and r is the working radius (for the integration). The magical
     averaged velocity is obtained using the equation (5.14). For which

           R       1- r                          2  r dr = Uave  R2            (5.7.a)

             Umax

         0

     The integration of the equation (5.7.a) is

                          R 2 2                                                (5.7.b)
                 Umax                            = Uave  R
                          6

     The solution of equation (b) results in average velocity as

                       Uave = Umax                                             (5.7.c)

Example 5.8: Boundary Layer                                          Level: Simple

Experiments have shown that a layer of liquid that attached itself to the surface
and it is referred to as boundary layer. The assumption is that fluid attaches
itself to surface. The slowed liquid is slowing the layer above it. The boundary
layer is growing with x because the boundary effect is penetrating further into
fluid. A common boundary layer analysis uses the Reynolds transform theorem.
In this case, calculate the relationship of the mass transfer across the control
volume. For simplicity assume slowed fluid has a linear velocity profile. Then
assume parabolic velocity profile as

                                               y 1 y2                (5.8.a)
                            Ux(y) = 2 U0  + 2 

and calculate the mass transfer across the control volume. Compare the two
different velocity profiles affecting on the mass transfer.

Solution

Assuming the velocity profile is linear thus, (to satisfy the boundary condition) it will

be                                 Ux(y) = U0 y

                                                                     (5.8.b)

The chosen control volume is rectangular of L  . Where  is the height of the

boundary layer at exit point of the flow as shown in Figure 5.9. The control volume

has three surfaces that mass can cross, the left, right, and upper. No mass can

cross the lower surface (solid boundary). The situation is steady state and thus using

equation (5.14) results in

                                x direction

                            in            out           y direction

                            0                           0

It can be noticed that the convention used in this chapter of "in" as negative is not
"followed." The integral simply multiply by negative one. The above integrals on the
right hand side can be combined as

                                   1- y                      L       (5.8.d)

Example 5.9: Jet Engine                                                    Level: Simple

Air flows into a jet engine at 5 kg/sec while fuel flow into the jet is at 0.1 kg/sec.
The burned gases leaves at the exhaust which has cross area 0.1 m2 with velocity

of 500 m/sec. What is the density of the gases at the exhaust?

Solution

The mass conservation equation (5.14) is used. Thus, the flow out is ( 5 + 0.1 )
5.1 kg/sec The density is

                       = m A U = 0.01 m2 5.1 kg/sec 500 m/sec = 1.02kg/m3  (5.9.a)

The mass (volume) flow rate is given by direct quantity like x kg/sec. However some-
time, the mass (or the volume) is given by indirect quantity such as the effect of flow.
The next example deal with such reversed mass flow rate.

by 6 hours. The tank also has three emptying valves of 5 hours, 7 hours, and
8 hours. The tank is 3/4 fulls, calculate the time for tank reach empty or full
state when all the valves are open. Is there a combination of valves that make
the tank at steady state?

Solution

Easier measurement of valve flow rate can be expressed as fraction of the tank per

mass flow rate in is

The mass flow rate out is

                                 m out = 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/8 = 131             (5.10.b)

Example 5.11: Cylinder Balloon                                         Level: Intermediate

Inflated cylinder is supplied in its center with constant mass flow. Assume that

the gas mass is supplied in uniformed way of mi [kg/m/sec]. Assume that the
cylinder inflated uniformly and pressure inside the cylinder is uniform. The gas

inside the cylinder obeys the ideal gas law. The pressure inside the cylinder is

linearly proportional to the volume. For simplicity, assume that the process is

isothermal. Calculate the cylinder boundaries velocity.

Solution

The applicable equation is

            increase pressure boundary velocity in or out flow rate

                 d dV +                  UbdV =                Urn dA  (5.11.a)

to pressure relationship have to be provided.

                                        RT

and relationship between the volume and pressure is

                                  P = f  Rc2                           (5.11.c)

Where Rc is the instantaneous cylinder radius. Combining the above two equations

results in                         = f  Rc2

Where f is a coefficient with the right dimension. It also can be noticed that boundary

velocity is related to the radius in the following form

                                  Ub = dRc                             (5.11.e)
                                           dt

The first term requires to find the derivative of density with respect to time which is

                        d = d     f  Rc2                           Ub  (5.11.f )

     the derivative of the second part is dUb/dRc = 0.

     Example 5.12: Balloon Supply                                       Level: Simple

     A balloon is attached to a rigid supply and is supplied by a constant mass rate,
     mi. Assume that gas obeys the ideal gas law. Assume that balloon volume is a
     linear function of the pressure inside the balloon such as P = fv V . Where fv
     is a coefficient describing the balloon physical characters. Calculate the velocity
     of the balloon boundaries under the assumption of isothermal process.

     Solution

     The question is more complicated than Example 5.12. The ideal gas law is

                                                      = P
                                                            RT

     The relationship between the pressure and volume is

                                                              4 fv  Rb3

     The combining of the ideal gas law with the relationship between the pressure and
     volume results

                                                   = 4 fv  Rb3
                                                           3RT

5.6 The Details Picture - Velocity Area Relationship

The integral approach is intended to deal       A
with the "big" picture. Indeed the method
is used in this part of the book for this pur-  h z y Ae
pose. However, there is very little written                    x
about the usability of this approach to pro-                      Ue
vide way to calculate the average quantities
in the control system. Sometimes it is desir-   Fig. 5.10 - Control volume usage to cal-

is no general way to provide these quanti-
ties. Therefore an example will be provided
to demonstrate the use of this approach.

       Consider a container filled with liquid on which one exit opened and the liquid
flows out as shown in Fig. 5.10. The velocity has three components in each of the
coordinates under the assumption that flow is uniform and the surface is straight4. The
integral approached is used to calculate the averaged velocity of each to the components.
To relate the velocity in the z direction with the flow rate out or the exit the velocity
mass balance is constructed. A similar control volume construction to find the velocity
of the boundary velocity (height) can be carried out. The control volume is bounded by
the container wall including the exit of the flow. The upper boundary is surface parallel
to upper surface but at Z distance from the bottom. The mass balance reads

       d                                                                        (5.35)
     V dt A A dV + Ubn  dA + Urn  dA = 0

For constant density (conservation of volume) equation5 and (h > z) reduces to

       Urn  dA = 0                                                              (5.36)

     A

In the container case for uniform velocity Eq. (5.36) becomes

     Uz A = Ue Ae = Uz = - Ae Ue                                                (5.37)
                                        A

It can be noticed that the boundary is not moving and the mass inside does not change
this control volume. The velocity Uz is the averaged velocity downward.

    4The liquid surface is not straight for this kind of problem. However, under certain conditions it is

reasonable to assume straight surface which have been done for this problem.

Usage of control volume not included in the previous analysis provides the velocity at

                                              Ayz

Where Ax- is the area shown the Figure under this label. The area Ayz referred to
area into the page in Figure 5.11 under the blow line. Because averaged velocities and
constant density are used transformed equation (5.39) into

                                              Ayz                               (5.40)

             Ae Ax-Ue + Ux Y (x) h = 0
             A

Where Y (x) is the length of the (blue) line of the boundary. It can be notice that the
velocity, Ux is generally increasing with x because Ax- increase with x.

       The calculations for the y directions are similar to the one done for x direction.
The only difference is that the velocity has two different directions. One zone is right
to the exit with flow to the left and one zone to left with averaged velocity to right.
If the volumes on the left and the right are symmetrical the averaged velocity will be
zero.

Solution

The flow out in the x direction is zero because symmetrical reasons. That is the flow
field is a mirror images. Thus, every point has different velocity with the same value
in the opposite direction.
The flow in half of the cylinder either the right or the left has non zero averaged
velocity. The calculations are similar to those in the previous to example 5.14. The
main concept that must be recognized is the half of the flow must have come from
one side and the other come from the other side. Thus, equation (5.40) modified to
be

exams is the following.
202                                              CHAPTER 5. MASS CONSERVATION

     Example 5.16: Boat Jet                                        Level: Simple

     A boat travels at speed of 10m/sec up-                        Us = 5[m/sec]
     stream in a river that flows at a speed of

     5m/s. The inboard engine uses a pump             U0 = 50[m/sec] Ub = 10[m/sec]

     to suck in water at the front Ain =
     0.2 m2 and eject it through the back

     of the boat with exist area of Aout =            Fig. 5.14 - Schematic of the boat for
     0.05 m2. The water absolute (relative                 example 5.16.

     to the ground) velocity leaving the back

     is 50[m/sec], what are the relative velocities entering and leaving the boat and

     the pumping rate?

     Solution

     The boat is assumed (implicitly is stated) to be steady state and the density is constant.
     However, the calculations have to be made in the frame of reference moving with the
     boat. The relative jet discharge velocity is

                        Urout = 50 + 10 = 60[m/sec]                                  (5.16.a)

     The volume flow rate is then

                        Qout = Aout Urout = 60  0.05 = 3[m3/sec]                    (5.16.b)

     The flow rate at entrance is the same as the exit thus,

                        Urin = Aout Urout = 0.05 60 = 15.0[m/sec]                    (5.16.c)
                        Ain                      0.2

     In this case (the way the question is phrased), the velocity of the river has no relevance.

     Example 5.17: Boat Absolute Velocity                          Level: Simple

     The boat from Example 5.16 travels downstream with the same relative exit
     jet speed (60m/s). Calculate the boat absolute velocity (to the ground) in
     this case, assume that the areas to the pump did not change. Is the relative
     velocity of the boat (to river) the same as before? If not, calculate the boat
     relative velocity to the river. Assume that the river velocity is the same as in
     the previous example.

     Solution

     The relative exit velocity of the jet is 15[m/sec] hence the flow rate is

                        Qout = Aout Urout = 60  0.05 = 3[m3/sec]                    (5.17.a)
5.7. MORE EXAMPLES FOR MASS CONSERVATION                                                     203

                                                                            End of Ex. 5.17
The relative (to the boat) velocity into boat is same as before (15m/sec). The

absolute velocity of boat (relative to the ground) is

                             Uboat = 15 + 5 = 20[m/sec]                    (5.17.b)

The relative velocity of boat to the river is

              Urelative to river = 20 - 5 = 15[m/sec]                      (5.17.c)

The relative exit jet velocity to the ground

                             Uin = 60 - 15 = 45[m/sec]                     (5.17.d)

The boat relative velocities are different and depends on the directions.

Example 5.18: Mixing Chamber Streams                         Level: simple

Liquid A enters a mixing device depicted in at 0.1 [kg/s]. In same time liquid
B enter the mixing device with a different specific density at 0.05 [kg/s]. The
density of liquid A is 1000[kg/m3] and liquid B is 800[kg/m3]. The results of
the mixing is a homogeneous mixture. Assume incompressible process. Find the
average leaving velocity and density of the mixture leaving through the 2O [cm]
diameter pipe. If the mixing device volume is decreasing (as a piston pushing
into the chamber) at rate of .002 [m3/s], what is the exit velocity? State your
assumptions.

Solution

In the first scenario, the flow is steady state and equation (5.12) is applicable

          m A + m B = Qmix mix == 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15[m]                     (5.18.a)

Thus in this case, since the flow is incompressible flow, the total volume flow in is
equal to volume flow out as

                                 m A m A 0.10 0.05
          QA + QB = Qmix ==                    +       =  +
                                 A A 1000 800

Thus the mixture density is

            mix = m A + m B = 923.07[kg/m3]                                (5.18.b)
                       m A + m B
                       A B

The averaged velocity is then

                                   m A + m B                               (5.18.c)
            Umix = Qmix A = out  0.012 A B = 1.625  [m/s]

In the case that a piston is pushing the exit density could be changed and fluctuated
depending on the location of the piston. However, if the assumption of well mixed is
204                                                CHAPTER 5. MASS CONSERVATION

                                                                                 End of Ex. 5.18
     still holding the exit density should not affected. The term that should be added to

     the governing equation the change of the volume. So governing equation is (5.16).

                            Ubn A b = m A + m B - m mix             (5.18.d)

     That is the mixture device is with an uniform density

                            mexit = 1.9974[kg/s]

     Example 5.19: Syringe Withdrawn                                Level: Simple

     A syringe apparatus is being use to withdrawn blood6. . If the piston is with-
     drawn at O.01 [m/s]. At that stage air leaks in around the piston at the rate
     0.000001 [m3/s]. What is the average velocity of blood into syringe (at the
     tip)? The syringe radios is 0.005[m] and the tip radius is 0.0003 [m].

     Solution

     The situation is unsteady state (in the instinctive c.v. and coordinates) since the

     mass in the control volume (the syringe volume is not constant). The chose of the

     control volume and coordinate system determine the amount of work. This part of

     the solution is art. There are several possible control volumes that can be used to

     solve the problem. The two "instinctive control volumes" are the blood with the air

     and the whole volume between the tip and syringe plunger (piston). The first choice

     seem reasonable since it provides relationship of the total to specific material. In that

     case, control volume is the volume syringe tip to the edge of the blood. The second

     part of the control volume is the air. For this case, the equation (5.16) is applicable

     and can be written as

                            Utip Atip &b = Ub As &b                 (5.19.a)

     In the air side the same equation can used. There several coordinate systems that

     can used, attached to plunger, attached to the blood edge, stationary. Notice that

     change of the volume do not enter into the calculations because the density of the air

     is assumed to be constant. In stationary coordinates two boundaries are moving and

     thus

                            moving b.c.                     in/out

                            Uplunger As a - Ub As b = aQ in         (5.19.b)

     In the case, the choice is coordinates moving with the plunger, the relative plunger

     velocity is zero while the blood edge boundary velocity is Uplunger - Ub. The air

     governing equation is

                            blood b. velocity      in/out

                            (Uplunger - Ub) As b = aQ in            (5.19.c)

     In the case of coordinates are attached to the blood edge similar equation is ob-
     tained. At this stage, there are two unknowns, Ub and Utip, and two equations. Using

Example 5.20: Apparatus Water-Jet                                   Level: Simple

The apparatus depicted in Figure 5.15 is referred in the literature some-
time as the water-jet pump. In this device, the water (or another liq-

The velocity is A3 = A1 + A2 and thus

For the solution, it is assumed that the ve-                                r
locity has only component in the radial di-             R
rection. This assumption is really not re-
quired if there is no circulation and eddy
flow. The conservation of the mass requires
that the flow into every cross section must
be the same. The mass conservation can
be written as

      m =  A Ur =  2  r dp (5.21.a)

where r is any radius in pump as the veloc-
ity will be

The flow rate through pump eye is constant and hence it can be written as the

following

                          Q = A Uf =  r02 Uf                                   (5.21.c)

where Uf is the (average) entrance velocity to the pump at the pump eye. The velocity

inside the pump is
                                                  U = dr
                                                         dt

Where r is the distance from the center of the pump which starts from r0. Notice that

this equation is not valid inside the pump's eye. Rearranging the velocity definition as

                                           dt = dr                             (5.21.d)

Inside the pump, the velocity is defined as a function of the radius Eq. (5.21.b). As
usual, Eq. (5.21.d) is integrated to be

Where 0 is characteristic time is defined as r/Uf or (R - r0) /Uf . This parameter

Example 5.22: Eye Flow                                              Level: Intermediate

As opposed to example (5.21.a) this question was originated from the medical

field (ophthalmology) and yet the similar idea appear. Assume that an eye can

be approximated as a sphere (very rough approximation yet it provide reasonable

approximation). For this model, it is assumed that tears are originated at the

center of the eye and leave at the surface (not a proper assumption just for

practice the concepts. It is better assumption if medication is injected at the
center). The dimension of the eye7 23[mm]. If the velocity of tears at the surface

is 0.00001 [m/sec] what is flow rate supply. If medicine/or dye is injected at

the center of the eye how long it will take to reach to the eye surface.

Solution

The mass conservation of the flow rate and assuming the density is constant as

                                  Q = A U = 4  r2 U                          (5.22.a)

Eq. (5.22.a) can be rearranged and the velocity can be expressed as

                              dr Q                                       (5.22.c)

?? is valid after certain range where velocity can does not have any component of
the injection. For practical purposes, it is assume to be zero because there is no clear
boundary. ?? is written as

                        dr                     4  r2 dr

The results are simply could guess from the question and no complicate analysis was
required. The analysis provide only the velocity in the eye.

Example 5.23: Reynolds Ratio                                         Level: Basic

This question was inspired by a question from GATE (2007). Reynolds number

is defined as                   U r
                        Re =

                                  

where  is density, U is the velocity, r is radius  is the viscosity of the fluid.
Fluid flows in two pipes with same flow rate the radius ratio is r1 = 0.5 r2 what
is the Reynolds number ratio? State your assumptions.

Solution

In order to solve the question several assumptions have to be made. The temperature

and density are same and fluid incompressible substance. For these assumptions the

density  = constnat and viscosity  = constant. The velocity ratio from from the

flow rate ratio.        A1 U1 = A2 U2 ---- U1 = A2

Solution

The continuity (mass conservation) of the control volume. Eq. (5.10) can be reduced
due to constant density in this case to

The integral is replaced by the simple multiplication because the velocity is uniform.
At the case at hand the change of volume is results in the flow out.

Solution

If H denote the initial level the distance between the two plates, after some time t
the distance (height) the plates is height h, then

                                      h=H -vt                             (5.25.a)

Thus the radial velocity can be used as Eq. (5.24.c) to read              (5.25.b)
                                            vr = v r                      (5.25.c)

The radial acceleration is             ar = dvr
                                               dt

Taking the derivative of Eq. (5.25.b)

                                 ar = d v r                               (5.25.d)

which is            ar =               vr                           v2 r  (5.25.e)

In a final form Eq. (5.25.f) becomes

6 Momentum Conservation for Control

                                  Volume

6.1 Momentum Governing Equation

6.1.1 Introduction to Continuous

In the previous chapter, the Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT) was applied to mass
conservation. Mass is a scalar (quantity without magnitude). This chapter deals with
momentum conservation which is a vector. The Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT) is
applicable to any quantity and the discussion here deals with forces that acting on the
control volume. Newton's second law for a single body is as the following

           d(mU )                               (6.1)
     F=

               dt

It can be noticed that bold notation for the velocity is U (and not U ) to represent that
the velocity has a direction. For several bodies (n), Newton's law becomes

n n d(mU )i                                     (6.2)
     F i = dt
i=1           i=1

The fluid can be broken into infinitesimal elements which turn the above equation (6.2)
into a continuous form of small bodies which results in

 nD                               element mass
    F i = Dt
                  U                dV           (6.3)
i=1
              sys

212                                    CHAPTER 6. MOMENTUM CONSERVATION

Note that the notation D/Dt is used and not the regular operator d/dt to signify that
the operator refers to a derivative of the system. The Reynold's Transport Theorem
(RTT) has to be used on the right hand side of Eq. (6.3).

6.1.2 External Forces

First, the terms on the left hand side, or the forces, have to be discussed. The forces,
excluding the external forces, are divided to the body forces, and the surface forces as
the following

                   F total = F b + F s                                           (6.4)

In this book (at least in this discussion), the main body force is the gravity. The gravity
acts on all the system elements. The total gravity force is

                                                element mass

                   Fb =                    g         dV                          (6.5)

                                       sys

which acts through the mass center towards the center of earth. After infinitesimal time
the gravity force acting on the system is the same for control volume, hence,

                        g  dV = g  dV                                            (6.6)

                   sys                          cv

The integral yields a force trough the center mass which has to be found separately.

       In this chapter, the surface forces are

divided into two categories: one perpendi-          with the n^
cular to the surface and one with the sur-          surface perpendicular
face direction (in the surface plane see Fig-
                                                                 to the surface

ure 6.1.). Thus, it can be written as

       F s = Sn dA +  dA (6.7)                  Fig. 6.1 - The explanation for the direc-
                                                     tion relative to surface perpendicular
       c.v.  c.v.

                                                    and with the surface.

Where the surface "force", Sn, is in the

surface direction, and  are the shear stresses perpendicular to the surface. The surface

"force", Sn, is made out of two components, one due to the viscosity (solid body see

also discussion page number 298) and two consequence of the fluid pressure. Here for

simplicity, only the pressure component is used which is reasonable for most situations.

Thus,

                                               0                                 (6.8)

                   S n = -P n^ + S

Where S is perpendicular stress due to viscosity. Again, n^ is an unit vector outward
of element area and the negative sign is applied so that the resulting force acts on the
body.
6.1. MOMENTUM GOVERNING EQUATION                                                      213

6.1.3 Momentum Governing Equation

The right hand side, according Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT), is

            D                  t                                           (6.9)
            Dt sys  U dV = dt c.v. c.v.  U dV +  U U rndA

The liquid velocity, U , is measured in the frame of reference and U rn is the liquid
relative velocity to boundary of the control volume measured in the same frame of
reference.

       Thus, the general form of the momentum equation without the external forces is

               Integral Momentum Equation

          g  dV -  P dA +   dA                                            (6.10)

      c.v.         c.v.               c.v.

                            t          U dV +                U Urn dV
                       =
                                  c.v.                  c.v.
                           dt

With external forces equation (6.10) is transformed to

      Integral Momentum Equation & External Forces

      F ext + g  dV -                   P  dA +   dA =                   (6.11)

                      c.v.        c.v.         c.v.
                                  t
                                  dt c.v. c.v.  U dV +  U Urn dV

 The external forces, Fext, are the forces resulting from support of the control volume
by non-fluid elements. These external forces are commonly associated with pipe, ducts,
supporting solid structures, friction (non-fluid), etc.

       Equation (6.11) is a vector equation which can be broken into its three com-
ponents. In Cartesian coordinate, for example in the x coordinate, the components
are

Fx +        g  ^i  dV - P cos x dA +  x  dA =

      c.v.         c.v.                        c.v.

                                     t                                     (6.12)
                                     dt c.v. c.v.  U x dV +  U x  U rndA

where x is the angle between n^ and ^i or the resulting of (n^  ^i).

6.1.4 Momentum Equation in Acceleration System

For accelerate system, the right hand side has to include the following acceleration

     Integral of Uniform Pressure on Body

     In this kind of calculations, it common to obtain a situation where one of
     the term will be an integral of the pressure over the body surface. This
     situation is a similar to the idea that was shown in Section 4.6. In this
     case the resulting force due to the pressure is zero to all directions.

6.1.5 Momentum Equation For Steady State and Uniform Flow

The momentum equation can be simplified for the steady state condition as it was
shown in example 6.3. The unsteady term (where the time derivative) is vanished.

6.1.5.1 Momentum Equation for Constant Pressure and Frictionless Flow

Another important sub category of simplification deals with flow under approximation
of the frictionless flow and uniform pressure. These kind of situations raised when the
friction (forces) is small compared to the kinetic momentum change (high Re number).
Additionally, in these situations, the flow is exposed to the atmosphere and thus (almost)
uniform pressure surrounding the control volume. In this situation, the mass flow rate
in and out are equal. Thus, equation (6.15) is further reduced to

            F=                    Urn                 Urn                          (6.16)

                  out                   in

In situations where the velocity is provided and known (remember that the density is
constant), the integral can be replaced by

                  F = m U o - m U i                                                (6.17)

The average velocity is related to the velocity profile by the following integral

                    21      [U (r)]2 dA                                            (6.18)

     Eq. (6.11) can be reduced, because it is a steady state, to  End of Ex. 6.2

                 out                      in

     It can be noticed that even though the velocity change direction, the mass flow rate
     remains constant. Eq. (6.2.a) can be explicitly written for the two coordinates. The
     equation for the x coordinate is

                              Fx = m (cos  Uo - Ui)                       (6.2.b)

     or since Ui = Uo

                              Fx = m Ui (cos  - 1)                        (6.2.c)

     It can be observed that the maximum force, Fx occurs when cos  = . It can be

     proved by setting dFx/d = 0 which yields  = 0 a minimum and the previous solution.

     Hence,

                              Fx|max = -2 m Ui                            (6.2.d)

     and the force in the y direction is

                                          Fy = m Ui sin                   (6.2.e)

     the combined forces are

                 Ftotal = Fx2 + Fy2 = m Ui (cos  - 1)2 + sin2             (6.2.f )

     Which results in

                              Ftotal = m Ui sin (/2)                      (6.2.g)

     with the force angle of

                              tan  =  - Fy =  -                           (6.2.h)

Solution

The chosen control volume is shown in Figure 6.3. First, the velocity has to be found.
This situation is a steady state for constant density. Then the mass conservation
requires that

                        A1 U1 = A2 U2

and after rearrangement, the exit velocity is

6.2 Momentum Equation Application

Momentum Equation Applied to Propellers

The propeller is a mechanical devise that is used to increase the fluid momentum. Many

times it is used for propulsion purposes of airplanes, ships and other devices (thrust) as

shown in Figure 6.4. The propeller can be stationary like in cooling tours, fan etc. The

other common used of propeller is mostly to move fluids as a pump.

The propeller analysis of unsteady is complicated due to the difficulty in under-

standing the velocity field. For a steady state the analysis is simpler and used here to

provide an example of steady state. In the Figure 6.4 the fluid flows from the left to

the right. Either it is assumed that some of the fluid enters into the container and fluid

outside is not affected by the propeller. Or there is a line (or surface) in which the fluid

outside changes. only the flow direction This surface is called slip surface. Of course it

is only approximation but is provided a crude tool. Improvements can be made to this

analysis. Here, this analysis is used for academic purposes.

As first approximation,

the pressure around control

volume is the same. Thus,

pressure drops from the cal-

culation. The one dimen-

sional momentum equation is      1  U1                 34           2  U2

This analysis provide a way to calculate the work needed to move this propeller. Note
that in this analysis it was assumed that the flow is horizontal that z1 = z2 and/or the
change is insignificant.

       Example 6.4: Fish Moving in Infinite Medium Level: Intermediate
    Fish moves in infinite medium. To analyze the flow around the fish the re-
    searchers assume that the momentum is conserved by arguing that "If we con-
    sider the body-fluid system, no external forces or moments are present and
    therefore the linear and angular momenta are conserved" (Paniccia, Graziani,
    Lugni, and Piva 2022, p. 918). Is that appropriate assumption to ignore the

     what conditions this assumption is appropriate.

     Solution

Jet Propulsion

       Jet propulsion is a mechanism in which the airplanes and other devices are pro-
pelled. Essentially, the air is sucked into engine and with an addition heating (burning
fuel) the velocity is increased. Further increase of the exit area with the increased of
the burned gases further increase the thrust. The analysis of such device in complicated
and there is a whole class dedicated for such topic in many universities. Here, a very
limited discussion related to the steady state is offered.

       The difference between the jets propulsion and propellers is based on the energy
supplied. The propellers are moved by a mechanical work which is converted to thrust.
In Jet propulsion, the thermal energy is converted to thrust. Hence, this direct conver-
sion can be, and is, in many case more efficient. Furthermore, as it will be shown in
the Chapter on compressible flow it allows to achieve velocity above speed of sound, a
major obstacle in the past.

       The inlet area and exit area are different for most jets and if the mass of the fuel
is neglected then

               F =  A2 U22 - A1 U12                                      (6.22)

     conservation equation for steady state is                              continue Ex. 6.5
                                                   A1U1 = A2U2
     The momentum equation in the x direction is

F f + g  dV - P dA +  dA =                                                       U U rndV  (6.5.a)

c.v.                           c.v.  c.v.                                   c.v.

The relative velocity into the control volume is

                                     U 1j = (Uj - U0) x^

The relative velocity out the control volume is

                                     U 2j = (Uj - U0) y^

The absolute exit velocity is

                               U 2 = U0x^ + (Uj - U0) y^

For small volume, the gravity can be neglected also because this term is small compared
to other terms, thus

                                                   g  dV  0

                                                                      c.v.

The same can be said for air friction as

                                                     dA  0

                                                                       c.v.

The pressure is uniform around the control volume and thus the integral is

                                                    P dA = 0

                                                                       c.v.

The control volume was chosen so that the pressure calculation is minimized.
The momentum flux is

                                            Ux Uirn dA = A  U1j 2                          (6.5.b)

                                                       Sc.v.

The substituting (6.5.b) into equation (6.5.a) yields

                                     Ff = A  U1j 2                                         (6.5.c)

The friction can be obtained from the momentum equation in the y direction

                               mtoy g + A  U1j 2 = Fearth

According to the statement of question the friction force is
                                    Ff = 킺 mtoy g + A  U1j 2
222                            CHAPTER 6. MOMENTUM CONSERVATION

     The momentum in the x direction becomes            End of Ex. 6.5

     킺 mtoy g + A  U1j 2 = A  U1j 2 = A  (Uj - U0)2

     The toy velocity is then

                               U0 = Uj -     킺 mtoy g
                                           A  (1 - 킺)

     Increase of the friction reduce the velocity. Additionally larger toy mass decrease the
     velocity.

6.2.1 Momentum for Unsteady State and Uniform Flow

The main problem in solving the un-                   FR
steady state situation is that the con-
trol volume is accelerating. A possible                         mf
way to solve the problem is by expressing                           mR UR
the terms in an equation (6.10). This
method is cumbersome in many cases.                                Ug
Alternative method of solution is done        Fig. 6.6 - A rocket with a moving control
by attaching the frame of reference to
the accelerating body. One such ex-                volume.
ample of such idea is associated with
the Rocket Mechanics which is present
here.

6.2.2 Momentum Application to Unsteady State

Rocket Mechanics

A rocket is a devise similar to jet propulsion. The difference is the fact that the oxidant
is on board with the fuel. The two components are burned and the gases are ejected
through a nozzle. This mechanism is useful for specific locations because it is indepen-
dent of the medium though which it travels. In contrast to other mechanisms such as
jet propulsion which obtain the oxygen from the medium which they travel the rockets
carry the oxygen with it. The rocket is accelerating and thus the frame for reference is
moving the with the rocket. The velocity of the rocket in the rocket frame of reference
is zero. However, the derivative with respect to time, dU /dt = 0 is not zero. The
6.2. MOMENTUM EQUATION APPLICATION                                         223

resistance of the medium is Denote as FR. The momentum equation is

FR                      0

     dA +      g  dV +      P dA -       a0 dV =

c.v.       c.v.         c.v.                UydV +

                                   d   Vc.v.                     Uy UrndA  (6.23)

                                   dt                        c.v.

There are no external forces in this control volume thus, the first term FR, vanishes.
The pressure term vanish because the pressure essentially is the same and the difference
can be neglected. The gravity term is an instantaneous mass times the gravity times
the constant and the same can be said for the acceleration term. Yet, the acceleration
is the derivative of the velocity and thus

                                     dU                                    (6.24)
                         a0 dV = dt (mR + mf )

The first term on the right hand side is the change of the momentum in the rocket
volume. This change is due to the change in the volume of the oxidant and the fuel.

           d                           d                                   (6.25)
           dt Vc.v. UydV = dt [(mR + mf ) U ]

Clearly, the change of the rocket mass can be considered minimal or even neglected.
The oxidant and fuel flow outside. However, inside the rocket the change in the velocity
is due to change in the reduction of the volume of the oxidant and fuel. This change is
minimal and for this analysis, it can be neglected. The last term is

                                Uy UrndA = m (Ug - UR)                     (6.26)

                                       c.v.

Combining all the above term results in

                                   dU                                      (6.27)
    -FR - (mR + mf ) g + dt (mR + mf ) = m (Ug - UR)

Denoting MT = mR + mf and thus dM/dt = m and Ue = Ug - UR. As first approx-
imation, for constant fuel consumption (and almost oxidant), gas flow out is constant
as well. Thus, for constant constant gas consumption equation (6.27) transformed to

                               dU                                          (6.28)
           -FR - MT g + MT = MT Ue
                               dt

Separating the variables equation (6.28) yields

              dU =      -M T Ue FR                   - g dt                (6.29)
                                       -
                           MT                    MT
224               CHAPTER 6. MOMENTUM CONSERVATION

Before integrating equation (6.29), it can be noticed that the friction resistance FR, is a
function of the several parameters such the duration, the speed (the Reynolds number),
material that surface made and the medium it flow in altitude. For simplicity here the
part close to Earth (to the atmosphere) is assumed to be small compared to the distance
in space. Thus it is assume that FR = 0. Integrating equation (6.29) with limits of
U (t = 0) = 0 provides

        U t dt t
        dU = -M T Ue                               - g dt      (6.30)

     0                                                0

the results of the integration is (notice M = M0 - t M )

        U = Ue ln M0 - g t                                     (6.31)
                       M0 - t M

       The following is an elaborated example which deals with an unsteady two dimen-

sional problem. This problem demonstrates the used of control volume to find method
of approximation for not given velocity profiles1

     Example 6.6: Tank with Wheels                        Level: Intermediate

     A tank with wheels is filled with liquid is depicted in Fig. 6.7. The

     tank upper part is opened to the atmosphere. At initial time the valve

     on the tank is opened and the liquid flows out with an uniform velocity

     profile. The tank mass with the                  UT

     wheels (the solid parts) is known,

     mt. Calculate the tank velocity for           y

     two cases. One the wheels have a              hx      U0

     constant resistance with the ground              FR

     and two the resistance linear func-

     tion of the weight. Assume that the    Fig. 6.7 - Schematic of a tank seating on
     exit velocity is a linear function of       wheel for unsteady state discussion
     the height.

     Solution

     This problem is similar to the rocket mechanics with a twist, the source of the propul-
     sion is the potential energy. Furthermore, the fluid has two velocity components verse
     one component in the rocket mechanics. The control volume is shown in Figure 6.7.
     The frame of reference is moving with the tank. This situation is unsteady state thus
     equation (6.12) for two dimensions is used. The mass conservation equation is

        d  dV + dA = 0                                         (6.6.a)
        dt Vc.v.
                                            Sc.v.

    1A variation of this problem has appeared in many books in the literature. However, in the past
it was not noticed that a slight change in configuration leads to a constant x velocity. This problem
was aroused in manufacturing industry. This author was called for consultation and to solve a related
problem. For which he noticed this "constant velocity."
6.2. MOMENTUM EQUATION APPLICATION                                                                     225
     Equation (6.6.a) can be transferred to                                   continue Ex. 6.6

                                dmc.v. = - U0 A0 = -m0                            (6.6.b)
                                  dt

Where m0 is mass flow rate out. Equation (6.6.b) can be further reduced due to
constant density to

         d (A h)                     (6.6.c)
                   + U0 A0 = 0

            dt

It can be noticed that the area of the tank UT

is almost constant (A = constant) thus y L

                                                                           x

    A dh + U0 A0 = 0 = dh =                                  x                Uo

                                                        tank for example 6.6.
The relationship between the height and
the flow now can be used.

                                         U0 = B h                                 (6.6.e)

Where B is the coefficient that has the right units to Mach equation (6.6.e) that
represent the resistance in the system and substitute the energy equation. Substituting
equation (6.6.e) into equation (6.6.c) results in

                                 dh + B h A0 = 0                                  (6.6.f )
                                     dt    A

Equation (6.6.f) is a first order differential equation which can be solved with the

initial condition h(t = 0) = h0. The solution (see for details in the Appendix A.2.1 )

is                                            t A0 B

                                 h(t) = h0 e- A                                   (6.6.g)

         To find the average velocity in the x direction a new control volume is used. The

boundary of this control volume are the tank boundary on the left with the straight

surface as depicted in Figure 6.8. The last boundary is variable surface in a distance

x from the tank left part. The tank depth, is not relevant. The mass conservation for

this control volume is                dh

                                                                                  (6.6.h)
                                      dt

Where here w is the depth or width of the tank. Substituting (6.6.g) into (6.6.h)

results                                         t A0쭮

                                     A h                    A

The average x component of the velocity is a linear function of x. Perhaps surprising,

it also can be noticed that Ux(x) is a not function of the time. Using this function,

the average velocity in the tank is

                        Ux = 1           L x A0 B L A0 B                          (6.6.j)

                                                                                continue Ex. 6.6
     It can be noticed that Ux is not function of height, h. In fact, it can be shown that

     average velocity is a function of cross section (what direction?).
             Using a similar control volumea, the average velocity in the y direction is

                                                                                  t A0 B

                                                                                          (6.6.k)

     dt            A

     It can be noticed that the velocity in the y is a function of time as oppose to the x
     direction.

             The applicable momentum equation (in the tank frame of reference) is (6.11)
     which is reduced to

                                                     acceleration                         (6.6.l)

     -F R - (mt + mf ) g - a (mt + mf ) = d [(mt + mf ) U r] + U0 mo
                                                         dt

     Where U r is the relative fluid velocity to the tank (if there was no tank movement). mf

     and mt are the mass of the fluid and the mass of tank respectively. The acceleration
     of the tank is a = -^ia0 or ^i  a = -a. And the additional force for accelerated system

     is

     -^i          adV = mc.v. a

            Vc.v.

     The mass in the control volume include the mass of the liquid with mass of the solid
     part (including the wheels).

                                                mc.v. = mf + mT

     because the density of the air is very small the change of the air mass is very small as
     well (a << ).

             The pressure around the control volume is uniform thus

                                                      P cos xdA  0

                                                                     Sc.v.

     and the resistance due to air is negligible, hence

                                                           dA  0

     The momentum flow rate out of the tank is

                                                                           continue Ex. 6.6
There is no mass flow in the y direction and Uy is component of the velocity in the y
direction.

The tank movement cause movement of the air which cause momentum change.

This momentum is function of the tank volume times the air density times tank velocity

(h0  A  a  U ). This effect is known as the add mass/momentum and will be
discussed in the Dimensional Analysis and Ideal Flow Chapters. Here this effect is

neglected.

The main problem of integral analysis approach is that it does not provide a

way to analysis the time derivative since the velocity profile is not given inside the

control volume. This limitation can be partially overcome by assuming some kind of

average. It can be noticed that the velocity in the tank has two components. The first

component is downward (y) direction and the second in the exit direction (x). The

velocity in the y direction does not contribute to the momentum in the x direction.

The average velocity in the tank (because constant density and more about it later

section) is

                     Ux = 1            UxdV
                             Vt
                                    Vf

Because the integral is replaced by the average it is transferred to

                         UxdV  mc.v. Ux

                     Vf

        Thus, if the difference between the actual and averaged momentum is neglected
then

Noticing that the derivative with time of control volume mass is the flow out in

     The initial condition is that UT (t = 0) = 0. Substituting equations (6.6.s) and (6.6.t)
     into equation (6.6.r) transforms it to a differential equation which is integrated if Rx
     is constant.

any assumption that you made.

Solution

The liquid is pushed by the ring can be divided into two zones plus the ring free
body. The first zone is the volume within the ring and second is the volume under the
ring see Figure 6.9. It reasonable to separate the problem into two control volumes
because the first zone is accelerating in the Earth frame of reference while the second
control volume has a constant velocity (zero) with an accelerating upper boundary.
The first control volume shown in Figure 6.9 has the same flow in and out (regardless
the selection of the coordinates system).

c.v. 1
The continuity equation in coordinate system moving with the ring reads

      (Uin + Uring) dA -         (Uout + Uring) dA = d         dV        (6.7.a)
                          Aout dt
Ain                                                         V

Where Uin and Uout are the absolute velocities in the Earth coordinate system. The
right hand side term vanishes because the amount of liquid in the control volume does
not change. The density is constant which leads to

                          Uin = Uout                                     (6.7.b)

That is, the velocities in and out of the ring are the same but are a strong function
of the time. This fact also means that these velocities are identical in any other
coordinate systems. The momentum conservation has to account for the acceleration
of the control volume (see the first term) as

 (g - a) dV +       Pin dA -       Patmos dA +  dA =

               Ain            out                  A

Where the velocities are taken in a coordinate system attached to the ring. In that
case, ring is accelerating in the direction of the gravity, hence, the acceleration has be

     subtracted from the gravity. Notice that the gravity is reduced by the absolute value

     of the acceleration. The different terms of above equation have to be examined. The

     acceleration according to the definition is a = - dt2 d2h . Hence, the first term can be

     written as                                                d2h
                                                          g + dt2

     The second and third terms can be combined and simplified, under the assumption of
     uniform pressure in the cross section. Hence, these terms can be written as

                     Pin dA -           P dA = (Patmos - Pin) Aout            (6.7.e)

     The shear stresses in the ring surface could be better analyzed utilizing the differential
     analysis. Here for this discussion, it is assumed that the shear stresses are a function
     of the velocity square Fshear = C U 2. Where C is assumed to be constant (indirectly
     also assuming that the flow does not undergoes flow region change e.g. laminar to
     turbulent or other complications). The velocity refers to the relative velocity to ring
     surface. Some identities can be observed from the definition of height, h.

                                   Uring = - dh                               (6.7.f )
                                                 dt

     The negative sign is to signify that the height change direction is positive upward.

     The relative liquid velocity to the ring surface is the summation of the velocity, Uout

     plus ring velocity, Uring. The relative velocity (in or out) further can be combined

     with equation (6.7.f) as

                                   Urn = Uout - dh                            (6.7.g)
                                                      dt

     The assumption mentioned above, the resistance based on the absolute velocity, trans-

     lates to                                       dh 2

                               A

     The first term on the right hand side represents the change of the momentum in the

     control volume in the coordinate system attached to the body. The change in the

     velocity in the equation refers to the change of relative velocity thus

     dt V                      dt         dt

     The last term is based on two similar velocities Urn and U . The relative liquid velocity
     in the frame of reference of the ring is defined by equation (6.7.g). The velocity, U
     is identities to (6.7.g) because the control volume size is fixed. Yet, it can be noticed
     that the amount momentum enter to the control volume as the leaving amount. The
     last term can be written as

The second control volume is stationary

(with respect to Earth coordinates) with                         Uout = 0
the exception of the upper surface. On                                           
the second control volume, the liquid ve-
locity inside control volume is zero in the                Uout = 0

frame of reference attached the control vol-

ume. The mass and momentum equations

can be ascertained after the velocity at the           Fig. 6.10 - Jump in the velocity
interface and relative velocity established.                across the control volume bound-

is not defined. On one side of the boundary

the velocity is zero yet the velocity at the other side the velocity is finite (see Figure

6.10). If a small control volume is constructed around this boundary (see the green

line) it will result in a mass source within the control volume. Clearly, there is no

mass source in that control volume. Thus, the alternative approach adapted here

is to move the control volume just  in the opening of the ring. This small change

allows continue the uniform velocity and uniform pressure assumptions to be used.

However, the payment is that equations such Bernoulli equation can not be used

across this jump. In that case the velocity of at the velocity at boundary is Uout. The

continuity equation reads

            Ŀ B 0          A U dA = d         dV = d ( A h) =  A dh               (6.7.l)

Consequently

The shear stresses zero in this control volume because the velocity field is zero. The

momentum balance reads

                                                    0     U dV +     U Urn dA      (6.7.n)

     The first term in the right hand side represents the change of momentum, since in

     the control volume the velocity is always zero, the total change is zero. There is no

     change with respect to time.

     U is Uout - dh/dt and the relative velocity, Urn = Aout. Thus,

           U Urn dA =  Aout                                     dh                   (6.7.q)

         g h A - (Pin - Pb) A =  Aout Uout - dh
                                                                dt

     Combining with equation (6.7.m) with equation (6.7.r) results in

      g h A - (Pin - Pb) A =  Aout  - A dh - dh       = - Aout dh               A +1
                                      Aout dt dt                     dt        Aout

                                                                                      (6.7.s)

     Ring Free Body or c.v.3 Around the Ring
             The third control volume is around the ring. The forces balance reads

     m g + F -  dA - (Pin - Patmos) (A - Ain) = mring a = mring dh                   (6.7.t)
                                                                               dt
     A

     It was assumed that the friction force can be expressed by equation (6.7.h) so

     m g + F + C dh                 A + 1 - (Pin - Patmos) (A - Ain)                 (6.7.u)
                       dt          Aout

             These four equations have four unknowns, Pb, Fb, Uout, h along with the initial
     conditions can be solved. Rearranging equation (6.7.k) and combining with equation
     (6.7.m) yields

     Pin = Patmos -  hring              d2h  +        Vring dh2     1+ A             (6.7.v)
                                   g + dt2                               Aout
                                                      Aout dt  2

     Substituting equation (6.7.v) into equation (6.7.u) provides second order differential
     equation for h. The initial conditions can be assumed that initial velocity is zero and
     the initial height is specific height.

                                    h(0) = h0                                       (6.7.w)
                                    dh (0) = 0
                                    dt

Averaged Velocity! Estimates

       In example (6.1) relationship between momentum of maximum velocity to average
velocity was presented. Here, relationship between momentum for the average velocity
6.3. CONSERVATION MOMENT OF MOMENTUM                                     233

to the actual velocity is presented. There are situations where actual velocity profile
is not known but is function can be approximated. For example, the velocity profile
can be estimated using the ideal fluid theory but the actual values are not known. For
example, the flow profile in example 6.6 can be estimated even by hand sketching.

       For these cases a correction factor can be used. This correction factor can be
calculated by finding the relation between the two cases. The momentum for average
velocity is

                                   Ma = mc.vU =  V     U dV              (6.34)
The actual momentum for control volume is                                (6.35)
                                                    c.v

                               Mc =  UxdV

                                             c.v.

These two have to equal thus,

C  V U dV =  UxdV                                                        (6.36)

                               c.v           c.v.

If the density is constant then the coefficient is one (C  1). However, if the density is
not constant, the coefficient is not equal to one.

6.3 Conservation Moment Of Momentum

The angular momentum can be derived in the same manner as the momentum equation
for control volume. The force

                               F=   D         U dV                       (6.37)

                                    Dt Vsys

The angular momentum then will be obtained by calculating the change of every element
in the system as

M =r F =                              D             r  U dV            (6.38)

                                       Dt Vsys

Now the left hand side has to be transformed into the control volume as

        d                                                                (6.39)
M = dt Vc.v. Sc.v  (r  U ) dV +  (r  U ) U rn dA

The angular momentum equation, applying equation (6.39) to uniform and steady state
flow with neglected pressure gradient is reduced to

M = m (r2  U2 + r2  U1)                                                (6.40)

locity occur. The pressure on the outer

side is uniform thus does not create a moment. The flow is assumed to enter the

impeller radially with average velocity U1. Here it is assumed that fluid is incompressible

( = constant). The height of the impeller is h. The exit liquid velocity, U2 has two

components, one the tangential velocity, Ut2 and radial component, Un2. The relative

exit velocity is Ulr2 and the velocity of the impeller edge is Um2. Notice that tangential

liquid velocity, Ut2 is not equal to the impeller outer edge velocity Um2. It is assumed

that required torque is function U2, r, and h.

               M = m r2 Ut2                                               (6.41)

Multiplying equation (6.41) results in

                                  Um2                                     (6.42)

               M  = m r2  Ut2

The shaft work is given by the left side and hence,

               W = m Um2 Ut2                                              (6.43)

The difference between Um2 to Ut2 is related to the efficiency of the pump which will
be discussed in the chapter on the Turbomachinary.

     Example 6.8: Centrifugal Pump                   Level: Intermediate

     A centrifugal pump is pumping 600 2[m3/hour]. The thickness of the impeller,

Solution

Under construction for time being only hints2

In the solution of this problem several assumptions must be made so that the integral
system can be employed.

1 The surface remained straight at the times and no liquid residue remains
     behind.

2 The gas obeys the ideal gas law.

3 The process is isothermal (can be isentropic process).

4 No gas leaves the rocket.

5 The mixing between the liquid and gas is negligible.

6 The gas mass is negligible in comparison to the liquid mass and/or the rocket.

7 No resistance to the rocket (can be added).

 8 The cross section of the liquid is constant.
In this problem the energy source is the pressure of the gas which propels the rocket.
Once the gas pressure reduced to be equal or below the outside pressure the rocket
have no power for propulsion. Additionally, the initial take off is requires a larger
pressure.
The mass conservation is similar to the rocket hence it is

                             dm = -Ue Ae                                     (6.9.a)

                                                                                continue Ex. 6.9
     The mass conservation on the gas zone is a byproduct of the mass conservation of

     the liquid. Furthermore, it can be observed that the gas pressure is a direct function

     of the mass flow out.

     The gas pressure at the initial point is

                                      P0 = 0 R T                                                   (6.9.b)

     Per the assumption the gas mass remain constant and is denoted as mg. Using the
     above definition, equation (6.9.b) becomes

                                                   P0 = mg R T                                     (6.9.c)
                                                             V0g

     The relationship between the gas volume

                                      Vg = hg A                                                    (6.9.d)

     The gas geometry is replaced by a virtual constant cross section which cross section

     of the liquid (probably the same as the base of the gas phase). The change of the gas

     volume is                    dVg = A dhg = -A dh

                                  dt           dt                 dt                               (6.9.e)

     The last identify in the above equation is based on the idea what ever height concede

     by the liquid is taken by the gas. The minus sign is to account for change of "direction"

     of the liquid height. The total change of the gas volume can be obtained by integration

     as

                                  Vg = A (hg0 - h )                                                (6.9.f )

     It must be point out that integral is not function of time since the height as function
     of time is known at this stage.
     The initial pressure now can be expressed as

                                      P0 = mg R T                                                  (6.9.g)
                                               hg0 A

     The pressure at any time is      P = mg R T                                                   (6.9.h)
     Thus the pressure ratio is               hg A

                            P = hg0 = hg0          = hg0 1                                         (6.9.i)
                            P0 hg hg0 - h                  1 - h
                                                                 hg0

     Equation (6.9.a) can be written as                                                            (6.9.j)

                                                                                                t

     From equation (6.9.a) it also can be written that

                                      dh = Ue Ae                                                   (6.9.k)

is needed. For great accuracy, the effect minor loss or the loss in the tank opening

have taken into account. First assuming that a minimum accuracy therefore the infor-

mation was given on the tank that it large. First, the velocity to move the block can

be obtained from the analysis of the block

free body diagram (the impinging jet dia-

gram).

        The control volume is attached to    Uexit2
the block. It is assumed that the two
                                                      w              mg

streams in the vertical cancel each other.  Uout2
The jet stream has only one component in

the horizontal component. Hence,

        F =  A Uexit2             (6.14.a)  Fig. 6.14 - Jet impinging jet sur-
                                                 face perpendicular and with the

                                            surface.

The minimum force the push the block is

           A Uexit2 = m g  -- Uexit =            mg                    (6.14.b)
                                                   A                     (6.14.c)

                                                                   
And the velocity as a function of the height is U =  g h and thus

                                        m
                                  h= 2

                                        A

It is interesting to point out that the gravity is relevant. That is the gravity has no
effect on the velocity (height) required to move the block. However, if the gravity
was in the opposite direction, no matter what the height will be the block will not
move (neglecting other minor effects). So, the gravity has effect and the effect is the
direction, that is the same height will be required on the moon as the earth.

        For very tall blocks, the forces that acts on the block in the vertical direction is
can be obtained from the analysis of the control volume shown in Fig. 6.14. The jet
impinged on the surface results in out flow stream going to all the directions in the
block surface. Yet, the gravity acts on all these "streams" and eventually the liquid
flows downwards. In fact because the gravity the jet impinging in downwards sled
direction. At the extreme case, all liquid flows downwards. The balance on the stream
downwards (for steady state) is

                                2                                        (6.14.d)
                         Uout =  Vliquid g + m g

Where Vliquid is the liquid volume in the control volume (attached to the block). The

pressure is canceled because the flow is exposed to air. In cases were  Vliquid g >

            2

 Uout the required height is larger. In the opposite cases the height is smaller.

     Example 6.15: Filling Tank with Water        Level: GATE 2003

     A water container is kept on a weighing balance. Water from the tap is falling

     vertically into the container with a volume flow rate of Q; the velocity of the

     water when it hits the water surface is U . At a particular instant of time the

     total mass of the container and water is m. The force registered by the weighing

     balance at this instant of time is

     (a) m g +  Q U                               (b) m g + 2  Q U
     (c) m g + mg + 2  Q U2                       (d) m g + 2  Q U

     Solution

     The control volume in this case should include the water plus the container. In this
     control volume, there is one external force (the scale) in the upward direction and one
     flow in. It can be noticed that at the specific point there two (or more) options for the
     control volume upper surface: one) the upper surface moves with the liquid surface
     velocity or the boundary is fixed and there is flow out. For the first option surface
     velocity should enter into the calculation. No matter the choice, the results should be
     the same. However, to solve the problem additional information is required. Hence, in
     case for ill-defined problem one has to result into to what the poet meant (admittedly
     this author will try to find general expression and fail the exam).

             For the case of the neglecting (for large cross section) surface velocity, simple
     balance should be expressed. The weight of the container and water denoted m and
     wight m g. The momentum entering to control volume is m U or in the given data as
      Q U , therefore, net balance reads

     F = mg+QU                                                      (6.15.a)

     Answer is (a) not correct but the closest.

       Example 6.16: Siphon Flow Out                               Level: GATE 2006

     A siphon draws water from a reservoir                                          P
     and discharges it out at atmospheric                         h1
     pressure. Assuming ideal fluid and the
     reservoir is large, the velocity at point P                                                 h2
     in the siphon tube is:

Solution                                     End of Ex. 6.16

The velocity at P is the same as though the whole pipe. The fact that there is siphon
is irrelevant to the velocity for ideal condition. The difference between the two sides
dictate the velocity and also the flow rate. Thus, in this case 2 g (h2 - h1)
The answer is (c)

7.1 The First Law of Thermodynamics

This chapter focuses on the energy conservation which is the first law of thermodynam-
ics1. The fluid, as all phases and materials, obeys this law which creates strange and
wonderful phenomena such as a shock and choked flow. Moreover, this law allows to
solve problems, which were assumed in the previous chapters. For example, the rela-
tionship between height and flow rate was assumed previously, here it will be derived.
Additionally a discussion on various energy approximation is presented.

       It was shown in Chapter 2 that the energy rate equation (2.10) for a system is

  D EU D                                       mU2     D (m g z)  (7.1)
Q-W =                                  +       Dt   +
       Dt
                                                           Dt

This equation can be rearranged to be

Q - W = D                                         U2              (7.2)
             Dt                        EU + m 2 + m g z

Equation (7.2) is similar to equation (6.3) in which the right hand side has to be

interpreted and the left hand side interpolated using the Reynold's Transport Theorem
(RTT)2.

    1Thermodynamics is the favorite topic of this author since it was his major in high school. Clearly this
topic is very important and will be extensively discussed here. However, during time of the constructing
this book only a simple skeleton by Potto standards will be build.

    2Some view the right hand side as external effects while the left side of the equation represents the
internal effects. This simplistic representation is correct only under extreme conditions. For example,
the above view is wrong when the heat convection, which is external force, is included on the right
hand side.

                                          243
244                                              CHAPTER 7. ENERGY CONSERVATION

       The right hand side is very complicated and only some of the effects will be
discussed (It is only an introductory material).

       The energy transfer is carried (mostly3) by heat transfer to the system or the
control volume. There are three modes of heat transfer, conduction, convection4 and
radiation. In most problems, the radiation is minimal. Hence, the discussion here
will be restricted to convection and conduction. Issues related to radiation are very
complicated and considered advance material and hence will be left out. The issues
of convection are mostly covered by the terms on the left hand side. The main heat
transfer mode on the left hand side is conduction. Conduction for most simple cases is
governed by Fourier's Law which is

                                dT                                              (7.3)
                      dq = kT dn dA

Where dq is heat transfer to an infinitesimal small area per time and kT is the heat
conduction coefficient. The heat derivative is normalized into area direction. The total
heat transfer to the control volume is

                                                 dT                             (7.4)

transfer. There are two kinds of works that

the system does on the surroundings. The

first kind work is by the friction or the shear

stress and the second by normal force. As            System at t + dt

in the previous chapter, the surface forces

are divided into two categories: one per- Fig. 7.1 - The work on the control volume is

surface direction. The work done by sys-

tem on the surroundings (see Figure 7.1) is

         dw = -S dA 톎 = - (Sn +  )  d dA                                      (7.5)

The change of the work for an infinitesimal time (excluding the shaft work) is

                       U

     dw                d                                                        (7.6)
     dt = - (Sn +  )  dt dA = - (Sn +  )  U dA

The total work for the system including the shaft work is

         W = -         (Sn +  ) U dA - Wshaft                                   (7.7)

                Ac.v.

    3There are other methods such as magnetic fields (like microwave) which are not part of this book.
    4When dealing with convection, actual mass transfer must occur and thus no convection is possible

to a system by the definition of system.
7.1. THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS                               245

       Equation (7.8) does not apply any restrictions on the system. The system can
contain solid parts as well several different kinds of fluids. Now Reynolds Transport
Theorem can be used to transformed the left hand side of equation (7.8) and thus
yields

                  Energy Equation

                  Acv + Eu + m 2 + g z  UrndA

From now on the notation of the control volume and system will be dropped since all
equations deals with the control volume. In the last term in equation (7.9) the velocity
appears twice. Note that U is the velocity in the frame of reference while Urn is the
velocity relative to the boundary. As it was discussed in the previous chapter the normal
stress component is replaced by the pressure (see equation (6.8) for more details). The
work rate (excluding the shaft work) is

                     flow work

                W = P n^  U dA -   U n^ dA                       (7.10)

                     S                   S

       The first term on the right hand side is referred to in the literature as the flow
work and is

                                Urn

The second term is referred to as the shear work and is defined as

                           W shear = -   U dA                           (7.13)

     Substituting all these terms into the governing equation yields

     Q - W shear-  W shaft = d             U2

Equation (7.15) describes the energy conservation for the control volume in stationary
coordinates. Also note that the shear work inside the control volume considered as shaft
work.

       The example of flow from a tank or container is presented to demonstrate how
to treat some of terms in equation (7.15).

Flow Out From A Container

     In the previous chapters of this book,

the flow rate out of a tank or container

was assumed to be a linear function of           A

the height. The flow out is related to the

height but in a more complicate function

and is the focus of this discussion. The en-     h                       Ae

ergy equation with mass conservation will

be utilized for this analysis. In this anal-

ysis several assumptions are made which

includes the following: constant density,

the gas density is very small compared to Fig. 7.2 - Discharge from a Large Container with
                                              a small diameter.
liquid density, and exit area is relatively

small, so the velocity can be assumed uni-

form (not a function of the opening height)5, surface tension effects are negligible and

5Later a discussion about the height opening effects will be discussed.
7.1. THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS                                247

the liquid surface is straight6. Additionally, the temperature is assumed to constant.
The control volume is chosen so that all the liquid is included up to exit of the pipe.
The conservation of the mass is

                               d                                    (7.16)
                               dt V A  dV +  Urn dA = 0

which  also  can  be  written  (because  d   =  0)  as
                                         dt

                                  Ubn dA + UrndA = 0                (7.17)

                               A                    A

Equation (7.17) provides the relationship between boundary velocity to the exit velocity
as

                                         A Ub = Ae Ue               (7.18)

Note that the boundary velocity is not the averaged velocity but the actual velocity.
The averaged velocity in z direction is same as the boundary velocity

                               Ub = Uz = dh = Ae Ue                 (7.19)
                                              dt A

       The x component of the averaged velocity is a function of the geometry and was
calculated in Example 5.14 to be larger than

                               2 r Ae                   2r  2 r dh  (7.20)
                      Ux               Ue = Ux = Ub =
                               hA                       h   h dt

In this analysis, for simplicity, this quantity will be used.
       The averaged velocity in the y direction is zero because the flow is symmetrical7.

However, the change of the kinetic energy due to the change in the velocity field isn't
zero. The kinetic energy of the tank or container is based on the half part as shown in
Figure 7.3. Similar estimate that was done for x direction can be done to every side of
the opening if they are not symmetrical. Since in this case the geometry is assumed to
be symmetrical one side is sufficient as

                                            ( - 2)r dh              (7.21)
                                       Uy =

                                                  8 h dt

    6This assumption is appropriated only under certain conditions which include the geometry of the
tank or container and the liquid properties. A discussion about this issue will be presented in the
Dimensional Chapter and is out of the scope of this chapter. Also note that the straight surface
assumption is not the same surface tension effects zero.

   Also notice that the surface velocity is not zero. The surface has three velocity components which
non have them vanish. However, in this discussion it is assumed that surface has only one component
in z direction. Hence it requires that velocity profile in x y to be parabolic. Second reason for this
exercise the surface velocity has only one component is to avoid dealing with Bar-Meir's instability.

    7For the mass conservation analysis, the velocity is zero for symmetrical geometry and some other
geometries. However, for the energy analysis the averaged velocity cannot be considered zero.

       The energy balance can be expressed                   Uy 1      Uy 1
by equation (7.15) which is applicable to
this case. The temperature is constant8.                           2         2
In this light, the following approximation
can be written

       Eu                          (7.22)                    Uy = 0

The boundary shear work is zero because

the velocity at tank boundary or walls is   Fig. 7.3 - How to compensate and estimate the

the exit are normal to the flow direction

hence the shear work is vanished. At the

free surface the velocity has only normal component9and thus shear work vanishes there

as well. Additionally, the internal shear work is assumed negligible.

                             W shear = W shaft = 0                               (7.23)

Now the energy equation deals with no "external" effects. Note that the (exit) velocity
on the upper surface is zero Urn = 0.

       Combining all these information results in

                                            energy flow out

     internal energy change        energy in and out         upper surface work

Where Ub is the upper boundary velocity, Pa is the external pressure and Pe is the exit
pressure10.

       The pressure terms in equation (7.24) are

          Pe Ue dA - Pa Ub dA = Pe                      Ue dA - Pa      Ub dA    (7.25)

It can be noticed that Pa = Pe hence

                                      =0

                             Pa Ue dA - Ub dA = 0                                (7.26)

    8This approach is a common approximation. Yet, why this approach is correct in most cases is not
explained here. Clearly, the dissipation creates a loss that has temperature component. In this case,
this change is a function of Eckert number, Ec which is very small. The dissipation can be neglected
for small Ec number. Ec number is named after this author's adviser, E.R.G. Eckert. A discussion
about this effect will be presented in the dimensional analysis chapter. Some examples how to calculate
these losses will be resent later on.

    9It is only the same assumption discussed earlier.
   10It is assumed that the pressure in exit across section is uniform and equal surroundings pressure.

The governing equation (7.24) is reduced to

dt V 2 A + g z  dV - 2 Ue  dA = 0

The minus sign is because the flow is out of the control volume.
       Similarly to the previous chapter which the integral momentum will be replaced

by some kind of average. The terms under the time derivative can be divided into two
terms as

d     U2   + g z dV =  d U2                     dV +      d        g z  dV   (7.28)
dt V
        2              dt V 2                             dt V

The second integral (in the r.h.s) of equation (7.28) is

        d d h dV                                                             (7.29)
               g z  dV = g                                z dz dA
        dt V                                 dt A 0

Where h is the height or the distance from the surface to exit. The inside integral can
be evaluated as

                  h h2                                                       (7.30)

Substituting the results of equation (7.30) into equation (7.29) yields

The kinetic energy related to the averaged velocity with a correction
factor which depends on the geometry and the velocity profile. Further-
more, Even the averaged velocity is zero the kinetic energy is not zero
and another method should be used.

A discussion on the correction factor is presented to provide a better "averaged" velocity.
A comparison between the actual kinetic energy and the kinetic energy due to the
"averaged" velocity (to be called the averaged kinetic energy) provides a correction
coefficient. The first integral can be estimated by examining the velocity profile effects.
The averaged velocity is

                         1                     U dV                          (7.32)

                                             V

The total kinetic energy for the averaged velocity is

 Uave2 V =  1                  2                                          2  (7.33)

250                                           CHAPTER 7. ENERGY CONSERVATION

The general correction factor is the ratio of the above value to the actual kinetic energy
as

                                              2

                     CF =     U dV               =  (Uave)2 V           (7.34)
                                                          U 2 dV
                           V

Here, CF is the correction coefficient. Note, the inequality sign because the density
distribution for compressible fluid. The correction factor for a constant density fluid is

                                           2           2

                                                    V

This integral can be evaluated for any given velocity profile. A large family of velocity
profiles is laminar or parabolic (for one directional flow)11. For a pipe geometry, the

velocity is

              U   r     = U (r) = Umax 1 - r = 2 Uave 1 - r2   2      (7.36)

                 R

It can be noticed that the velocity is presented as a function of the reduced radius12.
The relationship between Umax to the averaged velocity, Uave is obtained by using
equation (7.32) which yields 1/2.

       Substituting equation (7.36) into equation (7.35) results

     Uave2 V               Uave2 V                     Uave2 V 3         (7.37)
               =                    2 2 = 4 Uave2  L R2 = 4

     V               V                                    3

The correction factor for many other velocity profiles and other geometries can be
smaller or larger than this value. For circular shape, a good guess number is about
1.1. In this case, for simplicity reason, it is assumed that the averaged velocity indeed
represent the energy in the tank or container. Calculations according to this point can
improve the accurately based on the above discussion.

         The difference between the "averaged momentum" velocity and the "av-
         eraged kinetic" velocity is also due to the fact that energy is added for
         different directions while in the momentum case, different directions can-
         cel each other out.

   11Laminar flow is not necessarily implies that the flow velocity profile is parabolic. The flow is
parabolic only when the flow is driven by pressure or gravity. More about this issue in the Differential
Analysis Chapter.

   12The advantage is described in the Dimensional Analysis Chapter.

The unsteady state term then obtains the form

                                                                          V

The relationship between the boundary velocity to the height (by definition) is

                                                        dh                       (7.39)
                                                 Ub = dt
Therefore, the velocity in the z direction13 is

                     dh                                                          (7.40)

It can be noticed that f (G) is a weak function of the height inverse. Analytical solution
of the governing equation is possible including this effect of the height. However, the
mathematical complication are enormous14 and this effect is assumed negligible and the
function to be constant.

concept.

   14The solution, not the derivation, is about one page. It must be remembered that is effect extremely
important in the later stages of the emptying of the tank. But in the same vain, some other effects
have to be taken into account which were neglected in construction of this model such as upper surface
shape.

Defining a new tank emptying parameter, Te, as

                                  Te =          A2                    (7.53)
                                            f (G) Ae

This parameter represents the characteristics of the tank which controls the emptying
process. Dividing equation (7.52) by f (G)2 and using this parameter, equation (7.52)

after minor rearrangement transformed to

       d2h g Ae2                            1 dh 2                    (7.54)

       dt Te A                                  dt

The solution can either of these equations16

                                        dh

    - (k1 Te - 2 k1) eln(h) T e + 2 g h2 = t + k2                     (7.55)
                       h (T e - 2) f (G)

or

                                        dh

       (k1 Te - 2 k1) eln(h) T e + 2 g h2 = t + k2                    (7.56)
                h (T e - 2) f (G)

 The solution with the positive solution has no physical meaning because the height
cannot increase with time. Thus define function of the height as

                                                             dh

    f (h) = -                     (k1 Te - 2 k1) eln(h) T e + 2 g h2  (7.57)
                                           h (T e - 2) f (G)

The initial condition for this case are: one the height initial is

                                  h(0) = h0                           (7.58)

The initial boundary velocity is

                                        dh                            (7.59)
                                            =0

                                        dt

This condition pose a physical limitation17 which will be ignored. The first condition
yields

                                  k2 = -f (h0)                        (7.60)

   16A discussion about this equation appear in the mathematical appendix.
   17For the initial condition speed of sound has to be taken into account. Thus for a very short time,
the information about opening of the valve did not reached to the surface. This information travel
in characteristic sound speed which is over 1000 m/sec. However, if this phenomenon is ignored this
solution is correct.

The second condition provides

        dh                     (k1 Te - 2 k1) eln(h0) T e + 2 g h02              (7.61)
            =0=                         h0 (T e - 2) f (G)

        dt

The complication of the above solution suggest a simplification in which

                                    d2h       g Ae2                              (7.62)
                                    dt2 << Te A2

which reduces equation (7.54) into

           g Ae2                         1 dh 2                                  (7.63)

           Te A                            dt

While equation (7.63) is still non linear equation, the non linear element can be removed
by taking negative branch (height reduction) of the equation as

                               dh 2            2gh                               (7.64)
                                      =
                               dt                      2
                                                 A
                                         -1 + Ae

It can be noticed that Te "disappeared" from the equation. And taking the "positive"

branch

                               dh                                                (7.65)

The nature of first order Ordinary Differential Equation that they allow only one initial
condition. This initial condition is the initial height of the liquid. The initial velocity
field was eliminated by the approximation (remove the acceleration term). Thus it is
assumed that the initial velocity is not relevant at the core of the process at hand. It is
correct only for large ratio of h/r and the error became very substantial for small value
of h/r.

       This analysis has several drawbacks which limits the accuracy of the calculations.

Yet, this analysis demonstrates the usefulness of the integral analysis to provide a
reasonable solution. This analysis can be improved by experimental investigating the
phenomenon. The experimental coefficient can be added to account for the dissipation
and other effects such

7.2 Limitation of Integral Approach

Some of accuracy issues to enhance the quality and improvements of the integral method
were suggested in the analysis of the emptying tank. There are problems that the integral
methods even with these enhancements simply cannot tackle.

       The improvements to the integral methods are the corrections to the estimates
of the energy or other quantities in the conservation equations. In the calculations
of the exit velocity of a tank, two such corrections were presented. The first type
is the prediction of the velocities profile (or the concentration profile). The second
type of corrections is the understanding that averaged of the total field is different
from the averaged of different zooms. In the case of the tank, the averaged velocity

   18Evangelista Torricelli (October 15, 1608 October 25, 1647) was an Italian physicist and mathe-
matician. He derived this equation based on similar principle to Bernoulli equation (which later leads to
Bernoulli's equation). Today the exact reference to his work is lost and only "sketches" of his lecture
elude work. He was student (not formal) and follower of Galileo Galilei. It seems that Torricelli was an
honest man who gave to others and he died at young age of 39 while in his prime.
256                                            CHAPTER 7. ENERGY CONSERVATION

in x direction is zero yet the averaged velocity in the two zooms (two halves) is not

zero. In fact, the averaged energy in the x direction contributes or effects the energy

equation. The accuracy issues that integral methods intrinsically suffers from no ability

to exact flow field and thus lost the accuracy as was discussed in the example. The

integral method does not handle the problems such as the free surface with reasonable

accuracy. Furthermore, the knowledge of whether the flow is laminar or turbulent (later

on this issue) has to come from different techniques. Hence the prediction can skew

the actual predictions.

       In the analysis of the tank it was

assumed that the dissipation can be ig-        air                     D

nored. In cases that dissipation play major         H  equilibrioum    air
role, the integral does not provide a suf-
ficient tool to analyze the issue at hand.             level

                                                              H

For example, the analysis of the oscillating           lowest level
manometer cannot be carried by the inte-               for the liquid

gral methods. A liquid in manometer is

disturbed from a rest by a distance of H0.

The description H(t) as a function of time

requires exact knowledge of the velocity

field. Additionally, the integral methods is

too crude to handle issues of free interface.  Fig. 7.5 - Flow in an oscillating manometer.
These problem were minor for the empty-

ing the tank but for the oscillating manometer it is the core of the problem. Hence

different techniques are required.

       The discussion on the limitations was not provided to discard usage of this method

but rather to provide a guidance of use with caution. The integral method is a powerful

and yet simple method but has has to be used with the limitations of the method in

mind.

7.3 Approximation of Energy Equation

The emptying the tank problem was complicated even with all the simplifications that
were carried. Engineers in order to reduce the work further simplify the energy equation.
It turn out that these simplifications can provide reasonable results and key understand-
ing of the physical phenomena and yet with less work, the problems can be solved. The
following sections provides further explanation.

7.3.1 Energy Equation in Steady State

The steady state situation provides several ways to reduce the complexity. The time
derivative term can be eliminated since the time derivative is zero. The acceleration
term must be eliminated for the obvious reason. Hence the energy equation is reduced

                                                             2

If the flow is uniform or can be estimated as uniform, equation (7.72) is reduced to

    Steady State Equation & uniform

    Q - W shear - W shaft =                                     U2  Urn Aout-          (7.73)

It can be noticed that last term in equation (7.73) for non-deformable control volume
does not vanished. The reason is that while the velocity is constant, the pressure is dif-
ferent. For a stationary fix control volume the energy equation, under this simplification

Dividing equation the mass flow rate provides

7.3.2 Energy Equation in Frictionless Flow and Steady State

In cases where the flow can be estimated without friction or where a quick solution is
needed the friction and other losses are illuminated from the calculations. This imaginary
fluid reduces the amount of work in the calculations and Ideal Flow Chapter is dedicated
in this book. The second low is the core of "no losses" and can be employed when
calculations of this sort information is needed. Equation (2.21) which can be written as

                             dqrev = T ds = dEu + P dv                                 (7.76)

Using the multiplication rule change equation (7.76)

258                                        CHAPTER 7. ENERGY CONSERVATION
integrating equation (7.77) yields
                                                            P                             (7.78)

7.4 Energy Equation in Accelerated System

In the discussion so far, it was assumed that the control volume is at rest. The only
acceptation to the above statement, is the gravity that was compensated by the gravity
potential. In building the gravity potential it was assumed that the gravity is a conserva-
tive force. It was pointed earlier in this book that accelerated forces can be translated to
potential force. In many cases, the control volume is moving in accelerated coordinates.
These accelerations will be translated to potential energy.

       The accelerations are referring to two kinds of acceleration, linear and rotational.
There is no conceptional difference between these two accelerations. However, the
mathematical treatment is somewhat different which is the reason for the separation.
General Acceleration can be broken into a linear acceleration and a rotating acceleration.

7.4.1 Energy in Linear Acceleration Coordinate

The potential is defined as

                                                   2              (7.88)

                             P.E. = - F  d

                                                  ref

In Chapter 3 a discussion about gravitational energy potential was presented. For
example, for the gravity force is

                                      GM m                        (7.89)
                             F = - r2

Where G is the gravity coefficient and M is the mass of the Earth. r and m are the
distance and mass respectively. The gravity potential is then

                                                   r GM m         (7.90)
                              P Egravity = - - r2 dr

The reference was set to infinity. The gravity force for fluid element in small distance
then is g dz dm. The work this element moving from point 1 to point 2 is

                                                       2          (7.91)

                                        g dz dm = g (z2 - z1) dm

                                                     1

The total work or potential is the integral over the whole mass.

7.4.2 Linear Accelerated System

The acceleration can be employed in similar fashion as the gravity force. The linear
acceleration "creates" a conservative force of constant force and direction. The "po-
tential" of moving the mass in the field provides the energy. The Force due to the
acceleration of the field can be broken into three coordinates. Thus, the element of the
potential is

                             d P Ea = a  d dm                    (7.92)

The total potential for element material

             (1)

     P Ea =       a  d dm = (ax (x1 - x0) ay (y1 - y0) az (z1 - z0)) dm  (7.93)

             (0)

At the origin (of the coordinates) x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0. Using this trick the notion
of the ax (x1 - x0) can be replaced by ax x. The same can be done for the other two
coordinates. The potential of unit material is

                     P Eatotal =       (ax x + ay y + az z)  dV           (7.94)

                                  sys

The change of the potential with time is

                  D               D                                       (7.95)
                  Dt P Eatotal = Dt sys (ax x + ay y + az z) dm

Equation can be added to the energy equation as

     Q - W = D                      U2                                    (7.96)

volume as

7.4.3 Energy Equation in Rotating Coordinate System

The coordinate system rotating around fix axes creates a similar conservative potential

as a linear system. There are two kinds of acceleration due to this rotation; one is the

centrifugal and one the Coriolis force. To understand it better, consider a particle which

moves with the our rotating system. The forces acting on particles are

                             centrifugal          

                                          Coriolis

                             F =   r r^ + 2 U   dm

The work or the potential then is                                         (7.99)
                                 P E = 2 r r^ + 2 U    d dm
7.4. ENERGY EQUATION IN ACCELERATED SYSTEM                                         261
The cylindrical coordinate are                                                 (7.100)

                                       d = drr^ + r d ^ + dz k^

where r^, ^, and k^ are units vector in the coordinates r,  and z respectively. The
potential is then

          P E = 2 r r^ + 2 U    drr^ + r d ^ + dz k^ dm                      (7.101)

The first term results in 2 r2 (see for explanation in the appendix 765 for vector
explanation). The cross product is zero of

               U 利U =U 利 = 0

because the first multiplication is perpendicular to the last multiplication. The second
part is

                   (2 U  )  d dm                                             (7.102)

This multiplication does not vanish with the exception of the direction of U . However,
the most important direction is the direction of the velocity. This multiplication creates
lines (surfaces ) of constant values. From a physical point of view, the flux of this
property is important only in the direction of the velocity. Hence, this term canceled
and does not contribute to the potential.

       The net change of the potential energy due to the centrifugal motion is

P Ecentrifugal = - 2 2 r2 dr dm = 2 r12 - r22 dm                               (7.103)
                                                                 2
                   1

Inserting the potential energy due to the centrifugal forces into the energy equation
yields

7.4.4 Simplified Energy Equation in Accelerated Coordinate

7.4.4.1 Energy Equation in Accelerated Coordinate with Uniform Flow

One of the way to simplify the general equation (7.104) is to assume uniform flow. In
that case the time derivative term vanishes and equation (7.104) can be written as

                              Energy Equation in steady state

     Q - W =                  U2                               2 r2

                                                                     cv

                                                                               (7.105)

Further simplification of equation (7.105) by assuming uniform flow for which

Q - W =       U2 2 r2                                          U rn  dA
         h + 2 + ax x + ay y + (az + g) - z 2

                                                                             + P U bn dA (7.106)

                                                                                                                    cv

Note that the acceleration also have to be averaged. The correction factors have to
introduced into the equation to account for the energy averaged verse to averaged
velocity (mass averaged). These factor make this equation with larger error and thus
less effective tool in the engineering calculation.

7.4.5 Energy Losses in Incompressible Flow

In the previous sections discussion, it was assumed that there are no energy loss. How-
ever, these losses are very important for many real world application. And these losses
have practical importance and have to be considered in engineering system. Hence
writing equation (7.15) when the energy and the internal energy as a separate identity
as

         W shaft = d              U2        dV +
                      dt V            +gz

Equation (7.107) sometimes written as

W shaft = d        U2                   dV +
             dt V      +gz

     P U2
A  + 2 A + g z Urn  dA + P UbndA + energy loss

       Equation can be further simplified under assumption of uniform flow and steady
state as

w shaft =  P U2          -             P U2            + energy loss  (7.109)
              + +gz                       + +gz

           2                           2

Equation (7.109) suggests that term h + 2 U2 + g z has a special meaning (because it
remained constant under certain conditions). This term, as will be shown, has to be con-
stant for frictionless flow without any addition and loss of energy. This term represents
the "potential energy." The loss is the combination of the internal energy/enthalpy
with heat transfer. For example, fluid flow in a pipe has resistance and energy dissipa-
tion. The dissipation is lost energy that is transferred to the surroundings. The loss is
normally is a strong function of the velocity square, U 2/2. There are several categories
of the loss which referred as minor loss (which are not minor), and duct losses. These
losses will be tabulated later on.

       If the energy loss is negligible and the shaft work vanished or does not exist
equation (7.109) reduces to simple Bernoulli's equation.

Example 7.1: Flow in Unsteady Pipe                  Level: Intermediate

Consider a flow in a long straight pipe. Initially the flow is at a rest. At time,

     energy loss is f . Furthermore assume

     Solution

     The mass balance on the liquid in the pipe results in

         =0               =0

     0=             dV +  UbndA +  UrndA = &A Uin = &A Uexit                           (7.1.a)

     There is no change in the liquid mass inside pipe and therefore the time derivative is
     zero (the same mass resides in the pipe at all time). The boundaries do not move and
     the second term is zero. Thus, the flow in and out are equal because the density is
     identical. Furthermore, the velocity is identical because the cross area is same.
     It can be noticed that for the energy balance on the pipe, the time derivative can enter
     the integral because the control volume has fixed boundaries. Hence,

                   =0        =0

     The boundaries shear work vanishes because the same arguments present before (the
     work, where velocity is zero, is zero. In the locations where the velocity does not
     vanished, such as in and out, the work is zero because shear stress are perpendicular
     to the velocity).
     There is no shaft work and this term vanishes as well. The first term on the right
     hand side (with a constant density) is

     where L is the pipe length, r is the pipe radius, U averaged velocity.

     In this analysis, it is assumed that the pipe is perpendicular to the gravity line and

     thus the gravity is constant. The gravity in the first term and all other terms, related

     to the pipe, vanish again because the value of z is constant. Also, as can be noticed

     from equation (7.1.a), the velocity is identical (in and out). Hence the second term

Equation (7.1.d) can be further simplified (since the area and averaged velocity are
constant, additionally notice that U = Urn) as

                Eu + P           UrndA = P U A +  Eu Urn dA                                (7.1.e)

The third term vanishes because the boundaries velocities are zero and therefore

                                                P UbndA = 0                                (7.1.f )

The terms on the LHS (left hand side) can be combined. It common to assume (to

view) that these terms are representing the energy loss and are a strong function of

velocity square19. Thus, equation (7.1.h) can be written as

                       U2              2 dU                                                (7.1.i)

     The solution is an exponentially approaching the steady state solution. In steady state
     the flow equation (7.1.j) reduced to a simple linear equation. The solution of the
     linear equation and the steady state solution of the differential equation are the same.

     Another note, in reality the resistance, K, is not constant but rather a strong function
     of velocity (and other parameters such as temperature20, velocity range, velocity regime
     and etc.). This function will be discussed in a greater extent later on. Additionally, it
     should be noted that if momentum balance was used a similar solution (but not the
     same) was obtained (why? hint the difference of the losses accounted for).

       The following example combined the above discussion in the text with the above
example (7.1).

     Example 7.2: Evacting Large Tank                          Level: Intermediate

     A large cylindrical tank with a diameter, D, contains liquid to height, h. A long

     pipe is connected to a tank from which the liquid is emptied. To analysis this situation,

     consider that the tank has a constant                     D        Vair
     pressure above liquid (actually a bet-                        1

     mass.). The pipe is exposed to the                                      Patmos

   20The shear work inside the liquid refers to molecular work (one molecule work on the other molecule).

This shear work can be viewed also as one control volume work on the adjoined control volume.

       This problem can split into two D

tank and one of the liquid in pipe. Analy-                    3

in tank is depicted in Figure 7.7.

The effect of the energy change in air side was neglected. The effect is negligible in

most cases because air mass is small with exception the "spring" effect (expansion/-

compression effects). The mass conservation reads

                        =0

                         dV +  UbndA +  UrndA = 0                              (7.2.a)

The first term vanishes and the second and third terms remain and thus equation

(7.2.a) reduces to

It can be noticed that U3 = dh/dt and D = 2 R and d = 2 r when the lower case

refers to the pipe and the upper case referred to the tank. Equation (7.2.b) simply

can be written when the area ratio is used (to be changed later if needed) as

                    U1 Apipe = dh Atank = U1 =                R 2 dh           (7.2.c)

        The boundaries shear work and the shaft work are assumed to be vanished in
the tank. Therefore, the energy conservation in the tank reduces to

              =0            =0

The equations (7.2.m) and (7.2.i) provide the frame in which the liquid velocity in

tank and pipe have to be solved. In fact, it can be noticed that the liquid velocity in

the tank is related to the height and the liquid velocity in the pipe. Thus, there is only

one equation with one unknown. The relationship between the height was obtained by

substituting equation (7.2.c) in equation (7.2.m). The equations (7.2.m) and (7.2.i)

have two unknowns (dh/dt and P1) which are sufficient to solve the problem. It can

be noticed that two initial conditions are required to solve the problem.

The initial conditions are that zero initial velocity in the tank and pipe. Additionally,

the height of liquid is at prescript point as

                            h(0) = h0                                            (7.2.o)

7.6 Qualitative Questions

   1. A liquid flows in and out from a long pipe with uniform cross section as single
       phase. Assume that the liquid is slightly compressible. That is the liquid has a
       constant bulk modulus, BT . What is the direction of the heat from the pipe or
       in to the pipe. Explain why the direction based on physical reasoning. What kind
       of internal work the liquid performed. Would happen when the liquid velocity is
       very large? What it will be still correct.

   2. A different liquid flows in the same pipe. If the liquid is compressible what is the
       direction of the heat to keep the flow isothermal?

   3. A tank is full of incompressible liquid. A certain point the tank is punctured
       and the liquid flows out. To keep the tank at uniform temperature what is the
       direction of the heat (from the tank or to the tank)?

     Consider steady, incompressible and irrotational flow through a reducer in a

     horizontal pipe where the diameter is reduced from 20 [cm] to 10 [cm]. The

     pressure in the 20 cm pipe just upstream of the reducer is 150 [kPa]. The
     fluid has a vapor pressure of [50] kP a and a specific weight of 5 [kN/m3].
     Neglecting frictional effects, the maximum discharge (in [m3/s]) that can pass

     through the reducer without causing cavitation is

     With given pressure values and velocity ratio (Eq. (7.3.b)) as

                            P1 - P2 = U22 - U22 = 3 U22

    (density = 1000 [kg/m3]) in the two

    The velocity of air in [m/s] is

               (a) 116.18
               (c) 18.22

Solution

Since this test is for mechanical engineers that compressibility is not considered. Notice
that if this question was given in the aerospace engineering it would more complicated.
Thus the fact that fluid is air is irreverent for the GATE exam (for mechanical engi-
neers). Utilizing the standard Bernoulli's equation reads

                      U12 - U22 = P2 - P1                            (7.4.a)
                      2g                     air g

Notice that the density of air was used. The pressure difference is

                      P2 - P1 = water g h                            (7.4.b)

Again notice the water density was used in this case. The velocity, U1 can be funded

when U2 = 0 as

                      U1 =  2 water g h                              (7.4.c)
                                air

As

                U1 =  2  1000  9.81  0.01 = 12.8[m/s]             (7.4.d)
                                   1.2

The air speed of sound at room temperature is about 330 [m/s]. Hence the Mach
number is very small. The compressibility is not strong factor in this case.
The answer is (c).

                         1 h1 + 2 h2 + 3 h3

     Solution

     Take a stream line that goes from somewhere at nozzle level to the exit of the nozzle.
     On this line Gauge pressure at the nozzle level is

                     P = g (1 h1 + 2 h2 + 3 h3)                        (7.5.a)

     This pressure difference has be transferred into velocity which can be estimated by
     using Bernoulli's equation. It can assume the far from the valve there is no velocity or
     it Insignificant. On the other hand, when stream leaving the valve is exposed to the
     atmosphere hence zero pressure (relatively speaking).

                                    Uexit 2 = P                        (7.5.b)
                                     2 g 3 g

     Hence

                              Uexit =           2 g P                  (7.5.c)
                                                  3 g

     The pressure difference was found in Eq. (7.5.a) and it can be used in Eq. (7.5.c) to
     yield

                     Uexit =  2 g eg (1 h1 + 2 h2 + 3 h3)              (7.5.d)
                                            3 eg

     From this point it is only small manipulation in which 3 h3 is pull out from the

     parenthesis as

                     Uexit =  2g                1 h1 + 2 h2 + 1        (7.5.e)
                                 3 h3           3 h3 3 h3

The answer is (a).                                 End of Ex. 7.5

Perhaps in this case the intuition can help. In this exam (GATE) where time is

premium, hence Option (b) has to eliminated immediately as the relationship cannot

be linear (h1 and h2) due to the density cannot have the same effect. Option (c)
is similar argument has to eliminated. The expectation that if h1 = 0 and h2 = 0
then the standard solution should appear. However, option (d) does not provide it

while option (a) does provide this solution. Based on these argument one can arrive

to solution without actually solving the problem.

      8 Differential Analysis

8.1 Introduction

The integral analysis has a limited accuracy, which leads to a different approach of dif-
ferential analysis. The differential analysis allows the flow field investigation in greater
detail. In differential analysis, the emphasis is on infinitesimal scale and thus the analysis
provides better accuracy1. This analysis leads to partial differential equations which are
referred to as the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are named after Claude-
Louis Navier-Marie and George Gabriel Stokes. Like many equations they were indepen-
dently derived by several people. First these equations were derived by Claude-Louis-
Marie Navier as it is known in 1827. As usual Simeon-Denis Poisson independently,
as he done to many other equations or conditions, derived these equations in 1831 for
the same arguments as Navier. The foundations for their arguments or motivations are
based on a molecular view of how stresses are exerted between fluid layers. Barr큖 de
Saint Venant (1843) and George Gabriel Stokes (1845) derived these equation based
on the relationship between stress and rate-of-strain (this approach is presented in this
book).

       Navier-Stokes equations are non-linear and there are more than one possible
solution in many cases (if not most cases) e.g. the solution is not unique. A discussion
about the "regular" solution is present and a brief discussion about limitations when
the solution is applicable. Later in the Chapters on Real Fluid and Turbulence, with
a presentation of the "non-regular" solutions will be presented with the associated
issues of stability. However even for the "regular" solution the mathematics is very
complex. One of the approaches is to reduce the equations by eliminating the viscosity

    1Which can be view as complementary analysis to the integral analysis.

equations (Euler Equations) which will be discussed in the next chapter. The concepts

is ignored, and will be presented in the Ideal Flow chapter. It has to be pointed
out that the Add Mass and Add Force appear regardless to the viscosity. Historically,
complexity of the equations, on one hand, leads to approximations and consequently to
the ideal flow approximation (equations) and on the other hand experimental solutions
of Navier-Stokes equations. The connection between these two ideas or fields was done
via introduction of the boundary layer theory by Prandtl which will be discussed as well.

       Even for simple situations, there are cases when complying with the boundary
conditions leads to a discontinuity (shock or choked flow). These equations cannot
satisfy the boundary conditions in other cases and in way the fluid pushes the boundary
condition(s) further downstream (choked flow). These issues are discussed in Open
Channel Flow and Compressible Flow chapters. Sometimes, the boundary conditions
create instability which alters the boundary conditions itself which is known as Interfacial
instability. The choked flow is associated with a single phase flow (even the double
choked flow) while the Interfacial instability associated with the Multi-Phase flow. This
phenomenon is presented in Multi-phase chapter and briefly discussed in this chapter.

ing Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT), the following can be written

     Dt V dV = dt V A dV + Urn  dA = 0

For a constant control volume, the derivative can enter into the integral (see also for
the divergence theorem in the appendix A.1.2) on the right hand side and hence

                       dt d dV          Urn  dA = 0                                                (8.3)

The first term in equation (8.3) for the infinitesimal volume is expressed, neglecting
higher order derivatives, as

                               dV                 0

The second term in the LHS of equation (8.2) is expressed2 as

The difference between point x and x + dx can be obtained by developing Taylor series
as

                     ( Ux)|x+dx = ( Ux)|x +  ( Ux) dx                             (8.6)
                                                          x x

The same can be said for the y and z coordinates. It also can be noticed that, for
example, the operation, in the x coordinate, produces additional dx thus a infinitesimal
volume element dV is obtained for all directions. The combination can be divided by
dx dy dz and simplified by using the definition of the partial derivative in the regular
process to be

                     Urn  dA = - ( Ux) + ( Uy) + ( Uz)                            (8.7)

       Combining the first term with the second term results in the continuity equation

The same equation can be derived in cylindrical coordinates. The net mass change, as
depicted in Figure 8.2, in the control volume is

                                               dv                                         (8.9)

                               
                      d m = dr dz r d

                               t

The net mass flow out or in the r direction has an additional term which is the area
change compared to the Cartesian coordinates. This change creates a different differ-
ential equation with additional complications. The change is

     flux in r     = d dz r  Ur - r  Ur +  Ur r dr                                        (8.10)
     direction                                              r

The net flux in the r direction is then

                net flux in the = d dz  Ur r dr                                           (8.11)
                r direction                              r

Note3 that the r is still inside the derivative since it is a function of r, e.g. the change
of r with r. In a similar fashion, the net flux in the z coordinate be written as

                           net flux in z direction = r d dr  ( Uz) dz                     (8.12)
                                                                       z

The net change in the  direction is then

          net flux in  direction = dr dz  U d                                             (8.13)
                                                  

    3The mass flow is  Ur r d dz at r point. Expansion to Taylor serious  Ur r d dz|r+dr is obtained
by the regular procedure. The mass flow at r + dr is  Ur r d dz|r + d/dr ( Ur r d dz) dr +    .
Hence, the r is "trapped" in the derivative.

Combining equations (8.11)-(8.13) and dividing by infinitesimal control volume,

by infinitesimal control volume, dr r d dz yields

The continuity equations (8.8), (8.15) and (8.16) can be expressed in different coor-
dinates. It can be noticed that the second part of these equations is the divergence
(see the Appendix A.1.2 page 768). Hence, the continuity equation can be written in a
general vector form as

       The mass equation can be written in index notation for Cartesian coordinates.
The index notation really does not add much to the scientific understanding. However,
this writing reduce the amount of writing and potentially can help the thinking about
the problem or situation in more conceptional way. The mass equation (see in the
appendix for more information on the index notation) written as

                         +  ( U )i = 0                (8.18)
                        t  xi

Where i is is of the i, j, and k4. Compare to equation (8.8). Again remember that the
meaning of repeated index is summation.

                                                           End Advance material

       The use of these equations is normally combined with other equations (momentum
and or energy equations). There are very few cases where this equation is used on its
own merit. For academic purposes, several examples are constructed here.

    4notice the irony the second i is the direction and first i is for any one of direction x(i), y(j), and
z(k).

Example 8.1: Liquid Layer                                     Level: Basic

A layer of liquid has an initial height           T1      1
of H0 with an uniform temperature of                  T0                 H0(t)
T0. At time, t0, the upper surface is

8.3). Assume that the actual temper-                      0
ature is exponentially approaches to a
linear temperature profile as depicted
in Figure 8.3. The density is a function
of the temperature according to

Assume that the velocity is only a function of the y coordinate. Calculates the
velocity of the liquid. Assume that the velocity at the lower boundary is zero at
all times. Neglect the mutual dependency of the temperature and the height.

Solution

The situation is unsteady state thus the unsteady state and one dimensional continuity
equation has to be used which is

                              +  (Uy) = 0                                       (8.1.b)
                             t            y

with the boundary condition of zero velocity at the lower surface Uy(y = 0) = 0. The
expression that connects the temperature with the space for the final temperature as

                             T - T0 =  H0 - y                                   (8.1.c)
                             T1 - T0          H0

The exponential decay is  1 - e- t and thus the combination (with equation (8.1.a))
is
                              - 0 =  H0 - y 1 - e- t
                             1 - 0        H0                                    (8.1.d)

Equation (8.1.d) relates the temperature with the time and the location was given in
the question (it is not the solution of any model). It can be noticed that the height
H0 is a function of time. For this question, it is treated as a constant. Substituting
the density, , as a function of time into the governing equation (8.1.b) results in

                                               Uy

                                                                             End of Ex. 8.1
Equation (8.1.e) is first order ODE with the boundary condition Uy(y = 0) = 0 which
can be arranged as

 Uy  H H0-y 0 1 - e- t                 = -             H0 - y    e- t       (8.1.f )
               y                                         H0

Uy is a function of the time but not y. Equation (8.1.f) holds for any time and
thus, it can be treated for the solution of equation (8.1.f) as a constant5. Hence, the

integration with respect to y yields

Uy  H0 - y 1 - e- t              = -   2 H0 - y                  e- ty + c  (8.1.g)
         H0                              2 H0

Utilizing the boundary condition Uy(y = 0) = 0 yields

            Uy  H0 - y 1 - e- t  = -   2 H0 - y e- t (y - 1)                (8.1.h)
                     H0                  2 H0

or the velocity is

Uy =                     2 H0 - y         e- t                              (8.1.i)
                        2 (H0 - y)     (1 - e- t) (1 - y)

It can be noticed that indeed the velocity is a function of the time and space y.

8.2.2 Simplified Continuity Equation

A simplified equation can be obtained for a steady state in which the transient term is
eliminated as (in a vector form)

If the fluid is incompressible then the governing equation is a volume conservation as

                                 톃 = 0                                            (8.20)

Note that this equation appropriate only for a single phase case.

     State your assumptions.

     Solution

     This problem is somewhat similar to Example 8.1a however it can be considered as

     steady state. At any point the governing equation in coordinate system that moving

     with the belt is           ( Ux) +  ( Uy) = 0

                               x                    y                        (8.2.b)

     At first, it can be assumed that the material moves with the belt in the x direction in
     the same velocity. This assumption is consistent with the first solution (no stability
     issues). If the frame of reference was moving with the belt then there is only velocity
     component in the y directionb. Hence equation (8.2.b) can be written as

                               Ux  = -  ( Uy)                                (8.2.c)
                               x                    y

     Where Ux is the belt velocity.
     See the resembles to equation (8.1.b). The solution is similar to the previous Example
     8.1 for a general function T = F (x).

                               =  F (x) (0 - )                               (8.2.d)
                              x Ux x

     Substituting this relationship in equation (8.2.d) into the governing equation results

     in                       Uy  =  F (x) (0 - )

                              y Ux x                                         (8.2.e)

     The density is expressed by equation (8.2.a) and thus

                            Uy =  F (x) (0 - ) y + c                         (8.2.f )
                                     Ux x

     Notice that  could "come" out of the derivative (why?) and move into the RHS.
     Applying the boundary condition Uy(t = 0) = 0 results in

                            Uy =  F (x) (0 - ) y                             (8.2.g)

    aThe presentation of one dimension time dependent problem to two dimensions problems

can be traced to heat and mass transfer problems. One of the early pioneers who suggest this

idea is Higbie which Higbie's equation named after him. Higbie's idea which was rejected by

the scientific establishment. He spend the rest of his life to proof it and ending in a suicide.

On personal note, this author Master thesis is extension Higbie's equation.
    bIn reality this assumption is correct only in a certain range. However, the discussion about

this point is beyond the scope of this section.

Example 8.3: Velocity Field                                        Level: Simple

The velocity in a two dimensional field is assumed to be in a steady state.
Assume that the density is constant and calculate the vertical velocity (y com-
ponent) for the following x velocity component.

                              Ux = a x2 + b y2                     (8.3.a)

Next, assume the density is also a function of the location in the form of

                               = m ex+y                            (8.3.b)

Where m is constant. Calculate the velocity field in this case.

Solution

The flow field must comply with the mass conservation (8.20) thus

                              2 a x + Uy = 0                       (8.3.c)
                                         y

Equation (8.3.c) is an ODE with constant coefficients. It can be noted that x should
be treated as a constant parameter for the y coordinate integration. Thus,

             Uy = - 2 a x + f (x) = -2 x y + f (x)                 (8.3.d)

The integration constant in this case is not really a constant but rather an arbitrary
function of x. Notice the symmetry of the situation. The velocity, Ux has also arbitrary
function in the y component.
For the second part equation (8.19) is applicable and used as

              a x2 + b y2     m ex+y  +   Uy m ex+y   =0           (8.3.e)
                           x
                                                y

Taking the derivative of the first term while moving the second part to the other side

results in

             a 2 x + x2 + b y2 ex+y = - ex+y        Uy + Uy        (8.3.f )
                                a                   y

The exponent can be canceled to further simplify the equation (8.3.f) and switching

sides to be

              Uy + Uy = -a 2 x + x2 + b y2                         (8.3.g)
             y                                     a

                                                                                  End of Ex. 8.3
     Equation (8.3.g) is a first order ODE that can be solved by combination of the homo-

     geneous solution with the private solution (see for an explanation in the Appendix).

     The homogeneous equation is

                                        Uy + Uy = 0                   (8.3.h)
                                        y

     The solution for (8.3.h) is Uy = c e-y (see for an explanation in the appendix). The
     private solution is

                         Uy|private = -b y2 - 2 y + 2 - a x2 - 2 a x  (8.3.i)

     The total solution is

               Uy = c e-y + -b y2 - 2 y + 2 - a x2 - 2 a x            (8.3.j)

       Example 8.4: Velocity Field Coexistence                        Level: Basic
     Can the following velocities co-exist

        Ux = (x t)2 z       Uy = (x t) + (y t) + (z t)    Uz = (x t) + (y t) + (z t)
                         Is the flow is incompressible?                              (8.4.a)

     condition?                                          Is the flow in a steady state

     Solution

     Whether the solution is in a steady state or not can be observed from whether the
     velocity contains time component. Thus, this flow field is not steady state since it con-
     tains time component. This continuity equation is checked if the flow incompressible
     (constant density). The derivative of each component are

                            Ux = t2 z  Uy = t            Uz = t       (8.4.b)
                            x          y                 z            (8.4.c)

     Hence the gradient or the combination of these derivatives is

                                       U = t2 z + 2 t

     The divergence isn't zero thus this flow, if it exist, must be compressible flow. This
     flow can exist only for a limit time since over time the divergence is unbounded (a
     source must exist).

     Example 8.5: Mass with                                           Level: Basic

     Find the density as a function of the time for a given one dimensional flow with
     Ux = x e5  y (cos ( t)). The initial density is (t = 0) = 0.
8.2. MASS CONSERVATION                                                                       287
                                                                    continue Ex. 8.5
   Solution

This problem is one dimensional unsteady state and for a compressible substance.
Hence, the mass conservation is reduced only for one dimensional form as

                            +  (Ux ) = 0                                (8.5.a)
                           t          x

Mathematically speaking, this kind of presentation is possible. However physically
there are velocity components in y and z directions. In this problem, these physical
components are ignored for academic reasons. Equation (8.5.a) is first order partial
differential equation which can be converted to an ordinary differential equations when
the velocity component, Ux, is substituted. Using,

                        Ux = e5  y (cos ( t))                           (8.5.b)
                        x

Substituting equation (8.5.b) into equation (8.5.a) and noticing that the density, , is
a function of x results of

                  = - x e5  y (cos ( t)) -  e5  y (cos ( t))            (8.5.c)
                 t                              x

Equation (8.5.c) can be separated to yield

                    f (t)                       f (y)

                    1  = - x e5  y -  e5  y                             (8.5.d)

                    cos ( t) t                         x

A possible solution is when the left and the right hand sides are equal to a constant.
In that case the left hand side is

                               1  = c1                                  (8.5.e)
                           cos ( t) t

The solution of equation (8.5.e) is reduced to ODE and its solution is

                                          = c1 sin ( t) + c2            (8.5.f )
                                                     

The same can be done for the right hand side as

                         x e5  y +  e5  y = c1                          (8.5.g)
                                       x

The term e5  y is always positive, real value, and independent of y thus equation

(8.5.g) becomes

                                            c1                          (8.5.h)

Equation (8.5.h) is a constant coefficients first order ODE which its solution discussed

extensively in the appendix. The solution of (8.5.h) is given by

     which indicates that the solution is a complex number thus the constant, c3, must
     be zero and thus the constant, c1 vanishes as well and the solution contain only the

     Where the constant, c2, is an arbitrary function of the y coordinate.

8.3 Conservation of General Quantity

8.3.1 Generalization of Mathematical Approach for Derivations

In this section a general approach for the derivations for conservation of any quantity
e.g. scalar, vector or tensor, are presented. Suppose that the property  is under a
study which is a function of the time and location as (x, y, z, t). The total amount of
quantity that exist in arbitrary system is

                      =   dV                                                           (8.21)

                                sys

Where  is the total quantity of the system which has a volume V and a surface area
of A which is a function of time. A change with time is

                D D                                                                    (8.22)
                     =                 dV
                Dt Dt sys

Using RTT to change the system to a control volume (see equation (5.34)) yields

        D      dV =     d           dV +   U  dA                                      (8.23)

     Dt sys             dt cv                    A

The last term on the RHS can be converted using the divergence theorem (see the
appendix6 ) from a surface integral into a volume integral (alternatively, the volume

integral can be changed to the surface integral) as

                  U  dA =   (  U ) dV                                                (8.24)

             A                    V

Substituting equation (8.24) into equation (8.23) yields

     D         dV =  d              dV +   (  U ) dV                                  (8.25)

     Dt sys          dt cv                   cv

    6These integrals are related to RTT. Basically the divergence theorem relates the flow out (or) in
and the sum of the all the changes inside the control volume.
8.3. CONSERVATION OF GENERAL QUANTITY                                                                      289

Since the volume of the control volume remains independent of the time, the derivative
can enter into the integral and thus combining the two integrals on the RHS results in

                        D           dV =         d ( )        +   (  U ) dV                            (8.26)

                        Dt sys             cv dt

       The definition of equation (8.21) LHS can be changed to simply the derivative

Using equation (8.21) leads to

                                D                                                                       (8.29)

                                  Dt             t

Equation (8.29) can be rearranged as

                                                                                                        (8.30)

Equation (8.30) can be further rearranged so derivative of the density is equal the

divergence of velocity as

                                      substantial derivative

                                  1                           = -  U                                   (8.31)
                                   t + U   

Equation (8.31) relates the density rate of change or the volumetric change to the
velocity divergence of the flow field. The term in the bracket LHS is referred in the
literature as substantial derivative. The substantial derivative represents the change
rate of the density at a point which moves with the fluid.

       One of the important points is to find the fluid particles acceleration. A fluid
particle velocity is a function of the location and time. Therefore, it can be written that

     U (x, y, z, t) = Ux(x, y, x, t) i + Uy(x, y, z, t) j + Uz(x, y, z, t) k  (8.32)

Therefor the acceleration will be

                 DU = d Ux i + d Uy j + d Uz k                                (8.33)
                 Dt dt                       dt     dt

The velocity components are a function of four variables, (x, y, z, and t), and hence

                               =1            Ux        Uy            Uz

         D Ux =  Ux d t +  Ux d x +  Ux d y +  Ux d z                         (8.34)
         Dt      t d t x d t y d t z d t                                      (8.35)

The acceleration in the x can be written as

     D Ux =  Ux + Ux  Ux + Uy  Ux + Uz  Ux =  Ux + (U  ) Ux
     Dt  t       x                 y             z             t

The same can be developed to the other two coordinates which can be combined (in a
vector form) as

                               dU U                                           (8.36)
                                    = + (U  ) U

                               dt t

or in a more explicit form as

                                  local          convective
                               acceleration      acceleration

             dU U                            U U U                            (8.37)
                 =                 + U +U +U
             dt                t             x      y             z

The time derivative referred in the literature as the local acceleration which vanishes
when the flow is in a steady state. While the flow is in a steady state there is only
convective acceleration of the flow. The flow in a nozzle is an example to flow at
steady state but yet has acceleration which flow with a very low velocity can achieve a
supersonic flow.

8.4 Momentum Conservation

The relationship among the shear stress various components have to be established.
The stress is a relationship between the force and area it is acting on or force divided
by the area (division of vector by a vector). This division creates a tensor which the
physical meaning will be explained here (the mathematical explanation can be found in
8.4. MOMENTUM CONSERVATION                                    291

the mathematical appendix of the book). The area has a direction or orientation which
control the results of this division. So it can be written that

                                      = f (F , A)             (8.38)

It was shown that in a static case (or in better words, when the shear stresses are
absent) it was written

                                        = -P n                (8.39)

It also was shown that the pressure has to be continuous. However, these stresses
that act on every point and have three components on every surface and depend on
the surface orientation. A common approach is to collect the stress in a "standard"
orientation and then if needed the stresses can be reorientated to a new direction. The
transformation is available because the "standard" surface can be transformed using
trigonometrical functions. In Cartesian coordinates on surface in the x direction the
stresses are

                              (x) =    xx          xy     xz  (8.40)

where xx is the stress acting on surface x in the x direction, and xy is the stress
acting on surface x in the y direction, similarly for xz. The notation  (xi) is used

to denote the stresses on xi surface. It can be noticed that no mathematical symbols

are written between the components. The reason for this omission is that there is no
physical meaning for it7. Similar "vectors" exist for the y and z coordinates which can

be written in a matrix form

                                                       

                                      xx xy xz 
                                                       
                              =  yx            yy  yz         (8.41)
                                                       

                                       zx zy zz

Suppose that a straight angle tetrahedron                                         Z nnY
is under stress as shown in Figure 8.5. The                                    n n

area of the tetrahedron in the x direction and Az is the surface area of the tetrahedron
in the z direction. The opposing forces which acting on the slanted surface in the x
direction are

     Fx = An nn n  i - n  i - n  i                                  (8.43)

Where here , and n are the local unit coordinates on n surface the same can be

written in the x, and z directions. The transformation matrix is then

                                   

      Fx   n  i    톓 톓                                              (8.44)

     Fx  n톕        톕 톕

When the tetrahedron is shrunk to a point relationship of the stress on the two sides
can be expended by Taylor series and keeping the first derivative. If the first derivative
is neglected (tetrahedron is without acceleration) the two sides are related as

     -yxAy - xxAx - zxAz = An nn n  i - n  i - n  i                 (8.45)

The same can be done for y and z directions. The areas are related to each other through
angles. These relationships provide the transformation for the different orientations
which depends only angles of the orientations. This matrix is referred to as stress
tensor and as it can be observed has nine terms.

The Symmetry of the Stress Tensor

       A small liquid cubical has three possible rotation axes. Here only one will be dis-
cussed the same conclusions can be drown on the other direction. The cubical rotation
can involve two parts: one distortion and one rotation8. A finite angular distortion of
infinitesimal cube requires an infinite shear which required for infinite moment. Hence,
the rotation of the infinitesimal fluid cube can be viewed as it is done almost as a solid
body rotation. Balance of momentum around the z direction shown in Figure 8.6 is

                     d                                                 (8.46)
         Mz = Izz dt

Where Mz is the cubic moment around the cubic center and Izz9 is the moment of
inertia around that center. The momentum can be asserted by the shear stresses which
act on it. The shear stress at point x is xy. However, the shear stress at point x + dx
is

         xy|x+dx = xy + dxy dx dx                                      (8.47)

8For infinitesimal change the lines can be approximated as straight.
9See for the derivations in Example 3.9 for moment of inertia.

   10This point bother this author in the completeness of the proof. It can be ignored, but provided to
those who wonder why body forces can contribute to the torque while pressure, even though varied,
does not. This point is for self convincing since it deals with a "strange" and problematic "animals"
of integral of infinitesimal length.

The reason that this term is neglected because on the other face of the cubic contributes
an identical term but in the opposing direction (see Figure 8.7).

which means since that dx - 0 and dy - 0 that

This analysis can be done on the other two directions and hence the general conclusion
is that

                   GT + ij = ji                                          (8.54)

where i is one of x, y, z and the j is any of the other x, y, z11. For the case of GT = 0
the stress tensor becomes symmetrical. The gravity is a body force that is considered
in many kind of calculations and this force cause a change in symmetry of the stress
tensor. However, this change, for almost all practical purposes, can be neglected12. The
magnetic body forces on the other hand are significant and have to be included in the
calculations. If the body forces effect is neglected or do not exist in the problem then
regardless the coordinate system orientation

                   ij = ji (i = j)                                       (8.55)

   11The index notation is not the main mode of presentation in this book. However, since Potto
Project books are used extensively and numerous people asked to include this notation it was added. It
is believed that this notation should and can be used only after the physical meaning was "digested."

   12In the Dimensional Analysis a discussion about this effect hopefully will be presented.

Previously it was shown that equation (6.11) is equivalent to Newton second law for
fluids. Equation (6.11) is also applicable for the small infinitesimal cubic. One direction
of the vector equation will be derived for x Cartesian coordinate (see Figure 8.8). Later
Newton second law will be used and generalized. For surface forces that acting on the

       Equations (8.61) or (8.62) or (8.63) requires that the stress tensor be defined
in term of the velocity/deformation. The relationship between the stress tensor and
deformation depends on the classes of materials the stresses acts on. Additionally, the
deformation can be viewed as a function of the velocity field. As engineers do in general,
the simplest model is assumed which referred as the solid continuum model. In this
model the relationship between the (shear) stresses and rate of strains are assumed to be
linear. In solid material, the shear stress yields a fix amount of deformation. In contrast,
when applying the shear stress in fluids, the result is a continuous deformation. Further-
more, reduction of the shear stress does not return the material to its original state as
in solids. The similarity to solids the increase shear stress in fluids yields larger deforma-
tions. Thus this "solid" model is a linear relationship with three main assumptions:

a. There is no preference in the orientation             = ++

The rotation is the second movement that referred to a change in of the relative ori-

entation inside the control volume. The third change is the misconfiguration or control

volume (deformation). The deformation of the control volume has several components

(see the top of Figure 8.9). The shear stress is related to the change in angle of the

control volume lower left corner. The angle between x to the new location of the control

volume can be approximate for a small angle as

Normal Stress

       The normal stress, ii (where i is either ,x, y, z) appears in the shear matrix
diagonal. To find the main (or the diagonal) stress the coordinates are rotate by 45.
The diagonal lines (line BC and line AD in Figure 8.9) in the control volume move
to the new locations. In addition, the sides AB and AC rotate in unequal amount
which make one diagonal line longer and one diagonal line shorter. The normal shear
stress relates to the change in the diagonal line length change. This relationship can be

     Equation (8.76) relates the difference between the normal shear stress and the

normal shear stresses in x', y' coordinates) and the angular strain rate in the regular (x, y

coordinates). The linear deformations in the x' and y' directions which is rotated 45

relative to the x and y axes can be expressed in both coordinates system. The angular

strain rate in the (x, y) is frame related to the strain rates in the (x', y') frame. Figure

The small deformations a , b, c, and d in the Figure are related to the incremental linear

strains. The rate of strain in the x direction is

The rate of the strain in y direction is

The total change in the deformation angle is related to tan , in both sides (d/dx+b/dy)
which in turn is related to combination of the two sides angles. The linear angular
deformation in xy direction is

                       b+d                                                           (8.80)
             dxy = dx

       Here, d x is the linear strain (increase in length divided by length) of the particle
in the x direction, and d y is its linear strain in the y-direction. The linear strain in the
x direction can be computed by observing Figure 8.11b. The hypotenuse of the triangle

is oriented in the x' direction (again observe Figure 8.11b). The original length of the
hypotenuse 2dx. The change in the hypotenuse length is (c + b)2 + (a + d)2. It
can be approximated that the change is about 45 because changes are infinitesimally
small. Thus, cos 45 or sin 45 times the change contribute as first approximation to

change. Hence, the ratio strain in the x' direction is

Equation (8.81) can be interpreted as (using equations (8.78), (8.79), and (8.80)) as

              1 a+b+c+d 1                                                            (8.82)
     d x' = 2 dx = 2 (d y + d y + dxy)

In the same fashion, the strain in y' coordinate can be interpreted to be

                     1                                                               (8.83)
             d y' = 2 (d y + d y - dxy)

Notice the negative sign before dxy. Combining equation (8.82) with equation (8.83)
results in

             d x' - d y' = dxy                                                       (8.84)

Equation (8.84) describing in Lagrangian coordinates a single particle. Changing it to
the Eulerian coordinates transforms equation (8.84) into

               D x' - D y' = Dxy                                                 (8.85)

From (8.69) it can be observed that the right hand side of equation (8.85) can be
replaced by xy/ to read

The same way it can written for the y' coordinate.

               D y' = Uy'                                                        (8.89)
               Dt y'

Equation (8.88) can be written in the y' and is similar by substituting the coordinates.
The rate of strain relations can be substituted by the velocity and equations (8.88) and
(8.89) changes into

   x'x' - y'y' = 2                            Ux' - Uy'                         (8.90)
                                               x' y'

Similar two equations can be obtained in the other two plans. For example in y'-z' plan
one can obtained

   x'x' - z'z' = 2                          Ux' - Uz'                           (8.91)

Adding equations (8.90) and (8.91) results in

302                          CHAPTER 8. DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

rearranging equation (8.92) transforms it into

     3 x'x' = x'x' + y'y' + z'z' + 6  Ux' - 2   Ux' + Uy' + Uz'                   (8.93)
                                              x'  x' y' z'

Dividing the results by 3 so that one can obtained the following

     "mechanical" pressure

     x'x' = x'x' + y'y' + z'z' +2  Ux' - 2      Ux' + Uy' + Uz'                   (8.94)
     3                      x' 3                  x' y' z'

The "mechanical" pressure, Pm, is defined as the (negative) average value of pressure
in directions of x'-y'-z'. This pressure is a true scalar value of the flow field since the
propriety is averaged or almost15 In situations where the main diagonal terms of the
stress tensor are not the same in all directions (in some viscous flows) this property
can be served as a measure of the local normal stress. The mechanical pressure can
be defined as averaging of the normal stress acting on a infinitesimal sphere. It can be
shown that this two definitions are "identical" in the limits16. With this definition and
noticing that the coordinate system x'-y' has no special significance and hence equation
(8.94) must be valid in any coordinate system thus equation (8.94) can be written as

                                xx = -Pm + 2  Ux + 2    U                        (8.95)
                                                        x 3

Again where Pm is the mechanical pressure and is defined as

          Mechanical Pressure                                                       (8.96)
        Pm = - xx + yy + zz

                            3

It can be observed that the non main (diagonal) terms of the stress tensor are represented
by an equation like (8.72). Commonality engineers like to combined the two difference
expressions into one as

                          2  =0                   Ux + Uy                           (8.97)

Summary of The Stress Tensor

       The above derivations were provided as a long mathematical explanation17. To
reduced one unknown (the shear stress) equation (8.61) the relationship between the
stress tensor and the velocity were to be established. First, connection between xy and
the deformation was built. Then the association between normal stress and perpendicu-
lar stress was constructed. Using the coordinates transformation, this association was
established. The linkage between the stress in the rotated coordinates to the deforma-
tion was established.

The averaged change of the small angle is then

This term is the shear strain for a very small angle. It can established for the averaged

strains for the two other planes Under the same argument will be same (nothing unique

for this plane). For the main direction such as xx it will be the averaged of the same

values. Hence the matrix for the whole strain is

This matrix (8.106) referred in literature as the shear rate which is similar to strain in
solid mechanics. These changes in the angles and element's geometry can be obtained
from the velocity field.

     Example 8.6: Given Velocity to Strain                    Level: Intermediate

     Calculate the shear rate of the hypothetical flow field given as

There is no special significance for these results. In certain direction the strain can be
zero while it can have value in others.

Second Viscosity Coefficient

       The coefficient 2/3 is experimental and relates to viscosity. However, if the
derivations before were to include additional terms, an additional correction will be
needed. This correction results in

                                  P = Pm +   U             (8.107)

The value of  is obtained experimentally. This coefficient is referred in the literature
by several terms such as the "expansion viscosity "second" coefficient of viscosity" and
"bulk viscosity. Here the term bulk viscosity will be adapted. The dimension of the
bulk viscosity, , is similar to the viscosity .According to second law of thermodynamic
derivations (not shown here and are under construction) demonstrate that  must be
positive. The thermodynamic pressure always tends to follow the mechanical pressure
during a change. The expansion rate of change and the fluid molecular structure through
 control the difference. Equation (8.107) can be written in terms of the thermodynamic
pressure P , as

ij = - P + 2  -    U ij +  Ui + Uj                       (8.108)
                               3                     xj xi

       The significance of the difference between the thermodynamic pressure and the
mechanical pressure associated with fluid dilation which connected by   U . The
physical meaning of   U represents the relative volume rate of change. For simple gas
(dilute monatomic gases) it can be shown that  vanishes. In material such as water,
 is large (3 times ) but the net effect is small because in that cases   U - 0.
For complex liquids this coefficient, , can be over 100 times larger than . Clearly for
incompressible flow, this coefficient or the whole effect is vanished18. In most cases,
the total effect of the dilation on the flow is very small. Only in micro fluids and small
and molecular scale such as in shock waves this effect has some significance. In fact
this effect is so insignificant that there is difficulty in to construct experiments so this

18vanish is because   U = 0.
306                                      CHAPTER 8. DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

effect can be measured. Thus, neglecting this effect results in

                        ij = -P ij +  Ui + Uj                      (8.109)

To explain equation (8.109), it can be written for specific coordinates. For example, for
the xx it can be written that

                                xx = -P + 2 Ux                      (8.110)

and the y coordinate the equation is

                                   yy = -P + 2 Uy                   (8.111)
                                                      y

however the mix stress, xy, is

                        xy = yx =        Uy + Ux                    (8.112)

8.6 Boundary Conditions and Driving Forces

8.6.1 Boundary Conditions Categories

The governing equations that were developed earlier requires some boundary conditions
and initial conditions. These conditions described physical situations that are believed
or should exist or approximated. These conditions can be categorized by the velocity,
pressure, or in more general terms as the shear stress conditions (mostly at the interface).
For this discussion, the shear tensor will be separated into two categories, pressure (at
the interface direction) and shear stress (perpendicular to the area). A common velocity
condition is that the liquid has the same value as the solid interface velocity. In the
literature, this condition is referred as the "no slip" condition. The solid surface is
rough thus the liquid participles (or molecules) are slowed to be at the solid surface
velocity. This boundary condition was experimentally observed under many conditions
yet it is not universal true. The slip condition (as oppose to "no slip" condition) exist in
situations where the scale is very small and the velocity is relatively very small. The slip
condition is dealing with a difference in the velocity between the solid (or other material)
and the fluid media. The difference between the small scale and the large scale is that
the slip can be neglected in the large scale while the slip cannot be neglected in the small
308     CHAPTER 8. DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

scale. In another view, the difference in the velocities vanishes as the scale increases.

Another condition which affects whether the slip condition exist is how rapidly of the

velocity change. The slip condition cannot

be ignored in some regions, when the flow is                tn
with a strong velocity fluctuations. Mathe-
matically the "no slip" condition is written         f (x)    flow
as                                                          direction
                                                 yx

     t  (U fluid - U boundary) = 0 (8.121)      Fig. 8.14 - 1-Dimensional free surface
                                                      describing n and t.

where n is referred to the area direction (perpendicular to the area see Figure 8.14).
While this condition (8.121) is given in a vector form, it is more common to write this
condition as a given velocity at a certain point such as

        U( ) = U                                                (8.122)

Note, the "no slip" condition is applicable to the ideal fluid ("inviscid flows") because
this kind of flow normally deals with large scales. The "slip" condition is written in
similar fashion to equation (8.121) as

     t  (U fluid - U boundary) = f (Q, scale, etc)             (8.123)

       As oppose to a given velocity at particular point, a requirement on the accel-
eration (velocity) can be given in unknown position. The condition (8.121) can be
mathematically represented in another way for free surface conditions. To make sure
that all the material is accounted for in the control volume (does not cross the free sur-
face), the relative perpendicular velocity at the interface must be zero. The location of
the (free) moving boundary can be given as f (r, t) = 0 as the equation which describes
the bounding surface. The perpendicular relative velocity at the surface must be zero
and therefore

     Df                                                         (8.124)
          = 0 on the surface f (r, t) = 0

     Dt

This condition is called the kinematic boundary condition. For example, the free surface
in the two dimensional case is represented as f (t, x, y). The condition becomes as

     f                                        f  f              (8.125)
     0 = t + Ux x + Uy y

The solution of this condition, sometime, is extremely hard to handle because the
location isn't given but the derivative given on unknown location. In this book, this
condition will not be discussed (at least not plane to be written).

       The free surface is a special case of moving surfaces where the surface between
two distinct fluids. In reality the interface between these two fluids is not a sharp
transition but only approximation (see for the surface theory). There are situations
8.6. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND DRIVING FORCES  309

where the transition should be analyzed as a continuous transition between two phases.
In other cases, the transition is idealized an almost jump (a few molecules thickness).
Furthermore, there are situations where the fluid (above one of the sides) should be
considered as weightless material. In these cases the assumptions are that the transition
occurs in a sharp line, and the density has a jump while the shear stress are continuous
(in some cases continuously approach zero value). While a jump in density does not
break any physical laws (at least those present in the solution), the jump in a shear
stress (without a jump in density) does break a physical law. A jump in the shear
stress creates infinite force on the adjoin thin layer. Off course, this condition cannot
be tolerated since infinite velocity (acceleration) is impossible. The jump in shear stress
can appear when the density has a jump in density. The jump in the density (between
the two fluids) creates a surface tension which offset the jump in the shear stress. This
condition is expressed mathematically by equating the shear stress difference to the
forces results due to the surface tension. The shear stress difference is

 (n) = 0 =  (n)upper -  (n)lower             (8.126)

                surface           surface

where the index (n) indicate that shear stress are normal (in the surface area). If the
surface is straight there is no jump in the shear stress. The condition with curved
surface are out the scope of this book yet mathematically the condition is given as
without explanation as

n   (n) =       11                          (8.127)
                    +                        (8.128)

                R1 R2

                t   (t) = -t  

where n is the unit normal and t is a unit tangent to the surface (notice that direction
pointed out of the "center" see Figure 8.14) and R1 and R2 are principal radii. One
of results of the free surface condition (or in general, the moving surface condition) is
that integration constant is unknown). In same instances, this constant is determined
from the volume conservation. In index notation equation (8.127) is written19 as

ij(1) nj +  ni   11      = ij(2) nj          (8.129)

The Pressure Condition

       The second condition that commonality prescribed at the interface is the static
pressure at a specific location. The static pressure is measured perpendicular to the
flow direction. The last condition is similar to the pressure condition of prescribed shear
stress or a relationship to it. In this category include the boundary conditions with issues
of surface tension which were discussed earlier. It can be noticed that the boundary
conditions that involve the surface tension are of the kind where the condition is given
on boundary but no at a specific location.

Gravity as Driving Force

       The body forces, in general and gravity in a particular, are the condition that
given on the flow beside the velocity, shear stress (including the surface tension) and
the pressure. The gravity is a common body force which is considered in many fluid
mechanics problems. The gravity can be considered as a constant force in most cases
(see for dimensional analysis for the reasons).

Shear Stress and Surface Tension as Driving Force

If the fluid was solid material, pulling the side will  Fig. 8.15 - Kerosene lamp.
pull all the material. In fluid (mostly liquid) shear
stress pulling side (surface) will have limited effect
and yet sometime is significant and more rarely dom-
inate. Consider, for example, the case shown in Fig-
ure 8.15. The shear stress carry the material as if
part of the material was a solid material. For exam-
ple, in the kerosene lamp the burning occurs at the
surface of the lamp top and the liquid is at the bot-
tom. The liquid does not move up due the gravity
(actually it is against the gravity) but because the
surface tension.

       The physical conditions in Fig. 8.15 are used to idealize the flow around an in-
ner rode to understand how to apply the surface tension to the boundary conditions.
The fluid surrounds the rode and flows upwards. In that case, the velocity at the sur-
face of the inner rode is zero. The velocity at the outer surface is unknown. The
boundary condition at outer surface given by a jump of the shear stress. The outer
diameter is depends on the surface tension (the larger surface tension the smaller the

book, this effect is not discussed. However, some-                    r h             } mix zone
where downstream the temperature gradient is in-
significant. Even in that case, the surface tension                                   } constant
gradient remains. It can be noticed that, under the
assumption presented here, there are two principal                                    }T
radii of the flow. One radius toward the center of
the rode while the other radius is infinite (approxi-  Fig. 8.16 - Flow in a candle
mately). In that case, the contribution due to the          with a surface tension gra-
curvature is zero in the direction of the flow (see         dient.
Figure 8.16). The only (almost) propelling source of
the flow is the surface gradient (  n ).

8.7 Examples for Differential Equation (Navier-Stokes)

Examples of an one-dimensional flow driven by the shear stress and pressure are pre-
sented. For further enhance the understanding some of the derivations are repeated.
First, example dealing with one phase are present. Later, examples with two phase are
presented.

                                     Ux(y = ) = U

The solution of the "ordinary" differential equation (8.7.h) after the integration be-

comes                      Ux = - 1 dP y2 + c2 y + c3
                                     2  dx

Applying the boundary conditions, Eq. (8.7.i) results in c3 = and

                              c2 = 1   U + 1 dP 2                                                                              (8..a)

             Ux(y) = - 1 dP y2 + U + 1 dP y                                                                                    (8.7.k)

                        Ux(y)  =      2 dP     1- y                  y+y                                                       (8.7.m)

       For the case where the pressure gradient is zero the velocity is linear as was

discussed earlier in the chapter 1 (see Fig. 8.18). However, if the plates or the boundary

conditions do not move the solution is Eq. (8.7.m).

     Example 8.8: Flow Rate Two Plate                                      Level: Intermediate

     For the previous example calculate the flow rate into and out control volume.

     What is the averged velocity? what is the ratio of the averged velocity to the

     maximum velocity?

     Solution

     The flow is simply the integration of velocity across the section.

                                         qin =                 dA                         (8..b)

                                                      U w dy

                                                   0

     Substituting Eq. (8.7.m) into Eq. (8..b) can be writtten as

                               qin =                1- y         y + y dy                 (8..c)
                                 w
                                      0

     The definition of  is given Eq. (8.7.m). Or using some mathematical substitutions

     that to read

                               qin =                1 - y y + y dy                        (8..d)

                                      0

     Using the substitutions of  = y and thus d = dy. In this substitution when

     y = -  = 1 and y = 0 -  = 0 which turn Eq. (8..d) into

                            Uaveraged = qin =        1                                    (8..e)

                                                   0

     after the integration

                                      Uave = qin =  + 1                                   (8..f )
                                                w 62

     The maximum velocity is obtained by taking the derivative of velocity as

                            dU = 0 -- max = 1 + 1 = 1 1 + 1                               (8..g)
                            d                      2 2 2 

     Note that when  = 0 or in other words no pressure gradient exist, the maximum
     velocity occurs at the moving boundary. Substituting the value to the velocity formula
     provides

     Umax =  ( + 1) -  2                         1         1 + 1 (1 + ) -       1      2

     The veloicty ratio is then

                                                1  1 + 1  (1 + ) - 2   1 + 1 2

     Notice that when  = 0 this ratio isn't applicable.

       When more than one liquid is following in the conduit the mathematics because
more complected but the principle is the same. The following problem was inspired by
a stability question of two fluids transition in die casting.

Two fluids flow as two layers one above each other in conduit is examined here.

and the the pressure gradient?

Solution

The governing equation for both fluids is

                            dP               d2 U                       (8.9.a)
                            - dx =  dy2                                (8.9.b)

with boundaries conditions

                            UA(y = 0) = 0

The shear stress has to match on both sides thus

          킕 dUA                           = 킖 dUB                     (8.9.c)
                            dy (y=h1)        dy (y=h1)

The no-slip condition between the liquid must be obey

                            UA (y = h1) = UB (y = h1)                   (8.9.d)

and the no-slip condition on the upper surface reads

                            UB (y = h2) = 0                             (8.9.e)

The shear stress requirement force a jump in the abrupt change in the velocity profile.

These conditions Eqs. (8.9.b)-(8.9.e) need to be augmented with two more equation

to deal with expected 4 unknowns. These four unknowns are the result of the solution

of ODE Eq. (8.9.a) (two ranges thus two times two). This combination is sufficient

solve the problem. This author is not aware of a single and ultimate solution to the

problem. Thus, any method is valid. The general solution of of the governing equation

is        U(A,B) = - 1 dP  y2 + C(A,B) A,B dx 1 y + C(A,B)2

                                                                        (8.9.f )

     where C(A,B)1 and C(A,B)2 are the integration constants.       End of Ex. 8.9
     Eq. (8.9.b) results in                                         Applying condition

                      0 = - 1 dP 02 + CA 1 0 + CA 2                                 (8.9.g)
                              킕 dx

     which dictates that CA2 = 0. Similarly, the upper condition can be written as

                      0 = - 1 dP (hA + hB )2 + CB 1 (hA + hB ) + CB 2               (8.9.h)
                              킕 dx

     at the interface between the two fluids the velocities are the same

         - 1 dP hA 2 + CA 1 hA = - 1 dP hA 2 + CB 1 hA + CB 2                       (8.9.i)
         킕 dx                               킖 dx

     And the shear stress are the same at the interface

         킕 -         1 dP   hA + CA 1 = 킖 -            1 dP       hA + CB 1       (8.9.j)

                      킕 dx                              킖 dx

     or after rearrangement it can be written as

                      dP                          dP                                (8.9.k)
                      - hA + 킕 CA 1 = - hA + 킖 CB 1                               (8.9.l)
                      dx                          dx 

     which relates the two coefficients as

                             CA 1 = 킖 CB 1
                                       킕

     Combining or substituting Eq. (8.9.l) into Eq. (8.9.k) yields

         - 1 dP hA 2 + 킖 CB 1 hA = - 1 dP hA 2 + CB 1 hA + CB 2               (8.9.m)
         킕 dx        킕                     킖 dx                             (8.9.n)

     or

         - 1-1               dP hA 2 = CB 1           1 - 킖        hA + CB 2
              킕 킖          dx                            킕

     Eq. (8.9.n) and Eq. (8.9.h) provides a linear set of equation to solve for CB1 for CB2.
     Eq. (8.9.h) slightly rearranged to be

                       1 dP (hA + hB )2 = CB 1 (hA + hB ) + CB 2                    (8.9.o)
                      킕 dx

     The solution is

                      CB 1 = dP 킕           (hA + hB )2 킖 - hA 2                  (8.9.p)
                                dx 킖                       킕

                                                (hA 킖 + hB 킕 )

     The value of CB1 can be either positive or negative which could effect of the stability

     of flow (solution) which depend the viscosity ratio. Notice that Eq. (8.9.l) also dictate

     that CB2 has the same sign. This topic is above the scope of the example. The

     solution for the second coefficient is

                      hA (hB + hA ) 킖 - 1 (hB 킖 + hA 킖 - hA 킕 )                 (8.9.q)

         dx 킖               킕 킖 (hA 킖 + hB 킕 )

     These solutions are not fully non-dimensionalized as the heights can be pulled out and

     some additional manipulations and create an universal solution to this problem.

flow can be constructed for cylindrical co-

The term Uz+dz2 - Uz2 is zero because Uz+dz = Uz because mass conservation con-

Equation (8.138) is a first order differential equation for which only one boundary
condition is needed. The "no slip" condition is assumed

While the above analysis provides a solution, it has several deficiencies which include the
ability to incorporate different boundary conditions such as flow between concentering
cylinders.

     given pressure gradient.

     Solution

     After the previous example, the appropriate version of the Navier-Stokes equation will
     be used. The situation is best suitable to solved in cylindrical coordinates. One of
     the solution of this problems is one dimensional solution. In fact there is no physical
     reason why the flow should be only one dimensional. However, it is possible to satisfy
     the boundary conditions. It turn out that the "simple" solution is the first mode that
     appear in reality. In this solution will be discussing the flow first mode. For this mode,

the flow is assumed to be one dimensional. That is, the velocity isn't a function of the

angle, or z coordinate. Thus only equation in z coordinate is needed. It can be noticed

that this case is steady state and also the acceleration (convective acceleration) is zero

The PDE above (8.10.b) required boundary conditions which are

                           Uz (r = ri) = 0
                           Uz (r = ro) = 0

Integrating equation (8.10.b) once results in

     A finite integration of the last term in the integrand results in zero because it is

     The first integration of the first part of the second square bracket, (r3), is

     1/4 ro4 - ri4 . The second part, of the second square bracket, (-a  r ln r) can be

For the concentric velocity profile, at what radius the maximum velocity ob-

tained. Draw the maximum velocity location as a function of the ratio ri/ro.

Solution

       The next example deals with the gravity as body force in two dimensional flow.
This problem study by Nusselt22 which developed the basics equations. This problem is

related to many industrial process and is fundamental in understanding many industrial

processes. Furthermore, this analysis is a building bloc for heat and mass transfer
understanding23.

Example 8.12: Thin Film                           Level: Simple

In many situations in nature and many industrial processes liquid flows down-

stream on inclined plate at  as shown in Figure 8.22. For this example, assume

that the gas density is zero (located

outside the liquid domain). Assume

that "scale" is large enough so that

the "no slip" condition prevail at

the plate (bottom). For simplic-

ity, assume that the flow is two di-                      h

obtains a steady state after some

This problem is suitable to Cartesian coordinates in which x coordinate is pointed in

     The first term of the acceleration is zero because the flow is in a steady state. The
     first term of the convective acceleration is zero under the assumption of this example
     flow is fully developed and hence not a function of x (nothing to be "improved"). The
     second and the third terms in the convective acceleration are zero because the velocity
     at that direction is zero (Uy = Uz = 0). The pressure is almost constant along the x
     coordinate. As it will be shown later, the pressure loss in the gas phase (mostly air) is
     negligible. Hence the pressure at the gas phase is almost constant hence the pressure
     at the interface in the liquid is constant. The surface has no curvature and hence the
     pressure at liquid side similar to the gas phase and the only change in liquid is in the
     y direction. Fully developed flow means that the first term of the velocity Laplacian
     is zero ( x Ux  0). The last term of the velocity Laplacian is zero because no velocity
     in the z direction.
     Thus, equation (8.12.a) is reduced to

                                            2Ux                             (8.12.b)

     With boundary condition of "no slip" at the bottom because the large scale and steady

     state

                                        Ux(y = 0) = 0                              (8.12.c)

     The boundary at the interface is simplified to be

                                    Ux = air ( 0)                           (8.12.d)
                                     y y=0

     If there is additional requirement, such a specific velocity at the surface, the governing

     equation can not be sufficient from the mathematical point of view. Integration of

     equation (8.12.b) yields

     The integration constant can be obtain by applying the condition (8.12.d) as

                         air =  Ux = - g sin              y                       (8.12.f )

     Solving for c1 results in

                                    c1 = air + 1 g sin  h

When the shear stress caused by the air is neglected, the velocity profile is

Note the shear stress at the interface can be positive or negative and hence can increase
or decrease the flow rate and the averaged velocity.

       In the following following example the issue of driving force of the flow through
curved interface is examined. The flow in the kerosene lamp is depends on the surface
tension. The flow surface is curved and thus pressure is not equal on both sides of the
interface.

    Example 8.13: Kerosen Lump                                      Level: Intermediate

A simplified flow version the kerosene lump is of liquid moving up on a solid

core. Assume that radius of the liquid and solid core are given and the flow is

at steady state. Calculate the minimum shear stress that required to operate

the lump (alternatively, the maximum height).

In Example 8.12 no requirement was made                               air (gas)     same
as for the velocity at the interface (the up-                                       solutiveloc

                                                                     uid)

governing equations must be solved one                                           h

for the air (gas) phase and one for wa-

ter (liquid) phase. Two boundary condi-

tions must be satisfied at the interface. For

the liquid, the boundary condition of "no      Fig. 8.23 - Flow of liquid in partially
slip" at the bottom surface of liquid must          filled duct.

be satisfied. Thus, there is total of three

boundary conditions24 to be satisfied. The solution to the differential governing equa-

tions provides only two constants. The second domain (the gas phase) provides another

equation with two constants but again three boundary conditions need to satisfied.

However, two of the boundary conditions for these equations are the identical and thus

the six boundary conditions are really only 4 boundary conditions.

The governing equation solution25 for the gas phase (h  y  a h) is

Uxg = g sin  y2 + c1 y + c2                                                                       (8.143)
          2 g

Note, the constants c1 and c2 are dimensional which mean that they have physical units
(c1 - [1/sec]. The governing equation in the liquid phase (0  y  h) is

Ux = g sin  y2 + c3 y + c4                                                                        (8.144)
          2

The gas velocity at the upper interface is vanished thus

Uxg [(1 + a) h] = 0                                                                               (8.145)

At the interface the "no slip" condition is regularly applied and thus

Uxg(h) = Ux (h)                                                                                   (8.146)

Also at the interface (a straight surface), the shear stress must be continuous

킽 Uxg =  Ux                                                                                     (8.147)

   24 The author was hired to do experiments on thin film (gravity flow). These experiments were to
study the formation of small and big waves at the interface. The phenomenon is explained by the fact
that there is somewhere instability which is transferred into the flow. The experiments were conducted
on a solid concrete laboratory and the flow was in a very stable system. No matter how low flow
rate was small and big occurred. This explanation bothered this author, thus current explanation was
developed to explain the wavy phenomenon occurs.

   25This equation results from double integrating of equation (8.12.b) and subtitling  = /.

Assuming "no slip" for the liquid at the bottom boundary as

                                  Ux (0) = 0                           (8.148)

The boundary condition (8.145) results in

0 = g sin  h2 (1 + a)2 + c1 h (1 + a) + c2                             (8.149)

The same can be said for boundary condition (8.148) which leads

                                  c4 = 0                               (8.150)

Combining boundary conditions equation(8.146) with (8.149) results in

This process that was shown here is referred as non-dimensionalization26. The ratio of
the dynamics viscosity can be eliminated from equation (8.160) to be

       The two different fluids27 have a solution as long as the distance is a finite rea-
sonable similar. What happen when the lighter fluid, mostly the gas, is infinite long.
This is one of the source of the instability at the interface. The boundary conditions of
flow with infinite depth is that flow at the interface is zero, flow at infinite is zero. The
requirement of the shear stress in the infinite is zero as well. There is no way obtain
one dimensional solution for such case and there is a component in the y direction.
Combining infinite size domain of one fluid with finite size on the other one side results
in unstable interface.

    fluid flows. At a particular flow rate,
    the mercury column appears as shown
    in the Fig. 8.24. The density of mercury
    is 13600 [kg/m3] and g = 9.81 [m/s2].
    Which of the following is correct?

(a) Flow direction is A to B and pA - pB = 20 [kPa]

(b) Flow direction is B to A and pA - pB = 1.4 [kPa]

(c) Flow direction is A to B and pB - pA = 20 [kPa]

(d) Flow direction is B to A and pB - pA = 1.4 [kPa]

Solution

The pressure difference between the A and B is

pA - pB = (m - w) gh  21.484[kP a]                             (8.14.a)

As pA > pB , the flow goes from A to B. The above statement is for the GATE
test only. However, according to the drawing the area in A is much larger than the
cross section in B. According Bernoulli's equation this pressure difference supposed to
be like even when the flow goes from B to A. The real answer there is not enough

Solution

The stream line is represented as

                                      dx = dy                         (8.16.a)

or in another form of                 dy = Ux
                                      dx Uy

Substituting into the velocities into Eq. (8.16.b) reads

                       dy = -2 x y tg = -2 y -- dy = -2 dx           (8.16.c)

Integrating the Eq. (8.16.c) yields,

               ln(y) = -2 ln(cx) -- ln(y) + 2 ln(x) = constant        (8.16.d)

In a final form as                  y x2 = constant                   (8.16.e)

Solution

Assuming that Newton's law of viscosity is applicable, the shear stress at r = D/2 is

9.1 Introductory Remarks

Dimensional analysis refers to techniques dealing with units or conversion to a unitless
system. The definition of dimensional analysis is not consistent in the literature which
span over various fields and times. Possible topics that dimensional analysis deals with
are consistency of the units, change order of magnitude, applying from the old and
known to unknown (see the Book of Ecclesiastes), and creation of group parameters
without any dimensions (Buckingham 1914). In this chapter, the focus is on the ap-
plying the old to unknown as different scales and the creation of dimensionless groups.
These techniques gave birth to dimensional parameters which have a great scientific
importance. Since the 1940s1, the dimensional analysis is taught and written in all fluid
mechanics textbooks. The approach or the technique used in these books is referred
to as Buckingham--theory (G쮗rtler 1975). The -theory was coined by Bucking-
ham(Buckingham 1915b). However, there is another technique which is referred to
in the literature as the Nusselt's method. Both these methods attempt to reduce the

    1The history of dimensional analysis is complex. Several scientists used this concept before Buck-
ingham and Nusselt (see below history section). Their work culminated at the point of publishing the
paper Buckingham's paper and independently constructed by Nusselt. It is interesting to point out
that there are several dimensionless numbers that bear Nusselt and his students name, Nusselt number,
Schmidt number, Eckert number. There is no known dimensionless number which bears Buckingham
name. Buckingham's technique is discussed and studied in Fluid Mechanics while almost completely
ignored by Heat and Mass Transfer researchers and their classes. Furthermore, in many advance fluid
mechanics classes Nusselt's technique is used and Buckingham's technique is abandoned. Perhaps this
fact can be attributed to tremendous influence Nusselt and his students had on the heat transfer field.
Even, this author can be accused for being bias as the Eckert's last student. However, this author
observed that Nusselt's technique is much more effective as it will demonstrated later.

number of parameters which affect the problem and reduce the labor in solving the prob-
lem. The key in these techniques lays in the fact of consistency of the dimensions of
any possible governing equation(s) and the fact that some dimensions are reoccurring.
The Buckingham- goes further and no equations are solved and even no knowledge
about these equations is required. In Buckingham's technique only the dimensions or
the properties of the problem at hand are analyzed. This author is aware of only a
single class of cases were Buckingham's methods is useful and or can solve the problem
namely the pendulum class problem (and similar).

       The dimensional analysis was independently developed by Nusselt and improved
by his students/co-workers (Schmidt, Eckert) in which the governing equations are used
as well. Thus, more information is put into the problem and thus a better understand-
ing on the dimensionless parameters is extracted. The advantage or disadvantage of
these similar methods depend on the point of view. The Buckingham- technique is
simpler while Nusselt's technique produces a better result. Sometime, the simplicity of
Buckingham's technique yields insufficient knowledge or simply becomes useless. When
no governing equations are found, Buckingham's method has usefulness. It can be
argued that these situations really do not exist in the Thermo-Fluid field. Nusselt's
technique is more cumbersome but more precise and provide more useful information.
Both techniques are discussed in this book. The advantage of the Nusselt's technique
are: a) compact presentation, b)knowledge what parameters affect the problem, and c)
easier to extent the solution to more general situations. In very complex problems both
techniques suffer from in inability to provide a significant information on the effective
parameters such multi-phase flow etc.

       It has to be recognized that the dimensional analysis provides answer to what
group of parameters affecting the problem and not the answer to the problem (Langhaar
1951) In fact, there are fields in thermo-fluid where dimensional analysis, is recognized
as useless. For example, the area of multiphase flows there is no solution based on
dimensionless parameters (with the exception of the rough solution of Martinelli). In the
Buckingham's approach it merely suggests the number of dimensional parameters based
on a guess of all parameters affecting the problem. Nusselt's technique provides the form
of these dimensionless parameters, and the relative relationship of these parameters.

9.1.1 Brief History

The idea of experimentation with a different, rather than the actual, dimension was
suggested by several individuals independently. Some attribute it to Newton (1686)
who coined the phrase of "great Principle of Similitude." Later, Maxwell a Scottish
Physicist played a major role in establishing the basic units of mass, length, and time
as building blocks of all other units. Another example, John Smeaton (8 June 1724-28
October 1792) was an English civil and mechanical engineer who study relation between
propeller/wind mill and similar devices to the pressure and velocity of the driving forces.

       Jean B. J. Fourier (1768-1830) first attempted to formulate the dimensional analy-
sis theory. This idea was extend by William Froude (1810-1871) by relating the modeling
of open channel flow and actual body but more importantly the relationship between
9.1. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS                                                   335

drag of models to actual ships. While the majority of the contributions were done by
thermo-fluid guys the concept of the equivalent or similar propagated to other fields.
Aim큖em Vaschy, a German Mathematical Physicist (1857-1899), suggested using sim-
ilarity in electrical engineering and suggested the Norton circuit equivalence theorems.
Rayleigh probably was the first one who used dimensional analysis (1872) to obtain
the relationships between the physical quantities (see the question why the sky is blue
story).

       Osborne Reynolds (1842-1912) was the first to derive and use dimensionless pa-
rameters to analyze experimental data. Riabouchunsky2 proposed of relating tempera-
ture by molecules velocity and thus creating dimensionless group with the byproduct of
compact solution (solution presented in a compact and simple form).

       Buckingham culminated the dimensional analysis and similitude and presented it in
a more systematic form. In the about the same time (1915, Wilhelm Nusselt (November
25, 1882 - September 1, 1957), a German engineer, developed the dimensional analysis
(proposed the principal parameters) of heat transfer without knowledge about previous
work of Buckingham.

9.1.2 Theory Behind Dimensional Analysis

In chemistry it was recognized that there are fundamental elements that all the material
is made from (the atoms). That is, all the molecules are made from a combination of
different atoms. Similarly to this concept, it was recognized that in many physical
systems there are basic fundamental units which can describe all the other dimensions
or units in the system. For example, isothermal single component systems (which does
not undergo phase change, temperature change and observed no magnetic or electrical
effect) can be described by just basic four physical units. The units or dimensions
are, time, length, mass, quantity of substance (mole). For example, the dimension or
the units of force can be constructed utilizing Newton's second law i.e. mass times
acceleration - m a = M L/t2. Increase of degree of freedom, allowing this system
to be non-isothermal will increase only by one additional dimension of temperature,
. These five fundamental units are commonly the building blocks for most of the
discussion in fluid mechanics (see Table of basic units 9.1).

       The choice of these basic units is not unique and several books and researchers
suggest a different choice of fundamental units. One common selection is substituting
the mass with the force in the previous selection (F, t, L, mol, Temperature). This
author is not aware of any discussion on the benefits of one method over the other
method. Yet, there are situations in which first method is better than the second one
while in other situations, it can be the reverse. In this book, these two selections are
presented. Other selections are possible but not common and, at the moment, will not
be discussed here.

     Example 9.1: Force Basic Units                               Level: Basic

     What are the units of force when the basic units are: mass, length, time,

     temperature (M, L, t, )? What are the units of mass when the basic units

     are: force, length, time, temperature (F, L, t, T)? Notice the different notation

     for the temperature in the two systems of basic units. This notation has no

     significance but for historical reasons remained in use.

     Solution

     These two systems are related as the questions are the reversed of each other. The

     connection between the mass and force can be obtained from the simplified Newton's

     second law F = m a where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.

     Thus, the units of force are

9.1. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS                                                                    337

                                                                             End of Ex. 9.1
For the second method the unit of mass are obtain from Equation (9.1.a) as

                                  F t2            (9.1.b)

       The number of fundamental or basic dimensions determines the number of the
combinations which affect the physical3 situations. The dimensions or units which
affect the problem at hand can be reduced because these dimensions are repeating or
reoccurring. The Buckingham method is based on the fact that all equations must be
consistent with their units. That is the left hand side and the right hand side have to have
the same units. Because they have the same units the equations can be divided to create
unitless equations. This idea alludes to the fact that these unitless parameters can be
found without any knowledge of the governing equations. Thus, the arrangement of the
effecting parameters in unitless groups yields the affecting parameters. These unitless
parameters are the dimensional parameters. The following trivial example demonstrates
the consistency of units

Example 9.2: Force Second Term Units              Level: Simple

Newton's equation has two terms that related to force F = m a + m U . Where

F is force, m is the mass, a is the acceleration and dot above m indicating

the mass derivative with respect to time. In particular case, this equation get a

form of

                           F = ma+7               (9.2.a)

where 7 represent the second term. What are the requirement on equation
(9.2.a)?

Solution

Clearly, the units of [F ], m a and 7 have to be same. The units of force are [N ] which
is defined by first term of the right hand side. The same units force has to be applied
to 7 thus it must be in [N ].

       Suppose that there is a relationship between a quantity a under the question
and several others parameters which either determined from experiments or theoretical
consideration which is of the form

          D = f (a1, a2,    , ai,    , an)  (9.1)

where D is dependent parameters and a1, a2,    , ai,    , an are have independent di-
mensions. From these independent parameters a1, a2,    , ai have independent di-
mensions (have basic dimensions). This mean that all the dimensions of the pa-
rameters ai+1,    , an can be written as combination of the independent parameters
a1, a2,    , ai. In that case it is possible to write that every parameter in the later set

    3The dimensional analysis also applied in economics and other areas and the statement should
reflect this fact. However, this book is focused on engineering topics and other fields are not discussed.
338                                          CHAPTER 9. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

can written as dimensionless                                                             (9.2)
                                        ai+1 = dimensionless

                               a1p1 , a2p2 ,    , aipi

The "non-basic" parameter would be dimensionless when divided by appropriately and
selectively chosen set of constants p1, p2,    , pi.

     Example 9.3: Clamping Force                                          Level: Simple

     In a experiment, the clamping force is measured. It was found that the clamping
     force depends on the length of experimental setup, velocity of the upper part,
     mass of the part, height of the experimental setup, and leverage the force is
     applied. Chose the basic units and dependent parameters. Show that one of
     the dependent parameters can be normalized.

     Solution

     The example suggest that the following relationship can be written.

                              F = f (L, U, H, , m)                        (9.3.a)

     The basic units in this case are in this case or length, mass, and time. No other basic
     unit is need to represent the problem. Either L, H, or  can represent the length.
     The mass will be represented by mass while the velocity has to be represented by the
     velocity (or some combination of the velocity). Hence a one possible choice for the
     basic dimension is L, m, and U . Any of the other Lengths can be represented by
     simple division by the L. For example

                              Normalize parameter = H                     (9.3.b)
                                                             L

     Or the force also can be normalized as

               Another Normalize parameter =                    F         (9.3.c)

                                                                2 -1
                                                       mU L

     The acceleration can be any part of acceleration component such as centrifugal ac-
     celeration. Hence, the force is mass times the acceleration.

The relationship (9.1) can be written in the light of the above explanation as

           D
a1p1 , a2p2 ,    , aip1 =

     F ai+1 ,    , an                                                                 (9.3)
               a1pi+1,1 , a2pi+1,2 ,    , aipi+1,i  anpn,1 , anpn,2 ,    , anpn,i

where the indexes of the power p on the right hand side are single digit and the double
digits on the on the right hand side. While this "proof" shows the basic of the Buck-
ingham's method it actually provides merely the minimum number of the dimension
parameters. In fact, this method entrenched into the field while in most cases pro-
vides incomplete results. The fundamental reason for the erroneous results is because
9.1. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS  339

the fundamental assumption of equation (9.1). This method provides a crude tool of
understanding.

9.1.3 Dimensional Parameters Application for Experimental
          Study

The solutions for any situations which are controlled by the same governing equations
with same boundary conditions regardless of the origin the equation. The solutions are
similar or identical regardless to the origin of the field no matter if the field is physical, or
economical, or biological. The Buckingham's technique implicitly suggested that since
the governing equations (in fluid mechanics) are essentially are the same, just knowing
the parameters is enough the identify the problem. This idea alludes to connections
between similar parameters to similar solution. The non-dimensionalization i.e. opera-
tion of reducing the number affecting parameters, has a useful by-product, the analogy
in other words, the solution by experiments or other cases. The analogy or similitude
refers to understanding one phenomenon from the study of another phenomenon. This
technique is employed in many fluid mechanics situations. For example, study of com-
pressible flow (a flow where the density change plays a significant part) can be achieved
by study of surface of open channel flow. The compressible flow is also similar to traffic
on the highway. Thus for similar governing equations if the solution exists for one case
it is a solution to both cases.

       The analogy can be used to conduct experiment in a cheaper way and/or a safer
way. Experiments in different scale than actual dimensions can be conducted for cases
where the actual dimensions are difficult to handle. For example, study of large air
planes can done on small models. On the other situations, larger models are used to
study small or fast situations. This author believes that at the present the Buckingham
method has extremely limited use for the real world and yet this method is presented in
the classes on fluid mechanics. Thus, many examples on the use of this method will be
presented in this book. On the other hand, Nusselt's method has a larger practical use
in the real world and therefore will be presented for those who need dimensional analysis
for the real world. Dimensional analysis is useful also for those who are dealing with
the numerical research/calculation. This method supplement knowledge when some
parameters should be taken into account and why.
340               CHAPTER 9. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

Fitting a rod into a circular hole (see Figure

9.1) is an example how dimensional analysis

can be used. To solve this problem, it is re-

quired to know two parameters; 1) the rode                       D2

diameter and 2) the diameter of the hole.

Actually, it is required to have only one pa-             D1

rameter, the ratio of the rode diameter to

the hole diameter. The ratio is a dimension-

less number and with this number one can

tell that for a ratio larger than one, the rode

will not enter the hole; and a ratio smaller              Fig. 9.1 - Fitting rod into a hole.
than one, the rod is too small. Only when

the ratio is equal to one, the rode is said to be fit. This presentation allows one to draw

or present the situation by using only one coordinate, the radius ratio. Furthermore,

if one wants to deal with tolerances, the dimensional analysis can easily be extended

to say that when the ratio is equal from 0.99 to 1.0 the rode is fitting, and etc. If

one were to use the two diameters description, further significant information will be

needed. In the preceding simplistic example, the advantages are minimal. In many real

problems this approach can remove clattered views and put the problem into focus.

Throughout this book the reader will notice that the systems/equations in many cases

are converted to a dimensionless form to augment understanding.

9.1.4 The Pendulum Class Problem

The only known problem that dimensional analysis can be solved (to some degree) is
the pendulum class problem. In this section several examples of the pendulum type
problem are presented. The first example is the classic Pendulum problem.

       Example 9.4: Simple Pendulum                              Level: Basic

     Derive the relationship for the gravity [g], fre-           
     quency [ ] and length of pendulum [ ]. Assume
     that no other parameter including the mass af-
     fects the problem. That is, the relationship can
     be expressed as

      = f ( , g)                                 (9.4.a)  mg

     Notice in this problem, the real knowledge is        Fig. 9.2 - Figure for exam-
     provided, however in the real world, this knowl-          ple (9.4).
     edge is not necessarily given or known. Here it
     is provided because the real solution is already
     known from standard physics classes.4
9.1. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS                                           341
                                              End of Ex. 9.4
   Solution

The solution technique is based on the assumption that the indexical form is the
appropriate form to solve the problem. The Indexical form

       = C1  agb                                                            (9.4.b)

The solution functional complexity is limited to the basic combination which has to
be in some form of multiplication of and g in some power. In other words, the
multiplication of g have to be in the same units of the frequency units. Furthermore,
assuming, for example, that a trigonometric function relates and g and frequency.
For example, if a sin function is used, then the functionality looks like  = sin( g).
From the units point of view, the result of operation not match i.e. (sec = sin (sec)).
For that reason the form in equation (9.4.b) is selected. To satisfy equation (9.4.b)
the units of every term are examined and summarized the following table.

Table 9.2 - Units of the Pendulum Parameters

Parameter Units Parameter Units Parameter     Units
                                              L1t-2
 t-1                       L1  g

Thus substituting of the Table 9.2 in equation (9.4.b) results in            (9.4.c)
                            t-1 = C1 L1 a L1 t-2 b = La+bt-2 b               (9.4.d)
                                                                             (9.4.e)
after further rearrangement by multiply the left hand side by L0 results in
                                         L0t-1 = C La+bt-2 b

In order to satisfy equation (9.4.d), the following must exist

                                     0 = a + b and -1 = -2 b
The solution of the equations (9.4.e) is a = -1/2 and b = -1/2.

       5 What was found in this example is the form of the solution's equation and
frequency. Yet, the functionality e.g. the value of the constant was not found. The
constant can be obtained from experiment for plotting  as the abscissa and /g as
ordinate.

       According to some books and researchers, this part is the importance of the di-
mensional analysis. It can be noticed that the initial guess merely and actually determine

342  CHAPTER 9. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

the results. If, however, the mass is added to considerations, a different result will be
obtained. If the guess is relevant and correct then the functional relationship can be
obtained by experiments.

9.2 Buckingham--Theorem

All the physical phenomena that is under the investigation have n physical effecting
parameters such that

     F1(q1, q2, q3,    , qn) = 0  (9.4)

where qi is the "i" parameter effecting the problem. For example, study of the pressure
difference created due to a flow in a pipe is a function of several parameters such

     P = f (L, D, , , U )           (9.5)

In this example, the chosen parameters are not necessarily the most important parame-
ters. For example, the viscosity,  can be replaced by dynamic viscosity, . The choice
is made normally as the result of experience and it can be observed that  is a function
of  and . Finding the important parameters is based on "good fortune" or perhaps
intuition. In that case, a new function can be defined as

     F (P, L, D, , , U ) = 0        (9.6)

Again as stated before, the study of every individual parameter will create incredible
amount of data. However, Buckingham's (Buckingham 1915a) methods suggested to
reduce the number of parameters. If independent parameters of same physical situation
is m thus in general it can be written as

     F2(1, 2, 3,    , m) = 0      (9.7)

If there are n variables in a problem and these variables contain m primary dimensions
(for example M, L, T), then the equation relating all the variables will have (n-m)
dimensionless groups.

       There are 2 conditions on the dimensionless parameters:

1. Each of the fundamental dimensions must appear in at least one of the m variables

2. It must not be possible to form a dimensionless group from one of the variables
   within a recurring set. A recurring set is a group of variables forming a dimen-
   sionless group.

       In the case of the pressure difference in the pipe (Equation (9.6)) there are 6
variables or n = 6. The number of the fundamental dimensions is 3 that is m = 3 ([M],
[L], [t]) The choice of fundamental or basic units is arbitrary in that any construction
of these units is possible. For example, another combination of the basic units is time,
force, mass is a proper choice. According to Buckingham's theorem the number of
9.2. BUCKINGHAM--THEOREM                                         343

dimensionless groups is n - m = 6 - 3 = 3. It can be written that one dimensionless
parameters is a function of two other parameter such as

1 = f (2, 3)                                                     (9.8)

If indeed such a relationship exists, then, the number of parameters that control the
problem is reduced and the number of experiments that need to be carried is considerably
smaller. Note, the -theorem does not specify how the parameters should be selected
nor what combination is preferred.

9.2.1 Construction of the Dimensionless Parameters

In the construction of these parameters it must be realized that every dimensionless
parameters has to be independent. The meaning of independent is that one dimen-
sionless parameter is not a multiply or a division of another dimensional parameter. In
the above example there are three dimensionless parameters which required of at least
one of the physical parameter per each dimensionless parameter. Additionally, to make
these dimensionless parameters independent they cannot be multiply or division of each
other.

       For the pipe problem above, and D have the same dimension and therefore
both cannot be chosen as they have the same dimension. One possible combination
is of D, U and  are chosen as the recurring set. The dimensions of these physical
variables are: D = [L1], velocity of U = [L t-1] and density as  = [M L-3]. Thus,
the first term D can provide the length, [L], the second term, U , can provide the time
[t], and the third term,  can provide the mass [M ]. The fundamental units, L, t, and
M are length, time and mass respectively. The fundamental units can be written in
terms of the physical units. The first term L is the described by D with the units of
[L]. The time, [t], can be expressed by D/U . The mass, [M ], can be expressed by
 D3. Now the dimensionless groups can be constructed by looking at the remaining
physical parameters, P , D and . The pressure difference, P , has dimensions of
[M L-1 t-2]. Therefore, P M -1 L t2 is a dimensionless quantity and these values
were calculated just above this line. Thus, the first dimensionless group is

[M L-1 t-2]               [M -1]                  [t2] unitless

                                             [L]  D2 P
                                                  U2 = U2

1 = P  D3 D

The second dimensionless group (using D) is

                          [L] [L-1]

2 = D                             -1 = D                         (9.10)

       This analysis is not unique and there can be several other possibilities for selecting
dimensionless parameters which are "legitimately" correct for this approach.

       There are roughly three categories of methods for obtaining the dimensionless
parameters. The first one solving it in one shot. This method is simple and useful for
a small number of parameters. Yet this method becomes complicated for large number
of parameters. The second method, some referred to as the building blocks method, is
described above. The third method is by using dimensional matrix which is used mostly
by mathematicians and is less useful for engineering purposes.

       The second and third methods require to identification of the building blocks.
These building blocks are used to construct the dimensionless parameters. There are
several requirements on these building blocks which were discussed on page 342. The
main point that the building block unit has to contain at least the basic or fundamental
unit. This requirement is logical since it is a building block. The last method is mostly
used by mathematicians which leads and connects to linear algebra. The fact that this
method used is the hall mark that the material was written by mathematician. Here,
this material will be introduced for completeness sake with examples and several terms
associated with this technique.

9.2.2 Basic Units Blocks

In Thermo-Fluid science there are several basic physical quantities which summarized
in Table 9.1. In the table contains two additional physical/basic units that appear in
magnetohydrodynamics (not commonly use in fluid mechanics). Many (almost all) of
the engineering dimensions used in fluid mechanics can be defined in terms of the four
basic physical dimensions M , L ,t and . The actual basic units used can be S.I. such as
kilograms, meters, seconds and Kelvins/Celsius or English system or any other system.
In using basic new basic physical units, M , L, t, and  or the old system relieves the
discussion from using particular system measurements. The density, for example, units
are M ass/Length3 and in the new system the density will be expressed as M/L3 while
in S.I. kg/m3 and English system it slug/f t3. A common unit used in Fluid Mechanics
is the Force, which expressed in SI as Newton [N ]. The Newton defined as a force which
causes a certain acceleration of a specific mass. Thus, in the new system the force it
will be defined as M L t-2. There are many parameters that contains force which is
the source reason why the old (or alternative) system use the force instead the mass.

       There many physical units which are dimensionless by their original definition.
Examples to "naturally" being dimensionless are the angle, strains, ratio of specific
heats, k, friction coefficient, f and ratio of lengths. The angle represented by a ratio
of two sides of a triangle and therefor has no units nor dimensions. Strain is a ratio of
the change of length by the length thus has no units.

       Quantities used in engineering can be reduced to six basic dimensions which are
presented in Table 9.1. The last two are not commonly used in fluid mechanics and
temperature is only used sometimes. Many common quantities are presented in the
following Table 9.3.

     units appear as "s" while in small units as "sec."

9.2.3.1 One Shot Method: Constructing Dimensionless Parameters

In this method, the solution is obtained by assigning the powers to the affecting variables.
The results are used to compare the powers on both sides of the equation. Several
examples are presented to demonstrate this method.

this limited information construct a re-

Solution                                                                   (9.5.b)

     In equations (9.5.c) there are three equations and 4 unknowns. Expressing all the
     three variables in term of d to obtain

                                    a = 2-d                                (9.5.e)

                                    c = 1-d

     Substituting equation (9.5.e) into equation (9.5.c) results in    킺  (9.5.f )

     Or rearranging equation yields                        킺              (9.5.g)
                                           R = Constant  U r

     The relationship between the two sides in equation (9.5.g) is related to the two di-

     mensionless parameters. In dimensional analysis the functionality is not clearly defined

     by but rather the function of the parameters. Hence, a simple way, equation (9.5.g)

     can be represented as

                            R = Constant f                                (9.5.h)

affects the question at hand then this is the functionality form. However, this example

demonstrates the short coming of the Buckingham's method. If instead the star mass,

Ms, is selected instead of density and radius (which determine the star mass any way)

then                                               L3 c

Equation (9.6.b) leads to a = c = 1/2 and b = -3/2. Thus, the relationship can be

written

                  = Constant f  Ms G                                   (9.6.c)

The relationship dim:eq:starOscillationSol2 and (9.6.a) are similar since   Ms/R3.
Some suggested that first equation is better (more correct) to used less parameters
appear. This suggestion is not correct but depend on the circumstances. Only if the
governing equations were written, this situation can be analyzed.

       An example of a ship6 is be a typical example were more than one dimensionless

Example 9.7: Propeller                                             Level: Basic

The modern ship today is equipped with a propeller as the main propulsion

mechanism. The thrust, T is known to be a function of the radius, r, the fluid

density, , relative velocity of the ship to the water, U , rotation speed, rpm or

N , and fluid viscosity, . Assume that no other parameter affects the thrust,

find the functionality of these parameters and the thrust.

Solution

The general solution under these assumptions leads to solution of

It is convenient to arrange the dimensions and basic units in table. This table is

     Using the matrix results in                                          (9.7.b)
                          M Lt-2 = La (Lt)b M L-3 c t-t d M L-1t-t e

     This matrix leads to three equations.

      Mass, M                          1=   c+e                           (9.7.c)

     The solution of this system is

                                     a= 2+d-e                             (9.7.d)

                                     c= 1-e

     Substituting the solution (9.7.d) into equation (9.7.a) yields       (9.7.e)
                                   T = C r(2+d-e) (2-d-e) U (1-e) N d 킼

     Rearranging equation (9.7.e) provides

     T = C  U2 r2                           U r d  rN e                   (9.7.f )
                                                   U

     From dimensional analysis point of view the units under the power d and e are dimen-
     sionless. Hence, in general it can be written that

                                     T = f U r g rN                       (9.7.g)

     where f and g are arbitrary functions to be determined by experiments. Note the rpm
     or N refers to the rotation in radian per second even though rpm refers to revolution
     per minute.
     It has to be mentioned that these experiments have to constructed in such way that the
     initial conditions and the boundary conditions are somehow "eliminated." In practical
     purposes the thrust is a function of Reynolds number and several other parameters. In
     this example, a limited information is provided on which only Reynolds number with
     a additional dimensionless parameter is mentioned above.

     Example 9.8: Small Disturbance                          Level: Intermediate

     The surface wave is a small disturbance propagating in a liquid surface. Assume

     that this speed for a certain geometry is a function of the surface tension,

     , density, , and the wave length of the disturbance (or frequency of the

disturbance. The knowledge when this disturbance is important and is detected

because the chemical kinetics. The calibration of the process was done with

satisfactory results. Technician by mistake releases a chemical which reduces

the surface tension by half. Estimate the new speed of the disturbance.

Solution

In the problem the functional analysis was defined as

                     U = f (, , )                                        (9.8.a)

Equation (9.8.a) leads to three equations as

          U   a   b  c

             time, t                          -2b = -1

The solution of equation set (9.8.c) results in

                          U=                                             (9.8.d)
                                    

Hence reduction of the surface tension by half will reduce the disturbance velocity by
1/ 2.

it could have? Flow is achieved steady state for a very long two dimensional

     Solution

     The numerator and denominator have to have the same units.

                                   t3 = t3

     The averaged velocity could be a represented (there are better methods or choices)
     of the energy flowing in the channel. The averaged velocity is U/2 and the velocity
     derivative is dU/d = constant = U/ . With these value of the Diss number is

                                   U2    = 4
                                           U

                                      8

     The results show that Dissipation number is not a function of the velocity. Yet, the
     energy lost is a function of the velocity square E  Diss  U .

or several dimensionless parameters without going for the whole calculations of the
dimensionless parameters.

The first dimensionless parameter 1 represents the dimensionless flow rate. The sec-
ond number represents the importance of the compressibility of the liquid in the pump.
Some argue that this parameter is similar to Mach number (speed of disturbance to
speed of sound. The third parameter is similar to Reynolds number since the combina-
tion N D can be interpreted as velocity. The fourth number represents the production
quality (mostly mode by some casting processa). The fifth dimensionless parameter is
related to the ratio of the body forces to gravity forces. The last number represent
the "effectiveness" of pump or can be viewed as dimensionless pressure obtained from
the pump.
In practice, the roughness is similar to similar size pump and can be neglected. How-
ever, if completely different size of pumps are compared then this number must be
considered. In cases where the compressibility of the liquid can be neglected or the
pressure increase is relatively insignificant, the second dimensionless parameter can be
neglected.
A pump is a device that intends to increase the pressure. The increase of the pressure
involves energy inserted to to system. This energy is divided to a useful energy (
pressure increase) and to overcome the losses in the system. These losses has several
components which includes the friction in the system, change order of the flow and
"ideal flow" loss. The most dominate loss in pump is loss of order, also know as
turbulence (not covered yet this book.). If this physical phenomenon is accepted than

       In the progression of the development of the technique the new evolution is the

mathematical method. It can be noticed that in the previous technique the same matrix
was constructed with different vector solution (the right hand side of the equation). This
fact is the source to improve the previous method. However, it has to be cautioned
that this technique is overkill in most cases. Actually, this author is not aware for any
case this technique has any advantage over the "building block" technique.

       In the following hypothetical example demonstrates the reason for the reduction
of variables. Assume that water is used to transport uniform grains of gold. The total
amount grains of gold is to be determined per unit length. For this analysis it is assumed
that grains of gold grains are uniformly distributed. The following parameters and their
dimensions are considered:

9.2.4 Similarity and Similitude

One of dimensional analysis is the key point is the concept that the solution can be ob-
tained by conducting experiments on similar but not identical systems. The analysis here
suggests and demonstrates7 that the solution is based on several dimensionless num-
bers. Hence, constructing experiments of the situation where the same dimensionless
parameters obtains could, in theory, yield a solution to problem at hand. Thus, knowing
what are dimensionless parameters should provide the knowledge of constructing the
experiments.

       In this section deals with these similarities which in the literature some refer as
analogy or similitude. It is hard to obtain complete similarity. Hence, there is discussion
how similar the model is to the prototype. It is common to differentiate between
three kinds of similarities: geometric, kinetics, and dynamic. This characterization
started because historical reasons and it, some times, has merit especially when applying
Buckingham's method. In Nusselt's method this differentiation is less important.

Geometric Similarity

       One of the logical part of dimensional analysis is how the experiences should be
similar to actual body they are supposed to represent. This logical conclusion is an add-
on and this author is not aware of any proof to this requirement based on Buckingham's
methods. Ironically, this conclusion is based on Nusselt's method which calls for the
same dimensionless boundary conditions. Again, Nusselt's method, sometimes or even
often, requires similarity because the requirements to the boundary conditions. Here8
this postulated idea is adapted.

    7This statement is too strong. It has to be recognized that the results are as good as the guessing
which in most cases is poor.

    8Because this book intend to help students to pass their exams, this book present what most
instructors required. It well established that this over-strict requirement and under Nusselt's method
it can be overcome.
9.2. BUCKINGHAM--THEOREM                                                    357

Under this idea the prototype area has to be square of the actual model or

Ap =                      1 prototy pe  2             2              (9.12)

                                              2m

where 1 and 2 are the typical dimensions in two different directions and subscript p
refers to the prototype and m to the model. Under the same argument the volumes
change with the cubes of lengths.

       In some situations, the model faces inability to match two or more dimensionless
parameters. In that case, the solution is to sacrifice the geometric similarity to minimize
the undesirable effects. For example, river modeling requires to distort vertical scales
to eliminate the influence of surface tension or bed roughness or sedimentation.

Kinematic Similarity

       The perfect kinetics similarity is obtained when there are geometrical similarity
and the motions of the fluid above the objects are the same. If this similarity is not
possible, then the desire to achieve a motion "picture" which is characterized by ratios
of corresponding velocities and accelerations is the same throughout the actual flow
field. It is common in the literature, to discuss the situations where the model and
prototype are similar but the velocities are different by a different scaling factor.

       The geometrical similarity aside the shapes and counters of the object it also can
requires surface roughness and erosion of surfaces of mobile surfaces or sedimentation
of particles surface tensions. These impose demands require a minimum on the friction
velocity. In some cases the minimum velocity can be Umin = w/. For example,
there is no way achieve low Reynolds number with thin film flow.

Dynamics Similarity

       The dynamic similarity has many confusing and conflicting definitions in the lit-
erature. Here this term refers to similarity of the forces. It follows, based on Newton's
second law, that this requires similarity in the accelerations and masses between the
model and prototype. It was shown that the solution is a function of several typical
dimensionless parameters. One of such dimensionless parameter is the Froude number.
The solution for the model and the prototype are the same, since both cases have the
same Froude number. Hence it can be written that

                          U2            U2                           (9.13)

                          gm

It can be noticed that t  /U thus equation (9.13) can be written as

                          U             U                            (9.14)
                                  =     gt p

                          gt m

and noticing that a  U/t

                          a   =         a                            (9.15)

and a  F/m and m =  3 hence a = F/ 3. Substituting into equation (9.15) yields

           F                     F Fp  p 3                        (9.16)
           3 m=                  3 p = Fm = ( 3)m

       In this manipulation, it was shown that the ratio of the forces in the model and
forces in the prototype is related to ratio of the dimensions and the density of the same
systems. While in Buckingham's methods these hand waiving are not precise, the fact
remains that there is a strong correlation between these forces. The above analysis was
dealing with the forces related to gravity. A discussion about force related the viscous
forces is similar and is presented for the completeness.

       The Reynolds numbers is a common part of Navier-Stokes equations and if the
solution of the prototype and for model to be same, the Reynolds numbers have to be
same.

multiplying by the length on both side of the fraction by U as

     탏 U m 탏 U p                 ( U/t)p ( U )p

Noticing that U/t is the acceleration and  is the mass thus the forces on the right
hand side are proportional if the Re number are the same. In this analysis/discussion,
it is assumed that a linear relationship exist. However, the Navier-Stokes equations
are not linear and hence this assumption is excessive and this assumption can produce
another source of inaccuracy.

       While this explanation is a poor practice for the real world, it common to provide
questions in exams and other tests on this issue. This section is provide to this purpose.

     Example 9.11: Tube Height                                    Level: Simple

     The liquid height rises in a tube due to the surface tension,  is h. Assume
     that this height is a function of the body force (gravity, g), fluid density, ,
     radius, r, and the contact angle . Using Buckingham's theorem develop the
     relationship of the parameters. In experimental with a diameter 0.001 [m] and
     surface tension of 73 milli-Newtons/meter and contact angle of 75 a height is
     0.01 [m] was obtained. In another situation, the surface tension is 146 milli-
     Newtons/meter, the diameter is 0.02 [m] and the contact angle and density
     remain the same. Estimate the height.

                                                                       9.11
   Solution

It was given that the height is a function of several parameters such

              h = f (, , g, , r)                                       (9.11.a)

There are 6 parameters in the problem and the 3 basic parameters [L, M, t]. Thus
the number of dimensionless groups is (6-3=3). In Buckingham's methods it is either
that the angle isn't considered or the angle is dimensionless group by itself. Five
parameters are left to form the next two dimensionless groups.
One technique that was suggested is the possibility to use three parameters which
contain the basic parameters [M, L, t] and with them form a new group with each of
the left over parameters. In this case, density,  for [M] and d for [L] and gravity, g
for time [t]. For the surface tension,  it becomes

       ar                 c                           1

           b                                             0 00          (9.11.b)
M L-3         L t-2 ig M t-2 = M L t
       L

Equation (9.11.b) leads to three equations which are

           Mass, M           a+1= 0

           Length, L -3a + b + c = 0                                   (9.11.c)

           time, t           -2c - 2 = 0

                                                                                                        
the solution is a = -1 b = -2 c = -1 Thus the dimensionless group is 2 .

                                                                                                      r g
The third group obtained under the same procedure to be h/r.
In the second part the calculations for the estimated of height based on the new ratios.
From the above analysis the functional dependency can be written as

              h =f                                                     (9.11.d)
              d              5 ,
                          r g

which leads to the same angle and the same dimensional number. Hence,

           h1 = h2 = f          ,                                      (9.11.e)
           d1 d2              r2 g

Since the dimensionless parameters remain the same, the ratio of height and radius
must be remain the same. Hence,

       h2 = h1 d2 = 0.01  0.002 = 0.002                               (9.11.f )

     Example 9.12: Functionality of Parameters                            Level: Basic

     Use the Buckingham's methods and attempt to find functionality of various

     parameters that affect the stability of floating bodies. For this question assume

     that the parameters that affect the solution are the density and others parame-

     ters that seem reasonable. In Chapter 4 a discussion on floating bodies stability

     was presented. Assume that the solution is unknown and no prior knowledge

     exist.

     Solution

     The stability is an old problem that have been around for more than 600 years. While
     the actual solution was presented in this book for the first time, no dimensional analysis
     was carried on this stability that the undersign is aware of it. The gravity and the
     typical dimension of the geometry are reasonable to assume that affect the stability.
     Assume that the tilding angle indicating the stability as the body will rotate until
     reach a stable point. As it was discussed earlier, the large size of the floating body
     reduce role the surface tension. Additionally, the speed of the rolling is not in question
     but rather the location of rest hence the viscosity does not play a role. With the
     illumination of these factors, the only possible factors with Buckingham's logic are

                           = f (, d, V, g)                                (9.12.a)

     In written Eq. (9.12.a) it is assumed that the area with some kind modifier (projected
     area, etc) is extraneous parameter. It also can be assumed for the argument can
     be said for the volume. This inability to find what should be considered is a major
     weakness of the  theory. Utilizing the standard procedure yields

                 ad          V                         g
                                                                 1
                          b      c                                  0 00
               M L-3 L       L3     L t-2 = M L t                         (9.12.b)

     Equation (??) leads to three equations which are

                 Mass, M                               a= 0

                 Length, L -3a + b + 3c - 2 = 0                           (9.12.c)

                 time, t                               -2 = 0

     This set (9.12.c) has solution that does not make sense. It suggest that gravity does
     not play role (accidentally) is true. However, it suggest that density does not play role
     which is not true. It can be noticed that if the volume will be used the same results
     are obtained.

At the time, just before publishing version 0.4 it is habit to do last minute literature
review to check for items could be missing. A paper "Simple Computational Platform
of Ship Stability for Engineering Education" by Amin etc in 3rd IUGRC International
Undergraduate Research Conference, Military Technical College, Cairo, Egypt, July 30-
August 2, 2018 was discovered. Several points that made in the discussion earlier are
relavent to this paper as well. One important point of the paper while not exacly related

to dimensional analysis is the rotation point of the ship. And kudos for pointing to the
possibilty that it could be around Metacenter point. This possible view is reverse of the
common preseption that the buoyancy centroid vertically points or under to Metacenter.
It is possibley important obsrvation.

9.3 Nusselt's Technique

The Nusselt's method is a bit more labor intensive, in that the governing equations with
the boundary and initial conditions are used to determine the dimensionless parameters.
In this method, the boundary conditions together with the governing equations are taken
into account as opposed to Buckingham's method. A common mistake is to ignore the
boundary conditions or initial conditions. The parameters that results from this process
are the dimensional parameters which control the problems. An example comparing the
Buckingham's method with Nusselt's method is presented.

       In this method, the governing equations, initial condition and boundary conditions
are normalized resulting in a creation of dimensionless parameters which govern the
solution. It is recommended, when the reader is out in the real world to simply abandon
Buckingham's method all together. This point can be illustrated by example of flow
over inclined plane. For comparison reasons Buckingham's method presented and later
the results are compared with the results from Nusselt's method.

Example 9.13: Body's Corners                           Level: Intermediate

Stability analysis of boating bodies is determined by geometrical parameters.

On of these parameters is number of corners in the liquid. For example, a

rectangular extruded floating body can be in either of 1, 2, and 3 corners

(see Biran, Adrian, and Ruben Lopez Pulido. Ship hydrostatics and stability.

Butterworth-Heinemann, 2013. 2nd edition p. 73). Use Nusselt's methods to

find dimensionless which affecting the problem. Assume that Archimedes's law

applied to floating bodies is known in this analysis.

Solution

If the rectangular is floating then there three distinct cases there can be 1, 2, and
3 corner. When the rectangular standing upright there are two corners. It can be
observed that the buoyancy centroid is determined by Archimedes equation i.e.

                           2 B = s2 G                  (9..a)

where B is the distance from bottom (at upright position) to the center (centroid) of
the displaced liquid. Archimedes' law determine that the some volume (area in 2D
case) has to be maintained. When s = 0.5  then it is a special case that the gravity
center is fixed to liquid surface and the body rotates around this fix point. In that, the
extreme case where there is two corners at all time. At 45 is the controversial point
there could be said that there is one corner with two "half" corners. These two "half"
corners can be said to be either 3 corners in the liquid or one. Another option is that
two halves can be combine one and in that case continuously two corners scenario. It
has to be emphasized that it does not mater if the body is square or rectangle. In any

     case, when solid density about or lower than the extreme case determine the range in

     which point B can be. For the case where B upright is below 1/4 than the maximum

     corner can be only 2 (and 1 on the most cases). Thus the location of B is determined

     by Archimedes' law. Hence, the density ratio determine the number of corners in the

     liquid. In fact, defining the number of corners in the liquid as the average number of

     corner as a function of the angle. This number approach to one as the s/ - 0
     and when s/ - 1 the number of corner approach to 3.

     Example 9.14: 2-D Inclined Plane         Level: Intermediate

     Utilize the Buckingham's method to analyze a two dimensional flow in incline

     plane. Assume that the flow infinitely long and thus flow can be analyzed per

     width which is a function of several parameters. The potential parameters are

     the angle of inclination, , liquid viscosity, , gravity, g, the height of the liquid,

     h, the density, , and liquid velocity, U . Assume that the flow is not affected

     by the surface tension (liquid), . You furthermore are to assume that the flow

     is stable. Develop the relationship between the flow to the other parameters.

     Solution

     Under the assumptions in the example presentation leads to following

                         m = f (, , g, , U )                                      (9.20)

     The number of basic units is three while the number of the parameters is six thus the
     difference is 6 - 3 = 3. Those groups (or the work on the groups creation) further
     can be reduced the because angle  is dimensionless. The units of parameters can be
     obtained in Table 9.3 and summarized in the following table.

The conclusion from this analysis are that the number of controlling parameters totaled
in three and that the initial conditions and boundaries are irrelevant.

       A small note, it is well established that the combination of angle gravity or effective
body force is significant to the results. Hence, this analysis misses, at the very least,
the issue of the combination of the angle gravity. Nusselt's analysis requires that the
governing equations along with the boundary and initial conditions to be written. While
the analytical solution for this situation exist, the parameters that effect the problem
are the focus of this discussion.

       In Chapter 8, the Navier-Stokes equations were developed. These equations along
with the energy, mass or the chemical species of the system, and second laws governed
almost all cases in thermo-fluid mechanics. This author is not aware of a compelling

With boundary conditions

                          Ux(y = 0) = U0xf (x)             (9.23)
                          Ux (y = h) = 0f (x)

The value U0x and 0 are the characteristic and maximum values of the velocity or the
shear stress, respectively. and the initial condition of

                          Ux(x = 0) = U0y f (y)            (9.24)

where U0y is characteristic initial velocity.
       These sets of equations (9.21)-(9.24) need to be converted to dimensionless

equations. It can be noticed that the boundary and initial conditions are provided in a
special form were the representative velocity multiply a function. Any function can be
presented by this form.

       In the process of transforming the equations into a dimensionless form associated
with some intelligent guess work. However, no assumption is made or required about
whether or not the velocity, in the y direction. The only exception is that the y com-
ponent of the velocity vanished on the boundary. No assumption is required about the
acceleration or the pressure gradient etc.

       The boundary conditions have typical velocities which can be used. The velocity
is selected according to the situation or the needed velocity. For example, if the effect
of the initial condition is under investigation than the characteristic of that velocity
should be used. Otherwise the velocity at the bottom should be used. In that case, the

    9In economics and several other areas, there are no governing equations established for the field nor
there is necessarily concept of conservation of something. However, writing the governing equations
will yield dimensionless parameters as good as the initial guess.
9.3. NUSSELT'S TECHNIQUE                                                              365

boundary conditions are

                                          Ux(y = 0) = f (x)               (9.25)
                                               U0x

                                           Ux (y = h) = 0 g(x)
                                             x

Now it is very convenient to define several new variables:

                         U=  Ux(x)
                              U0x

                         where :                                          (9.26)
                                      x
                                                     y
                              x=             y=
                                      h
                                                     h

The length h is chosen as the characteristic length since no other length is provided.
It can be noticed that because the units consistency, the characteristic length can be
used for "normalization" (see Example 9.15). Using these definitions the boundary and
initial conditions becomes

                                        U Ux(y=0) 0x = f (x)              (9.27)
                                        h  Ux (y = 1) = 0 g (x)
                                        U0x x
It commonly suggested to arrange the second part of equation (9.27) as

                         Ux (y = 1) = 0 U0x g (x)                         (9.28)
                         x               h                               (9.29)

Where new dimensionless parameter, the shear stress number is defined as

                             0 = 0 U0x
                                      h

With the new definition equation (9.28) transformed into

                         Ux (y = 1) = 0 g (x)                             (9.30)

                           Ux(y = h) = U0 a x2 + b exp(x)  (9.15.a)

Solution

The coefficients a and b multiply different terms and therefore must have different
units. The results must be unitless thus a

                                                x2         (9.15.b)

                              L0 = a L2 = a = L2 1

From equation (9.15.b) it clear the conversion of the first term is Ux = a h2x. The
exponent appears a bit more complicated as

L0 = b exp h x = b exp (h) exp x = b exp (h) exp (x)       (9.15.c)
                h                     h

Hence defining

                              b= 1                         (9.15.d)
                                   exp h

With the new coefficients for both terms and noticing that y = h - y = 1 now can
be written as

                           a       b

Ux(y = 1) = a h2 x2 + b exp (h) exp (x) = a x2 + b exp x   (9.15.e)
    U0

Where a and b are the transformed coefficients in the dimensionless presentation.

       After the boundary conditions the initial condition can undergo the non-
dimensional process. The initial condition (9.24) utilizing the previous definitions trans-
formed into

                              Ux(x = 0) = U0y f (y)                                (9.31)
                              U0x     U0x

Notice the new dimensionless group of the velocity ratio as results of the boundary
condition. This dimensionless number was and cannot be obtained using the Buck-
ingham's technique. The physical significance of this number is an indication to the
"penetration" of the initial (condition) velocity.

       The main part of the analysis if conversion of the governing equation into a di-
mensionless form uses previous definition with additional definitions. The dimensionless
time is defined as t = t U0x/h. This definition based on the characteristic time of

The pressure is normalized by the same initial pressure or the static pressure as
(P - P) / (P0 - P) and hence

                    P -P

Equation (9.39) show one common possibility of a dimensionless presentation of gov-
erning equation. The significance of the large and small value of the dimensionless
parameters will be discuss later in the book. Without actually solving the problem,
Nusselt's method provides several more parameters that were not obtained by the block
method. The solution of the governing equation is a function of all the parameters
present in that equation and boundaries condition as well the initial condition. Thus,
the solution is

           Ux = f x, y, Eu, Re, F r, , 0, fu, f , U0y                   (9.40)
                                                            U0x

The values of x, y depend on h and hence the value of h is an important parameter.
       It can be noticed with Buckingham's method, the number of parameters obtained

was only three (3) while Nusselt's method yields 12 dimensionless parameters. This is
a very significant difference between the two methods. In fact, there are numerous
examples in the literature that showing people doing experiments based on Bucking-
ham's methods. In these experiments, major parameters are ignored rendering these
experiments useless in many cases and deceiving.

Common Transformations

       Fluid mechanics in particular and Thermo-Fluid field in general have several com-
mon transformations that appear in boundary conditions, initial conditions and equa-
tions10. It recognized that not all the possibilities can presented in the example shown
above. Several common boundary conditions which were not discussed in the above
example are presented below. As an initial matter, the results of the non dimensional
transformation depends on the selection of what and how is nondimensionalization car-
ried. This section of these parameters depends on what is investigated. Thus, one of
the general nondimensionalization of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations will be
discussed at end of this chapter.

       Boundary conditions are divided into several categories such as a given value to
the function11, given derivative (Neumann b.c.), mixed condition, and complex condi-
tions. The first and second categories were discussed to some degree earlier and will

   10Many of these tricks spread in many places and fields. This author is not aware of a collection of

this kind of transforms.
   11The mathematicians like to call Dirichlet conditions

be expanded later. The third and fourth categories were not discussed previously. The
nondimensionalization of the boundary conditions of the first category requires finding
and diving the boundary conditions by a typical or a characteristic value. The second
category involves the nondimensionalization of the derivative. In general, this process
involve dividing the function by a typical value and the same for length variable (e.g.
x) as

                       U  U0 U               U                          (9.41)
                       x = U0  x      =

                                         U0 x

In the Thermo-Fluid field and others, the governing equation can be of higher order
than second order12. It can be noticed that the degree of the derivative boundary
condition cannot exceed the derivative degree of the governing equation (e.g. second
order equation has at most the second order differential boundary condition.). In general
"nth" order differential equation leads to

                       nU U0  U0 n U     U0 nU                          (9.42)
                       xn = n  x n    =n n

                                              x

       The third kind of boundary condition is the mix condition. This category includes
combination of the function with its derivative. For example a typical heat balance at
liquid solid interface reads

                                               T                        (9.43)
                          h(T0 - T ) = -k x

This kind of boundary condition, since derivative of constant is zero, translated to

    h@(T@0 -@T@m@a@x)    T0 - T        k @(T@0 -@T@m@a@x) -    T - T0   (9.44)
                       T0 - Tmax  =-
                                                             T0 - Tmax
                                                                 x

                                                             

or

highest derivative can be fifth order derivative.
370           CHAPTER 9. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

and Tmax is the maximum or reference temperature of the system.
       The last category is dealing with some non-linear conditions of the function with

its derivative. For example,

     P    11      =  r1 + r2                                             (9.47)
             +       r1 r2

          r1 r2

Where r1 and r2 are the typical principal radii of the free surface curvature, and, , is
the surface tension between the gas (or liquid) and the other phase. The surface geom-
etry (or the radii) is determined by several factors which include the liquid movement
instabilities etc chapters of the problem at hand. This boundary condition (9.47) can
be rearranged to be

     P r1  r1 + r2 = Av  r1 + r2                                         (9.48)
          r2            r2

Where Av is Avi number . The Avi number represents the geometrical characteris-
tics combined with the material properties. The boundary condition (9.48) can be
transferred into

          P r1 = Av                                                      (9.49)
             

Where P is the pressure difference between the two phases (normally between the
liquid and gas phase).

       One of advantage of Nusselt's method is the Object-Oriented nature which allows
one to add additional dimensionless parameters for addition "degree of freedom." It is
common assumption to initially assume that liquid is incompressible. If greater accuracy
is needed than this assumption is removed. In that case, a new dimensionless parameters
is introduced as the ratio of the density to a reference density as

                                                                         (9.50)
          =

               0

In case of ideal gas model with isentropic flow this assumption becomes

                     1

        =  = P0 n                                                       (9.51)
          0       P

The power n depends on the gas properties.

Characteristics Values

       Normally, the characteristics values are determined by physical. values e.g The
diameter of cylinder as a typical length . There are several situations where the char-
acteristic length, velocity, for example, are determined by the physical properties of
the fluid(s). The characteristic velocity can determined from U0 = 2P0/. The
characteristic length can be determined from ratio of = P/.

Example 9.16: Renewable Energy                Level: Intermediate

One idea of renewable energy is to use and to utilize the high concentration

of of brine water such as in the Salt Lake and the Salt Sea (in Israel). This

process requires analysis the mass transfer process. The governing equation is

non-linear and this example provides opportunity to study nondimensionalizing

of this kind of equation. The conversion of the species yields a governing
nonlinear equation13 for such process is

          U0 CA =  DAB CA                                            (9.16.a)
              x y (1 - XA) y

Where the concentration, CA is defended as the molar density i.e. the number
of moles per volume. The molar fraction, XA is defined as the molar fraction
of species A divide by the total amount of material (in moles). The diffusivity
coefficient, DAB is defined as penetration of species A into the material. What
are the units of the diffusivity coefficient? The boundary conditions of this
partial differential equation are given by

                          CA (y = ) = 0                              (9.16.b)
                           y

                                       CA(y = 0) = Ce                (9.16.c)
Where Ce is the equilibrium concentration. The initial condition is

                          CA(x = 0) = C0                             (9.16.d)

Select dimensionless parameters so that the governing equation and boundary
and initial condition can be presented in a dimensionless form. There is no need
to discuss the physical significance of the problem.

Solution

This governing equation requires to work with dimension associated with mass transfer
and chemical reactions, the "mole." However, the units should not cause confusion or
fear since it appear on both sides of the governing equation. Hence, this unit will be
canceled. Now the units are compared to make sure that diffusion coefficient is kept
the units on both sides the same. From units point of view, equation (9.16.a) can be
written (when the concentration is simply ignored) as

                    C       DAB C
          U x             y (1-X) y

          L &C = 1 DAB &C                                            (9.16.e)

          tL              L1L

It can be noticed that X is unitless parameter because two same quantities are divided.

          11                              L2                         (9.16.f )
          t = L2 DAB = DAB = t
372                                               CHAPTER 9. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

                                                                               2 End of Ex. 9.16
     Hence the units of diffusion coefficient are typically given by m /sec (it also can be

     observed that based on Fick's laws of diffusion it has the same units).

     The potential of possibilities of dimensionless parameter is large. Typically, dimen-

     sionless parameters are presented as ratio of two quantities. In addition to that, in

     heat and mass transfer (also in pressure driven flow etc.) the relative or reference to

     certain point has to accounted for. The boundary and initial conditions here provides

     the potential of the "driving force" for the mass flow or mass transfer. Hence, the

     potential definition is

                                            = CA - C0                                            (9.16.g)
                                                  Ce - C0

     With almost "standard" transformation

                                        x= x           y= y                                      (9.16.h)

     Hence the derivative of  with respect to time is

                  CA - C0                                            0  = CA
                    Ce - C0                                                Ce - C0 x             (9.16.i)
              =       x=                          CA - &C& b0
           x                       Ce - C0            x
                    

     In general a derivative with respect to x or y leave yields multiplication of      . Hence,
     equation (9.16.a) transformed into                                                  (9.16.j)

                    U0$(Ce$-C$$0)          = 1  DAB $(C$e -$C$$0) 
                                   x          y (1 - XA)                       y

                              U0               1       DAB 
                                           =2
                                   x              y (1 - XA) y

     Equation (9.16.j) like non-dimensionalized and proper version. However, the term
     XA, while is dimensionless, is not proper. Yet, XA is a function of  because it
     contains CA. Hence, this term, XA has to be converted or presented by . Using the
     definition of XA it can be written as

                              XA = CA = (Ce - C0) CA - C0 1                                      (9.16.k)
                                        C                  Ce - C0 C

     Thus the transformation in equation (9.16.k) another unexpected dimensionless pa-

     rameter as                         XA =  Ce - C0
                                                        C
                                                                                                 (9.16.l)

     Thus  number,  Ce -C0    was  not  expected  and  it  represent    ratio  of  the  driving  force  to
                        C

     the height of the concentration which was not possible to attend by Buckingham's

     method.

       The dimensional parameters that were used in the construction of the dimension-
less parameters in Table 9.8 are the characteristics of the system. Therefore there are
several definition of Reynolds number. In fact, in the study of the physical situations
often people refers to local Re number and the global Re number. Keeping this point
in mind, there several typical dimensions which need to be mentioned. The typical body

   14This number is named by Reiner, M. (1964), "The Deborah Number", Physics Today 17 (1): 62,
doi:10.1063/1.3051374. Reiner, a civil engineer who is considered the father of Rheology, named this
parameter because theological reasons perhaps since he was living in Israel.

force is the gravity g which has a direction to center of Earth. The elasticity E in case
of liquid phase is BT , in case of solid phase is Young modulus. The typical length is
denoted as and in many cases it is referred to as the diameter or the radius. The
density,  is referred to the characteristic density or density at infinity. The area, A in
drag and lift coefficients is referred normally to projected area.

       The frequency  or f is referred to as the "unsteadiness" of the system. Generally,
the periodic effect is enforced by the boundary conditions or the initial conditions. In
other situations, the physics itself instores or forces periodic instability. For example, flow
around cylinder at first looks like symmetrical situation. And indeed in a low Reynolds
number it is a steady state. However after a certain value of Reynolds number, vortexes
are created in an infinite parade and this phenomenon is called Von Karman vortex
street (see Figure 9.4) which named after Von Karman. These vortexes are created
in a non-symmetrical way and hence create an unsteady situation. When Reynolds
number increases, these vortexes are mixed and the flow becomes turbulent which, can
be considered a steady state15.

       The pressure P is the pressure at infinity or when the velocity is at rest. c is the
speed of sound of the fluid at rest or characteristic value. The value of the viscosity, 
is typically some kind averaged value. The inability to define a fix value leads also to
new dimensionless numbers which represent the deviations of these properties.

9.4.1 The Significance of these Dimensionless Numbers

Reynolds number, named in the honor of Reynolds, represents the ratio of the momen-
tum forces to the viscous forces. historically, this number was one of the first numbers
to be introduced to fluid mechanics. This number determines, in many cases, the flow
regime.

     Example 9.17: Eckert Number  Level: Intermediate

     Eckert number (Bird, Stewart, and Lightfoot 1960) determines whether the role

     of the momentum energy is transferred to thermal energy is significant to affect

     the flow. This effect is important in situations where high speed is involved.

     This fact suggests that Eckert number is related to Mach number. Determine

   15This is an example where the more unsteady the situation becomes the situation can be analyzed
as a steady state because averages have a significant importance.

this relationship and under what circumstances this relationship is true.

Solution

In Table 9.8 Mach and Eckert numbers are defined as

                        U2             M= U                              (9.17.a)

                      Cp T                         

The material which obeys the ideal flow modela (P/ = R T and P = C1 k) can be

written that

                          M =U   P =U                                    (9.17.b)

For the comparison, the reference temperature used to be equal to zero.  Thus Eckert
                                                                              (9.17.c)

              U=            U      k - 1 U 
  Ec =        Cp T         Rk    =                   = k-1M

The Eckert number and Mach number are related under ideal gas model and isentropic
relationship.

       Brinkman number measures of the importance of the viscous heating relative the
conductive heat transfer. This number is important in cases when a large velocity
change occurs over short distances such as lubricant, supersonic flow in rocket mechan-
ics creating large heat effect in the head due to large velocity (in many place it is a
combination of Eckert number with Brinkman number. The Mach number is based on
different equations depending on the property of the medium in which pressure distur-
bance moves through. Cauchy number and Mach number are related as well and see
Example 9.19 for explanation.

Example 9.18: Historical Reason                      Level: Simple

For historical reason some fields prefer to use certain numbers and not others.
For example in Mechanical engineers prefer to use the combination Re and W e
number while Chemical engineers prefers to use the combination of Re and the
Capillary number. While in some instances this combination is justified, other
cases it is arbitrary. Show what the relationship between these dimensionless
numbers.

       Euler number is named after Leonhard Euler (1707 1783), a German Physicist
who pioneered so many fields that it is hard to say what and where are his greatest
contributions. Euler's number and Cavitation number are essentially the same with
the exception that these numbers represent different driving pressure differences. This
difference from dimensional analysis is minimal. Furthermore, Euler number is referred
to as the pressure coefficient, Cp. This confusion arises in dimensional analysis because
historical reasons and the main focus area. The cavitation number is used in the study
of cavitation phenomena while Euler number is mainly used in calculation of resistances.

     Cauchy number is defined as                                                        (9.19.a)
                                                              U2                        (9.19.b)

                                                   Cau =
                                                                E

     The square root of Cauchy number is

                                                   U

                                  Cau =

                                                   E

                                                   

     In the liquid phase the speed of sound is approximated as                          (9.19.c)
                                                       c= E
                                                              

     Using equation (9.19.b) transforms equation (9.19.a) into

                                    U

                                Cau = = M                                               (9.52)
                                         c

     Thus the square root of Cau is equal to Mach number in the liquid phase. In the solid
     phase equation (9.19.c) is less accurate and speed of sound depends on the direction
     of the grains. However, as first approximation, this analysis can be applied also to the
     solid phase.

9.4.2 Relationship Between Dimensionless Numbers

The Dimensionless numbers since many of them have formulated in a certain field
tend to be duplicated. For example, the Bond number is referred in Europe as Eotvos
number. In addition to the above confusion, many dimensional numbers expressed the
same things under certain conditions. For example, Mach number and Eckert Number
under certain circumstances are same.

9.4.3 Examples for Dimensional Analysis

Example 9.24: Pump Similarity                           Level: Intermediate

The similarity of pumps is determined by comparing several dimensional numbers

among them are Reynolds number, Euler number, Rossby number etc. Assume

that the only numbers which affect the flow are Reynolds and Euler number.
The flow rate of the imaginary pump is 0.25 [m3/sec] and pressure increase

for this flow rate is 2 [Bar] with 2500 [kw]. Due to increase of demand, it is

suggested to replace the pump with a 4 times larger pump. What is the new

estimated flow rate, pressure increase, and power consumption?

Solution

It provided that the Reynolds number controls the situation. The density and viscosity
remains the same and hence

          Rem = Rep = Um Dm = Up Dp = Up = Dm Um                         (9.24.a)
                                                                     DP

It can be noticed that initial situation is considered as the model and while the new
pump is the prototype. The new flow rate, Q, depends on the ratio of the area and
velocity as

Qp        =  Ap Up        = Qp = Qm    Ap Up            Dp2 Up           (9.24.b)
                                              = Qm 2
Qm Am Um                               Am Um  Dm Um

Thus the prototype flow rate is

                                 Dp 3         3 m3                       (9.24.c)
             Qp = Qm                   = 0.25  4 = 16

     The new pressure is obtain by comparing the Euler number as     End of Ex. 9.24

                  Eup = Eum =            P =               P         (9.24.d)

                             (P )m ( U )m (U )m

Utilizing equation (9.24.a)

                                                 Dp 2
                             Pp = Pm

                                                 Dm

The power can be obtained from the following

                             W = F = F U = P A U                     (9.24.g)
                                      t

In this analysis, it is assumed that pressure is uniform in the cross section. This

assumption is appropriate because only the secondary flows in the radial direction (to

be discussed in this book section on pumps.). Hence, the ratio of power between the

two pump can be written as

                                   W p (P A U )p                     (9.24.h)
                                   W m = (P A U )m

Example 9.25: Simulating Water by Air                        Level: Intermediate

The flow resistance to flow of the water in a pipe is to be simulated by flow

of air. Estimate the pressure loss ratio if Reynolds number remains constant.

This kind of study appears in the industry in which the compressibility of the

air is ignored. However, the air is a compressible substance that flows the

ideal gas model. Water is a substance that can be considered incompressible

flow for relatively small pressure change. Estimate the error using the averaged

properties of the air.

Solution

For the first part, the Reynolds number is the single controlling parameter which affects

the pressure loss. Thus it can be written that the Euler number is function of the

Reynolds number.

                                    Eu = f (Re)                      (9.25.a)

     Thus, to have a similar situation the Reynolds and Euler have to be same.

                           Rep = Rem                     Eum = Eup  (9.25.b)

     Hence,

                                        Pp p Up

     and utilizing equation (9.25.c) yields

     Inserting the numerical values results in

                           Pm = 1  1000                           (9.25.f )

     It can be noticed that the density of the air changes considerably hence the calcula-
     tions produce a considerable error which can render the calculations useless (a typical
     problem of Buckingham's method). Assuming a new variable that effect the problem,
     air density variation. If that variable is introduced into problem, air can be used to
     simulate water flow. However as a first approximation, the air properties are calculated
     based on the averaged values between the entrance and exit values. If the pressure

    Example 9.27: AP Physics                                        Level: Intermediate

In AP physics in 2005 the first question reads "A ball of mass M is thrown

vertically upward with an initial speed of U0. Does it take longer for the ball to
rise to its maximum height or to fall from its maximum height back to the height

from which it was thrown? It also was mentioned that resistance is proportional

to ball velocity (Stoke flow). Justify your answer." Use the dimensional analysis

to examine this situation.

Solution

The parameters that can effect the situation are (initial) velocity of the ball, air resis-
tance (assuming Stokes flow e.g. the resistance is function of the velocity), maximum
height, and gravity. Functionality of these parameters can be written as

                            t = f (U, k, H, m, g)                    (9.27.a)

The time up and/or down must be written in the same fashion since fundamental prin-
ciple of Buckingham's  theorem the functionally is unknown but only dimensionless
parameters are dictated. Hence, no relationship between the time up and down can
be provided.
However, Nusselt's method provides first to written the governing equations. The
governing equation for the ball climbing up is

                            m dU = -m g - k U                        (9.27.b)
                                dt

when the negative sign indicates that the positive direction is up. The initial condition

is that

                                 U (0) = U0                          (9.27.c)
384                                          CHAPTER 9. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

     The governing equation the way down is             End of Ex. 9.27

                                m dU = -m g + k U       (9.27.d)
                                    dt

     with initial condition of

                                        U (0) = 0       (9.27.e)

     Equation (9.27.d) has no typical velocity (assuming at this stage that solution was not
     solved ever before). Dividing equation (9.27.d) by m g and inserting the gravitation
     constant into the derivative results in

                                        dU = -1 + k U   (9.27.f )
                                d (g t)            mg

     The gravity constant, g, could be inserted because it is constant. Equation suggests
     that velocity should be normalized by as dimensionless group, k U / m g. Without
     solving the equations, it can be observed that value of dimensionless group above
     or below one change the characteristic of the governing equation (positive slop or
     negative slop). Non-dimensioning of initial condition (9.27.c) yields

                                        k U (0) = k U0  (9.27.g)
                                         mg mg

     In this case, if the value k U0/ m g is above one change the characteristic of the
     situation. This exercise what not to solve this simple Physics mechanics problem

     but rather to demonstrate the power of dimensional analysis power. So, What this

     information tell us? In the case the supper critical initial velocity, the ball can be
     above critical velocity k U0 > 1 on the up. However the ball never can be above

                                   mg
     the critical velocity and hence the time up will shorter the time done. For the initial

     velocity below the critical velocity, while it is know that the answer is the same, the

     dimensional analysis does not provide a solution. On the way up ball can start

   Solution

The original problem was constructed so it was suitable to the 11 years old author's
daughter who was doing her precalculus. However, it appears that this question can
be used to demonstrate some of the power of the dimensional analysis. Using the
Buckingham's method it is assumed that diameter is a function of the velocities and
lengths. Hence, the following can be written

                                D = f ( 1, 2, UA, UB)         (9.28.a)

Where D is the river width. Hence, according basic idea the following can be written

                                D = 1 1 a b UAc UB d          (9.28.b)

The solution of equation (9.28.b) requires that

                                     D = [L]a [L]b L c L d    (9.28.c)
                                                          TT

The time has to be zero hence it requires that

                                    0=c+d                     (9.28.d)

The units length requires that

                                    1=a+b+c+d                 (9.28.e)

Combined equation (9.28.d) with equation (9.28.e) results in

                                    1=a+b                     (9.28.f )

It can noticed that symmetry arguments require that a and b must be identical. Hence,
a = b = 1/2 and the solutions is of the form D = f ( 1 2). From the analytical
solution it was found that this solution is wrong.
Another approach utilizing the minimized Buckingham's approach reads

                                    D = f ( 1, UA)            (9.28.g)

In the standard form this leads to

                                    D = [L]a L b              (9.28.h)
                                                   T

Which leads to the requirements of b = 0 and a = 1. Which again conflict with the

actual analytical solution.

Using Nusselt's method requires to write the governing equation. The governing

equations are based equating the time traveled to first and second meeting as the

following

                                    1 = D- 1                  (9.28.i)
                                    UA  UB

At the second meeting the time is

                                D+ 2 = 2D- 2                  (9.28.j)

     Equations (9.28.i) and (9.28.j) have three unknowns D, UA and UB. The non-
     dimensioning process can be carried by dividing governing equations by D and multiply

     by UB to become

                      1 = 1 - 1 UA                               (9.28.k)
                                        UB

                      1 + 2 = 2 - 2 UA                           (9.28.l)
                                              UB

     Equations (9.28.k) and (9.28.l) have three unknowns. However, the velocity ratio

     is artificial parameter or dependent parameter. Hence division of the dimensionless

     governing equations yield one equation with one unknown as

                         1 = 1- 1                                (9.28.m)
                      1+ 2 2- 2

     Equation 9.28.m determines that 1 is a function of 2. It can be noticed that D, 1
     and 2 are connected. Hence, knowing two parameters leads to the solution of the
     missing parameter. From dimensional analysis it can be written that the

                                       2 1 -1                    (9.28.n)
                      2 = f( 1) = 1 - 1

                                        1+ 1
                                             1- 1

     It can be concluded that river width is a function of implicit of 1 and 2. Clearly the

     Nusselt's technique provided write based to obtain the dimensionless parameters. A

     bit smarter selection of the normalizing parameter can provide explicit solution. An

     alternative definition of dimensionless parameters of D = D/ 1 and 2 = 2/ 1 can

     provide the need path. Equation (9.28.m) can be converted quadratic equation for D

     as

                         1 = D-1                                 (9.28.o)
                      D- 2 2D- 2

     Equation (9.28.o) is quadratic which can be solved analytically. The solution can be

     presented as

                      D = 1f 2                                   (9.28.p)

     Lumped Capacity System refers to a systems were the heat conduction is faster

     then the heat convection process. This situation is typical when to small metal

     is placed into cooling air. This situations can be approximated by Newton Law

     of cooling. Assume that dimensional analysis indeed show that the situation for

     Newton law of cooling. The temperature of the metal object is measured at two

     different times and the temperature was recorded. Find what parameters effect

   Solution

The Buckingham method requires that the parameters should be guessed. In this
situation some knowledge of the problem can be helpful. It is logical to assume
that the heat conduction coefficient, k, surface area, A, volume, V , density, , heat
capacity, Cv, the convection coefficient, h and temperature difference are the effecting
parameters of the time. Thus it can be written that

                          t = f (k, A, V, , Cv, h, T )                (9.29.a)

Later it can be shown that these parameters are indeed affecting the time. The number

of basic parameters in this problem is four which are, length, L, M , t, and .

clumsy and rough it provides dimensionless parameters while Buckingham's method

fails dramatically.

9.5 Abuse of Dimensional Analysis

Buckingham's method while simple can produce significant errors. Recently (2020)
Wuhan Corona Virus (WCV) was propagated from China to the many places around
the world. To analysis many researchers utilize Buckingham's method and mistakenly
referring to it as Dimensional Analysis. While this book has no intention to criticize
people in this case, it has to make exception and single case demonstrate how Buck-
ingham's methods produce errors because the wrong parameters are used. As it was
discussed earlier in this Chapter, Buckingham is useful when main if not all parameters
are used. For example Contreras et al 16 suggest the following parameters as control-
ling the spread of Wuhan Coronavirus. Because the caparison with these research their
nomenclature is adapted in this section only. These parameters include the following,
ambient temperature , air currents (Ca), air humidity H (absolute humidity), rainfall
P r. Additionally, Contreras et al mentioned several parameters that might effect the
spread such as social structure Ef s, seasonal changes of behavior Ce and pre-existing
immunity Ip. The spread velocity is denoted as Vp. According Contreras et al the
suggested relationship is

                     Ca                     Ce  Ca2  Ef s  Ip     (9.53)
Vp = a  2 C1 + b 
                     Pr                               Pr  3

where a and b are constants that set so that units match and math some figures. This
method has the logic that units has to match. This logic is proper and of coarse the
model has to match the data. Thus,to this extend this approach has some logical
consistency. However, dimensional analysis is not panacea. The dimensional provides
consistency but not solution. Supposed that there is another parameter that effect the
spread and the mortality which totally change the model. For example, in New York the

Determine the Speed of Spread of a Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19) in Spain."

politicians like Andrew Cuomo sent sick people to nursing homes by spread WCV. On
the other hand, president Trump by closing the boarder with China reduced and/or slow
down the spread. Clearly these factors did not enter into the equations that suggested
by this researchers group. Hence, none of the model predict the results are close to
reality. For example, none of the models predict the following waves that appeared
in Spain and else where. Furthermore, none of the models utilizing this approach can
predict the reduction due to the vaccination because none of them can predict the
Trump's actions will create vaccination. None of the models can predict that China
will allow and encourage to fly to Italy and create a nucleus for spread. No dimensional
analysis can help these models.

9.6 Summary

The two dimensional analysis methods or approaches were presented in this chapter.
Buckingham's  technique is a quick "fix approach" which allow rough estimates and
relationship between model and prototype. Nusselt's approach provides an heavy duty
approach to examine what dimensionless parameters effect the problem. It can be shown
that these two techniques in some situations provide almost similar solution. In other
cases, these technique proves different and even conflicting results. The dimensional
analysis technique provides a way to simplify models (solving the governing equation by
experimental means) and to predict effecting parameters.

       model the air has the same pressure and temperature as that in prototype. If the
       air is considered as compressible, what velocity is required for pressure is 1.5[bar]
       and temperature 20C? What is the required velocity of the air in the model test
       when the medium is made of water to keep the dynamic similarity?

   2. An airplane 100[m] long is tested by 1 [m] model. If the airplane velocity is
       120 [m] and velocity at the wind-tunnel is 60 [m], calculate the model and the
       airplane Reynolds numbers. You can assume that both model and prototype
       working conditions are the same (1[Bar] and 60C).

   3. What is the pipe diameter for oil flowing at speed of 1[m/sec] to obtain dynamic
       similarity with a pipe for water flowing at 3 [m/sec] in a 0.02[m] pipe. State your
       assumptions.

   4. The pressure drop for water flowing at 1 [m/sec] in a pipe was measured to be
       1 [Bar]. The pipe is 0.05 [m] diameter and 100 [m] in length. What should be
       velocity of Castor oil to get the same Reynolds number? What would be pressure
       drop in that case?

Solution

The Reynolds number (Re) represents the ratio of inertia force and viscous force and
commonly used in many situations and has it can be used almost every where. Yet it
more dominate in pipe flow as the main parameter. While this question is not really
well defined it probably meant for that situation. Mach number is commonly used
in compressible flow as it represents the ratio of sonic velocity and gas velocity. The
reason that Mach number represents how compressible the flow is. The Weber number
(We) with his cosines (Capillary number and Bond number) is the ratio between the
inertial force and the surface tension force. Nusselt number (Nu) represents the ratio
of heat convected through the fluid and heat conducted through the fluid. The Froude
number (Fr) is a dimensionless value that describes ratio inertial forces to gravity force.
The flow regimes in open channel flow are determine by this number.
Based on the above discussion it has to be that P-Y and thus (a) and (b) must be
false. (c) fails because that heat convection is not related to Froude number.
The answer is (d).

10.1 Introduction

The external flow refers to flow around immersed bodies. In this analysis, the ap-
proached adapted is to start from from close proximity to body and increase the size
gradualy. Several geological shape will be introduced. In the extreme case when the
Boundary Layer ecomposes the whole field it refered as the Stokes's problem which will
be introduced. Stokes's problem is a special class problem that Boundary Layer is very
thick and ecompose the whole field.

10.2 Boundary Layer Theory

The boundary layer was introduced by Prandtl in 1904 to connect between the

experimental or empirical and the theoretical or analytical work. Many, if not

most, of the analytical work was based on Euler equation (inviscid fluid) to ex-

periment work (mostly) which was on viscous flow. The basic idea is that most

of the domain of the flow is not affected by the viscous effects while in the

close proximity to boundaries of the (mostly) solid bodies the viscosity effects are

dominated. This idea based on dimensional analysis of the Naiver-Stokes equa-

tion. That is, the local Reynolds number based on the Boundary Layer is much

smaller the general Reynolds number based

on the entire dimension. In these boundaries         U                             xx
the transfer of the momentum occurs (see

which will be discussed. The limit of the

Boundary Layer is where the relative velocity U/U is about one. For practical pur-

poses the value that is taken for relative velocity is U/U  0.99. The velocity of the

boundary layer is unknown and it turned out with reasonable demands yield similar

results. These conditions include, at minimum, zero velocity at the solid object and

the velocity at Boundary Layer edge to be same as the far away from the body, U.

Once, the velocity profile is guessed, the momentum transfer can be examined. As the

10.2.1 Non-Circular Shape Effect

The discussion until now was focused on the circular or pipe shape. The conduit shape
has significant effect on the velocity profile. Thus, it strongly affects the resistance to
the flow. The closer actual shape to a circular shape the smaller the resistance is. For
example, square cross section shape or even equiangular triangle are close enough to

For this reason the hydraulic diameter has to be defined or established. It was found
that the following equation produce a reasonable results

11.1 Introduction

A flow of fluid through a pipe or conduit has a significant applicability and importance

for many engineering processes. In the Chapters 14 and 151 a discussion about the

compressible substance and several models discussing flow in conduits were introduced.

These models were introduced based

on pure analytical consideration with

the exception of the friction factor,     P2  Boundary Layer  P1

on the "experimental" data of the             D

flow in a constant cross section al-

though other configurations will be pre-

sented. Additionally, various connec-         Entry Length
tions of the conduits or pipes will be

included. These kinds of flow are re-     Fig. 11.1 - Simple Entry length into a pipe

to "External Flows" that were discussed

in the previous Chapter. The Internal Flow is different in the sense that the boundary

conditions for the other side (the side wall) affects the entire flow field. The entry

region length is discussed later in this chapter (see Figure 11.1 for entry length).

    1Notice the way this book is written, these Chapters appeared earlier. Thus, the reference to these
chapters appear here.

ery consecutive cross section. The fully

developed flow is depicted in Figure 11.2. The connection of the shear stress and the

pressure loss is to be established. Consider the element and the control volume shown

in Figure 11.2. The momentum conservation of the control volume reads

               (P1 - P2) A -        L dA             U Urn dA            (11.1)

                                      w  D dx =   A

                                   0

Notice that the infinitesimal areas, dAs, are different. In the first integral, infinitesimal
area, dA, refers to the tangential area while the second infinitesimal area refers to cross
section area. The shear forces represent the total of the local shear stress. In this case,
the shear stress value is constant because the velocity profile is constant for every cross
section. Hence, this shear stress value (w) can be taken out the integration. It can be
also noticed that the shear stress is opposite to the flow direction. The right hand side
term in equation (11.1) is the net momentum flux which is zero in this case due to the
basis assumptions of the uniform profile (uniform flow). Equation (11.1) transitions to

               (P1 - P2) A = P A = w  D L                                (11.2)

The relationship between the velocity (profile) and the shear stress has to be established.
If the velocity profile is known, then the shear stress can be calculated regardless to the
flow regime.

       Example 11.1: Maximum Velocity                                 Level: Basic
     Consider a fluid with an hypothetical velocity profile given by

                                           r2                          (11.1.a)
               U (r) = Umax 1 - R

     What is the relationship between the velocity profile (parameters of the velocity
     profile) and the shear stress.

     Solution

     The shear stress is given by

                                   w = - U                              (11.1.b)

11.1. INTRODUCTION                                                                        401
     Using the given velocity profile                             End of Ex. 11.1

                                 r                = 2  Umax      (11.1.c)
            w = 2 Umax 2
                                           R r=R            R

Since the maximum velocity is twice the average velocity equation (11.1.c) it can be

written as                             w = 4  Uave
                                                   R
                                                                  (11.1.d)

       It has to emphasize that for the fully developed flow the shear stress is constant
regardless where or not the flow is laminar or turbulent. Hence, the fully developed
flow, the shear stress can be written as

                                       w = w = constant           (11.3)

For unknown velocity profile, this shear stress is needed to be obtained from experimental
investigation. The list of major researchers who contribute to this relationship includes
Ch큖zy, Weisbach, Darcy, Poiseuille, Hagen, Prandtl, Blasius, von K큑rm큑n, Nikuradse,
Colebrook, White, Rouse and Moody 2. The diagram named after Moody, even though
this diagram was just simple representation of Rouse's work3. It was found that several
parameters affect the shear stress which include the following: viscosity , density ,
velocity U , diameter D, and roughness . When the effective parameters are known
from experimental evidence, then the  theorem can be used to obtain the general
relationship. The general relationship can be written as

                                       w = f (, , U, D, )        (11.4)

Notice that the units of shear stress are the identical to units of pressure. Using the
Dimensional Analysis three dimensional groups control the flow which include the fol-
lowing

                                       U D                  w     (11.5)
            Re =                           , , and
                                          D                U  2

The first group is referred as Reynolds number and the second is the relative roughness.
So according the Dimensional Analysis, the relationship can be written in the form of

                                       w = f Re,                  (11.6)

       The left hand side is a dimensionless group which is commonly referred as the
frictional factor. In the literature there are two different friction factors known as
Fanning friction factor, f (seldom also denoted by ) which is four times of the Darcy
friction factor. To make things more complicated, both factors most times are denoted
as f . In this book unless otherwise noted, Darcy factor is used. From equation (11.2),
the shear stress can be rearranged as

                                            P = w  D L                                    (11.7)

This relation is exhibited by Figure 11.3. The velocity profile given in Example 11.1
represents laminar flow. For laminar velocity profile, the relationship between the friction
factor and Reynolds number can be derived based on the velocity profile which was
shown earlier. The velocity profile was

                                P D2            2r 2                                      (11.12)

It was shown that the averaged velocity is half of the maximum velocity for parabolic
profile4. Hence, the conservation of the mass requires that

                    Uave =  U (r) dr P D2                                                 (11.13)

which means that f = 64/Re Darcy factor (or f = 16/Re Fanning factor) for laminar
flow . For other flow regimes there are no exact analytical expression. The laminar
flow appears in low Reynolds number range. It is common to assume that this range
of Reynolds number is smaller than 2000 and that turbulent flow appears for Reynolds
number larger than 4000. The region between these two zones referred as transitional
region. If the velocity profile is unknown, the experimental data provides the needed
relationship. This data is plotted in Moody's diagram (Figure 11.3). It can be ob-
served from Moody diagram that for high value of roughness, /D, the friction factor
become constant for large Reynolds number. This zone is where the flow is "completely
turbulent." This information is depicted in Figure 11.3.

       The friction factor for smooth pipe with turbulent flow region has been suggested
to be

                            1                                             (11.18)
                            = 1.930 ln Re f - 0.537

                             f

The accuracy was reported (McKeon, Swanson, Zagarola, Donnelly, and SMITS 2004)
to be around 1% for the range of 300, 000  Re  13.6 106.

       In general, Moody diagram is only suggestive what are regions and friction factor
value might be in reality. In general, these values are correlated with for situations that
are under steady state and do not have Entry problem or Entry issue becomes negligible.
Moody diagram is used for the most situations in reality. Nikuradse (Nikuradse 1932)
suggested that the velocity profile in a smooth pipe can be written by

where n is a function of the Reynolds number. Thus, the velocity distribution is related
to Reynolds number and provides some information, if needed, for engineering purposes.

that very near the wall the velocity is relatively very small and therefore the flow is
laminar in parts of the pipe. Also from the boundary condition, the velocity must be
zero at the wall. These facts suggest that very close to the wall the flow should be
considered laminar. The shear stress at the wall is

                                        U                                  (11.20)

                                        y y=0

If the velocity is expend in Taylor series then the first term is linear so that the velocity
near the wall can be given by

                                  U = w y                                  (11.21)
                                         

from dimensional analysis point of view, the ratio w/  units are m2/sec2 or the units
of w/  are m/sec. The term w/  is traditionally referred as "Friction velocity"
and is denoted as U . Normalizing equation (11.21) by dividing the velocity yields

       The size of these subregions will be provided later on. It is common to use for
the velocity (profile) in the turbulent core region the following expression

            U                    = 5.5 + 5.75 log             Uy                 (11.24)

The velocity profile for the buffer zone has been proposed to be represented by

         U                       = -3.05 + 11.5 log           Uy                 (11.25)

To analysis the practical applications of the these equations consider a water flow in a
pipe of 5[cm] with Reynolds number of 106 and viscosity 0.001N s/m2. The density
of the water roughly is about 1000[kg/m3]. The laminar subregion will be based the

equation (11.26). The averaged velocity will be

From Figure 11.3 for Re = 106 and smooth pipe friction factor is

Fig. 11.5 - The left Figure exhibits the various subregions of the flow in a pipe with their
     equations. The right Figure exhibits the coefficient for the turbulence and the range of
     these coefficients.

This value demonstrates that the shear size of the laminar region is very small and the
turbulent core is the vast majority of the pipe. All these equations plus experimental
results are presented in Figure 11.5a.

       The relationship between the laminar sublayer size and the roughness presents a
new issue.

       The velocity profile for rough pipe with turbulence has analytical expression
(11.24) which the general form is

                                     U  = Constant + 5.75 log                       y                                      (11.29)

When the constant is a function of the wall roughness and diameter.
       It was demonstrated that the laminar sublayer is very small size. When the

roughness exceeds the laminar sublayer thickness then it said the flow region to be
in complete rough flow. In that case, the Constant value is 8.50 (see Figure 11.13).
For roughness smaller than the laminar sublayer the contestant varies according to the
Exhibit 11.5b. When the  <  are referred as hydraulically smooth and the constant
can be approximated by

                                Constant = 5.50 + 5.75 log U                                                               (11.30)

Substituting equation (11.30) into equation (11.29) provides

                                        U  = 5.5 + 5.75 log                   Uy                                           (11.31)

                                     U                                            

Equation (11.31) is identical to equation (11.24) as it would be expected for smooth

pipe.

       Generally  speaking,     the     laminar  flow   can                   be  related  as  log   P       = log U       while

These equations are supported by experimental relationships, however, these relation-
ships do not provide a direct information on the shear stress at the wall w for a particular
fluid. Yet, knowing the shear Stress, w, could come from the balance of momentum
equation.

11.1.1 Colebrook-White equation for Friction Factor, f

Colebrook and White did a large number of experiments on commercial pipes. Their
work with some important theoretical work by von Karman and Prandtl resulted in an
equation named after them as the Colebrook-White equation:

              1                             2.51
               = -2 log                     +                                   (11.33)
              f                         3.7Dh Re f

This equation (11.33) is implicit where f has to appear on both sides and it is solved
by numerical methods.

       In the literature there is a reference to Colebrook-White equation that is based
on the pipe material. This equation roughness is replaced by pipe material (for typical
commercial material) when this coefficient is given as

              1                         ks  1.26

              f                         3.7Dh Re f

The coefficient ks is given in a table

       According to More (2006) there is no analytical solution to Colebrook-White
equation. The solution for f is obtained by numerical methods. In the literature there
are several methods to approximate the solution of Colebrook-White equation by explicit

pipe. The relationship between the

acceleration and the momentum or energy loss depends on the Entry length. At one

extreme if somehow miraculously the flow enters to the pipe at the steady state profile

then the entry length is zero since it is already at steady state condition. The amount

of acceleration (or decelerating) is determined by the velocity profile at the entrance.

The following discussion refers to fluid entering the pipe with a uniform flow. It also

noteworthy to point the difference of flow regime (laminar to turbulence flow) can

change outcome. The basic idea of Entry Length is based on grow of the boundary

layer to the pipe center line. As was discussed before, the boundary layer rate growth

depends on the flow regime. Consider flow with Reynolds number less than 2000, the

flow should be laminar. In that case, the boundary layer should be also laminar thus it

can be according the laminar boundary layer. A typical laminar boundary is depicted in

Figure 11.6. This boundary layer can be described by smooth growth.

The flow is turbulent when the Reynolds              P2      LaminarBoundary Layer P1

(especially at the boundary layer5) changes

to turbulent. At that the point, the bound-    Fig. 11.7 - Boundary Layer creating the

Length is shorter. The specific point, where

the transition from laminar to turbulent occur, depends on the initial condition and

the Reynolds number at steady state. However, as all the turbulence phenomenon the

transition can not be predicted precisely only the trends can. Hence, it can be said

that the boundary turbulent Entry Length is shorter than the laminar Entry Length.

Furthermore, it can be said that the increase of Reynolds number tend to shorten the

entry length. The turbulent entry length depicted in Figure 11.7 which shows the

change in the rate of growth in the boundary layer.

Initial Conditions

       The initial conditions into the pipe are determined mostly by the immediate geom-
etry before the entrance to the pipe. Hence, clearly the entry length must be influenced
by these conditions. Furthermore these conditions can introduce another velocity com-
ponent (two dimensional verse one dimensional) that further complicate the analysis.
The practical point is that these conditions experimentally where investigated and the
results in data given Figure 11.8.

       The analysis of the actual length size of the entry length is beyond the scope this
book. However, experimental and analytical studies showed that it can be expressed as

     L  = 0.06                                 UL                          (11.37)

     D                                         

where in this case L refers to the entry length. For turbulent entrance length size is
has different functionally with Reynolds number as

     L                                          U L 1/6                    (11.38)
        = 4.4                                    

     D

       These equations (11.37) and (11.38) depended on the initial conditions (geomet-
rical conditions) at the pipe entrance. However, from practical point of view, these
equations provide adequate accuracy for many engineering calculations regardless to
the initial conditions.

       Earlier the discussion dealt with the feeding or sourcing pipes with fluids entering
from a upstream with a larger area to the pipe (at the extreme even "infinite" large
source). The attention has to be turned to the case where the feeding source area is

smaller than the pipe area. In addition, this configuration can also viewed as something
that can occur in the middle of pipe system as well. Hence, this category is a special case
and referred as abrupt expansion or sudden enlargement. As many things in thermofluid
field, opposite to our instinct, there is approximate analytical solution for turbulent flow
while for the laminar flow regime requires a complicate numerical simulation. The
turbulent flow is depicted by Figure 11.9. The flow enters a from a smaller pipe to a
larger pipe (at the extreme to a reservoir). The discussion about the geometry (a sharp
square or chamfered corner) will be presented later.

deeper blue in Figure 11.9 are stagnant.

These two zones are responsible for the energy losses that occurred. These two triangles

create situations were the static pressure does not vary across the enlargement that is

from point 1 to point 2. Utilizing the momentum equation for steady state leads to

     (P1 - P2) A2 + f1-2 =  U22 A2 -  U12 A1                       (11.39)

where f1-2 is the friction force. Or

     (P1 - P2) A2 + f1-2 = m (U2 - U1) =  U2 A2 (U2 - U1)          (11.40)

for the basic analysis the friction force, f1-2,is traditionally assumed negligible. This
assumption is appropriate for incompressible flow (and some compressible flow situ-
ations) for large range of Reynolds number and relative smaller ratio of expansion.
Otherwise the analysis is applicable for a free jet entering to a large medium. Hence,
equation (11.40) can be written as

     (P1 - P2) &A&2 =  U2 &A&2 (U2 - U1)                           (11.41)

When the area, A2, is canceled in combination with neglecting of the friction force.

       This approximate analysis provides reasonable equation to calculate the head loss
which also provided in a figure form (see Figure 11.10a). However, the minimum
distance for this sudden Expansion is not discussed.

       For the laminar flow the expression in (11.48) is not correct and it is recommended
(Oliveira, Pinho, and Schulte 1998) to use

       It is import to allude to an interesting point in regard to gradual change. Rosa
(Rosa and Pinho 2006) with others shown that the resistance of the of gradual change
can be larger and abrupt change. The deviation is summarized in figure for wide range
of Reynolds number as shown in Figure 11.10b. It can be notice up 17-18 degrees
the resistance is reduced while any angle above this value will increase the resistance.
Unless small angle is possible to build, the transition should be trough abrupt expansion.
Nevertheless, analysis of this Figure show that it better to design the transition with
small angle and then to change for abrupt transition. In that case the resistance can
change very significantly.

11.2.1 Non-Circular Shape Effect

The discussion until now was focused on the circular or pipe shape. The conduit
shape has significant effect on the velocity profile. Thus, the shape strongly affects
the resistance to the flow. The closer actual shape to a circular shape the smaller the
resistance is. For example, square cross section shape or even equiangular triangle are
close enough to circular shape and hence utilize the information that was developed for
the circular pipe. For this reason the hydraulic diameter has to be defined or established.
It was found that the following equation produce a reasonable results

                   Hydraulic Diameter                            (11.50)
                     4  Flow cross section

     D
           wetted perimeter of the cross-section

Some equations contain a definition of the hydraulic radius which is different than
the current definition6. This diameter can be used to calculate Reynolds number and
roughness ratio based in this diameter. Several shapes are tabulated and presented in
the following table.

    6It must be noted that hydraulic diameter diameter is not double the hydraulic radius but 4 times
the radius.

11.3 Losses in Conduits Connections and Other Devices

Most conduits or tubes are connected trough a network pipes which can be in different
sizes. These connections are made between conduits of the same size or different sizes.
These connections exhibit increased of the resistance to the flow. In addition to these
connections there are valves to regulate the flow and other devices which increases the
flow. These additional resistances are referred to as minor losses. The reason that the
416                                         CHAPTER 11. INTERNAL FLOW

term "minor" attached to it because under long conduits these resistances are relatively
small or in other words the pipe resistance is considered the main resistance. However,
for small pipe or tube these minor resistances are considerable. The representation of
these minor resistances represented in the same fashion as conduits. The two main
reasons for this representation are: convenience and the dimensional analysis suggests
that it is appropriated way of representation. Hence, the resistance of the minor loss is
represented as

                                   U2                                        (11.51)
                        Hl = K 2 g

where K is loss coefficient that depend on Reynolds number and geometrical configu-
ration. Thus the total loss can be written as

                                  f L N U2                                   (11.52)
                        Hl = D + Ki + exit loss 2 g

                                                     i

The first term on the right hand side is the familiar loss due the flow in the conduits.
The second term represents all the minor losses and the last term represent all due to
the exit. The common approach is to assume that the sudden expansion can describe
this head loss. At the extreme case when the exit is connected to the very large tank or
reservoir for which the maximum lost occur which is one (1). Kotowski et al (Kotowski,
Szewczyk, and Ciezak 2011) have pointed out that the lost at the pipe can be larger
than one for turbulent flow especially when there is energy difference between energy
measured by U 2/2 g and the actual energy. This energy difference is due to the liquid
movement perpendicular to flow direction and can be described by

     Kexit = 1 + 0.113   10 2                10 4                10 6        (11.53)
                                   - 0.107             + 0.101  ln Re

                        ln Re               ln Re

However, for most practical calculations, this correction can be neglected.

The head lost in the bend depends on the relative roughness but primarily on the ratio
of the radius of bending and the pipe diameter. This information is exhibited in Figure
11.11 for various ratio of the roughness. Generally, the resistance is larger for very mall
ratios of the r/ D. at about ratio of about 7 this value (K) reaches a minimum and
increase thereafter. It can be noticed that between the range of r/D = 2 to r/D = 5.5
the resistance, K decrease mildly. while before it is strong function. The roughness
increase the resistance as can be expected. Another connection that commonalty appear
in the pipe network is the Tee. This connection has two possible configurations. In one
configuration, the flow is in a straight line with a connection from the side. In another
possible configuration the flow split to two branches at 90. The "Y" connection is
actually extension of the tee branching with various angles.

       The typical network configuration contain a switch which referred in fluid me-
chanics as the valve. There several configuration of the valves which include globe
valve, angle value and gate valve.

The piping system is made from 15 [m] horizontal pipe and 90 elbow (bend).
The elbow is followed by 5 [m] vertical line. The vertical is followed by 90

elbow and a 8 [m] horizontal pipe. At the exit there is restricting device before

     assumed to incompressible fluid. Hence, for constant cross section, the velocity can

     be assumed to be constant as

                                   U1 = U2                             (11.2.b)

     Equation (11.2.a) can be simplified if z1 is denoted zero as

                                   P1 - P2 - z2 = Hl                   (11.2.c)
                                   g g

     But on the other side, the energy lost is made from the lost at the entrance, pipe flow,
     minor loss, and exit.

                 U2                                                    (11.2.d)
         Hl = 2 g (Kentrance + Kpipe + Kbends + Kexit)

     The resistance in the entrance, exit, and elbow can be assumed to be relatively small
     compared to the residence of the pipe. The resistance of the pipe is 4 f L/ D However,
     the Reynolds number and/or the velocity (profile) are unknowns at this stage. The
     solution is obtained by applying the following the procedure.

         1. The roughness ratio can be calculated because the material of the pipe is known.
             For galvanized pipe the roughness is obtained from Table 11.2 for which is
             0.15[mm]. The roughness ratio is obtained (pipe diameter is 30mm) as

                                    = 0.015 = .0006                    (11.2.e)
                                   D 25

     With this value the friction coefficient is obtained as 4f = 0.032. The resistance
     is then

                  4 f Li                                               (11.2.f )

                  D                      0.025

     The velocity can be obtained from equation (11.2.c) and hence

         U=                                         P                  (11.2.g)
                                                          - z2 g

                                                     
                                   Kentrance + Kpipe + Kbends + Kexit

     Since the other resistances are neglected then

     U=  2 P - z2 g

     The friction coefficient was based on the assumption that the flow is fully
     turbulent. However, this friction coefficient has to be checked and verified by

       using temperature of 20C, with this assumption becomes

                              1.002  10

       with this Reynolds number a new estimate of the friction coefficient has to be
       made. From the Figure 11.3 it can be observed that the change is not significant
       and the new value is 0.0325. The change is not significant enough to repeat
       the calculations in practice. However, the improve accuracy will required that

       into account the minor resistance will more the accuracy than the improved

11.3.2 Flow Meters (Flow Measurements)

The flow meters are devices that are used to measure flow rate for various reasons to
find the amount of material passing through. The flow can be measured by that uses
different effects. In this section, some of these effects are demonstrated. Like all the
measurements, these measurements them self affect the flow. These methods include
direct measurement (filling a fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times
the volume is filled), while other methods based on measurement of the pressures/forces
created by the fluid streams as it overcomes a designed obstacle. In general the flow
rate is measure by know combination measuring the velocity with a given area.

work was carried on this point which is presented in Figure 11.16. For large Reynolds
number, the Figure 11.16 exhibits that this coefficient is only function of the diameters
ratio. For Reynolds numbers the resistance increases with the decreasing of the Reynolds
number.

engineers to search to alternative. The orifice is similar to a pipe with a squared

connection (see Figure 11.8b). It is logical to look at Figure 11.8 to draw idea to where

the next step in the design should be. The rounded connection looks as reduction of the

pressure loss and hence the cost reduction of operation. Practically, the construction

of the rounded connection is done by the converging nozzle (see Figure ??). This

configuration, the nozzle, as well other configurations also have been tested and

tabulated. Similarly, to the orifice configuration the experience has shown that to the

same equation is obtained on the same ground and the same parameters affects the

flow. However, as opposed to the orifice, the nozzle is employed in situations where

the density is varied. In that case the experimental evidence and dimensionless analysis

shows that equation is

density are the same as before.

converging nozzle in smooth way to the original size. This extension is similar to the
diverging part of nozzle. It combined nozzle, that is the converging and diverging

11.4.1 Series Conduits Systems

The series connection is characterized by the fact that the flow rate is constant through-
out the pipe at least in steady state situations. The flow rate along the pipe is same
while the velocity might be different at various cross sections. This constant flow rate is
simple result of mass conservation. The typical questions that categorized into different
classes. These classes are summarized as

Class I:
       Flow rate, Q and pipe diameter, D, are known, loss head, h1-2 is unknown.

The knowledge of flow rate also mean that velocity at various cross section is known.

the pressure is 20 kPa and velocity is 2 [m/s]. Density of water is 1000 [kg/m3]
and acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 [m/s2] . Which of the following is TRUE?

1. the flow of S1 to S2 and heat loss is 0.53 [m]

2. the flow of S2 to S1 and heat loss is 0.53 [m]

3. the flow of S1 to S2 and heat loss is 1.06 [m]

4. the flow of S2 to S1 and heat loss is 1.06 [m]

Due to the fact that the pipe diameter is constant the velocity is constant throughout
pipe (incompressible flow). It direction of the flow is not know and it can be chosen
arbitrary. If the result is positive the guess was correct otherwise the flow to other
direction. In this case, here it is assumed that the flow is from S1 to S2. Utilzing

   12 Inviscid Flow or Potential Flow

12.1 Introduction

The mathematical complication of the Naiver-Stokes equations suggests that a sim-
plified approached can be employed. N-S equations are a second non-linear partial
equations. Hence, the simplest step will be to neglect the second order terms (second
derivative). From a physical point of view, the second order term represents the vis-
cosity effects. The neglecting of the second order is justified when the coefficient in
front of the this term, after non-dimensionalzing, is approaching zero. This coefficient
in front of this term is 1/Re where Re is Reynold's number. A large Reynolds num-
ber means that the coefficient is approaching zero. Reynold's number represents the
ratio of inertia forces to viscous forces. There are regions where the inertia forces are
significantly larger than the viscous flow.

       Experimental observations show that when the flow field region is away from a
solid body, the inviscid flow is an appropriate model to approximate the flow. In this
way, the viscosity effects can be viewed as a mechanism in which the information is
transferred from the solid body into depth of the flow field. Thus, in a very close
proximity to the solid body, the region must be considered as viscous flow. Additionally,
the flow far away from the body is an inviscid flow. The connection between these
regions was proposed by Prandtl and it is referred as the boundary layer.

       The motivations or benefits for such analysis are more than the reduction of
mathematical complexity. As it was indicated earlier, this analysis provides an adequate
solution for some regions. Furthermore the Potential Flow analysis provides several
concepts that obscured by other effects. These flow patterns or pressure gradients re-
veal several "laws" such as Bernoulli's theorem, vortex/lift etc which will be expanded.

                                                    435

There are several unique concepts which appear in potential flow such as Add Mass,
Add Force, and Add Moment of Inertia otherwise they are obscured with inviscid flow.
These aspects are very important in certain regions which can be evaluated using di-
mensional analysis. The determination of what regions or their boundaries is a question
of experience or results of a sophisticated dimensional analysis which will be discussed
later.

       The inviscid flow is applied to incompressible flow as well to compressible flow.
However, the main emphasis here is on incompressible flow because the simplicity. The
expansion will be suggested when possible.

12.1.1 Inviscid Momentum Equations

The Naiver-Stokes equations (equations (8.118), (8.119) and (8.120)) under the dis-
cussion above reduced to

             Euler Equations in Cartesian Coordinates

           Ux + Ux Ux + Uy Ux + Uz Ux = - P + gx
          t  x         y     z           x

           Uy + Ux Uy + Uy Uy + Uz Uy = - P +  gy                                (12.1)
          t  x         y     z           y

           Uz + Ux Uz + Uy Uz + Uz Uz = - P +  gz
          t  x         y     z           z

These equations (12.1) are known as Euler's equations in Cartesian Coordinates. Euler
equations can be written in a vector form as

                   DU  = -P -   g                                                (12.2)

                   Dt

where represents the distance from a reference point. Where the D U/ Dt is the
material derivative or the substantial derivative. The substantial derivative, in Cartesian
Coordinates, is

DU        Ux + Ux Ux + Uy Ux + Uz Ux
      =i  t  x     y         z

             + j Uy + Ux Uy + Uy Uy + Uz Uy

                   + k Uz + Ux Uz + Uy Uz + Uz Uz                                (12.3)

In the following derivations, the identity of the partial derivative is used

                      Ui 1  (Ui)2
                   Ui i = 2 i
12.1. INTRODUCTION                                                       437

where in this case i is x, y, and z. The convective term (not time derivatives) in x
direction of equation (12.3) can be manipulated as

   Ux Ux Ux 1  (Ux)2
Ux x + Uy y + Uz z = 2 x +

   Uy                    Ux Uy                  Uz               Ux Uz
Uy x                Uy y - x                 Uz x           Uz z - x

1  (Uy)2 Uy Ux 1  (Uz)2 Uz Ux                                            (12.5)

       =0                                               =0

       It can be noticed that equation (12.5) several terms were added and subtracted
according to equation (12.4). These two groups are marked with the underbrace and
equal to zero. The two terms in blue of equation (12.5) can be combined (see for the
overbrace). The same can be done for the two terms in the red-violet color. Hence,
equation (12.5) by combining all the "green" terms can be transformed into

   Ux Ux Ux 1  (Ux)2 1  (Uy)2 1  (Uz)2
Ux x + Uy y + Uz z = 2 x + 2 x + 2 x +

                       Uy Ux - Uy + Uz Ux - Uz                           (12.6)
                                          y x                    z x

       The, "green" terms, all the velocity components can be combined because of the
Pythagorean theorem to form

1  (Ux)2 1  (Uy)2 1  (Uz)2  (U )2                                        (12.7)
                    +                     +             =
2 x 2 x 2 x                                                   x

Hence, equation (12.6) can be written as

   Ux Ux Ux  (U )2                                      + Uz    Ux - Uz  (12.8)
Ux x + Uy y + Uz z = x                                           z x

                                        + Uy Ux - Uy
                                                   y x

In the same fashion equation for y direction can be written as

   Uy Uy Uy  (U )2                                      + Uz    Uy - Uz  (12.9)
Ux x + Uy y + Uz z = y                                          z y

                                        + Ux Uy - Ux
                                                   x y
438                                      CHAPTER 12. POTENTIAL FLOW
and for the z direction as

   Uz Uz Uz  (U )2                                    + Uy  Uz - Uy     (12.10)
Ux x + Uy y + Uz z = y                                      y z

                                      + Ux Uz - Ux
                                                 x z

Hence equation (12.3) can be written as

DU        Ux  (U )2         Ux - Uy      + Uz         Ux - Uz
      =i   t + x + Uy        y x                       z x

          Uy  (U )2              Uy Ux                      Uy Uz
+ j t + y + Ux x - y + Uz z - y

          Uz  (U )2              Uz Ux                      Uz Uy       (12.11)
+ k t + y + Ux x - z + Uy y - z

All the time derivatives can be combined also the derivative of the velocity square
(notice the color coding) as

DU = U +  (U )2 + i Uy Ux - Uy + Uz Ux - Uz

                            x y                       z y

                            + k Ux Uz - Ux + Uy Uz - Uy                 (12.12)

Using vector notation the terms in the parenthesis can be represent as

curl U =   U = i Uz - Uy + j Ux - Uz
                            y z          z x

                                                      + k Uy - Ux       (12.13)
                                                               x y
12.1. INTRODUCTION                                                 439

With the identity in (12.13) can be extend as

U    U = -i Uy Ux - Uy + Uz Ux - Uz
                    y x                             z x

        - j Ux Uy - Ux + Uz Uy - Uz
                            x y                     z y

                    - k Ux Uz - Ux + Uy Uz - Uy                    (12.14)
                                x z                      y z

The identity described in equation (12.14) is substituted into equation (12.12) to obtain
the form of

           DU = U +  (U)2 - U    U                               (12.15)
           Dt t

Finally substituting equation (12.15) into the Euler equation to obtain a more convenient
form as

    U +  (U)2 - U    U = -P -   g                                (12.16)
        t

       A common assumption that employed in an isothermal flow is that density, , is
a mere function of the static pressure,  = (P ). According to this idea, the density is
constant when the pressure is constant. The mathematical interpretation of the pressure
gradient can be written as

                                         dP                        (12.17)
                                P = n^

                                         dn

where n^ is an unit vector normal to surface of constant property and the derivative
d /dn refers to the derivative in the direction of n^. Dividing equation (12.17) by the
density, , yields

                    zero
                    net
                    effect

=       n^ = d                  n^ =                    n^ = 
 dn        dn                         dn                       

It can be noticed that taking a derivative after integration cancel both effects. The
derivative in the direction of n^ is the gradient. This function is normal to the constant
of pressure, P , and therefore ( dP / ) is function of the mere pressure.

       Substituting equation (12.18) into equation (12.16) and collecting all terms under
the gradient yields

        U U 2                                  dP                  (12.19)

The quantity   U is referred in the literature as the vorticity and it represents the
rotation of the liquid.

Hence the flow is not rotational.

The definition (12.20) substituted into equation (12.19) provides

       One of the fundamental condition is referred to as irrotational flow. In this flow,
the vorticity is zero in the entire flow field. Hence, equation (12.21) under irrotational
flow reduced into

                                   Bernoulli Equation

                     U U 2                               dP         (12.22)

For steady state condition equation (12.24) is further reduced when the time derivative
drops and carry the integration (to cancel the gradient) to became

                        Steady State Bernoulli Equation

                        U2                    dP                    (12.23)

                         2                     

It has to be emphasized that the symbol denotes the length in the direction of the
body force. For the special case where the density is constant, the Bernoulli equation
is reduced to

Constant Density Steady State Bernoulli Equation

                        U2 P                                        (12.24)

       The streamline is a line tangent to velocity vector. For the unsteady state the
streamline change their location or position. The direction derivative along the stream-
line depends the direction of the streamline. The direction of the tangent is

                                      =    U                        (12.25)

Multiplying equation (12.21) by the unit direction of the streamline as a dot product
results in

The partial derivative of any vector, , with respect to time is the same direction as
the unit vector. Hence, the product of multiplication of the partial derivative with an
unit vector is

with a vector perpendicular to itself must be zero. Thus equation (12.26) becomes

The first time derivative of equation (12.28) can be manipulated as it was done before
to get into derivative as

                             U d             U                      (12.30)

                             t d             t

Substituting into equation (12.28) writes

     d U U 2                                         dP             (12.31)

The integration with respect or along stream line, " " is a function of time (similar
integration with respect x is a function of y.) and hence equation (12.28) becomes

       In these derivations two cases where analyzed the first case, for irrotational
Bernoulli's equation is applied any where in the flow field. This requirement means
that the flow field must obey U  . The second requirement regardless whether the
flow is irrotational or not, must be along a streamline where the value is only function of
the time and not location. The confusion transpires because these two cases are referred
as the Bernoulli equation while they refer to two different conditions or situations1. For
both Bernoulli equations the viscosity must be zero.

    1It is interesting to point out that these equations where developed by Euler but credited to the last
D. Bernoulli. A discussion on this point can be found in Hunter's book at Rouse, Hunter, and Simon

12.2 Potential Flow Function

The two different Bernoulli equations suggest that some mathematical manipulations
can provide several points of understating. These mathematical methods are known as
potential flow. The potential flow is defined as the gradient of the scalar function (thus
it is a vector) is the following

                 U                                                    (12.33)

The potential function is three dimensional and time dependent in the most expanded
case. The vorticity was supposed to be zero for the first Bernoulli equation. According
to the definition of the vorticity it has to be

         =   U =                                                    (12.34)

The above identity is shown to be zero for continuous function as



                 2 2
 i +j +k =i                               -
x y z            yz zy

        +j       2 2                             +k  2 2              (12.35)
                                           -                       -
                 zx xz                               yx xy

According to Clairaut's theorem (or Schwarz's theorem)2 the mixed derivatives are
identical xy = yx. Hence every potential flow is irrotational flow. On the reverse
side, it can be shown that if the flow is irrotational then there is a potential function
that satisfies the equation (12.33) which describes the flow. Thus, every irrotational
flow is potential flow and conversely. In these two terms are interchangeably and no
difference should be assumed.

       Substituting equation (12.33) into (12.24) results in

   ()2 dP                                                             (12.36)
     +                         +g +                            =0
  t           2                                  

It can be noticed that the order derivation can be changed so

                               =                                      (12.37)

                 t                            t

Hence, equation (12.36) can be written as

      ()2 dP                                         =0               (12.38)

12.2.1 Streamline and Stream function

The streamline was mentioned in the earlier section and now the focus is on this issue.
A streamline is a line that represent the collection of all the point where the velocity is
tangent to the velocity vector. Equation (12.25) represents the unit vector. The total
differential is made of three components as

               = i Ux + j Uy + k Uz = i dx + j dy + k dz                         (12.40)
               UU       U        d       d               d

It can be noticed that dx /d is x component of the unit vector in the direction of x.
The discussion proceed from equation (12.40) that

                        Ux = Uy = Uz                                             (12.41)
                        dx dy dz

Equation (12.41) suggests a system of three ordinary differential equations as a way
to find the stream function. For example, in the x-y plane the ordinary differential
equation is

                        dy = Uy                                                  (12.42)

What are streamlines that should be obtained in Example 12.2.

Solution

Utilizing equation (12.42) results in

          dy = Uy = -4 y3                                                  (12.3.a)

The solution of equation streamLineSimple:separation is obtained by integration as

           1 = ln x + C                                                    (12.3.c)
          4 y2

From the discussion above it follows that stream-          y         2
lines are continuous if the velocity field is contin-        U
uous. Hence, several streamlines can be drawn in                  1  s  d           2

(blue) are close an arbitrary line (brown line) can be                     1
drawn to connect these lines. A unit vector (cyan)
can be drawn perpendicularly to the brown line. The                           x
velocity vector is almost parallel (tangent) to the
streamline (since the streamlines are very close) to    Fig. 12.1 - Streamlines to ex-

unit vector is determined. Denoting a stream func-

function of x, y, that is

                                       x                y

In this stage, no meaning is assigned to the stream function. The differential of stream
function is defied as

          d = U  s d                                                      (12.44)

 The term , d refers to a small straight element line connecting two streamlines close
to each other. It could be viewed as a function as some representing the accumulative
of the velocity. The physical meaning is needed to be connected with the previous
discussion of the two dimensional function. If direction of the is chosen in a such

the direction of -^j as shown in the Figure 12.2a. In this case, the stream function

differential is

     d = dx + dy =             ^i U x + ^j U y         -  ^j       dx  = -U y dx  (12.45)

In this case, the conclusion is that

                                                                                   (12.46)
                                      x = -U y

     On the other hand, if d in the y direction as shown in Figure 12.2b then s = i

as shown in the Figure.

     d = dx + dy =
                 x       y                                       s  dy = U x dy

                                                         
                                                          ^i 

                                                         

In this case the conclusion is the

                                                                                   (12.48)
                                      y = U x                                      (12.49)

Thus, substituting equation (12.46) and (12.48) into (12.43) yields

                                    U x dy - U y dx = 0
12.2. POTENTIAL FLOW FUNCTION                      447

It follows that the requirement on U x and U y have to satisfy the above equation which
leads to the conclusion that the full differential is equal to zero. Hence, the function
must be constant  = 0.

       It also can be observed that the continuity equation can be represented by the
stream function. The continuity equation is

                                  U x + U y = 0    (12.50)
                                   dx dy

Substituting for the velocity components the stream function equation (12.46) and
(12.46) yields

                                  2 2          =0  (12.51)

that flow rate can be calculated as the integral of the perpendicular component of the
velocity or the perpendicular component of the cross line as

Q = U  s d = d = 2 - 1                            (12.53)

       Hence the flow rate is represented by the value of the stream function. The
difference between two stream functions is the actual flow rate.

       In this discussion, the choice of the coordinates orientation was arbitrary. Hence
equations (12.46) and (12.48) are orientation dependent. The natural direction is the
shortest distance between two streamlines. The change between two streamlines is

                                             d     (12.54)
d = U  n dn = d = U dn = = U

                                             dn

where dn is d perpendicular to streamline (the shortest possible d .
       The stream function properties can be summarized to satisfy the continuity equa-

tion, and the difference two stream functions represent the flow rate. A by-product of
the previous conclusion is that the stream function is constant along the stream line.
This conclusion also can be deduced from the fact no flow can cross the streamline.

12.2.2 Compressible Flow Stream Function

The stream function can be defined also for the compressible flow substances and steady
state. The continuity equation is used as the base for the derivations. The continuity
equation for compressible substance is

                                  U x + U y = 0    (12.55)

448                          CHAPTER 12. POTENTIAL FLOW

To absorb the density, dimensionless density is inserted into the definition of the stream
function as

                      =  Ux             (12.56)
                     dy 0

and

              = -  Uy                   (12.57)
                     dx  0

Where 0 is the density at a location or a reference density. Note that the new stream
function is not identical to the previous definition and they cannot be combined.

       The stream function, as it was shown earlier, describes (constant) stream lines.
Using the same argument in which equation (12.46) and equation (12.48) were devel-
oped leads to equation (12.49) and there is no difference between compressible flow
and incompressible flow case. Substituting equations (12.56) and (12.57) into equation
(12.49) yields

           dy +  dx 0 = 0 d             (12.58)
          y          x   

Equation suggests that the stream function should be redefined so that similar expres-
sions to incompressible flow can be developed for the compressible flow as

             d = 0 U  s d              (12.59)
                     

With the new definition, the flow crossing the line 1 to 2, utilizing the new definition
of (12.59) is

     m =   2                      2     (12.60)

             U  sd  = 0 d = 0 (2 - 1)

12.2.2.1 Stream Function in a Three Dimensions

Pure three dimensional stream functions exist physically but at present there is no known
way to represent then mathematically. One of the ways that was suggested by Yih in
19573 suggested using two stream functions to represent the three dimensional flow.
The only exception is a stream function for three dimensional flow exists but only for
axisymmetric flow i.e the flow properties remains constant in one of the direction (say
z axis).

       The three dimensional representation is based on the fact the continuity equation
must be satisfied. In this case it will be discussed only for incompressible flow. The
U = 0 and vector identity of   U = 0 where in this case U is any vector. As
opposed to two dimensional case, the stream function is defined as a vector function as

B =                                               (12.61)

The idea behind this definition is to build stream function based on two scalar functions
one provide the "direction" and one provides the magnitude. In that case, the velocity
(to satisfy the continuity equation)

U =   ( )                                        (12.62)

where  and  are scalar functions. Note while  is used here is not the same stream
functions that were used in previous cases. The velocity can be obtained by expanding
equation (12.62) to obtained

                                              =0  (12.63)

U =    +    ()

The second term is zero for any operation of scalar function and hence equation (12.63)
becomes

U =                                              (12.64)

These derivations demonstrates that the velocity is orthogonal to two gradient vectors.
In another words, the velocity is tangent to the surfaces defined by  = constant and
 = constant. Hence, these functions,  and  are possible stream functions in three
dimensions fields. It can be shown that the flow rate is

Q = (2 - 1) ( - 1)                                (12.65)

The answer to the question whether this method is useful and effective is that in some
limited situations it could help. In fact, very few research papers deals this method and
currently there is not analytical alternative. Hence, this method will not be expanded
here.

12.2.3 The Connection Between the Stream Function and the
           Potential Function

For this discussion, the situation of two dimensional incompressible is assumed. It was
shown that

                          Velocity from Stream/Potential Function x

                                                  (12.66)
Ux = x = y
450                                         CHAPTER 12. POTENTIAL FLOW

and

     Velocity from Stream/Potential Function y               (12.67)
                              

                    Uy = y = - x

These equations (12.66) and (12.67) are referred to as the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
       Definition of the potential function is based on the gradient operator as U = 

thus derivative in arbitrary direction can be written as

               d                                             (12.68)
                   =   s = U  s

               ds

where ds is arbitrary direction and s is unit vector in that direction. If s is selected in
the streamline direction, the change in the potential function represent the change in
streamline direction. Choosing element in the direction normal of the streamline and
denoting it as dn and choosing the sign to possible in the same direction of the stream
function it follows that

           d                                (12.69)    y2     = co1

                                                             ds
If the derivative of the stream function is chosen in

the direction of the flow then as in was shown in                constant
                                                             =
equation (12.54). It summarized as

                                                                                           1

follows that the potential lines are constant as well. The line of constant value of the

12.2.3.1 Existences of Stream Functions

The potential function in order to exist has to have demised vorticity. For two dimen-
sional flow the vorticity, mathematically, is demised when

                    Ux - Ux = 0                              (12.73)
                     y x

The stream function can satisfy this condition when

                    Stream Function Requirements

                                         2 2                 (12.74)
y y + x x = 0 = y2 + x2 = 0

  Example 12.5: Is the Potential                             Level: Basic
Is there a potential based on the following stream function

                     = 3 x5 - 2 y                            (12.5.a)

Solution

Equation (12.74) dictates what are the requirements on the stream function. Accord-
ing to this equation the following must be zero

                    2 2 ?                                    (12.5.b)
                    y2 + x2 = 0

In this case it is

                       ?                 3                   (12.5.c)
                       0 = 0 + 60 x

Since x3 is only zero at x = 0 the requirement is fulfilled and therefore this function
cannot be appropriate stream function.

12.3 Potential Flow Functions Inventory

This section describes several simple scenarios of the flow field. These flow fields will
be described and exhibits utilization of the potential and stream functions. These flow
fields can be combined by utilizing superimposing principle.

Uniform Flow
       The trivial flow is the uniform flow in which the fluid field moves directly and

uniformly from one side to another side. This flow is further simplified, that is the
coordinates system aligned with to flow so the x-coordinate in the direction of the flow.
In this case the velocity is given by

                                                                                           (12.76)
                                Ux = x = y = U0

Hence, it can be obtained that

                                        = U0 x + fy(y)                                     (12.77)
                                        = U0 x + fx(x)

where fy(y) is arbitrary function of the y and fx(x) is arbitrary function of x. In the
same time these function have to satisfy the condition

                                                                                           (12.78)
       Uy = x and - x = 0

These conditions dictate that

                                       d fy(y) = 0                                         (12.79)

                                       d fx(x) = 0
                                         dx

Hence

       fy(y) = constant =  = U0 x + constant                                               (12.80a)

       fx(x) = constant =  = U0 y + constant                                               (12.80b)

       The volumetric flow rate (two dimensional) Q denotes the flow rate out or in to
control volume into the source or sink. The flow rate is shown in Figure 12.7 is constant
for every potential line. The flow rate can be determined by

Q = 2  r Ur                                                                          (12.81)

Where Q is the volumetric flow rate, r is distance from the origin and Ur is the ve-
locity pointing out or into the origin depending whether origin has source or sink. The
relationship between the potential function to velocity dictates that

 = U = U r =                                        Q  r                             (12.82)

Explicitly writing the gradient in cylindrical coordinate results as

The integration of equation results in

function can be obtained by similar equations that were used or Cartesian coordinates.
In the same fashion it can be written that

                  d = U톝 d                          (12.86)

Where in this case d = r d (the shortest distance between two adjoining stream lines
is perpendicular to both lines) and hence equation (12.86) is

Note that the direction of U and r is identical. The integration of equation (12.87)
yields

                                 Q                   (12.88)

It traditionally chosen that the stream function 0 is zero at  = 0. This operation is
possible because the integration constant and the arbitrary reference.

       In the case of the sink rather than the source, the velocity is in the opposite
direction. Hence the flow rate is negative and the same equations obtained.

           U = f (r)                (12.91)                            = const

And in vector notation the flow is             Fig. 12.8 - Two dimensional Vortex free

                                                    potential lines.

The fundamental aspect of the potential flow is that this flow must be irrotational
flow. The gradient of the potential in cylindrical coordinates is

                                        1                                                          (12.93)

                                       r r 

Hence, equation (12.93) dictates that

                                              1                                                    (12.94)
                                                      = f (r)

                                              r 
                                                     
                                                          =0
                                                     r

From these equations it can be seem that

                                        = ()                                                       (12.95)

and

                                                                                                   (12.96)
                                        = r f (r)

                                    

Equation (12.96) states that the potential function depends on the angle,  while it
also a function of the radius. The only what the above requirement is obtained when
the derivative of and the equation are equal to a constant. Thus,

                                                   c                                               (12.97)
                     r f (r) = c = f (r) =

                                                   r
           
            = c =  - 0 = c1 (0 - 0)
458                                            CHAPTER 12. POTENTIAL FLOW

It can be observed from equation (12.96) that the velocity varies inversely with the
radius. This variation is referred in the literature as the natural vortex as oppose to
forced vortex where the velocity varies in any different functionality. It has to be noted
that forced vortex flow is not potential flow.

       The stream function can be found in the "standard" way as

       d = U  s dr

It can observed, in this case, from Figure 12.8 that s = - hence

       d =  c1  (-) dr = c1 dr                                            (12.98)
                 r                             r

Thus,

                                r                                          (12.99)
        - 0 = -c1 ln r0

The source point or the origin of the source is a singular point of the stream function and
there it cannot be properly defined. Equation (12.97) dictates that velocity at the origin
is infinity. This similar to natural situation such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and whirlpools
where the velocity approaches a very large value near the core. In these situation the
pressure became very low as the velocity increase. Since the pressure cannot attain
negative value or even approach zero value, the physical situation changes. At the core
of these phenomenon a relative zone calm zone is obtained.

The Circulation Concept

       In the construction of the potential flow or the inviscid flow researchers discover
important concept of circulation. This term mathematically defined as a close path
integral around area (in two dimensional flow) of the velocity along the path.

                                                                        y  U

The circulation is denoted as  and defined as

        = Us ds                                (12.100)

Substituting the definition potential function into equation (12.101) provides

                                                                                        ds  (12.102)

   C ds                                            C

The integration of equation (12.103) results in

 = d = 2(starting point) - 1(starting point)                                                (12.104)

          C

Unless the potential function is dual or multi value, the difference between the two
points is zero. In fact this what is expected from the close path integral. However, in a
free vortex situation the situation is different. The integral in that case is the integral
around a circular path which is

 = U  i r d ds = c1 r d = c1 2                                                             (12.105)
                                 r

In this case the circulation,  is not vanishing. In this example, the potential function
 is a multiple value as potential function the potential function with a single value.

Example 12.6: Source Circulation                                                            Level: Basic

Calculate the circulation of the source on the path of the circle around the origin

with radius a for a source of a given strength.

Solution

The circulation can be carried by the integration

                 =0                                                                         (12.6.a)

 = U  i r d ds = 0

Since the velocity is perpendicular to the path at every point on the path, the integral
identically is zero.

       Thus, there are two kinds of potential functions one where there are single value
and those with multi value. The free vortex is the cases where the circulation add the
value of the potential function every rotation. Hence, it can be concluded that the
potential function of vortex is multi value which increases by the same amount every
time, c1 2 . In this case value at  = 0 is different because the potential function
did not circulate or encompass a singular point. In the other cases, every additional
enclosing adds to the value of potential function a value.

      It was found that the circulation,  is zero when
     there is no singular point within the region inside the
     path.

       For the free vortex the integration constant can be found if the circulation is
known as

                                                              (12.106)
         c1 = 2 

In the literature, the term  is, some times, referred to as the "strength" of the vortex.
The common form of the stream function and potential function is in the form of

                                                              (12.107a)
      = 2  ( - 0) + 0

         r                                                    (12.107b)
      = 2  ln r0 + 0

Superposition of Flows
       For incompressible flow and two dimensional the continuity equation reads

                             2 2 2                            (12.108)
     톃 =  =   = 2 + 2 = 0

                                     x y

       The potential function must satisfy the Laplace's equation which is a linear partial
differential equation. The velocity perpendicular to a solid boundary must be zero
(boundary must be solid) and hence it dictates the boundary conditions on the potential
equation. From mathematical point of view this boundary condition as

             d                                                (12.109)
     Un = dn = 톘 = 0

In this case, n represents the unit vector normal to the surface.

       A solution to certain boundary condition with certain configuration geometry and

shape is a velocity flow field which can be described by the potential function, . If

such function exist it can be denoted as 1. If another velocity flow field exists which
describes, or is, the solutions to a different boundary condition(s) it is denoted as 2.
The Laplacian of first potential is zero, 21 = 0 and the same is true for the second
one 22 = 0. Hence, it can be written that

     =0  =0

     21 + 22 = 0                                              (12.110)

Since the Laplace mathematical operator is linear the two potential can be combined
as

     2 (1 + 2) = 0                                            (12.111)
12.3. POTENTIAL FLOW FUNCTIONS INVENTORY                                              461

The boundary conditions can be also treated in the same fashion. On a solid boundary
condition for both functions is zero hence

                 d1 = d2 = 0                                                   (12.112)
                 dn dn

and the normal derivative is linear operator and thus

                 d (1 + 2) = 0                                                 (12.113)
                      dn

It can be observed that the combined new potential function create a new velocity field.
In fact it can be written that

U = (1 + 2) = 1 + 2 = U1 + U2                                                  (12.114)

The velocities U1 and U2 are obtained from 1 and 2 respectively. Hence, the super-
position of the solutions is the characteristic of the potential flow.

Source and Sink Flow or Doublet Flow

       In the potential flow, there is a special case where the source and sink are combined
since it represents a special and useful shape. A source is located at point B which is
r0 from the origin on the positive x coordinate. The flow rate from the source is Q0
and the potential function is

Q1 = Q0 ln rB    (12.115)
        2  r0

The sink is at the same distance but at the                          y         R
negative side of the x coordinate and hence                                       rA
it can be represented by the potential func-                     rB     r
tion

Q1 = - Q0 ln rA                                        A B O                   B A x
          2  r0
                 (12.116)                                        r0        r0

The description is depicted on Figure 12.10.  Fig. 12.10 - Combination of the Source
The distances, rA and rB are defined from          and Sink located at a distance r0 from
the points A and B respectively. The po-           the origin on the x coordinate. The

                       2

In this case, it is more convenient to represent the situation utilizing the cylindrical
coordinates. The Law of Cosines for the right triangle (OBR) this cases reads

                 rB2 = r2 + r02 - 2 r r0 cos                                   (12.118)

In the same manner it applied to the left triangle as                          (12.119)
                                    rA2 = r2 + r02 + 2 r r0 cos
462                                                CHAPTER 12. POTENTIAL FLOW

Therefore, equation (12.117) can be written as

                                     r2 + r02 
                     = - Q0 1 ln  2 r r0 cos  + 1  2 2

                             Caution: mathematical details which can be skipped

     It can be shown that the following the identity exist

                       coth-1() = 21 ln  + 1  - 1                                    (12.121)

where  is a dummy variable. Hence, substituting into equation (12.120) the identity
of equation (12.121) results in

                        = - Q0 coth-1               r2 + r02                         (12.122)

       The several following stages are more of a mathematical nature which provide
minimal contribution to physical understanding but are provide to interested reader.
The manipulations are easier with an implicit solution and thus

                                  2      = r2 + r02                                  (12.123)

                                    Q

Equation (12.123), when noticing that the cos  coth(-x) = - coth(x), can be written
as

                    -2 r0 r cos  coth 2   = r2 + r02                                 (12.124)
                                               Q

In Cartesian coordinates equation (12.124) can be written as

                       r cos           2

                    -2 r0 x coth - Q               = x2 + y2 + r02                   (12.125)

Equation (12.125) can be rearranged by the left hand side to right as and moving r02
to left side result in

                                           r cos   2   + x2 + y2                     (12.126)

Equation (12.139) describes circles with center on the y coordinates at y = r0 cot Q0 .
It can be noticed that these circles are orthogonal to the circle that represents the

the potential lines. For the drawing it is convenient to write equation s (12.139) in

dimensionless form as

Dipole Flow

       It was found that when the distance between the sink and source shrinks to zero
a new possibility is created which provides benefits to new understanding. The new
combination is referred to as the dipole. Even though, the construction of source/sink
to a single location (as the radius is reduced to zero) the new "creature" has direction
as opposed to the scalar characteristics of source and sink. First the potential function
and stream function will be presented. The potential function is

      lim  = - Q0 1 ln       r2 + r02 - 2 r r0 cos                           (12.141)

To determine the value of the quantity in equation (12.141) the L'H^opital's rule will be
used. First the appropriate form will be derived so the technique can be used.

       Multiplying and dividing equation (12.141) by 2 r0 yields

Equation (12.142) has two parts. The first part, (Q0 2 r0)/2 , which is a function of
Q0 and r0 and the second part which is a function of r0. While reducing r0 to zero,
the flow increases in such way that the combination of Q0 r0 is constant. Hence, the

       After the potential function was established the attention can be turned into the
stream function. To establish the stream function, the continuity equation in cylindrical
is used which is

The general form of this derivative is

                                         d g() f () d g()

The internal derivative is done by the quotient rule and using the prime notation as

The transformation of equations (12.46) and (12.48) to cylindrical coordinates results
in

            1                                                             (12.146a)

The relationship for the potential function of the cylindrical coordinates was determined
before an appear the relationship (12.66) and (12.67) in cylindrical coordinates to be

The only way that these conditions co-exist is f (r) to be constant and thus f (r) is

with location at x = 0 and y =  2   Q0 . The identical derivations can be done for the

potential function. It can be noticed that the difference between the functions results

from difference of r sin  the instead of the term is r cos . Thus, the potential functions

are made from circles that the centers are at same distance as their radius from origin

on the x coordinate. It can be noticed that the stream function and the potential

function can have positive and negative values and hence there are family on both sides

of coordinates. Figure 12.12 displays the stream functions (cyan to green color) and

potential functions (gold to crimson color). Notice the larger the value of the stream

function the smaller the circle and the same for the potential functions.

         color to crimson while the stream lines are cyan to green color. Notice the smaller value
         of the stream function translates the smaller circle. The drawing were made for the

It must be noted that in the derivations above it was assumed that the sink is on the left
and source is on the right. Clear similar results will obtained if the sink and source were
oriented differently. Hence the dipole (even though) potential and stream functions are
scalar functions have a direction. In this stage this topic will not be treated but must
be kept in question form.

12.3.1 Flow Around a Circular Cylinder

After several elements of the potential flow were built earlier, the first use of these
elements can be demonstrated. Perhaps the most celebrated and useful example is the
flow past a cylinder which this section will be dealing with. The stream function made
by superimposing a uniform flow and a doublet is

                      = U0 y +  Q0 sin    = U0 r sin  +                 Q0 r sin   (12.157)

                                2 r                                     2 r  2

Or after some arrangement equation (12.157) becomes

                           = U0 r sin  1 +             Q0                          (12.158)
                                                                                   (12.159)
                                                               2
                                                2 U0  r

Denoting    Q0   as  -a2  transforms  equation  (12.158)            to
          2 U0 

                                                    a2
                           = U0 r sin  1 - r2

The stream function for  = 0 is                                                    (12.160)
                                                                a2

                                      0 = U0 r sin  1 - r2

This value is obtained when  = 0 or  =  and/or r = a. The stream line that is
defined by radius r = a describes a circle with a radius a with a center in the origin.
The other two lines are the horizontal coordinates. The flow does not cross any stream
line, hence the stream line represented by r = a can represent a cylindrical solid body.

       For the case where  = 0 the stream function can be any value. Multiplying
equation (12.159) by r and dividing by U0 a2 and some rearranging yields

                          r           =   r2    sin  - sin                         (12.161)

                          a a U0 a

It is convenient, to go through the regular dimensionless process as

                 r  = (r)2 sin  - sin  or r2 -  r - 1 = 0                          (12.162)
                                                             sin 

       The radius for other streamlines can found or calculated for a given angle and
given value of the stream function. The radius is given by

                                                       2
                                                sin 
                                                2        +4
                                sin 
                          r=                                                       (12.163)

It can be observed that the plus sign must be used for radius with positive values (there
are no physical radii which negative absolute value). The various value of the stream
12.3. POTENTIAL FLOW FUNCTIONS INVENTORY                           471

function can be chosen and drawn. For example, choosing the value of the stream
function as multiply of  = 2 n (where n can be any real number) results in

       2n             2n   2                   n2 csc2() + 1       (12.164)
                    sin 
                    2        +4
      sin                         = n csc() +
r=

The various values for of the stream function are represented by the ratios n. For
example for n = 1 the (actual) radius as a function the angle can be written as

                    r = a csc() + csc2() + 1                       (12.165)

The value csc() for  = 0 and  =  is equal to infinity () and for values of
csc( = /2) = 1. Similar every line can be evaluated. The lines are drawn in Figure
12.13.

       The velocity of this flow field can be found by using the equations that were
developed so far. The radial velocity is

                            1                         a2  (12.166)

The tangential velocity is

         Example 12.8: Sink in Uniform Flow               Level: Basic

     A sink is placed in a uniform flow field from the left to right. Describe flow field

     by the stream lines. Find the shape of the solid body described by this flow.

     Solution

     The stream function for uniform flow is given by equation (12.80b) and the stream by

     equation (12.90) (with positive sign because it is source). Hence the stream function

     is                                            Q
                             = U0 r sin  +

     For  = 0 equation (12.8.a) becomes

                                             Q            (12.8.b)

     or in for any value of stream function,  as

                            r=           -        Q       (12.8.c)

     The long cigar shape resulted from the combination of the uniform flow with the source
     is presented in Figure 12.14. The black line represents the solid body that created
     and show two different kind of flows. The exterior and the interior flow represent the
     external flow outside and the inside the black line represents the flow on the enclosed
     body.
     The black line divides the streamline, which separates the fluid coming from the
     uniform source the flow due to the inside source. Thus, these flows represent a flow
     around semi-infinite solid body and flow from a source in enclosed body.

the intuition) of the solid body (or

equation (12.8.d) can be written as

                    y = Q  = Q                                                      (12.8.e)
                         2  U0 2 U0

It can be noticed that sign in front of y is accounted for and thus removed from the
equation. To check if this analysis is consistent with the continuity equation, the
velocity at infinity must be U = U0 because the velocity due to the source is reduced
as  1/r. Hence, the source flow rate must must be balanced (see for the integral
mass conservation) flow rate at infinity hence

                    Q = U0 2 y = U0 2 Q0 = Q0                                        (12.8.f )
                                             2 U0

        The stagnation point can be seen from Figure 12.14 by ascertaining the location
where the velocity is zero. Due to the symmetry the location is on "solid" body on
the x-coordinate at some distance from the origin. This distance can be found by
looking the combined velocities as

                    U0 = Q0 = r = Q0                                                 (12.8.g)

Pressure Distribution

       One advantage of the inviscid flow approach is the ability to have good estimates
of the pressure and velocity distribution. These two (pressure and velocity distribution)
are related via the Bernoulli's equation. The explanation and use is based on a specific
example and for a specific information.

       To illustrate this point the velocity distribution consider a doublet in uniform
flow which was examined earlier. The velocity field is a function of x, y and hence to
answer questions such as the location where the highest velocity or the highest velocity
itself is required to find the maximum point. This operation is a standard operation in

mathematics. However, in this case the observa-

tion of Figure 12.13 suggests that the height ve-

locity is at the line of the y-coordinate. The fun-

damental reason for the above conclusion is that                 U0

the area symmetry around y coordinate and the

fact that cross area shrink. The radial velocity

is zero on the y-coordinate (due the symmetry

and similar arguments) is zero. The tangential

velocity on the "solid" body is

angles is presented in Figure (12.15).

       Beside the velocity field, the pressure distribution is a common knowledge needed
for many engineering tasks. The Euler number is a dimensionless number representing
the pressure and is defined as

                                       Eu = P0 - P                   (12.171)
                                                1  U02
                                                2

In inviscid flow (Euler's equations) as a sub set of Naiver-Stokes equations the energy
conserved hence (see for discussion on Bernoulli equation),

     P0  =  P                    +  1  U2  or  P0    -P    =  1  U2  (12.172)
                                    2                         2

Dividing equation (12.172) by U02 yields

     P0 - P 1 U 2                                    P0 - P U 2      (12.173)

The velocity on the surface of the "solid" body is given by equation (12.168) Hence,

                                    1 2 P0 - P = 4 sin2              (12.174)

It is interesting to point that integration of the pressure results in no lift and no resistance
to the flow.This "surprising" conclusion can by provided by carrying the integration of
around the "solid" body and taking the x or y component depending if lift or drag is
calculated. Additionally, it can noticed that symmetry play major role which one side
cancel the other side.

Solution

The superposition of the source and sink follows:

(x, y) = m ln (x - a cos )2 + (y - a sin )2
             2

                       + ln (x + a cos )2 + (y + a sin )2 (12.9.a)

                       + ln (x + a cos )2 + (y + a sin )2       (12.9.b)

From mathematical point of view this can be replaced by
   (x, y) =   ln (x - a cos )2 + (y - a sin )2
                a 2  a

                       + ln (x + a cos )2 + (y + a sin )2       (12.9.c)

The results of the latest equation after some manipulations can be summarized as

                    (x, y) = -   x cos  + y sin                (12.9.d)

12.3.1.1 Adding Circulation to a Cylinder

The cylinder discussed in the previous sections was made from a dipole in a uniform
flow field. It was demonstrated that in the potential flow has no resistance, and no lift
due to symmetry of the pressure distribution. Thus, it was suggested that by adding
an additional component that it would change the symmetry but not change the shape
476                                              CHAPTER 12. POTENTIAL FLOW

and hence it would provide the representation cylinder with lift. It turned out that this
idea yields a better understanding of the one primary reason of lift. This results was
verified by the experimental evidence.

       The linear characteristic (superposition principle) provides by adding the stream
function of the free vortex to the previous the stream function for the case. The stream
function in this case (see equation (12.159)) is

                                                r2      a                      (12.175)
               = U0 r sin  1 - a                    + ln
                                                       2 r

       It can be noticed that this stream function (12.175) on the body is equal to
(r = a) = 0. Hence, the shape of the body remains a circle. The corresponding radial
velocity in cylindrical coordinates (unchanged) and is

                                  1                     a2                     (12.176)
              Ur = r  = U0 cos  1 - r

The tangential velocity is changed (add velocity at the top and reduce velocity at the
bottom or vice versa depending of the sign of the ) to be

                                                    a2                         (12.177)

       As it was stated before, examination of the stream function  = 0 is constructed.
As it was constructed and discussed earlier it was observed that the location of stag-
nation stream function is on r = a. On this line, equation (12.175) can be written
as

At the point r = a the ratio in the box is approaching 0/0 and to examine what happen

to it L'Hopital's rule can be applied. The examination can be simplified by denoting
 = (a/r)2 = r and noticing that  = 1 at that point and hence

                                                         1                     (12.180)

Hence, the relationship expressed in equation (12.178) as

                    -                                                (12.181)

This condition (12.181) limits the value of maximum circulation on the body due to
the maximum value of sin function. The doublet strength maximum strength can be

       The value of doublet strength determines the stagnation points (which were
moved by the free vortex so to speak). For example, the stagnation points for the

              -

The solution for equation (theta, ) (12.183) is 15 or /12 and 165 or 11 /12. For
various stagnation points can be found in similar way.

       The rest of the points of the stagnation stream lines are found from the equation
(12.179). For the previous example with specific value of the ratio,  as

There is a special point where the two points are merging 0 and .
       For all other points stream function can be calculated from equation (12.175) can

       The stagnation line occur when n = 0 hence equation (12.187) satisfied for all
r = 1 regardless to value of the . However, these are not the only solutions. To obtain
the solution equation (stagnation line) (12.187) is rearranged as

                                                            = sin 2 -1 2  r ln r                                                                           (12.188)
                                                                            1-r

       Equation (12.187) has three roots (sometime only one) in the most zone and
parameters. One roots is in the vicinity of zero. The second roots is around the one
(1). The third and the largest root which has the physical meaning is obtained when
the dominate term r2 "takes" control.

       The results are shown in Figure 12.16. Figure 12.16a depicts the stream lines
when the dimensionless vortex is below one. Figure 12.16b depicts the limiting case
where the dimensionless vortex is exactly one. Once the dimensionless vortex exceeds
one, the stagnation points do touch the solid body.

Pressure Distribution Around the solid Body

       The interesting part of the above analysis is to find or express the pressure around
the body. With this expression the resistance and the lift can be calculated. The body
reacts to static pressure, as opposed to dynamic pressure, and hence this part of the
pressure needed to be evaluated. For this process the Bernoulli's equation is utilized
and can be written as

                  P = P0 - 12  Ur2 + U2                    (12.189)

It can be noticed that the two cylindrical components were accounted for. The radial
component is zero (no flow cross the stream line) and hence the total velocity is the
tangential velocity (see equation (12.177) where r = a) which can be written as

                                                           (12.190)
                  U = 2 U0 sin  + 2  a                     (12.191)

Thus, the pressure on the cylinder can be written as

        P = P0 - 21  4 U02 sin2  + 2 U0  sin  +       2

dictates that D'Alembert's paradox is valid i.e that there is no resistance to the flow.
However, in this case there is no symmetry around x coordinate (see Figure 12.16). The
distortion of the symmetry around x coordinate contribute to lift and expected. The
lift can be calculated from the integral around the solid body (stream line) and taking
only the y component. The force elements is

                  dF = -j  P ndA                          (12.192)

where in this case j is the vertical unit vector in the downward direction, and the
infinitesimal area has direction which here is broken into in the value dA and the
standard direction n. To carry the integration the unit vector n is written as

                  n = i cos  + j sin                       (12.193)

The reason for definition or split (12.193) to take into account only the vertical com-
ponent. Using the above derivation leads to

Integration of the sin  in power of odd number between 0 and 2  is zero. Hence the
only term that left from the integration (12.195) is

             L = -  U0             2                         (12.196)

The lift created by the circulating referred as the Magnus effect which name after a

Jewish scientist who live in Germany who discover or observed this phenomenon. In

fact, physicists and engineers dismiss this phenomenon is "optical illusion." However,

the physical explanation is based on the viscosity and the vortex is the mechanism that

was found to transfer the viscosity to inviscid flow. In certain ranges the simultaneously

translate and rotation movement causes the lift of the moving object. This can be

observed in a thrown ball with spin over

1000 rpm and speed in over 5 m/sec. In

these parameters, the ball is moving in               U0-r 
curved line to the target. To understand

the reason for this curving, the schematic

if the ball is drawn (Figure 12.17). The               U0
ball is moving to the right and rotating
counter clockwise. The velocity at the

top of the ball is reduced due to the ro-

tation while the velocity at the bottom

of the ball is increased. According to

Bernoulli's equation, reduction or increase

of the velocity changes the static pres-              U0+r 
sure. Hence, the static pressure is not sym-

metrical and it causes a force perpendicu-      Fig. 12.17 - Schematic to explain Mag-
lar to the ball movement. It can be no-              nus's effect.

ticed the direction of the rotation changes

the direction of the forces. In addition to the change of the pressure, the resistance

changes because it is a function of the velocity. In many ranges the increase of the

velocity increase the resistance. Hence, there are two different velocities at the top

and bottom. The resistance, as a function of the velocity, is different on the bottom

as compared to the top. These two different mechanisms cause the ball to move in

perpendicular direction to the flow direction.

       The circulation mimics the Magnus's effect and hence it is used in representative
flow. In the above discussion it was used for body of perfect circular shape. However,
it was observed that bodies with a very complicated shape such as airplane wing, the
lift can be represented by of vortex. This idea was suggested independently by the
German Martin Wilhelm Kutta from the numerical method of Runge-Kutta and by
the Russian Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky (Joukowski). Zhukovsky suggested that the
dimensionless nature of vortex is controlling the any shape. The extension can be done
by defining the circulation as

                         = U  ds = U cos  ds                                            (12.197)

                         C                     C

Kutta-Joukowski theorem refers to the
equation

L = - U                  (12.198)                     SL  SB

The circulation of a ball or cylinder is easy     U0

to imagine. Yet a typical air plane do not        Fig. 12.18 - Wing in a typical uniform

viscid flow of with vortex can represent the

viscous flow. For example flow airplane wing will have typical stream line such as shown

in Figure 12.18. However, the viscous flow does not behaves in this fashion especially

at the trailing part of the wing. The flow around the wing sheds vortexes because

the sharp turn of the flow. The sheds vortexes existence is like the free vortexes since

integral including these vortexes can be included in the calculations of the circulation

(see equation 12.197).

12.4 Complex Potential

12.4.1 Complex Potential and Complex Velocity

The definition of Cauchy-Riemann equations can lead to the definition of the complex
potential F (z) as following

                        F (z) = (x, y) + i (x, y)                                        (12.199)

where z = x + i y. This definition based on the hope that F is differentiable and
continuous8 or in other words analytical. In that case a derivative with respect to z

when z is real number is

                        dF dF d d                                                        (12.200)
                             = = +i

                        dz dx dx dx

8An analytic function is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series.
482                   CHAPTER 12. POTENTIAL FLOW

On the other hand, the derivative with respect to the z that occurs when z is pure
imaginary number then

     dF 1 dF  dF d d                                          (12.201)
     =        = -i = - +
     dz i dy  dy        dy dy

Equations (12.200) and (12.201) show that the derivative with respect to z depends on
the orientation of z. It is desired that the derivative with respect z will be independent
of the orientation. Hence, the requirement is that the result in both equations must be
identical. Hence,

                                                              (12.202)
                  =

              x y

                                                              (12.203)
                  =-

              y x

In fact, the reverse also can be proved that if the Cauchy-Riemann equations condition
exists it implies that the complex derivative also must be exist.

       Hence, using the complex number guarantees that the Laplacian of the stream
function and the potential function must be satisfied (why?). While this method cannot
be generalized three dimensions it provides good education purposes and benefits for
specific cases. One major advantage of this method is the complex number technique
can be used without the need to solve differential equation. The derivative of the F is
independent of the orientation of the z and the complex velocity can be defined as

                                                          dF  (12.204)
                                              W (z) =

                                                          dz
This also can be defined regardless as the direction as

                dF                                            (12.205)
     W (z) = = + i

                dx x x

Using the definition that were used for the potential and the stream functions, one can
obtain that

        dF                                                    (12.206)
        dz = Ux - i Uy

       The characteristic complex number when multiplied by the conjugate, the results
in a real number (hence can be view as scalar) such as

     W W = (Ux - i Uy) (Ux + i Uy) = Ux2 + Uy2                (12.207)

In Bernoulli's equation the summation of the squares appear and so in equation (12.207).
Hence, this multiplication of the complex velocity by its conjugate needs velocity for
relationship of pressure-velocity.
12.4. COMPLEX POTENTIAL                                    483

       The complex numbers sometimes are easier to handle using polar coordinates in
such case like finding roots etc. From the Figure the following geometrical transforma-
tion can be written

     Ux = Ur cos  - U sin                                  (12.208)

and

     Ux = Ur sin  + U sin                                  (12.209)

Using the above expression in the complex velocity yields

     W = (Ur cos  - U sin ) - i (Ur sin  + U cos )         (12.210)

Combining the r and  component separately

     W = Ur (cos  - i sin ) - U (cos  - i sin )            (12.211)

It can be noticed the Euler identity can be used in this case to express the terms that,
are multiplying the velocity and since they are similar to obtain

                         W = (Ur - i U) e-i                (12.212)

Uniform Flow

       The uniform flow is revisited here with a connection to the complex numbers
presentation. In the previous section, the uniform flow was present as the flow from
the left to right. Here, this presentation will be expanded. The connection between
the mathematical presentation to the physical flow is weak at best and experience is
required. One can consider the flow that described by the function

     F (z) = c z = c (x + i )                              (12.213)

The complex flow is                                        (12.214)
                                                     dF

                                              W = =c
                                                      dz

The complex velocity was found to be represented as

                         W = c = Ux - i Uy                 (12.215)

There are three extreme cases that need to be examined. The first case is when c is a
real number. In that case, it requires that Ux = c which is exactly the case that was
presented earlier. The case the constant is imaginary resulting in

                         Ux - i Uy = -i c                  (12.216)
484                                        CHAPTER 12. POTENTIAL FLOW

When it was chosen that the constant value is negative it yields

                                   Uy = c                         (12.217)

This kind of flow is when the direction is upward and was not discussed in the standard
presentation earlier. The third case, the constant is a complex number. In that case,
the complex number is present in either polar coordinate for convenience or in Cartesian
coordinate to be as

                                   F (z) = c e-i z                (12.218)

The complex velocity will be then

                            W (z) = c cos  - i c sin              (12.219)

Hence the component of the velocity are

                                   Ux = c cos                     (12.220)
                                   Uy = c sin 

This flow is the generalized uniform flow where the flow is in arbitrary angle with the
coordinates. In general the uniform flow is described in two-dimensional field as

                                   F (z) = U0 e-i z               (12.221)

This flow contains two extremes cases discussed earlier horizontal and vertical flow.

Flow in a Sector
       The uniform flow presentation seem to be just repeat of what was done in the

presentation without the complex numbers. In sector flow is an example where the
complex number presentation starts to shine. The sector flow is referred to as a flow in
sector. Sector is a flow in opening with specific angle.The potential is defined as

                                   F (z) = U0 zn                  (12.222)

where n  1 the relationship between the n and opening angle will be established in
this development. The polar represented is used in this derivations as z = r ei  and

substituting into equation (12.222) provides

     F (z) = U0 rn cos(n) + i U0 rn sin(n)                        (12.223)

The potential function is

                                    = U0 rn cos(n)                (12.224)

and the stream function is

                                    = U0 rn sin(n)                (12.225)
12.4. COMPLEX POTENTIAL                                                                                  485

The stream function is zero in two extreme cases: one when the  = 0 and two when
 = /n. The stream line where  = 0 are radial lines at the angles and  = 0 and
 = /n. The zone between these two line the streamline are defined by the equation
of  = U0 rn sin(n). The complex velocity can be defined as the velocity along these
lines and is

    W (z) = n U0 zn-1 = n U0 rn-1ei (n-1) =                                                          (12.226)
                                      = n U0 rn-1 cos(n) + i n U0 rn-1 sin(n) ei 

Thus the velocity components are                                                                     (12.227)
                                       Ur = n U0 rn-1 cos(n)

and

                                     U = -n U0 rn-1 sin(n)                                           (12.228)

It  can  be  observed   that    the  radial   velocity  is  positive  in  the  range  of  0  <    <      while
                                                                                                     2n
                                                   n .
it is negative in the range          2n   <<                The tangential velocity is negative in the

0   <    <       while  it  is  positive  in  the  range        <    <    n .
             2n                                             2n

         In the above discussion it was established the relationship between the sector

angle and the power n. For n the flow became uniform and increased of the value of

the power, n reduce the sector. For example if n = 2 the flow is in a right angle sector.

Generally the potential of shape corner is given by

                                              F (z) = U0 zn                                          (12.229)

Flow Around a Sharp Edge

         It can be observed that when n < 1 the angle is larger then  this case of flow

around sharp corner. This kind of flow creates a significant acceleration that will be

dealt in some length in compressible flow under the chapter of Prandtl-Meyer Flow.

Here it is assumed that the flow is ideal and there is continuation in the flow and large

accelerations are possible.

         There is a specific situation where there is a turn around a flat plate. In this

extreme case is when the value of n < 0.5. In that case, the flow turn around the 2 

angle. In that extreme case the complex potential function is

                                                                                                     (12.230)
                                              F (z) = c z

If the value of c is taken as real the angle must be limited within the standard 360 and

the explicit potential in polar coordinates is

                                              F (z) = c r e0.5 i                                     (12.231)

The potential function is

                                                                                                     (12.232)
                                               = c r cos

                                                               2

The stream function is

                   Fig. 12.19 - Contour of two dimensional body with control volume.

In the previous sections it was shown that solid bodies can represented by elementary
elements that that obey Laplace's Equation equation. It was shown that these bodies
follow D'Alembert's paradox. This can be observed by utilizing Bernoulli's equation
to calculate the pressure distribution. Several parameters derived with these kind of
calculation are related to the circulation. These important parameters are the focus
of this section. To examine this point an two-dimensional arbitrary body is examined.
Suppose that this arbitrary body is enclosed by a control volume as depicted in the
Figure ??.

       The lifting force and the resistance (force) are depended on the pressure distri-
bution along the body and with the body surface contour. This analysis is attempted
to find the what part the core contributor the these forces. The force can be utilize
the momentum equation applied to the control volume. It can noticed that the body
surface is actually a stream line where no flow accords. The force due to the pressure
on body is eliminated because D'Alembert's paradox. There is no force acting on the
body because there is no shear stress. Hence the force on the body in the x coordinate
can be written as

     -Fx -                    P dx =         Ux (Ux dy - Uy dx)  (12.234)

                        cout          cout

The right hand side is written from the observations the Ux contribute to the momentum
while the Uy detracts from the momentum. Under the same arguments the momentum

equation can be written in the y direction as

                -Fy -        P dy =             Uy (Ux dy - Uy dx)  (12.235)

                       cout          cout

Equations (12.234) and (12.235) allow to solve the forces (resistance and the lift) as

                      Fx = cout P dx +  Ux (Ux dy - Uy dx)          (12.236)
                      Fy = cout P dy +  Uy (Ux dy - Uy dx)

The Bernoulli's equation can be used to eliminate the pressure from equation (12.236)
as P +  Ux2 + Uy2 2 = CB where CB is a constant.

                  Fx =  cout   Ux2 - Uy2          dy + Ux Uy dx     (12.237)
                Fy = - cout    Ux2 - Uy2          dx + Uy Uy dy

It can be noticed that the identity C = 0 was used. It happened that equation can
be represented by the complex velocity as

                             1st Blasius' Theorem

                                               W 2 dz               (12.238)
                       Fx - i Fy = i 2

This identity can be proved by carrying the expanding the terms in equation (12.238).

      W 2 dz =        (Ux - i Uy)2 (dx + i dy) =

cout            cout

       Ux2 - Uy2 dx + 2 Ux Uy dy + i Ux2 - Uy2 dx + 2 Ux Uy dy      (12.239)

cout

Which is the same as in equation (12.237) It has to be emphasized the Fx and Fy
are the forces that act on the through the center of mass. And the complex velocity
W (z) is the velocity that determined also by the derivative of the complex potential.
The evaluation of the integral is normally done by computed by using Cauchy's residue
theorem.

       The 1st Blasius theorem is referred to the forces that act through the center of
mass the same can done for the moment that act on the center of the mass.

12.5.1 Forces and Moment Acting on Circular Cylinder.

The approach adapted in "Ideal Flow" was to find a solution specific shape and then
convert any shape to the "solution" shape. The conversion of shapes is referred as
conformal mapping. The chosen shape is the simplest as a cylinder. The complex
potential of cylinder was given as

                                              a2 i  z
                         F (z) = U z + + ln

                                              z 2 a

Thus, the complex velocity is

                                  W (z) = U        a2                       (12.241)
                                              1 - z2

The velocity square in that case is

     2               2 2 U 2 a2 U 4 a4 i U                 i U  a2          (12.242)
     W (2) = U - 2 + 4 + -                             2 2- 3
                         z            z       z 4 z        z

Utilizing the Blasius's first theorem reads

                     i            W 2(residues in side the control volume)  (12.243)
     Fx - i Fy = 2 2  i

According the theory, the residue contribution is due to the singular points of the form
of c/z contribute. In the is case

                         i        2i     iU   = -i  U                       (12.244)

                         2                  

This calculations show that there is no resistance force but the force in the y direction

(the lift) is equal

                               Kutta-Joukowski Theorem

                                      Fy =  U                               (12.245)

According to Kutta-Joukowski theorem there is no lift if there is no vortex. Interesting
this fact was observed in creation of circulation (vortex) in many aviation devices.
Furthermore, the direction of the circulation (clockwise or counterclockwise) determines
the direction of the lift up or down. The examination of the moment on cylindrical shape
can be done by Blasius second theorem.

     2               2 2 U 2 a2 U 4 a4 i U                 i U  a2          (12.246)
     z W (2) = z U -                 + 3+ - 2-
                               z         z     4 z z           2

The moment is depends on the residue. In this case there two terms the contribute to
the residue.

                                              2 2                           (12.247)

                            2                   2

This result could be explained by the symmetry that there is no moment.

12.7 Qualitative questions                                             (Question 12.a)

1) The potential function is given by
                                               = x5 - 3 x y3

Determine the velocity components of this potential function. Calculate the stream
function and sketch the stream function.

2) A Wheel-type flow is a flow describe by the equation

                                     r                                 (Question 12.b)
                         U = U0 r0

Where radial velocity is zero Ur = 0 and r0 is typical dimension in this case. Demon-
strate that such flow can be potential flow. Calculate the vorticity in this case.

3) The stream line function is given by the equation

           = U0 x + Q0 cot1 x                                          (Question 12.c)
                         2 y

Calculate the Cartesian components of the velocity field. Sketch the stream line and
the stagnation points of the flow.

12.8 Additional Example

  Example 12.12: Flow to Streamlines                             Level: Intermediate
The velocity field is described the equation

          U = -3 y j + 3 x j                                           (12.12.a)

Draw the streamlines. Is there a potential function? If so what the potential
function.

Solution

The streamlines can be determined from equation (12.66) and therefore

          dy = Uy = - 3 x = - x                                        (12.12.b)
          dx Ux          3y                                   y

Equation (12.12.b) is a simple ODE that can be solved by direction integration as

          y dy + x dx = 0 = y2 + x2 = c                                (12.12.c)

These stream lines are of description of the circular streamlines.

       Example 12.13: Get Stream From U                             Level: Intermediate
     A two dimensional flow field is given as

                             Uy =  yx2 + y2Ux =  xx2 + y2            (12.13.a)
                             2                        2

     Find the stream function and what is the line described by  = 0?

     Solution

     The stream function can be obtained by integration as

                              = Uy dy + f (x) + c                      (12.13.b)

                              = Ux dx + f (y) + c                      (12.13.c)

     The integration of the equations (12.13.b) and (??) leads

      =  yx2 + y2 dy + f (x) + c =  ln x2 + y2 + f (x) + c           (12.13.d)
               2                                4

     it can be noticed that x2 + y2 = r2 and hence equation (12.13.d) can be written as

                =  ln r2 + f (x) + c = 2 ln (r) + f (x) + c         (12.13.e)
                  4                             e42                    (12.13.f )
                                                                       (12.13.g)
     Hence,                   =  ln (r) + f (x) + c
                                   2

     In the same fashion it can be done for the other direction as

                              =  ln (r) + f (y) + c
                                   2

     It is evident from equations (12.13.f) (12.13.g) that

                                     f (x) = f (y) = c                 (12.13.h)

     In summary the potential function is                               (12.13.i)
                                                 =  ln (r) + c         (12.13.j)
                                                      2                (12.13.k)
                                                                        (12.13.l)
     But when r = 1 the potential  = 0 (otherwise ) hence c = 0.       (12.13.m)

     The radial velocity is

                                     Ur =  = 1 
                                             r r 

     In this case the stream function found by

                              =  =  =   + f (r)
                              2                       2

     In the same fashion it is done to in the  direction as

                             U = 1  = -  = 0
                                     r r              r

     Hence, f (r) = constant. Thus,  =

Example 12.14: Section Structures                      Level: Intermediate

Uniform along the direction of the x coordinate needs several different flows

structures. Draw the streamline for these various situation.

1. Source                          3. Left Doublet
2. Sink                            4. Right Doublet

Explain why the stream line looks the way they looks.

Solution

The flow description of source and uniform flow is provided earlier by Rankine body
what is shown in Figure 12.14. The flow of an uniform flow around sink can be analyzed
by looking the extreme situations. The flow at the far left (downstream) is not affected
by the sink. The same argument can be said to the far right (downstream), the flow is
not affected by the missing flow (sink) because it is divided by the infinite size of the
uniform flow. From dimensional analyzed this situation is similar an infinitely weak
sink in uniform flow. The flow at the right (downstream) is affected by the sink. The
streamline are given by the equation of

                                  Q                           (12.14.a)
            = U- r sin - 2  

At the case of  = 0 the solid body that it is created is exact opposite of the of source
and uniform flow. The situation is depicted in Figure 12.20.
Uniform flow with right doublet was described before. Uniform flow with left doublet
(sink is upstream and source downstream) has different characteristic.

     is k. The bottom surface of the piston

     Solution

     Utilizing Eq. (12.15.a) and substituting the throat velocity into Eq. (12.15.b) as

                            U2                     D4                            (12.15.c)

ringe is 10 [mm]. Water density is 1000

[kg/m3]. The plunger is pushed in at 10 [mm/s] and the water comes out as

a jet. Assuming ideal flow, the force F , in Newtons, required on the plunger

to push out the water is

          (c) 0.13                       (d) 1.15

Solution

Denoting 1 for syringe and 2 for needle. Given : d1 = 0.01 [m], d2 = 0.001 [m]
l2 = 0.1 [m],  = 1000 [kg/m], and v1 = 0.01 [m/s] Assuming incompressible flow
and with mass conservation read in this case

                          d1 2 2                                       (12.16.a)

                          d2

The needle opens to the atmosphere therefore the pressure at the exit is atmosphere
(also not needed). Utilizing Bernoulli's equation

                          p1 - p2 = v22 - v12                          (12.16.b)
                                         2

The force that has overcome this pressure difference is

which is                                            D12                (12.16.c)

   Solution
                                           u =a x                               (12.17.a)
     The velocity Components are           v =a y                               (12.17.b)
     The stream line is obtained by
                                          dx = dy
     The integration of both sides reads   uv
                                          dx = dy
                                          ea x ea y
                                          dx = dy

                            ln x = ln y + ln c = ln c y                         (12.17.c)

So the general form is

                                          x = cy                                (12.17.d)

For point at question (x = 1, y = 2), c = 1/2. Therefore, equation of stream line is

                                          2x - y = 0                            (12.17.e)

The answer is (c).

Example 12.18: Divergent Flow                            Level: GATE 2004

For a fluid flow through a divergent pipe of length L having inlet and outlet radii

R1 and R2, respectively, and a constant flow rate of Q, assuming the velocity
to be axial and uniform at any cross-section, the acceleration at the exit is

(a)  L R23 2 Q (R1-R2)                                (b) 2 L R23 2 Q2(R1-R2)
(c) 2 L R25 2 Q2(R1-R2)                               (d) 2 L R25 2 Q2 (R2-R1)

Solution

In this case the radial and  velocity or other words in Cartesian velocity u and v
component are zero. The flow is steady state hence the acceleration is given by

                                       0                                        (12.18.a)

ity gradient. The simple approach is what probably expect from GATE is to assume

linear distribution. Or to assume a distribution of the radius as a function of x. Since

     What is forced vortex flow?
     A force is applied to fluid causing translation or rotation at constant acceleration
     when there is no relative motion between the liquid particle, then no shear stresses
     exit. An obvious example is container rotation around its vertical axis (full) of liquid
     in a constant angular velocity. In this case the fluid rotate as a solid body. Examples
     of forced vortex flow include a whirlpool, water flows out of a bathtub or toilet or sink,
     flow in the centrifugal pump, even flow in a pipe bend.
     P is sometime correct. In this case, incompressible and steady is such case. There is
     no velocity gradient and thus no vorticity.

The condition of the incompressible flow is   U = 0 or in explicit form as

stream line and an equipotential line in a flow field

(a) are parallel to each other

(b) are perpendicular to each other

(c) intersect at an acute angle

(d) are identical

Solution

The way to remember the relationship between these lines is that stream lines are
line which the fluid flows along them. Conceptually, the potential line represent the
difference that causes the fluid to move (the driving force). Thus these lines must be
perpendicular (orthogonal) to each other.
The answer is (b).
13 Added Mass (Moment of Inertia) and

                    Transfer Properties

This chapter is dedicated to my teacher, Dr. Touvia Miloh.

13.1 Introduction       Genick Bar-Meir

       Traditionally this topic is not covered by an introductory class on fluid mechanics
nor ship stability or marine architecture. This topic is considered to be too advanced
for regular fluid mechanics students or marine architecture. Here, it is advocating to
introduce the material conceptually without actually doing the actual calculations of
the added mass and added moment of inertia. The reason for this approach is to make
students aware of these phenomena and/or at least to the practitioners in the field.

       It is the experience of this undersign, that it is common that people not aware
of these properties and make calculations that have very little to do with reality. The
most obvious, a typical usage of both properties is in the marine or ship calculations
issue dealing with interaction of fluid with solid structures and energy harvesting. Yet,
many engineers who start to work in these areas are clueless on these issues. Not
only entry engineers are in lack understanding even researchers who work in this area
of added mass. Some of the these researchers are making calculations that are not
rooted on reality or break the meaning of the added mass. For instance, some papers
dealing with numerical calculations of added mass but they include turbulence effects
while turbulence should not account by the calculations of the added mass (Kianejad,
Enshaei, and Ranmuthugala 2017)1. For another example Brennen a main/premier
researcher stated that (Brennen 1982, p 6 second paragraph)

    1Kianejad et al also include among other thing large angles (strange) and several other parameters.
It is not unique and many other researchers include these parameters. None of them seem to be able
to explain this inclusion. It is a case of more is actually less

                   503
504  CHAPTER 13. ADDED MASS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES

       One other complication will emerge in the following section when the com-
       plete added mass matrix is defined, namely that the force on the body due
       to acceleration is not necessarily in the same direction as the acceleration.
       For an unsymmetnic body acceleration in one direction can give rise to an
       "added mass" effect resulting in a force which has a component in a direc-
       tion perpendicular to the direction of acceleration. If, for example, one were
       lifting a body from the ocean bottom by means of a cable then an increase
       in the lift rate could produce a lateral action of the body.

This statement is wrong! Brennen was not aware to the existence of the transfer
properties. He conflates the transfer properties with the added properties which will be
discussed down below. The added mass properties are related to the acceleration.

       In fact, since this material has been changed dramatically the current state of
knowledge, it should be brought even to the attention of the people which deal with
added mass research, mass transfer transfer (bubble flow) or multi-phase (especially
with liquid solid flow or large change in density)2. Even the most fundamental part like
difference between the added mass coefficients vs the added mass was not clear in any
book or research to this point even to this author before the writing.

       This chapter is introductory which emphasis the understanding of the concept
rather than actual calculations. Hence, this chapter provides examples where people
mistakenly claim that something is results of added mass effect while it is not. Thus,
a discussion will be focusing on the definition and character, later attempt is made to
differentiate what is and what is not added mass (or related to it or results of it).

       One can wonder how long it will take this information to penetrate to premier
universities, USA government and other organizations?3

       The added properties are not just a theoretical concept but a practical one and
probably all people felt it when got into water. When a question on "why people feel
heavy in the water?" is common on many quora and other discussion boards. However,
they get wrong since their assume that it related to buoyancy. They conflating two
phenomena the buoyancy and the added mass. The buoyancy makes us feel lighter
but our movement feel heavy because we have to move the water which is double our
weight (mass).

13.2 History

Meta

       The added mass was introduced as early as 1776 by Du Buat (Du Buat 1786) in

    2It so strange to write something and while you doing it to realize that so little is based on science.
Everything has to be questioned so it could be understand because the common believe is full with
misconceptions.

    3Some individuals believe that it will take about 10 years to spread the information. Other believe
that it will be about 40 years. This author contacted several individuals who work with the USA
government or with association with the government yet they did not bother to reply. This fact makes
one to believe that it will take long time. Yet two discussions on the invitation to give a workshop
makes one more optimistic.

first edition (copy of the book strangely can be found the University of Michigan
call number QC151.D8211816). The time and gravity calculations required more
precision which was prompted notice added mass (time for the pendulum period).
His measurements showed that the added mass of sphere was value in the range
0.45-0.67. Consider that theoretical value is 0.5 which is a great success. Later
Green studied the added mass in 1833 for the same reason and George Stokes
(Stokes et al. 1851). In parallel Friedrich Bessel proposed the concept of added
mass in 1828 (no real reference only claims of second hand). Even Charles Darwin
(Darwin 1953) have worked on showing that the particle actually moving during
the movement of the body. The sphere shape was solved on 1833 by Green
(Lamb 1924). The generalization of the added properties was done by Stokes
where investigate the affects of the boundaries.

Meta End

13.3 What is the Added Mass?

A ball placed in a close container and via exterior (or interior) force such as magnetic

force is propelled foreword. A ball in a container full with fluid is shown in Fig. 13.1.

The container is closed and hence no ma-

terial leaves or enters the container. First,

it is assumed that fluid in the container is

incompressible. Some of the material must

move to the right when the ball moves to        dU
                                                dt

the left (conservation of mass). The mass

conservation requires that if a change in

ball's location occurs then the first deriva-

tive (velocity) and the second derivative (ac-

celeration) etc of the ball must be com-        Fig. 13.1 - Accelerating ball in a close
pensated as well. These compensations                container.

of such movement requires the fluid to

displace volume not occupying by the ball. These changes in the fluid field require

that a force or in other words, the change in the field energy must occur. Namely,

additional force is needed to give the body a certain acceleration beside the regular

F = mbody a. This additional force, can be written as Fa = ma a where a is the same

acceleration of the body, Fa is the required added force, and ma is the added mass.

Without the detail, it must recognized the (exterior not required) force also to the

right (even though the liquid moves the left). Thus, if the force can be calculated,

the added mass can be calculated. The flow field is elliptical character and hence the

added force should linearly depend on the body acceleration. The term elliptical refers

to the superposition possibility (see equation Eq. (12.108)). Body in a flow in which

obeys these kind of equations can have a segregate added force and the added mass

(There are those who oppose to this statement.). These complicated calculations of

those forces and moments due to the fact that they requires two stages (at least).
506  CHAPTER 13. ADDED MASS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES

The first stage is to find velocity field and the second to find how this velocity field is
changed with the body acceleration.

       The added mass is not defined by actual material. Furthermore, it does not
confined/defined to the material that has a certain acceleration. The definition of the
added simply is based on the added force. The added mass, like all the masses, represents
the resistance to the acceleration. In "normal" situation the added mass confined to
specific material. In this case, no specific material can be assigned or confined. This
imaginary material is material that would be at the origin coordinate system used for
the calculations and mass value is ratio of the force and the acceleration. In fact this
mass is attributed to liquid (with constant density) and hence it can be defined by the
liquid volume (utilizing the liquid density). This volume is not the same as the volume
of the body but a strong unction of the body geometry.

       Suppose that these calculations can be carried (somehow easily), the change of
the force depends on the container. Different containers require different forces. As
engineers always have done, the documentations/calculations are broken into two parts.
The first part, calculations/documentations are carried for a moving body in a infinite
container. Second part done when the added mass is calculated/documented for body,
then the change in the container size effects are calculated and documented. The
question, can the container effects be transferable from one body to another. At first
glance, the problem problem is elliptic in nature (allows superposition) and it seems
that it should be correct. Yet, this topic for some strange reasons is not conclusive
and there is a dispute on accuracy of the idea (even though the proof in the appendix
of this chapter it is still debatable4). Of course, the main opposition rest with those
how believe that turbulence and velocity (Reynolds number) should entered into the
calculations. This author takes the position that is reasonable to apply superposition5.

       The added mass is important in several situations specialty when the added prop-
erties are in same size as the forces or the moments to the only the body. The typical
situations where the added properties important are the marine (ship or floating bodies),
high rise building, and propellers.

       Two topics are to be mentioned the compressibility, free surface, and the case
of the two phase materials like water and air. The second topic is a typical issue for
ship stability and even for multiphase flow. Compressible substance such as air, often
have much lower density then the solid (or semisolid) body and hence can be ignored
for most applications in this introductory material. The calculations of the added mass
for free surface suffered from additional complications. The surface is deformed and
it added complexity to the calculations. At this stage a little can be added (to free
surface) that is not too complicate.

       The idea of added mass is initially build for high Reynolds numbers (ideal flow).
Clearly the added mass exist in different Reynolds number range yet the separation
is harder. It is implies that added mass is somehow depends on Reynolds seem a

    4The meaning dispute in this context is that there are many publications dealing with different
boundary conditions for different bodies.

    5If someone can provided the proof to either way that should be the case. The proof at the end of
this chapter convince some but not all.
13.4. THE ADDED MASS MATRIX OF A BODY                                      507

bit strange and again this point is not conclusive. It seems that it like turbulence,
and viscosity should not be accepted to be part the added mass topic. If accepting
the Reynolds number effect, it means that the added mass depends somehow on the
Reynolds number among other parameters in situations like Stokes flow. Thus, the
reading the "fine print" is important. That is, at what ranges and other limiting factors,
it is applicable (is viscosity and other effects are really segregated).

13.4 The Added Mass Matrix of a Body

The velocity potential of inviscid flow is defined in (Bar-Meir 2021a) as

                                                                           (13.1)
Ux = x   Uy = y                        Uz = z

Note, the velocity due to the rotation is not defined in this book. The elliptic character
(linearity) of the ideal flow (Bar-Meir 2021a) allows combination of different potentials
due to different velocity which can be combined as

          = x + y + z                                                      (13.2)

where  is the potential function and the subscript i = x, y, z is due to the velocity
in the i direction. Where the subscript i can be in any orthogonal coordinate system.
While this description is not fully used in this section, it gives a hint how the potential
function is used later. The added force is a single force that act on the body. In other
words added force like all the forces is a vector. When a vector (with 3 elements) is
divided by a vector (with 3 elements) then results is a matrix of 3  3 (see the two
vectors in Fig. 13.2). Thus dividing the force (a vector) by the velocity (a vector) create
similar situation to the stress matrix (created by division of the force by area which is
a vector also see Eq. (A.11)). The results are added mass coefficients which are not
the added masses6. The added mass is a scalar in the same way the body mass which
the reason it can be added to the body mass without any limitations. This added mass
can be assumed to be located at the body gravity centroid (at least is acting on the
action line of the gravity centroid). As opposed to the regular mass, the added mass
value is not a constant and it depends on the direction of the acceleration. Hence,
the added mass is not a vector in the regular meaning but a scalar with different value
which depends on the direction7. The added mass is based on the added force and if
the added force can be broken into three components, Fx, Fy, and Fz a new added
mass can be defined as

mi = Fi     i = x, y, z                                                    (13.3)
        ai

The added mass that the body experience in the direction x depends on g acceleration
and the total added force and cosine of the angle to x. This value is not added mass

coefficients which are different creatures. The discussion on the added mass coefficients
is provided in the appendix at the end of this chapter.

       It is common believe, the added moment of inertia in many publications in the
same vein as the added mass. The total added moment of inertia does exist, but
unfortunately the common believe defined it as a moment inertia that the body rotation
around the gravity centroid (well it would be true if the body indeed rotate around the
gravity centroid). If the ship or the marine body was rotating around the gravity centroid
it would be appropriate. However, as it was shown in this book, the floating body (ship)
does not rotate around the gravity centroid. Furthermore, the rotating axes do not pass
through the gravity centroid but depend on the geometry of the body location of the
liquid line. The governing equations are needed to be solved when analyzed the marine
body and have to use the actual added moment of inertia (or close to real value and
not something that is hundreds of percents off the mark like today it is done). As it
not enough, the axes for added moment of inertia have different origin. The ascertain
the actual moment of inertia for marine body, the parallel theorem for added properties
has to be used. This theorem is similar to the tensor parallel axis theorem which will
discussed in the appendix.

       It is the common believe that the added mass is a matrix of 6  6. The reason
the number is six because there is 6 different movements. Assuming that the argument
about the rotation potential is dismissed and the rotations are included. The elements of
the matrix is made of added mass coefficients not the added masses. The matrix is made
of the main diagonal (green color) which display the main added mass coefficients. The
regular (black color) are secondary added mass coefficients. The secondary coefficients
are the results of the division of the added mass by the velocity for example of x and
taking the component in y direction. The main added mass components refers to the
added mass created by dividing by x and the x element of that value. The values of
main added mass are always positive they are never zero (in the common believe). The
secondary values can be zero or a positive. Vininje (1989) claims to find negative values
yet it generally rejected by all others and this author has no opinion on this point either
way because it like twilight zone. In fact, it is very common to have zero for secondary
added masses (on the non main part). Under the common believe is that, the secondary
added mass appears when only when there is velocity the secondary direction. None
seem to explain why this happen based any physical principle. No explanation, on how
this added property can happen or even possible, was found in the literature. According
13.4. THE ADDED MASS MATRIX OF A BODY                                509

to the common believe the matrix looks like is

It can be noticed that some elements of the matrix have two kind units (actually three),

mass and moment of inertia. According to the common believe this matrix is always

symmetrical that is, for example, m32 = m23. The appendix of this chapter offers a
discussion when the conditions for this symmetry really happen8. This kind of writing

allows to present the compact writing which supposed to reduce the clutter. It is

interesting to point out that people holding the common believe put large efforts to

prove this idea.

According to the common method, the secondary added mass coefficients appear

only when the secondary velocity appears. The real reason "secondary added mass"

appears completely different from the reason that common believe adapted. The rea-

son stems from the fact that the body has truly only one added mass (It is amazing

that no one has noticed this basic fundamental fact.). To make things easy for calcula-

tions, people attribute the added mass to different velocity components. This process

attribution is what create that added mass coefficients. It is the reverse is only the

convenience that people are using to describe added mass in the velocity coordinate.

actually has only a single velocity (strange

that it has to be pointed out but trees are

missed because the forest.). These claims                         x

that body has secondary added mass (such U
as m12) are simply wrong and they are not

property of the body in the same sense as

the common believe of this ideology. The             y

added mass of a body is actually a sin-

gle component as opposed to transfer prop-      Fig. 13.2 - Ship in two dimensional gen-
erty that will be discussed later. To un-            eral coordinate.
derstand it, consider a body that moves

in the general direction U. The floating body is accelerating in the arbitrary direction

with the velocity U. At that direction the body has only added mass mU and body

does not have any secondary added mass. This claim can easily verified by the fact

that the added force is only a single component at the direction of the acceleration.

The common believe internal conflict is exposed because there are no other velocity

components and yet common believe claims that they exist. The body is only affected

8This common believe is just like CNN or NBC or BBC never know when they are telling the true.
510            CHAPTER 13. ADDED MASS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES

in the direction of the acceleration. According to the common believe, in the coordinate
system shown in the Fig. 13.2 the body has to have two components main and two
secondary added mass. Yet, the actual value of the added force is mU dU/dt. The
component of added force in the x is mU dU/dt cos  where  is the angle between
the velocity and x coordinate. In same time, the added force in the y direction is
mU dU/dt sin . Thus, the added mass in the x direction must be mU cos  and the
added mass in the y direction must be mU sin . The common approach has different
values for the added mass in x and y not to mention the secondary added mass. The
difference is results of the conflating added mass with added mass coefficients.

       For example, Brennen suggested (that appeared earlier) that somehow there is
added force perpendicular to the direction of boy acceleration is conflating two different
concepts and conflicts with the definition of the added mass9. One concept is dealing
with added mass and other concept deals with the transfer properties (related mostly
to velocity). The distinguishing can be done by checking if only the acceleration affects
the force or the velocity. In the case of asymmetrical body, the force appears even if
there is no acceleration, hence it is transfer properties.

     Example 13.1: Galina's First Question  Level: Intermediate

     Prof. Galina Yakovlevna Dynnikova expert on added mass suggested that sup-

     pose the body that moves a long the path of U is asymmetrical than there must

     be a force in the direction perpendicular to the body's path. Hence there must

     be secondary added mass. Thus, this facts breaks the idea of uniqueness of

     the added mass on the direction of U. Explain why the researcher's idea is not

     breaking uniqueness of added mass.

     Solution

     If the body moves along a line (and either accelerates or not), then the body asymmetry
     might create a force. First case, the body is moving with a constant velocity then
     there is only force perpendicular to movement. Hence there is no work (work is force
     in the direction of the velocity). Hence change in the energy of the velocity field is
     zero. If there is no acceleration, there is no work and again no added force and hence
     no added mass. Second case, the acceleration in the direction of body does no affect
     the force in perpendicular direction and hence no added force and therefore no added
     mass.

       What cause these added masses in the different direction?10 All the explanations
that appear in the literature do not make sense or were clear to this author. For example,
in MIT class 2.016 Hydrodynamics it is stated that

       A good way to think of the added mass components, mij, is to think of
       each term as mass associated with a force on the body in the ith direction
       due to a unit acceleration in the jth direction.

    9Added mass is results of the acceleration.
   10This was explained before it was a rehash. It seems to a necessity because the previous explanation

was not digested well with some individuals.
13.4. THE ADDED MASS MATRIX OF A BODY                                              511

All the explanations must obey the physics laws or discuss the intuition and state that it
is intuition. It further has to be pointed that researchers who hold the common believe
that the secondary added mass appears only when the velocity in the secondary direction
appears. In reality, the body does not know about any coordinates system. People are
thinking about velocity components as different velocities in x or y etc which not make
it correct. The body moves only in one direction which is vectorially combination of
the components but it is only one direction. And in the acceleration direction, the
body only has one added mass, no other direction! The added mass can be broken into
components. However, in the human imagination and convenience, the factual added
mass can be broken into components for convenient of the calculations. The reason that
added mass can be broken into component is because the added force can be broken
into components. The second mistake of this statement is that word "acceleration"
in the third line is not right and should be velocity. At this stage it is not clear if it
because conceptional misunderstanding or just typo or not paying attention to wording
(this author is famous for doing it all the time). Is there connection between the added
mass coefficients in different coordinates to arbitrary direction? Or in other words, can
added properties coefficients utilized to build the added mass? The answer is yes.

Solution

The added mass coefficients is given two dimension matrix as

                                            

          M =   b2                          0                        (13.2.a)

It can be noticed that the main terms are similar cylinder as "seen" by the flow.
The secondary terms are zero because symmetry. The acceleration in the prime co-
ordinate is dU/dt cos  in the x direction and the y (note the negative direction)

                       F = dU/dt cos  x - dU/dt sin  y                  (13.2.b)

Writing it in a matrix form the added force in prime coordinate system is then

                                                             

                       F = -  dU b2           0    cos                 (13.2.c)

         M =    b2 cos2  + a2 sin2 
                         - a2 - b2 cos  sin 

The added force is then                                                 (13.2.f )

      F =    b2 cos2  + a2 sin2 
                     - a2 - b2 cos  sin 

or in simple terms as

                                                           

                       F =   dU -b2 cos2  + a2 sin2                     (13.2.g)
                                  dt a2 - b2 cos  sin 

The equation Eq. (13.2.g) shows the value of the added force and added mass will be
without the acceleration.

The added mass in a given orientation has value of 3.0 V0. At this stage the
units are ignored. Where V0 is the volume of the body. The body accelerates
in a two dimensional coordinate system with 30 degree to x coordinate. The

body does not experience any rotation. Calculate the added mass for the x

coordinate and added mass for the y coordinate. Explain if the normalization

process is required. Can the body has added mass that is 3 times the body

volume?

Solution

                                                                            End of Ex. 13.3
First, the added mass has to be transferred to x and y. In x the added mass is

                                                        (13.3.a)
        mx = ma cos  = 3.0 V0  3

                                             2

The transfer of the added mass to y is

        my = ma sin  = 3.0 V0  1                       (13.3.b)
                                           2

The discussion about the normalization refers to the formulation such that when
multiply by U0 the actual added mass is added. The added force is Fa = ma dU0/dt
and the added force in the x direction. The added force in the x direction is Fx =
cos  Fa or Fx = cos  ma dU0/dt. Thus, the added mass in the x direction should be
multiply by the actual velocity of the body.
The body can have a large added mass. For example, a thin body moving in the largest
cross section has added mass several time the volume (times the liquid density).

13.4.1 Added Moment of Inertia Coefficients

A slightly similar situation to this one in linear motion happens in the rotations. The
three rotations can be combined to form a single rotation if the rotations share common
origin. If the common origin does not exist than the rotations components cannot
be joined. Thus, only some circumstances rotations components can be combined.
As writing this section, there is no known method to make general solution for it11.
In the particular case where the rotation components have the same origin then the
components can be combined to create a new axis around in which actuality the body
is rotated. Then if the added moment of inertia known, it can be broken into specific
coordinate. The arguments used the linear motion can be used for added moment of
inertia as well.

After establishing the general principle concept for the linear and rotation added prop-
erties, at this stage the combination of two kinds is discussed. Two simple cases can
be provided a taste of the situation and they are presented here. The first case shown
in Fig. 13.4a and second case shown in Fig. 13.4b. In both cases, the body move in

has no a solution, no one has.
514  CHAPTER 13. ADDED MASS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES

the x coordinate direction. However, the first case the body is rotating around the x
coordinate and the second case the body is rotating around the y coordinate. In the
first case the rotation does not change added mass nor it change the added moment of
inertia of the body (this observation conflicts with the common believe ideology).12 The
reason for this "oblivion" behavior is that the fluid sees the same kind of body during
the trajectory (direction). Along the path fluid, the body rotation does not change the
added moment of inertia. It can be verified by tying to calculated the moment of inertia
at any in body projection. For a body with a constant velocity in x direction and a
rotation around x, according to the definitions in this book (dU/dt = 0), will experience
no added force and therefor no added mass in the direction of the movement. That
is, the acceleration does not change the effect of rotation on the added mass in the x
direction. For the second case, fluid sees a different body during the trajectory. The
added moment of inertia does not change during that process because the rotation will
cause the same energy change in fluid field. The change in the added mass in this case
if some kind periodic value (sinusoidal). As side note, it can be noticed that the cylinder
causes added mass in all directions while moment of inertia in the special direction has
a zero value.

13.5 Calculations of the Added Mass

There are several techniques used to evaluate the added masses and the added moment
of inertia. The first technique is done by representing the body by potential flow
elements. The word represents in this context means body that normal (perpendicular)
velocity at the body border is zero relative to the body. Thus, the elements create a body
with zero velocity at the surface (or in case of porous media some kind condition specific
to boundary). Later, the potential flow elements are used, in various techniques, to
evaluate the force and hence obtaining the added mass value. There those who conflate
viscosity or viscous effects with added mass. Added mass is not result of viscosity.
This process is very delicate and requires understanding the even and odd functions
as a prerequisite (most of the time). This technique is out scope for introductory
book13. The other method is numerical calculations by solving the Euler equation (This
statement is disputed by some who believe in turbulence is of added mass. In this book
definition turbulence is not part of the definition of added mass). There are two ways
(actually more) to do it, one by looking at the forces forces and two by looking at energy
considerations.

       The acceleration is related to the kinetic energy. Furthermore, a change in the
kinetic energy of the field requires power supply to be delivered to the body to make
the change.

   12This author did found any explanation to this conflict. The rotation does not change the energy
field of the fluid and has no change in the added mass according to the definition in this book.

   13The undersign spend a semester to study this material and another semester as a teaching assis-
tance. Even with this experience, it is considered to be difficult topic.
13.5. CALCULATIONS OF THE ADDED MASS                                    515

The kinetic energy in the field is

                         (u1)2 + (u2)2 + (u3)2 dV                       (13.5)
    E=
                      V
           2

where here E denotes the energy of the entire field and u1 is the locale velocity in let
say x the same for the other components (u2 velocity in y and u3 velocity in z or any
other orthogonal coordinate system). Note, this statement is correct for any orthogonal

system. The velocity of the body is denoted as U0 and can be pulled out the integral
as

E=   (U0)2                u1 2         +   u2 2  +   u3 2         dV    (13.6)

    2              V      U0               U0        U0

This operation is carried out to relate velocity field and the body velocity. This operation
has the advantage of solving only for a body with one unit of velocity. Now, there is
no need to solve the equation for all velocities. The integral can be written as

    M=                u1 2          +  u2 2  +   u3 2         dV        (13.7)

                V     U0               U0        U0

The value of the integral Eq. (13.7) is independent of body velocity and every geometry
and ordination can be evaluated. The kinetic energy of the fluid field is

                                 U02                                    (13.8)
                          E= 2 M

The derivative with respect to time of M (or in other words, the added mass is fixed)
is zero. The derivative of Eq. (13.8) utilizing the chain role yields

                      d E =  U0 M dU0                                   (13.9)

Yet, the power need to supply the field to carry this change has to be

                          power = F U0                                  (13.10)

The energy conservation requires that power supplied have to be equal to the change
of the kinetic energy of the field where here, F is the force and U is the velocity, hence

                          dE                    dU                      (13.11)
                   F U0 = dt =  U0 M dt

Canceling the velocity on both sides of Eq. (13.11) Provides

                                      dU                                (13.12)
                          F =  M dt
516  CHAPTER 13. ADDED MASS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES

Eq. (13.12) can get the standard form F = m a when  M is denoted the added mass.
This added mass is not actual liquid mass but rather a representation of equivalent mass
if it would be accelerated with the body. A entire fluid field is accelerated but not in
the same neither uniform amount of amount. So, instead of doing the calculations for
the entire field it is done for a simpler representation is utilized.

       The simple case to calculate is a two dimensional cylinder with radius, R. In this
case the radial velocity is given Eq. (12.166) and it is copied into here as

                             Ur = U0 cos        a2            (13.13)
                                           1 - r2

The tangential velocity is Eq. (12.167)

                             U = U0 sin         a2            (13.14)
                                           1 + r2

       Eq. (13.7) is independent of the coordinate system, so a cylinder coordinate
system is used and Ur and U can be used instead the regular Cartesian coordinate that
was used in the definition. Thus the added mass is

                    2                U 2 + Ur r d dr =  R2 2  (13.15)
                                     U0    U0
     M=

                 R0

       The added mass of cylinder is exactly the same of the volume as it displaced
multiply the density of liquid (as oppose to the density of the cylinder). Thus, when light
cylinder is moving in a heavy flow, the resistance will be mostly due to the acceleration
of liquid.

       For sphere the potential is given by spherical coordinates

                                                      R3      (13.16)
                              = U0 cos  r + 2 r2

The radial velocity is then

                                                       R3     (13.17)
                             Ur = U0 cos  1 - r3

while the tangential velocity () is

                                                         R3   (13.18)
                             U = -U0 sin  1 + 2 r3

     Subtitling Eq. (13.17) and Eq. (13.18) into the definition Eq. (13.15) yield

                                     M = 2  R3                (13.19)
                                             3

which is half of the volume of the sphere. Thus, the added mass is a strong function
of the geometry and not affected by the body's velocity (it was eliminated). Yet, one
13.5. CALCULATIONS OF THE ADDED MASS                                                     517

can see some logic (intuition) in this value. The body continuously penetrates two
dimensional surfaces. The cylinder cut the surface with infinite length in one direction
while the sphere cut in only in a finite length. While this explanation is not scientific,
it does provide some hints to the expecting value.

       Suppose that body A and body B are connected by a thin rode the added masses
of the bodies can be summed up (because the linearity of the problem). This idea is
not totally accepted by all researchers. Yet, there is interest in bodies that are long
slender which lead to slender body theory of integration of infinity thin slices (think
long submarine for example, even ships). These coefficients (properties) are depend on
the orientation of the body. Hence, they are function of all the angles (all the three
angles). The observed current research work this days (as 2020) still assumes that the
added masses are constant (for the moving coordinate). Hence, all these research works
should be considered a progress point at best at this stage.

       The term added mass has been misused by many and in following examples of
such cases will be discussed.

Example 13.4: Poking Styrofoam                  Level: Advance

The following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5ihS9QFAP0
shows a person explaining or demonstrating the added mass concept. He was
attempting to poke hole in a small square floating on the water. The small
square was pushed into and no hole in square could be made. On the other
hand, when experiment is done with the bigger square and the researcher is suc-
cessful to poke a hole. The researcher claims that the reason for the different
result is the added mass. Is the researcher is right? Explain.

Solution

The forces that act on the styrofoam are buoyancy, gravity in the opposite direction,
and the force that apply to poke the hole, Fpoke. Taking downward as a positive
direction provides

          gravity                     buoyancy  (13.4.a)
           force                        force

          F = Fpoke + mstyrofoam g -A x 

The right trick is to recognize that at equilibrium the gravity (force) is equals to
buoyancy (force). Thus, the focus has to be on the deviation from equilibrium.

                            buoyancy            (13.4.b)
                               force

          F = Fpoke + -A x 

In Eq. (13.4.b) the buoyancy refers to the change from equilibrium and it is not same
as in Eq. (13.4.a). Locking the equation Eq. (13.4.b) it is recognized that Fpoke about
same in both cases. The only thing that is different is the area of styrofoam, A. Since
styrofoam depth is limited amount of ()x as long as area A is large enough the
poking makes a hole. Thus, in this analysis no added mass present because there is

                                                                                 End of Ex. 13.4
     no movement and the claim of the scientist wrong and it is not issue of added mass.

     The depth of the styrofoam is pushed into liquid is

                                   d = Fpoke                                       (13.4.c)
                                         A

     Where Fpoke is the force required to poke a hole in that specific styrofoam.

       Example 13.5: Obtaining Energy from Truck Level: Intermediate
     A truck is driven on highway. If you want to reduce your energy consumption
     what you will do. What kind of action you should take? Go behind the truck?
     get away from the truck? Move in-front of the truck? Is this operation is
     related to added mass phenomenon?

     Solution

     This question has a practical application if you drive on large distance. The truck
     accelerates the air around it and the air has a velocity and acceleration in the direction
     of the truck. This velocity field is stronger as closer you get to the truck. (assume
     safety is not an issue). The field at the back of the truck is larger and hence more
     accessible. From the discussion about it is related to added mass.

13.6 Transfer Mechanisms and Transfer Properties

13.6.1 History of Transfer Properties

The basic common theory for this "transfer" effect is that a wave moves along the ship
change GM during the time ship passes the wave. This idea as far it can be judged was
suggested by France and Shin (France, Levadou, Treakle, Paulling, Michel, and Moore
2003; Shin, Belenky, Paulling, Weems, and Lin 2004).The ship, according to this theory,
has to be exposed to a waves with a frequency of twice the natural ship frequency (van
Laarhoven 2009) which is defined as

                                    =   g V0 GM                                    (13.20)
                                       Ixx + Madd

where  is the natural frequency and Madd is the added mass of the ship14 and the
other properties are regular terms used in the book This equation can be recognized
as the regular term from a simple pendulum. In addition, the wave length has to be
at certain conditions (while they are not specified). In the said paper, it seem from
the equation has a simple units mistake and the added mass should be replaced by the
added moment of inertia (logically and dimensionally). (to be added as example to
the dimensional analysis chapter) It is not clear from the model what causes the rolling
beside that the rolling is possible (if the natural frequency was correct). This model

14Should be moment of the inertia
13.6. TRANSFER MECHANISMS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES  519

disregards the ship shape, shifting rotation point, and other important characteristics.
There are several problems with the assumptions that this model build on and they will
be discussed later.

       When engineers do not understand a certain topic, a committee (unknown 2008;
Krata and Wawrzyn큦ki 2016) issue recommendation with total disregard to the common
believe physics and realizing that something is going on (It is nice that someone notice
it). For example, IMO issue in 2008 equation for estimate the frequency (time of the
period)15 as

It is interesting in this equation that equation (committee) recognized that the com-
partmental approach is erroneous. Yet, the physical sources of the energy transfer from
one dimension to another approach (or to multi-dimensional movements) are unknown.
Clearly this equation is only valid only in special cases at this stage the equation to be
considered unknown.17

13.6.2 Introduction

In general the resistance to movement has three different components, the body mass,
added mass, and the transfer properties. In physics the first part is studied and is the
fundamental of many branches of physics. The second part is presented in graduate
class or by used by researchers mostly dealing the interaction of liquid-solid. The third
part was discovered by the undersign and probably will be study by researchers and later
move to graduate students. This idea is novel for which only minimum reviews have
been done. The added mass/added moment of inertia are results of the movement
uniform medium or at least continuous. Namely when the density on body surfaces
might be different values but they are continuous (for example compressible flow). What
happen when the media is not continuous either because it contains two or more phases.
Furthermore, when the body moves through a shock or other discontinuities (large wave)
there additional resistance (actually transfer of energy). These "resistances" occur only
because the sharp change of the density.

   15One can only wonder why the 2 is not swallowed into coefficient c.
   16The author would recommend that these kind of equations should be in dimensional analysis
section. Keep in mind when the various coefficients given their dimensions also should be provided.
   17This author speculated that about the affecting parameters. Yet, it will appear in later version.
520  CHAPTER 13. ADDED MASS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES

       The transfer properties are different than the added mass in several aspects. The
transfer components property of the body and possibly appear only when there is a
sharp change in liquid density for the rotation and the body is asymmetrical for linear
movements. The transfer properties can be represented by a matrix of 6  618. Notice
that the issue of units, not all the elements have the same units. The transfer properties
located on main diagonal are zero. The transfer properties are not resistance to the body
movement but rather acting as to transfer energy (hence the name transfer properties)
from one mode to another19. The transfer properties are mostly related to the velocity
and not the acceleration.

The transfer mechanism depends on the transfer properties. The transfer properties can
be calculated for every geometrical shape and orientation20. The cause of the transfer
is the change in location of the buoyancy centroid (for the rotation motions)21. The
only body shape that does not transfer from one mode to another is sphere. There
is source of waves or other exciting forces/moments (beside the magnetic forces) that
can cause transfer. Thus, the transfer of the motion from one mode to another is
because symmetry (or asymmetry or lack of symmetry) of the body. Here, the transfer
mechanisms are divided into two categories: one, from rotation in one direction to
rotation in another direction, and two from rotation to linear motion (vis versa). The
transfer from a linear motion to a linear motion is considered as the second category22.

       To understand this transfer consider the T-shape body depicted in Fig. 13.6.
The extend part of the body is just touching the liquid. In this case, the regular marine
coordinate system is adapted for this discussion (if cannot avoided). If the body is
rotating around the x coordinate (roll or around another parallel line), the buoyancy
centroid changes the location when the body rotated. The change in buoyancy centroid

   18There might be better representations. This undersign cowardly admits temporary defeat in this
case.

   19This statement is not entirely correct. It should be mentioned that part of the transfer has
"efficiency" issues and not all the energy is transferred.

   20The textbook was not intended to be a research paper. Yet, because lack of information, the book
has sections which look like a research paper.

   21The movements inside the body caused by roll (for example) can also cause transfer energy like
moving bodies or transfer of liquids.

   22In discussion with one of the reader has pointed out that in the future rotation to linear will be
considered the third category. Time will tell.
13.6. TRANSFER MECHANISMS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES          521

move has a component in the x direction. Yet, in this case, as opposed to the extruded

body, the buoyancy centroid moves to a new location with in a different plane of the

original z-y plane. In other words, the buoyancy centroid, B has two components one in

y direction (as before) and new one in the x. Assuming that the body was at equilibrium,

these changes in B centroid location creates a moment in the y axis (pitch) and also

around z (yew). This T-shape effects are created by added submerged volume, however

similar effects can be created by removing part of the submerged body. The meaning

of removing body is that a body when rotated exhibits a depression. Generally, if the

body is not symmetrical round y any rotation around the x coordinate creates rotation

y coordinate and z coordinate. The gravity centroid remains the same location on the

body. Thus, there is a new moment that acting the new direction. The described effect

is of roll causing pitch (and yaw). Yet, the same argument can describe pitch movement

causing roll. In this discussion, the source of the rotation is irrelevant. Another source

the rotation transfer is asymmetry in the movement or the orientation but this topic is

to advance and is not discussed in this version.

The previous discussion dealt with the transfer from one rotation to another

rotation due to the floating body asymmetry (in previous case the asymmetry was around

the yz plane). It can be expended to move-

ment of linear like heave to rotation. The

main difference in this category is that the

moment transferred into force. It must            y     G
be mentioned that the energy during the
transfer is constant (if no losses occurs)           x

and the transfer reduces the oscillations or            B

the movement because the energy is trans-

ferred. Additionally, the transfer does not

occur linearly and it depend on the change        Fig. 13.7 - Extruded triangle to explain
of the buoyancy centroid. The forces in                the movement transfer from Heave to

each other and hence cancel each other.

However, the forces in the y direction are not equal and cause a moment which will

result in the rolling rotation. That is, in this case the asymmetry in around y coordinate

transfers energy from the heave to roll. If the floating body is not perfect symmetry

it also might create a movement in other directions. Note that if the body was made

from straight lines going down, it will not have any effect on the other linear direction

motion.

The conceptional explanation has to get engineering expression. First, the trans-

fer from roll to pitch requires to knowledge the change in B due to the roll. The

calculation of the change in the x direction is done in a similar fashion to the change

buoyancy centroid was ascertained for symmetrical body. These calculations are 3-D

nature at least for the presentation. As this book (at least this version) is pioneer this

aspect and the technique presented here to calculate is crude. Not to be bogged with

the mathematics the functionally assumed to be known. Consider the body shown in

Fig. 13.6. First, the change in the z - y plane of buoyancy is considered. The body
522            CHAPTER 13. ADDED MASS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES

is divided into many small slices of with thickness of dx. For each slice the change in
buoyancy and it is denoted as dB. This value is a function of x and same time the area
can be calculated it denoted as A(x) (in mathematical term it referred as the weight
function). The change in the y direction is

                              1                                                   (13.23)
               B()x = V0 V0 B(x)A(x)dx

The change in the y direction is

                              1                                                   (13.24)
               B()y = V0 V0 y A(x)at new dx

It can be noticed that change in the x is not relevant to the y direction.

     Solution

13.6.3 Transfer Linear Motion to Rotating Motion

The transfer mechanism from a linear motion to a rotational motion can be demon-

strated by examining two motions In this discussion the most common motions are

presented which are heave (lin-

ear) and roll (rotational). For

simplicity it is assumed that liq-

uid level flat. The body trans-

lates to a lower point in the liq-

uid as shown in Fig. 13.8. The

rotation point changes when

the body move up or down.           D  G

important because it dictates

the moment of inertia of the body (ship). Yet, as a first approximation, the rotation is

assumed to be at the same center line as before but at the new liquid surface in the

middle of the surface (moving from A - A which is exact description for extruded

bodies, but more complicated for other bodies.). In this case, the governing equation

of movement is must include the variation of the moment of inertia due to height

change.
13.6. TRANSFER MECHANISMS AND TRANSFER PROPERTIES      523

       The rotation location change with the y coordinate is discussed below. First
effect of the change is the change in the body moment of inertia. Second effect is more
important which is the stability changes and the body could cross the stability line on
the stability dome. For the case of s/ < 0.5, when the body moves down it could
enter inside the unstable zone. The reason for it that body effectively increases the ratio
of the density. On the opposite case when s/ > 0.5 when the body moves up it enter
the inside the unstable zone. That is the body effectively decrease the density ratio.
Hence, this mechanism in which the linear motion is transfer to rotation (rolling). The
transfer mechanism is clear but at this point the transfer property is not well defined.
It can be noticed that no acceleration is required for this energy transfer.

       The previous discussion dealt with the effect of the transfer from a linear motion
to a rotation motion. The

       When the body is turning the resistance (damping forces) is changing according
the angle. In addition the added mass of the floating body changes. One of the reason
for this change asymmetrical resistance on both side of the body. For example, consider
the T shape body that discussed before when it makes rolling rotation. Beside the effect
of the rolling on the pitch and the yaw that creates also heave. The heave is created
because one side is liquid (water) and has larger resistance as compared to the other
side. The results of this resistance to lift the ship. On the other part of cycle it has the
opposite effect.

13.6.4 The Parallel Axes Theorem for Added Mass

Meta

       The change of the rotation origin affects only the added moment of inertia.
       The added moment of the floating body sometime give or calculated for specific
       location. However, the rotation can move from one location to another. One of
       the problems facing the individuals who calculating the floating body movement
       is the change of added moment of inertia from one axis to another. The floating
       body rotation axis can be significant. The reason to the change of the location
       can be different load of the ship for which the rotation point is at the liquid plane
       or other reasons.

In regular body, it was shown in ?? on page ?? that it can used by a simple
equation to transfer the property. The regular transfer of properties cannot be
used here because the fluid does not have the rigid connection that were required
from the solid body. The question, before lunching into calculating the moment
of from scratch, can the old calculations be used.

The energy created by the body around the new axis is

13.6.5 Experimental Observation

People have to find value of the added properties from experiential work. For example,
(Aso, Kan, Doki, and Mori 1991; Brennen 1982; Molin, Remy, and Rippol 2007) have
attempted to separate the various components like the fluid drags and Reynolds number
effects. Notice that added mass should not be affected by the Reynolds number. There
uniform method to carry these experiments and evaluated the values. This especially

This integral suggests that the closer the boundary is to the body the larger is the added
mass. Furthermore, it suggests that once the boundary contributions is determined
then it can be used for other bodies. Yet, this conclusion is not widely accepted and
controversial.

       Anther point that it is controversial but should be mentioned is the combined
potential

         = U0x 1 + U0y 2 + U0z 3 + 0x 4 + 0y 5 + 0z 6                   (13.34)

There are some limitations that statement like the origin of the rotation have to same
etc. Nevertheless,if that is accepted then it can be substitute into Eq. (13.33) so that
it provide 36 terms which looks like

                                mij = i j dA                            (13.35)

As the total energy change based on added properties is then

       Compering the energy of the terms opposite of the diagonal the mij mji is done
by subtracting one from each other to see it they are the same value. Notice that energy
was evaluated to according to Eq. (13.32) as a surface integral. Thus,

        i j dA - j i dA =                     i j - j i dA         (13.37)

The tricky part is to recognize that according to the identity Eq. (13.29) which is true
if only when the boundary around body is at infinity. That is,

        i j - j i dA =                        j i - i j dV         (13.39)

In a marine situation the liquid domain is made of liquid and gas (air), hence ,the sharp
change in density does not seem to create a problem. That is, the boundary conditions
required for Eq. (13.29) is required to be at infinity. The potential functions that used
are not continuous and there is a problem. It seem that requirement that the boundary
should be at infinity not satisfied therefor mij = mji. The conditions for mij = mji
are such boundary has to be at infinity. Hence the symmetry of the added mass seems
to be lacking.

second rotation is clockwise. In most
situations this change does mater be-
cause symmetry. For example, when ex-
truded square is rotating around it cen-
ter it does not matter the direction of
the rotation. The question is about a

the direction should matter shown in

   Solution

The answer to the question lay in the recognition what actually cause the added mass
or the moment of inertia. The derivation about sum it in the concept that as long all
the velocity components and rotation have the same origin as in this case the direction
of the rotation is insignificant to the direction of the rotation. In any direction of the
rotation the velocities on the surface will be same.

 14 Compressible Flow One Dimensional

14.1 What is Compressible Flow?

This Chapter deals with an introduction to the flow of compressible substances (gases).
The main difference between compressible flow and "almost" incompressible flow is not
the fact that compressibility has to be considered. Rather, the difference is in two
phenomena that do not exist in incompressible flow. The first phenomenon is the very
sharp discontinuity (jump) in the flow in properties. The second phenomenon is the
choking of the flow. Choking is referred to the situation where downstream conditions,
which are beyond a critical value(s), doesn't affect the flow.

       The shock wave and choking are not intuitive for most people. However, one
has to realize that intuition is really a condition where one uses his past experiences
to predict other situations. Here one has to build his intuition tool for future use.
Thus, not only engineers but other disciplines will be able use this "intuition" in design,
understanding and even research.

14.2 Why Compressible Flow is Important?

Compressible flow appears in many natural and many technological processes. Com-
pressible flow deals, including many different material such as natural gas, nitrogen and
helium, etc not such only air. For instance, the flow of natural gas in a pipe system,
a common method of heating in the U.S., should be considered a compressible flow.
These processes include flow of gas in the exhaust system of an internal combustion
engine. The above flows that were mentioned are called internal flows. Compressible
flow also includes flow around bodies such as the wings of an airplane, and is categorized

                                                    533
534  CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

as external flow.
       These processes include situations not expected to have a compressible flow, such

as manufacturing process such as the die casting, injection molding. The die casting
process is a process in which liquid metal, mostly aluminum, is injected into a mold
to obtain a near final shape. The air is displaced by the liquid metal in a very rapid
manner, in a matter of milliseconds, therefore the compressibility has to be taken into
account.

       Clearly, mechanical or aero engineers are not the only ones who have to deal with
some aspects of compressible flow. Even manufacturing engineers have to deal with
many situations where the compressibility or compressible flow understating is essen-
tial for adequate design. Another example, control engineers who are using pneumatic
systems must consider compressible flow aspects of the substances used. The com-
pressible flow unique phenomena also appear in zoology (bird fly), geological systems,
biological system (human body) etc. These systems require consideration of the unique
phenomena of compressible flow.

       In this Chapter, a greater emphasis is on the internal flow while the external flow
is treated to some extend in the next Chapter. It is recognized that the basic fluid
mechanics class has a limited time devoted to these topics. Additional information
(such as historical background) can be found in "Fundamentals of Compressible Flow"

14.3.1 Introduction

People had recognized for several hundred                             dU C.V. c-dU c

travel in a "quiet" medium? This velocity
is referred to as the speed of sound and is

discussed first.

       To answer this question consider a       Fig. 14.2 - Stationary sound wave and
piston moving from the left to the right at          gas moves relative to the pulse.

a relatively small velocity (see Figure 14.1).

The information that the piston is moving passes thorough a single "pressure pulse."

It is assumed that if the velocity of the piston is infinitesimally small, the pulse will be

infinitesimally small. Thus, the pressure and density can be assumed to be continuous.

In the control volume it is convenient to look at a control volume which is attached to

a pressure pulse (see Figure 14.2). Applying the mass balance yields

                       c = ( + d) (c - dU )                           (14.1)

or when the higher term dU d is neglected yields                      (14.2)
                                                                  cd

Substituting the expression for dU from equation (14.2) into equation (14.4) yields

An expression is needed to represent the right hand side of equation (14.5). For an ideal
gas, P is a function of two independent variables. Here, it is considered that P = P (, s)
where s is the entropy. The full differential of the pressure can be expressed as follows:

                      dP =           P   d +    P   ds                (14.6)

In the derivations for the speed of sound it was assumed that the flow is isentropic,
therefore it can be written

                             P P                                                   (14.7)

       Note that the equation (14.5) can be obtained by utilizing the momentum equa-
tion instead of the energy equation.

     Example 14.1: From Momentum                            Level: Intermediate

     Demonstrate that equation (14.5) can be derived from the momentum equation.

     Solution

     The momentum equation written for the control volume shown in Figure 14.2 is

                          F cs U ( U dA)                             (14.1.a)

           (P + dP ) - P = ( + d)(c - dU )2 -  c2

     Neglecting all the relative small terms results in     - c2

                  dP = ( + d) c -$2 c dU +$ dU

     And finally it becomes

                             dP = c2 d                               (14.1.c)

     This yields the same equation as (14.5).

14.3.2 Speed of Sound in Ideal and Perfect Gases

The speed of sound can be obtained easily for the equation of state for an ideal gas (also
perfect gas as a sub set) because of a simple mathematical expression. The pressure
for an ideal gas can be expressed as a simple function of density, , and a function
"molecular structure" or ratio of specific heats, k namely

                             P = constant  k                                      (14.8)

and hence

                                                                  P

           c = P = k  constant  k-1 = k  constant  k                           (14.9)

Remember that P/ is defined for an ideal gas as RT , and equation (14.9) can be

written as

                         Ideal Gas Speed Sound                                 (14.10)

The solution can be estimated by using the data from steam tablea

At 20[bar] and 350C: s = 6.9563 kJ K kg  = 6.61376 m3 kg
At 18[bar] and 350C: s = 7.0100 kJ K kg  = 6.46956 m3 kg
At 18[bar] and 300C: s = 6.8226 kJ K kg  = 7.13216 m3 kg

After interpretation of the temperature:
At 18[bar] and 335.7C: s  6.9563 kJ K kg   6.94199 m3 kg
and substituting into the equation yields

14.3.3 Speed of Sound in Almost Incompressible Liquid

Every liquid in reality has a small and important compressible aspect. The ratio of the
change in the fractional volume to pressure or compression is referred to as the bulk
538  CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

modulus of the material. For example, the average bulk modulus for water is 2.2  109
N/m2. At a depth of about 4,000 meters, the pressure is about 4  107 N/m2. The
fractional volume change is only about 1.8% even under this pressure nevertheless it is
a change.

       The compressibility of the substance is the reciprocal of the bulk modulus. The
amount of compression of almost all liquids is seen to be very small as given in the Book
"Fundamentals of Compressible Flow." The mathematical definition of bulk modulus
as following

                         P                  (14.11)
               BT =  

     In physical terms can be written as

            Liquid/Solid Sound Speed

         c = elastic property = BT          (14.12)
            inertial property             

For example for water

                                         2.2  109N/m2
                                c = 1000kg/m3 = 1493m/s

       This value agrees well with the measured speed of sound in water, 1482 m/s
at 20C. A list with various typical velocities for different liquids can be found in
"Fundamentals of Compressible Flow" by this author. The interesting topic of sound
in variable compressible liquid also discussed in the above book. In summary, the speed
of sound in liquids is about 3 to 5 relative to the speed of sound in gases.

14.3.4 Speed of Sound in Solids

The situation with solids is considerably more complicated, with different speeds in
different directions, in different kinds of geometries, and differences between transverse
and longitudinal waves. Nevertheless, the speed of sound in solids is larger than in
liquids and definitely larger than in gases.

       Young's Modulus for a representative value for the bulk modulus for steel is 160
109 N /m2. A list of materials with their typical velocity can be found in the above
book.

       Speed of sound in solid of steel, using a general tabulated value for the bulk
modulus, gives a sound speed for structural steel of

         E     160  109N/m2
     c=     =  7860Kg/m3 = 4512m/s

         initial point the object. The finial point is marked by red circled with gray filled. Notice
         that the circle line thickness is increase with the time i.e the more green wider circle line
         thickness. The transition from the blue fresher lines to the green older lines is properly
         marked.

Compared to one tabulated value the example values for stainless steel lays between the
speed for longitudinal and transverse waves.

14.3.5 The Dimensional Effect of the Speed of Sound

What is the significance of the speed of sound? This speed of sound determines what
regime the flow will be. In Chapter 9 that Mach number was described as important
parameter. It will be shown later in this Chapter that when Mach number is around
0.25-0.3 a significant change occur in the situation of flow. To demonstrate this point,
consider a two dimensional situation where a particle is moving from the left to the right.
A particle movement creates a pressure change which travels toward outside in equal
speed relative to the particle. Figure 14.3 depicts an object with three different relative
velocities. Figure 14.3(a) demonstrates that the whole surroundings is influenced by
the object (depicted by red color). While Figure 14.3 (b) that there small zone a head
object that is "aware" if the object arriving. In Figure 14.3 (c) the zone that aware of
the object is practically zero.

       In fact, when the object velocity is about or larger than the speed of sound then
the object arrive to location where the fluid does not aware or informed about the
object. The reason that in gas the compressibility plays significant role is because the
ratio of the object or fluid velocity compared to speed of sound. In gases the speed of
sound is smaller as compare to liquid and defendtly to solid. Hence, gases are media
540  CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

where compressibility effect must be considered in relationship compressibility. There
are some how defined the Mach cone as the shape of object movement approaching to
one. This shape has angle and it related to Mach angle.

14.4 Isentropic Flow

In this section a discussion on a steady state flow through a smooth and without
an abrupt area change which include converging- diverging nozzle is presented. The
isentropic flow models are important because of two main reasons: One, it provides the
information about the trends and important parameters. Two, the correction factors
can be introduced later to account for deviations from the ideal state.

14.4.1 Stagnation State for Ideal Gas Model

It is assumed that the flow is quasi one-         A Aexit
dimensional (that is the fluid flows mainly
in one dimension). Figure (14.4) describes        PB = P0
a gas flow through a converging-diverging
nozzle. It has been found that a theoreti-    P
cal state known as the stagnation state is
very useful in simplifying the solution and   P0  Subsonic
treatment of the flow. The stagnation state
is a theoretical state in which the flow is       M<1
brought into a complete motionless con-
ditions in isentropic process without other                                                M > 1 Supersonic
forces (e.g. gravity force). Several proper-                                                       distance, x
ties that can be represented by this theo-
retical process which include temperature,          Fig. 14.4 - Flow of a compressible sub-
pressure, and density et cetera and denoted              stance (gas) through a converging-
by the subscript "0."                                    diverging nozzle.

       First, the stagnation temperature is   written as
calculated. The energy conservation can be

          U2                                               (14.13)
     h + 2 = h0

Perfect gas is an ideal gas with a constant heat capacity, Cp. For perfect gas equation
(14.13) is simplified into

               U2                                          (14.14)
     Cp T + 2 = Cp T0

T0 is denoted as the stagnation temperature. Recalling from thermodynamic the rela-
tionship for perfect gas R = Cp - Cv and denoting k  Cp  Cv then the thermody-
14.4. ISENTROPIC FLOW                                                             541

namics relationship obtains the form

                                               kR                            (14.15)
                                      Cp = k - 1

and where R is the specific constant. Dividing equation (14.14) by (CpT ) yields

                       1 + U 2 = T0                                          (14.16)
                            2 Cp T T

Now, substituting c2 = k R T or T = c2/k R equation (14.16) changes into

                                      k R U 2 T0                             (14.17)
                       1+             2=
                                      2 Cp c T

By utilizing the definition of k by equation (2.24) and inserting it into equation (14.17)
yields

                                      k - 1 U 2 T0                           (14.18)
                       1+             2=
                                      2c T

       It very useful to convert equation (14.17) into a dimensionless form and denote
Mach number as the ratio of velocity to speed of sound as

                       Mach Number Definition                                (14.19)
                                         U

                                 M
                                         c

Inserting the definition of Mach number (14.19) into equation (14.18) reads

Isentropic Temperature relationship

                       T0 = 1 + k - 1 M 2                                    (14.20)

The usefulness of Mach number and equation          T0                            T0
(14.20) can be demonstrated by the following
simple example. In this example a gas flows         P0  V elocity                 P0
through a tube (see Figure 14.5) of any shape       0                             0
can be expressed as a function of only the stag-
nation temperature as opposed to the function      Fig. 14.5 - Perfect gas flows
of the temperatures and velocities.                     through a tube.

       The definition of the stagnation state provides the advantage of compact writing.
For example, writing the energy equation for the tube shown in Figure 14.5 can be
reduced to

                       Q = Cp (T0B - T0A) m                                  (14.21)
542  CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

       The ratio of stagnation pressure to the static pressure can be expressed as the
function of the temperature ratio because of the isentropic relationship as

In the same manner the relationship for the density ratio is

New useful definitions are introduced for the case when M = 1 and denoted by su-

14.4.2 Isentropic Converging-Diverging Flow in Cross Section

The important sub case in this chapter is the

flow in a converging-diverging nozzle. The

control volume is shown in Figure (14.7).                                   A              P P+dP

mal model. Here only the first model will

be described. Clearly, the stagnation tem-

perature, T0, is constant through the adia-       Fig. 14.7 - Control volume inside a
batic flow because there isn't heat transfer.          converging-diverging nozzle.

Therefore, the stagnation pressure is also

constant through the flow because the flow isentropic. Conversely, in mathematical

terms, equation (14.20) and equation (14.22) are the same. If the right hand side

is constant for one variable, it is constant for the other. In the same vein, the

stagnation density is constant through the flow. Thus, knowing the Mach number or

the temperature will provide all that is needed to find the other properties. The only

properties that need to be connected are the cross section area and the Mach number.

Examination of the relation between properties can then be carried out.

14.4.3 The Properties in the Adiabatic Nozzle

Differentiation of continuity equation,  A U = m = constant, and dividing by the
continuity equation reads

The thermodynamic relationship between the properties can be expressed as

Differentiation of the equation state (perfect gas), P = RT , and dividing the results
by the equation of state ( R T ) yields

14.4. ISENTROPIC FLOW                   545

Equation (14.34) is a differential equation for the pressure as a function of the cross sec-
tion area. It is convenient to rearrange equation (14.34) to obtain a variables separation
form of

                                U 2 dA  (14.35)
                       dP = A 1 - M 2

14.4.3.1 The pressure Mach number relationship

Before going further in the mathematical derivations it is worth looking at the physical
meaning of equation (14.35). The term  U 2/A is always positive (because all the
three terms can be only positive). Now, it can be observed that dP can be positive or
negative depending on the dA and Mach number. The meaning of the sign change for
the pressure differential is that the pressure can increase or decrease. It can be observed
that the critical Mach number is one. If the Mach number is larger than one than dP
has opposite sign of dA. If Mach number is smaller than one dP and dA have the same
sign. For the subsonic branch M < 1 the term 1/(1 - M 2) is positive hence

                       dA > 0 = dP > 0
                       dA < 0 = dP < 0

From these observations the trends are similar to those in incompressible fluid. An
increase in area results in an increase of the static pressure (converting the dynamic
pressure to a static pressure). Conversely, if the area decreases (as a function of x)
the pressure decreases. Note that the pressure decrease is larger in compressible flow
compared to incompressible flow.

       For the supersonic branch M > 1, the phenomenon is different. For M > 1 the
term 1/1 - M 2 is negative and change the character of the equation.

                       dA > 0  dP < 0
                       dA < 0  dP > 0

This behavior is opposite to incompressible flow behavior.
       For the special case of M = 1 (sonic flow) the value of the term 1 - M 2 = 0

thus mathematically dP   or dA = 0. Since physically dP can increase only in a
finite amount it must that dA = 0. 1 It must also be noted that when M = 1 occurs
only when dA = 0. However, the opposite, not necessarily means that when dA = 0
that M = 1. In that case, it is possible that dM = 0 thus the diverging side is in the
subsonic branch and the flow isn't choked.

       The relationship between the velocity and the pressure can be observed from
equation (14.29) by solving it for dU .

                                  dP    (14.36)
                       dU = -

                                 PU

    1It possible to claim that dP   and dA = 0 but it doesn't change the fact the pressure increase
must be finite and the same conclusion is obtained.
546  CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

From equation (14.36) it is obvious that dU has an opposite sign to dP (since the term
P U is positive). Hence the pressure increases when the velocity decreases and vice
versa.

       From the speed of sound, one can observe that the density, , increases with
pressure and vice versa (see equation (14.37)).

                1                                                        (14.37)
        d = c2 dP

It can be noted that in the derivations of the above equations ((14.36) - (14.37)), the
equation of state was not used. Thus, the equations are applicable for any gas (perfect
or imperfect gas).

       The second law (isentropic relationship) dictates that ds = 0 and from thermo-
dynamics ds = 0 = Cp TdT - R dPP and for perfect gas

     dT k - 1 dP                                                         (14.38)
                                         =
     T                                      kP

Thus, the temperature varies in the same way that pressure does.
       The relationship between the Mach number and the temperature can be obtained

by utilizing the fact that the process is assumed to be adiabatic dT0 = 0. Differentia-
tion of equation (14.20), the relationship between the temperature and the stagnation
temperature becomes

     dT0 = 0 = dT 1 + k - 1 M 2 + T (k - 1)M dM                          (14.39)
                                  2

and simplifying equation (14.39) yields

     dT (k - 1) M dM                                                     (14.40)

14.4.3.2 Relationship Between the Mach Number and Cross Section Area

The equations used in the solution are energy (14.40), second law (14.38), state (14.30),
mass (14.27)2. Note, equation (14.34) isn't the solution but demonstration of certain
properties of the pressure profile.

       The relationship between temperature and the cross section area can be obtained
by utilizing the relationship between the pressure and temperature (14.38) and the
relationship of pressure with cross section area (14.34). First stage equation (14.40) is
combined with equation (14.38) and becomes

     (k - 1) dP (k - 1) M dM                                             (14.41)

Combining equation (14.41) with equation (14.34) yields                                  (14.42)

                                 U 2 dA                                                  (14.43)

The following identify,  U 2 = k M P can be proved as

Using the identity in equation (14.43) changes equation (14.42) into

                                              2

Equation (14.44) is very important because

it relates the geometry (area) with the rel-

(14.44), the factors M 1 + k-2 1 M 2 and ative velocity (Mach number). In equation A
A are positive regardless of the values of

M or A. Therefore, the only factor that

affects relationship between the cross area

and the Mach number is M 2 - 1. For                        dM                         M

posite to the cross section area. In the

case of M > 1 the Mach number in-                       dA

creases with the cross section area and vice dx x

versa. The special case is when M = 1            Fig. 14.8 - The relationship between the

dition imposes that internal (This condi-             on the subsonic branch.
tion does not impose any restrictions for

external flow. In external flow, an object can be moved in arbitrary speed.) flow has to

pass a converting-diverging device to obtain supersonic velocity. This minimum area

is referred to as "throat."

Again, the opposite conclusion that when dA = 0 implies that M = 1 is not

correct because possibility of dM = 0. In subsonic flow branch, from the mathematical

point of view: on one hand, a decrease of the cross section increases the velocity and

the Mach number, on the other hand, an increase of the cross section decreases the

velocity and Mach number (see Figure (14.8)).

14.4.4  Isentropic Flow Examples

Example 14.3: Pressured Air Flow                      Level: Intermediate

Air is allowed to flow from a reservoir with temperature of 21C and with

pressure of 5[MPa] through a tube. It was measured that air mass flow rate

is 1[kg/sec]. At some point on the tube static pressure was measured to be

3[MPa]. Assume that process is isentropic and neglect the velocity at the

reservoir, calculate the Mach number, velocity, and the cross section area at

that point where the static pressure was measured. Assume that the ratio of

specific heat is k = Cp/Cv = 1.4.

Solution

The stagnation conditions at the reservoir will be maintained throughout the tube
because the process is isentropic. Hence the stagnation temperature can be written
T0 = constant and P0 = constant and both of them are known (the condition at
the reservoir). For the point where the static pressure is known, the Mach number
can be calculated by utilizing the pressure ratio. With the known Mach number,
the temperature, and velocity can be calculated. Finally, the cross section can be
calculated with all these information.

     For a circular tube the diameter is about 1[cm].

      Example 14.4: Station Pressure Measurement Level: Intermediate
    The Mach number at point A on tube is measured to be M = 23 and the
    static pressure is 2[Bar]. Downstream at point B the pressure was measured
    to be 1.5[Bar]. Calculate the Mach number at point B under the isentropic
    flow assumption. Also, estimate the temperature at point B. Assume that the
    specific heat ratio k = 1.4 and assume a perfect gas model.

    Solution

    With the known Mach number at point A all the ratios of the static properties to
    total (stagnation) properties can be calculated. Therefore, the stagnation pressure at
    point A is known and stagnation temperature can be calculated.
    At M = 2 (supersonic flow) the ratios are

    With this information the pressure at point B can be expressed as

                from the table 14.2                                             (14.4.a)

    3Well, this question is for academic purposes, there is no known way for the author to directly
measure the Mach number. The best approximation is by using inserted cone for supersonic flow and
measure the oblique shock. Here it is subsonic and this technique is not suitable.

     Example 14.5: Convergin-Diverging                               Level: Basic

     Gas flows through a converging-diverging duct. At point "A" the cross section
     area is 50 [cm2] and the Mach number was measured to be 0.4. At point B in
     the duct the cross section area is 40 [cm2]. Find the Mach number at point B.

     Assume that the flow is isentropic and the gas specific heat ratio is 1.4.

     Solution

     To obtain the Mach number at point B by finding the ratio of the area to the critical
     area. This relationship can be obtained by

                                    from the Table 14.2

     Example 14.6: French Question                       Level: Intermediate

     Engineer needs to redesign a syringe for medical applications. They complained

     that the syringe is "hard to push." The engineer analyzes the flow and conclude

     that the flow is choke. Upon this fact, what engineer should do with the syringe;

     increase the pushing diameter or decrease the diameter? Explain.

     Solution

     This problem is a typical to compressible flow in the sense the solution is opposite the
     regular intuition. The diameter should be decreased. The pressure in the choke flow
     in the syringe is past the critical pressure ratio. Hence, the force is a function of the
     cross area of the syringe. So, to decrease the force one should decrease the area.

14.4.5 Mass Flow Rate (Number)

One of the important engineering parameters is the mass flow rate which for ideal gas
is

                                               P                                        (14.45)
                            m =  U A = U A

14.4. ISENTROPIC FLOW                                                         551

This parameter is studied here, to examine the maximum flow rate and to see what is
the effect of the compressibility on the flow rate. The area ratio as a function of the
Mach number needed to be established, specifically and explicitly the relationship for
the chocked flow. The area ratio is defined as the ratio of the cross section at any point
to the throat area (the narrow area). It is convenient to rearrange the equation (14.45)
to be expressed in terms of the stagnation properties as

                                                                    f (M, k)

A P0 k R T R T T0                           T0              R P0 T

Expressing the temperature in terms of Mach number in equation (14.46) results in

                m       k M P0            1 + k - 1M2            k+1
                                                  2         - 2 (k-1)

                A  =              k R T0                                      (14.47)

It can be noted that equation (14.47) holds everywhere in the converging-diverging duct
and this statement also true for the throat. The throat area can be denoted as by A.
It can be noticed that at the throat when the flow is chocked or in other words M = 1
and that the stagnation conditions (i.e. temperature, pressure) do not change. Hence
equation (14.47) obtained the form

                   m                           k-1            k+1
                   A =             kP0    1+             - 2 (k-1)

Since the mass flow rate is constant in the duct, dividing equations (14.48) by equation

(14.47) yields

                                  Mass Flow Rate Ratio

Equation (14.49) relates the Mach number at any point to the cross section area ratio.
       The maximum flow rate can be expressed either by taking the derivative of equa-

tion (14.48) in with respect to M and equating to zero. Carrying this calculation results
at M = 1.

   Example 14.10: Chamber Tube         Level: Intermediate

A gas flows in the tube with mass flow rate of 0.1 [kg/sec] and tube cross
section is 0.001[m2]. The temperature at chamber supplying the pressure to
tube is 27C. At some point the static pressure was measured to be 1.5[Bar].

Calculate for that point the Mach number, the velocity, and the stagnation

pressure. Assume that the process is isentropic, k = 1.3, R = 287[j/kgK].

                                                                  End of Ex. 14.10
   Solution

The first thing that need to be done is to find the mass flow per area and it is

               m = 0.1/0.001 = 100.0[kg/sec/m2]              (14.10.a)
               A

It can be noticed that the total temperature is 300K and the static pressure is 1.5[Bar].
It is fortunate that Potto-GDC exist and it can be just plug into it and it provide that

The velocity can be calculated as

                                                             (14.10.b)

U = M c = k R T M = 0.17  1.3  287  300  56.87[m/sec]

The stagnation pressure is

               P0 = P = 1.5/0.98116 = 1.5288[Bar]

14.4.7 The Impulse Function

One of the functions that is used in calculat-        X - direction
ing the forces is the Impulse function. The
Impulse function is denoted here as F , but
in the literature some denote this function
as I. To explain the motivation for using
this definition consider the calculation of the
net forces that acting on section shown in
Figure (14.9). To calculate the net forces
acting in the x-direction the momentum
equation has to be applied

Fnet = m (U2 - U1) + P2A2 - P1A1                  Fig. 14.9 - Schematic to explain the sig-
                                         (14.58)       nificance of the Impulse function.

The net force is denoted here as Fnet.

The mass conservation also can be applied to our control volume

                  m = 1A1U1 = 2A2U2                                  (14.59)

Combining equation (14.58) with equation (14.59) and by utilizing the identity in equa-
tion (14.43) results in

           Fnet = kP2A2M22 - kP1A1M12 + P2A2 - P1A1                  (14.60)
14.4. ISENTROPIC FLOW                                                                                         561

Rearranging equation (14.60) and dividing it by P0A results in

                       f (M2)      f (M2)             f (M1)                                      f (M1)

          Fnet P2A2            1 + kM22               P1A1                                    1 + kM12        (14.61)
          =                                        -
          P0A P0A                                     P0A                                   

       Examining equation (14.61) shows that the right hand side is only a function
of Mach number and specific heat ratio, k. Hence, if the right hand side is only a
function of the Mach number and k than the left hand side must be function of only
the same parameters, M and k. Defining a function that depends only on the Mach
number creates the convenience for calculating the net forces acting on any device.
Thus, defining the Impulse function as

                       F = P A 1 + kM22                                                                       (14.62)

In the Impulse function when F (M = 1) is denoted as F 

                       F  = P A (1 + k)                                                                       (14.63)

The ratio of the Impulse function is defined as

                                                   see function (14.61)

F P1A1    1 + kM12             1                   P0A P1A1 1 + kM12                                    1     (14.64)
F  = P A   (1 + k)     = P                                                                           (1 + k)

                              P0

                                                k

                               ( 2 k+1 ) k-1

This ratio is different only in a coefficient from the ratio defined in equation (14.61)
which makes the ratio a function of k and the Mach number. Hence, the net force is

                                                                                         k    F2 F1           (14.65)
                                                                                              F - F
          Fnet = P0A(1 + k) k + 1 k-1
                                         2

       To demonstrate the usefulness of the this function consider a simple situation of
the flow through a converging nozzle.

     Solution

     The solution is obtained by getting the data for the Mach number. To obtained the
     Mach number, the ratio of P1A1/AP0 is needed to be calculated. The denominator

     is needed to be determined to obtain this ratio. Utilizing Fliegner's equation (14.52),

     provides the following

In this section the relationships between

sented. In this discussion, the flow is

assumed to be in a steady state, and                          flow x          c.v.

shock tube). Of course, the shock travels

from the high pressure to the low pressure side. The second is when many sound

waves "run into" each other and accumulate (some refer to it as "coalescing") into a

large difference, which is the shock wave. In fact, the sound wave can be viewed as

an extremely weak shock. In the speed of sound analysis, it was assumed the medium

is continuous, without any abrupt changes. This assumption is no longer valid in the

case of a shock. Here, the relationship for a perfect gas is constructed.

        In Figure 14.11 a control volume for this analysis is shown, and the gas flows from

left to right. The conditions, to the left and to the right of the shock, are assumed to be

uniform5. The conditions to the right of the shock wave are uniform, but different from

the left side. The transition in the shock is abrupt and in a very narrow width. Therefore,

the increase of the entropy is fundamental to the phenomenon and the understanding

of it.

        It is further assumed that there is no friction or heat loss at the shock (because the

heat transfer is negligible due to the fact that it occurs on a relatively small surface). It

is customary in this field to denote x as the upstream condition and y as the downstream

condition.

        The mass flow rate is constant from the two sides of the shock and therefore the

mass balance is reduced to

                                      x Ux = y Uy                           (14.66)

    5in the shock is so significant compared to the changes in medium before and after the shock that
the changes in the mediums (flow) can be considered uniform.
564  CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

       In a shock wave, the momentum is the quantity that remains constant because
there are no external forces. Thus, it can be written that

     Px - Py = xUy2 - y Ux2                      (14.67)

The process is adiabatic, or nearly adiabatic, and therefore the energy equation can be
written as

                Ux2 Uy2                          (14.68)
     Cp Tx + 2 = Cp Ty + 2

The equation of state for perfect gas reads

         P = RT                                  (14.69)

       If the conditions upstream are known, then there are four unknown conditions
downstream. A system of four unknowns and four equations is solvable. Nevertheless,
one can note that there are two solutions because of the quadratic of equation (14.68).
These two possible solutions refer to the direction of the flow. Physics dictates that
there is only one possible solution. One cannot deduce the direction of the flow from the
pressure on both sides of the shock wave. The only tool that brings us to the direction
of the flow is the second law of thermodynamics. This law dictates the direction of the
flow, and as it will be shown, the gas flows from a supersonic flow to a subsonic flow.
Mathematically, the second law is expressed by the entropy. For the adiabatic process,
the entropy must increase. In mathematical terms, it can be written as follows:

         sy - sx > 0                             (14.70)

Note that the greater-equal signs were not used. The reason is that the process is
irreversible, and therefore no equality can exist. Mathematically, the parameters are
P, T, U, and , which are needed to be solved. For ideal gas, equation (14.70) is

     ln Ty - (k - 1) Py > 0                      (14.71)
     Tx                                      Px

       It can also be noticed that entropy, s, can be expressed as a function of the
other parameters. These equations can be viewed as two different subsets of equations.
The first set is the energy, continuity, and state equations, and the second set is the
momentum, continuity, and state equations. The solution of every set of these equations
produces one additional degree of freedom, which will produce a range of possible
solutions. Thus, one can have a whole range of solutions. In the first case, the energy
equation is used, producing various resistance to the flow. This case is called Fanno flow,
and Section 14.7 deals extensively with this topic. Instead of solving all the equations
that were presented, one can solve only four (4) equations (including the second law),
which will require additional parameters. If the energy, continuity, and state equations
are solved for the arbitrary value of the Ty, a parabola in the T - s diagram will be
obtained. On the other hand, when the momentum equation is solved instead of the
14.5. NORMAL SHOCK                                       565

energy equation, the degree of freedom is now energy, i.e., the energy amount "added"
to the shock. This situation is similar to a frictionless flow with the addition of heat,
and this flow is known as Rayleigh flow. This flow is dealt with in greater detail in
Section (14.9).

       Since the shock has no heat transfer (a special case of Rayleigh flow) and there
isn't essentially any momentum transfer (a special case of Fanno flow), the intersection
of these two curves is what really happened in the shock. The entropy increases from
point x to point y.

14.5.1 Solution of the Governing Equations

Equations (14.66), (14.67), and (14.68) can be converted into a dimensionless form.
The reason that dimensionless forms are heavily used in this book is because by doing
so it simplifies and clarifies the solution. It can also be noted that in many cases the
dimensionless equations set is more easily solved.

       From the continuity equation (14.66) substituting for density, , the equation of
state yields

                    Px Ux = Py Uy                        (14.72)
                    R Tx                 R Ty

Squaring equation (14.72) results in

                    Px 2 2 Py 2 2                        (14.73)
                           Ux = 2 2 Uy
                    R2 Tx2               R Ty

Multiplying the two sides by the ratio of the specific heat, k, provides a way to obtain
the speed of sound definition/equation for perfect gas, c2 = k R T to be used for the

Mach number definition, as follows:

                    Px Ux2 2 = Py Uy2 2                  (14.74)
                    Tx k R Tx            Ty k R Ty

                    cx 2                           cy 2

Note that the speed of sound is different on the sides of the shock. Utilizing the
definition of Mach number results in

                    Px Mx2 2 = Py My2 2                  (14.75)
                    Tx                         Ty

Rearranging equation (14.75) results in

                    Ty =                 Py 2      My 2  (14.76)
                    Tx                   Px        Mx
566  CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

Energy equation (14.68) can be converted to a dimensionless form which can be ex-
pressed as

     Ty 1 + k - 1 My2 = Tx 1 + k - 1 Mx2                                  (14.77)
     2                                              2

It can also be observed that equation (14.77) means that the stagnation temperature
is the same, T0y = T0x. Under the perfect gas model,  U 2 is identical to k P M 2
because

                                     M2  

        2 P  U2                                                           (14.78)
     U =  R T   k R T  k R T = k P M 2

                                     c2

Using the identity (14.78) transforms the momentum equation (14.67) into

     Px + k Px Mx2 = Py + k Py My2                                        (14.79)

Rearranging equation (14.79) yields

        Py 1 + k Mx2                                                      (14.80)
        Px = 1 + k My2

The pressure ratio in equation (14.80) can be interpreted as the loss of the static
pressure. The loss of the total pressure ratio can be expressed by utilizing the relationship
between the pressure and total pressure (see equation (14.22)) as

     P0y Py                          1 + k - 1 My2    k                   (14.81)
           =                                 2      k-1

     P0x                             1 + k - 1 Mx2    k
              Px                             2      k-1

The relationship between Mx and My is needed to be solved from the above set of
equations. This relationship can be obtained from the combination of mass, momentum,
and energy equations. From equation (14.77) (energy) and equation (14.76) (mass)
the temperature ratio can be eliminated.

     Py My                           2 1 + k - 1 Mx2

                                     =                                    (14.82)
                                         1 + k - 1 My2
                                           2
14.5. NORMAL SHOCK                                                 567

Combining the results of (14.82) with equation (14.80) results in

1 + k Mx2 2                   M 2 x 1 + k - 1 2 Mx2                (14.83)
1 + k My2 =                   My 1 + k - 1 My2

                                               2

Equation (14.83) is a symmetrical equation in the sense that if My is substituted with
Mx and Mx substituted with My the equation remains the same. Thus, one solution is

                        My = Mx                                    (14.84)

It can be observed that equation (14.83) is biquadratic. According to the Gauss Bi-

quadratic Reciprocity Theorem this kind of equation has a real solution in a certain
range6 which will be discussed later. The solution can be obtained by rewriting equa-

tion (14.83) as a polynomial (fourth order). It is also possible to cross-multiply equation
(14.83) and divide it by Mx2 - My2 results in

                           1 + k - 1 My2 + My2 - k My2 My2 = 0     (14.85)
                                   2

Equation (14.85) becomes

                        Shock Solution

                              Mx2 + 2
                    My2 = 2 k      k-1                             (14.86)

                                     2
                              k - 1 Mx - 1

The first solution (14.84) is the trivial solution in which the two sides are identical and
no shock wave occurs. Clearly, in this case, the pressure and the temperature from
both sides of the nonexistent shock are the same, i.e. Tx = Ty, Px = Py. The second
solution is where the shock wave occurs.

       The pressure ratio between the two sides can now be as a function of only a
single Mach number, for example, Mx. Utilizing equation (14.80) and equation (14.86)
provides the pressure ratio as only a function of the upstream Mach number as

                    Py = 2 k Mx2 - k - 1 or
                    Px k + 1       k+1

       The density and upstream Mach number relationship can be obtained in the same
fashion to became

              x = Uy = 2 + (k - 1)Mx2

The fact that the pressure ratio is a function of the upstream Mach number, Mx, pro-
vides additional way of obtaining an additional useful relationship. And the temperature
ratio, as a function of pressure ratio, is transformed into

                  Shock Temperature Ratio

14.5.1.1 The Star Conditions

The speed of sound at the critical condition can also be a good reference velocity. The

speed of sound at that velocity is

                                                                                (14.91)
                                    c = k R T 

In the same manner, an additional Mach number can be defined as                 (14.92)
                                               M  = c U

14.5.2 Prandtl's Condition

It can be easily observed that the temperature from both sides of the shock wave is
discontinuous. Therefore, the speed of sound is different in these adjoining mediums.
It is therefore convenient to define the star Mach number that will be independent of
the specific Mach number (independent of the temperature).

                                     M  = c U = cc Uc = cc M                    (14.93)
The jump condition across the shock must satisfy the constant energy.

          c2 + U 2 = c2 + c2 = k + 1 c2                                         (14.94)
        k - 1 2 k - 1 2 2 (k - 1)

Dividing the mass equation by the momentum equation and combining it with the
perfect gas model yields

                            c12     + U1 =  c22   + U2                          (14.95)

                            k U1            k U2

Combining equation (14.94) and (14.95) results in

1 k + 1 c2 - k - 1 U1 + U1 = 1 k + 1 c2 - k - 1 U2 + U2                         (14.96)
k U1 2  2                           k U2 2              2

After rearranging and dividing equation (14.96) the following can be obtained:

                                    U1 U2 = c2                                  (14.97)

Air flows with a Mach number of Mx = 3, at a pressure of 0.5 [bar] and a
temperature of 0C goes through a normal shock. Calculate the temperature,

pressure, total pressure, and velocity downstream of the shock. Assume that

k = 1.4.

Solution

Analysis:

First, the known information are Mx = 3, Px = 1.5[bar] and Tx = 273K. Using these

data, the total pressure can be obtained (through an isentropic relationship in Table

(14.2), i.e., P0x is known). Also with the temperature, Tx, the velocity can readily be

calculated. The relationship that was calculated will be utilized to obtain the ratios for

the downstream of the normal shock.        Px   = 0.0272237 = P0x = 1.5/0.0272237 =

14.5.4 The Moving Shocks

In some situations, the shock wave is not stationary. This kind of situation arises in
many industrial applications. For example, when a valve is suddenly 7 closed and a
shock propagates upstream. On the other extreme, when a valve is suddenly opened
or a membrane is ruptured, a shock occurs and propagates downstream (the opposite
direction of the previous case). In addition to (partially) closing or (partially) opening of
value, the rigid body (not so rigid body) movement creates shocks. In some industrial
applications, a liquid (metal) is pushed in two rapid stages to a cavity through a pipe
system. This liquid (metal) is pushing gas (mostly) air, which creates two shock stages.
The moving shock is observed by daily as hearing sound wave are moving shocks.

       As a general rule, the moving shock can move downstream or upstream. The
source of the shock creation, either due to the static device operation like valve operat-
ing/closing or due to moving object, is relevant to analysis but it effects the boundary
conditions. This creation difference while creates the same moving shock it creates

    7It will be explained using dimensional analysis what is suddenly open.

different questions and hence in some situations complicate the calculations. The most
general case which this section will be dealing with is the partially open or close wave.
A brief discussion on the such case (partially close/open but due the moving object)
will be presented. There are more general cases where the moving shocks are created
which include a change in the physical properties, but this book will not deal with them
at this stage. The reluctance to deal with the most general case is due to fact it is
highly specialized and complicated even beyond early graduate students level. In these
changes (of opening a valve and closing a valve on the other side) create situations in
which different shocks are moving in the tube. The general case is where two shocks
collide into one shock and moves upstream or downstream is the general case. A spe-
cific example is common in die-casting: after the first shock moves a second shock is
created in which its velocity is dictated by the upstream and downstream velocities.

       In cases where the shock velocity can be approximated as a constant (in the
majority of cases) or as near constant, the previous analysis, equations, and the tools
developed in this chapter can be employed. The problem can be reduced to the pre-
viously studied shock, i.e., to the stationary case when the coordinates are attached
to the shock front. In such a case, the steady state is obtained in the moving control
value.

       For this analysis, the coordinates move with the shock. Here, the prime denotes
the values of the static coordinates. Note that this notation is contrary to the conven-
tional notation found in the literature. The reason for the deviation is that this choice
reduces the programing work (especially for object-oriented programing like C++). An
observer moving with the shock will notice that the pressure in the shock sides is

                                       Px = Px Py = Py     (14.100)
The temperatures measured by the observer are

              Tx = Tx Ty = Ty                              (14.101)

Assuming that the shock is moving to the right, (refer to Figure 14.14) the velocity
measured by the observer is

              Ux = Us - Ux                                 (14.102)
14.5. NORMAL SHOCK                                                                                       573

Where Us is the shock velocity which is moving to the right. The "downstream" velocity
is

                        Uy = Us - Uy                                                                     (14.103)

The speed of sound on both sides of the shock depends only on the temperature and it
is assumed to be constant. The upstream prime Mach number can be defined as

Mx = Us - Ux = Us - Mx = Msx - Mx                                                                        (14.104)
                    cx     cx

It can be noted that the additional definition was introduced for the shock upstream
Mach number, Msx = Us cx . The downstream prime Mach number can be expressed as

My = Us - Uy = Us - My = Msy - My                                                                        (14.105)
                    cy     cy

Similar to the previous case, an additional definition was introduced for the shock
downstream Mach number, Msy. The relationship between the two new shock Mach
numbers is

                        Us = cy Us                                                                       (14.106)
                        cx cx cy

                    Msx =      Ty Msy

The "upstream" stagnation temperature of the fluid is

                     T0x = Tx 1 + k - 1 Mx2
                                            2

and the "upstream" prime stagnation pressure is                                                          (14.108)

                                                                                                      k

                                                         2

The same can be said for the "downstream" side of the shock. The difference between
the stagnation temperature is in the moving coordinates

                        T0y - T0x = 0                                                                    (14.109)

14.5.5 Shock or Wave Drag Result from a Moving Shock

It can be shown that there is no shock drag in stationary shock8. However, the shock or
wave drag is very significant so much so that at one point it was considered the sound
barrier. Consider the Figure 14.15 where the stream lines are moving with the object

       The moving shock is either results from a body that moves in gas or from a sudden
imposed boundary like close or open valve9. In the first case, the forces or energies flow

from body to gas and therefor there is a need for large force to accelerate

the gas over extremely short distance          Fig. 14.16 - The diagram for the common

       For some strange reasons, this
topic has several misconceptions that

     Example 14.13: Zucorow's Question         Level: Intermediate

     A book (see Figure 14.16) explains the shock drag is based on the following ratio-

     nal: The body is moving in a stationary frictionless fluid under one-dimensional

     flow. The left plane is moving with body at the same speed. The second plane

     is located "downstream from the body where the gas has expanded isotropically

     (after the shock wave) to the upstream static pressure." The bottom and upper

     stream line close the control volume. Since the pressure is the same on the both

Both case there essentially bodies, however, in one the information flows from inside the field to the
boundary while the other case it is the opposite.

                                                                          End of Ex. 14.13
planes there is no unbalanced pressure forces. However, there is a change in

the momentum in the flow direction because (U1 > U2). The force is acting
on the body. There several mistakes in this explanation including the drawing.

Explain what is wrong in this description (do not describe the error results from

oblique shock).

Solution

Neglecting the mistake around the contact of the stream lines with the oblique
shock(see for retouch in the oblique chapter), the control volume suggested is stretched
with time. However, the common explanation fall to notice that when the isentropic
explanation occurs the width of the area change. Thus, the simple explanation in a
change only in momentum (velocity) is not appropriate. Moreover, in an expanding
control volume this simple explanation is not appropriate. Notice that the relative
velocity at the front of the control volume U1 is actually zero. Hence, the claim of
U1 > U2 is actually the opposite, U1 < U2.

14.5.6 Qualitative questions

   1. In the analysis of the maximum temperature in the shock tube, it was assumed
       that process is isentropic. If this assumption is not correct would the maximum
       temperature obtained is increased or decreased?

   2. In the analysis of the maximum temperature in the shock wave it was assumed
       that process is isentropic. Clearly, this assumption is violated when there are
       shock waves. In that cases, what is the reasoning behind use this assumption any
       why?

14.6 Isothermal Flow

In this section a model dealing with gas that flows through a long tube is described.

This model has a applicability to situations which occur in a relatively long distance

and where heat transfer is relatively rapid so that the temperature can be treated, for

engineering purposes, as a constant. For example, this model is applicable when a

natural gas flows over several hundreds of meters. Such situations are common in large

cities in U.S.A. where natural gas is used for heating. It is more predominant (more

applicable) in situations where the gas is pumped over a length of kilometers.

     The high speed of the gas is ob-

tained or explained by the combination of                  

heat transfer and the friction to the flow.   flow            +      c.v.
For a long pipe, the pressure difference re-                P + P   (M + M)
duces the density of the gas. For instance,   direction P
in a perfect gas, the density is inverse of   TU (M)         T + T
the pressure (it has to be kept in mind that                 U + U

                                                           

the gas undergoes an isothermal process.). Fig. 14.17 - Control volume for isothermal flow.
To maintain conservation of mass, the ve-

locity increases inversely to the pressure. At critical point the velocity reaches the speed

of sound at the exit and hence the flow will be choked11.

14.6.1 The Control Volume Analysis/Governing equations

Figure 14.17 describes the flow of gas from the left to the right. The heat transfer up
stream (or down stream) is assumed to be negligible. Hence, the energy equation can
be written as the following:

                                                                                                                                   
   11This explanation is not correct as it will be shown later on. Close to the critical point (about, 1/ k,
the heat transfer, is relatively high and the isothermal flow model is not valid anymore. Therefore,
the study of the isothermal flow above this point is only an academic discussion but also provides the
upper limit for Fanno Flow.

                       m = cpdT + d 2 = cpdT0

The momentum equation is written as the following

-A dP - w dAwetted area = m dU                          (14.111)

where A is the cross section area (it doesn't have to be a perfect circle; a close enough
shape is sufficient.). The shear stress is the force per area that acts on the fluid by the
tube wall. The Awetted area is the area that shear stress acts on. The second law of
thermodynamics reads

s2 - s1 = ln T2 - k - 1 ln P2                           (14.112)

The mass conservation is reduced to

                       m = constant =  U A              (14.113)

       Again it is assumed that the gas is a perfect gas and therefore, equation of state
is expressed as the following:

                                     P = RT             (14.114)

14.6.2 Dimensionless Representation

In this section the equations are transformed into the dimensionless form and presented
as such. First it must be recalled that the temperature is constant and therefore,
equation of state reads

                                     dP d               (14.115)

It is convenient to define a hydraulic diameter

The Fanning friction factor12 is introduced, this factor is a dimensionless friction factor
sometimes referred to as the friction coefficient as

                                             w          (14.117)

                                           2 U

   12It should be noted that Fanning factor based on hydraulic radius, instead of diameter friction
equation, thus "Fanning f" values are only 1/4th of "Darcy f" values.

Substituting equation (14.117) into momentum equation (14.111) yields

               4 dx  12  U 2                               m             (14.118)

Rearranging equation (14.118) and using the identify for perfect gas M 2 = U 2/kP
yields:

     dP 4 f dx  kP M2                                k P M 2 dU          (14.119)

The pressure, P as a function of the Mach number has to substitute along with velocity,
U as

               U2 = kRTM2                                                (14.120)

Differentiation of equation (14.120) yields                              (14.121)
                                d(U 2) = k R M 2 dT + T d(M 2)

                                     d(M 2) d(U 2) dT                    (14.122)
                                       M2 = U2 - T

     It can be noticed that dT = 0 for isothermal process and therefore

                                d(M 2) d(U 2) 2U dU 2dU                  (14.123)
                                  M2 = U2 = U2 = U

The dimensionalization of the mass conservation equation yields

     d dU d 2 U dU d d(U 2)                                              (14.124)
      + U =  + 2U 2 =  + 2 U 2 = 0

Differentiation of the isotropic (stagnation) relationship of the pressure (14.22) yields

                 kM2 

     dP0 dP                2                       dM 2                  (14.125)
     P0 = P +  1 + k - 1  M 2 M 2
                           2

     Differentiation of equation (14.20) yields:

     dT0 = dT 1 + k - 1 M 2 + T k - 1 dM 2                               (14.126)
                2                                 2

Notice that dT0 = 0 in an isothermal flow. There is no change in the actual temperature
of the flow but the stagnation temperature increases or decreases depending on the Mach
number (supersonic flow of subsonic flow). Substituting T for equation (14.126) yields:

        dT0 =  T0 k - 1 d M 2 M 22                                       (14.127)

Rearranging equation (14.127) yields

                             dT0 = (k - 1) M 2                dM 2                           (14.128)

                                                  2

By utilizing the momentum equation it is possible to obtain a relation between the
pressure and density. Recalling that an isothermal flow (dT = 0) and combining it with
perfect gas model yields

                                           dP d                                              (14.129)
                                                =

                                           P

From the continuity equation (see equation (14.123)) leads

                                           dM 2 2dU                                          (14.130)
                                           M2 = U

The four equations momentum, continuity (mass), energy, state are described

above. There are 4 unknowns (M, T, P, )13 and with these four equations the solution

is attainable. One can notice that there are two possible solutions (because of the

square power). These different solutions are supersonic and subsonic solution.

The  distance  friction,  t  4  fL  ,  is  selected  as  the  choice  for  the  independent  variable.
                                D
Thus, the equations need to be obtained as a function of D 4f L . The density is eliminated

from equation (14.124) when combined with equation (14.129) to become

                                           dP dU                                             (14.131)
                                              =-
                                           P         U

After substituting the velocity (14.131) into equation (14.119), one can obtain

               dP 4 f dx                      kP M2      = k P M 2 dP                        (14.132)
               --                                 2                    P
               P                DH

Equation (14.132) can be rearranged into

     dP d      dU                      1 dM 2                 k M2         dx                (14.133)

Similarly or by other paths, the stagnation pressure can be expressed as a function of

                                                                   2

The variables in equation (14.133) can be separated to obtain integrable form as follows

                                       L 4 f dx 1/k = 1 - k M 2 dM 2                                     (14.136)
                                   0D                    M2 k M2

It can be noticed that at the entrance (x = 0) for which M = Mx=0 (the initial velocity
                                              4f L
in  the  tube     isn't  zero).   The  term    D     is  positive  for  any   x,  thus,  the  term  on   the  other

side has to be positive as well. To obtain this restriction 1 = k M 2. Thus, the value

M   =    1    is  the    limiting  case  from  a  mathematical         point  of  view.   When  Mach     number
           k
                         1
larger   than  M  >        k  it  makes  the  right  hand  side    of  the  integrate  negative.    The  physical

meaning of this value is similar to M = 1 choked flow which was discussed in a variable

area flow in Section 14.4.

         Further  it     can  be   noticed  from  equation   (14.135)        that    when  M        1    the  value
                                                                                                      k

of right hand side approaches infinity (). Since the stagnation temperature (T0) has

a finite value which means that dT0  . Heat transfer has a limited value therefore

the model of the flow must be changed. A more appropriate model is an adiabatic flow

model yet this model can serve as a bounding boundary (or limit).

         Integration of equation (14.136) requires information about the relationship be-

tween the length, x, and friction factor f . The friction is a function of the Reynolds

number along the tube. Knowing the Reynolds number variations is important. The

The quantity U  is constant along the tube (mass conservation) under constant area.
Thus, only viscosity is varied along the tube. However under the assumption of ideal
gas, viscosity is only a function of the temperature. The temperature in isothermal
process (the definition) is constant and thus the viscosity is constant. In real gas, the
pressure effects are very minimal as described in "Basic of fluid mechanics" by this
author. Thus, the friction factor can be integrated to yield

This situation deals with situations where the conditions at the tube exit have not

For the case that M1 >> M2 and M1  1 equation (14.146) is reduced into the
following approximation

heat transfer is extraordinarily fast.  In reality,  even small  4f L  > 2 results in a Mach

number which is larger than 4.5. This velocity requires a large entrance length to achieve

good heat transfer. With this conflicting mechanism obviously the flow is closer to the

Fanno flow model. Yet this model provides the directions of the heat transfer effects

on the flow.

      Example 14.14: Isothermal Example                                          Level: Basic

     Calculate the exit Mach number for pipe with           4f L  = 3 under the assumption

                                                            D
     of the isothermal flow and supersonic flow. Estimate the heat transfer needed

     to achieve this flow.

     Solution

14.6.4 Supersonic Branch

Apparently, this analysis/model is over simplified for the supersonic branch and does

not produce reasonable results since it neglects to take into account the heat transfer

effects. A dimensionless analysis14 demonstrates that all the common materials that the

author is familiar which creates a large error in the fundamental assumption of the model

and the model breaks. Nevertheless, this model can provide a better understanding to

the trends and deviations from Fanno flow model.

      In the supersonic flow, the hydraulic entry length is very large as will be shown

below. However, the feeding diverging nozzle somewhat reduces the required entry

length (as opposed to converging feeding). The thermal entry length is in the order

of the hydrodynamic entry length (look at the Prandtl number15 , (0.7-1.0), value for

the common gases.). Most of the heat transfer is hampered in the sublayer thus the

core assumption of isothermal flow (not enough heat transfer so the temperature isn't

constant) breaks down16.

      The flow speed at the entrance is very large, over hundred of meters per second.

For  example,  a  gas    flows  in  a  tube  with  4f L  =  10  the  required   entry  Mach  number
                                                     D

is over 200. Almost all the perfect gas model substances dealt with in this book, the

speed of sound is a function of temperature. For this illustration, for most gas cases

the speed of sound is about 300[m/sec]. For example, even with low temperature like

200K the speed of sound of air is 283[m/sec]. So, even for relatively small tubes with

4f D  =  10  the  inlet  speed  is  over  56  [km/sec].  This   requires  that  the  entrance  length
  D

to be larger than the actual length of the tub for air.

                                                             UD                            (14.149)
                                       Lentrance = 0.06 

The typical values of the kinetic viscosity, , are 0.0000185 kg/m-sec at 300K and

0.0000130034   kg/m-sec     at  200K.     Combine  this  information  with  our  case  of  4f L  =  10
                                                                                             D

                                      Lentrance = 250746268.7
                                           D

   14This dimensional analysis is a bit tricky, and is based on estimates. Currently and ashamedly the
author is looking for a more simplified explanation. The current explanation is correct but based on
hands waving and definitely does not satisfy the author.

   15 is relating thermal boundary layer to the momentum boundary layer.
   16See Kays and Crawford "Convective Heat Transfer" (equation 12-12).
586               CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

On the other hand a typical value of friction coefficient f = 0.005 results in

                               Lmax = 10 = 500
                                 D 4  0.005

The fact that the actual tube length is only less than 1% of the entry length means that

the assumption is that the isothermal flow also breaks (as in a large response time). If

Mach  number  is  changing  from  10  to  1  the  kinetic  energy  change  is  about  T0   =  18.37
                                                                                      T0 
which means that the maximum amount of energy is insufficient.

      Now with limitation, this topic will be covered in the next version because it

provide some insight and boundary to the Fanno Flow model.

14.6.6 Isothermal Flow Examples

There can be several kinds of questions aside from the proof questions17. Generally,
the "engineering" or practical questions can be divided into driving force (pressure
difference), resistance (diameter, friction factor, friction coefficient, etc.), and mass
flow rate questions. In this model no questions about shock (should) exist18.

       The driving force questions deal with what should be the pressure difference to
obtain a certain flow rate. Here is an example.

Example 14.15: Isothermal Flow Rate     Level: Intermediate

A tube of 0.25 [m] diameter and 5000 [m] in length is attached to a pump.

What should be the pump pressure so that a flow rate of 2 [kg/sec] will be

achieved? Assume that friction factor f = 0.005 and the exit pressure is 1[bar].
The specific heat for the gas, k = 1.31, surroundings temperature 27C, R =

290 K kg J . Hint: calculate the maximum flow rate and then check if this
request is reasonable.

Solution

If the flow was incompressible then for known density, , the velocity can be calculated
by utilizing P = D 2g 4 f L U2 . In incompressible flow, the density is a function of the

   17The proof questions are questions that ask for proof or for finding a mathematical identity (normally
good for mathematicians and study of perturbation methods). These questions or examples will appear
in the later versions.

   18Those who are mathematically inclined can include these kinds of questions but there are no real
world applications to isothermal model with shock.

     The maximum flow rate then reads

                                            (0.25)2                    kg                 (14.15.b)

     The maximum flow rate is larger then the requested mass rate hence the flow is not
     choked. It is note worthy to mention that since the isothermal model breaks around
     the choking point, the flow rate is really some what different. It is more appropriate
     to assume an isothermal model hence our model is appropriate.
     For incompressible flow, the pressure loss is expressed as follows

                                                         4f L U2                           (14.15.c)
                                          P1 - P2 = D 2

     Now  note  that   for  incompressible  flow  U1  =  U2  =  U  and  4f L    represent  the  ratio  of
                                                                          D

     the traditional h12. To obtain a similar expression for isothermal flow, a relationship

     between M2 and M1 and pressures has to be derived. From equation (14.15.c) one

     can obtained that                      M2 = M1 P1
                                                         P2
                                                                                           (14.15.d)

     To solve this problem the flow rate has to be calculated as

                                    m = AU = 2.0 kg                                        (14.15.e)
                                                           sec

                  m = P1 A k U =  P1 A k U = P1 Ak M1                                      (14.15.f )

     Now combining with equation (14.15.d) yields

Example 14.16: Pipe Flow Calculations                             Level: Basic

A flow of gas was considered for a distance of 0.5 [km] (500 [m]). A flow rate of

0.2 [kg/sec] is required. Due to safety concerns, the maximum pressure allowed

for the gas is only 10[bar]. Assume that the flow is isothermal and k=1.4,

calculate the required diameter of tube. The friction coefficient for the tube

can be assumed as 0.02 (A relative smooth tube of cast iron.). Note that tubes
are provided in increments of 0.5 [in]19 You can assume that the soundings
temperature to be 27C.

Solution

At first, the minimum diameter will be obtained when the flow is choked. Thus, the
maximum M1 that can be obtained when the M2 is at its maximum and back pressure
is at the atmospheric pressure.

                                      Mmax

     Since 50.3  0.2 the mass flow rate requirement is satisfied.

     It should be noted that P should be replaced by P0 in the calculations. The speed of

Nevertheless, for the sake of the exercise the other parameters will be calculated. This
situation is reversed question. The flow rate is given with the diameter of the pipe. It
should be noted that the flow isn't choked.

.

Example 14.17: Gas Station                                Level: Intermediate

A gas flows of from a station (a) with pressure of 20[bar] through a pipe with

0.4[m] diameter and 4000 [m] length to a different station (b). The pressure

at the exit (station (b)) is 2[bar]. The gas and the sounding temperature can

be assumed to be 300 K. Assume that the flow is isothermal, k=1.4, and the

average friction f=0.01. Calculate the Mach number at the entrance to pipe

and the flow rate.

Solution

First, the information whether the flow is choked needs to be found. Therefore, at
first it will be assumed that the whole length is the maximum length.

                    4 f L = 4  0.01  4000 = 400                      (14.17.a)

with 4 Df L max = 400 the following can be written

                                T  28          2.21[bar]               (14.17.b)

                                        12.67

The pressure at point (b) by utilizing the isentropic relationship (M = 1) pressure
ratio is 0.52828.

                    P2 =     P0 T  = 2.21  0.52828 = 1.17[bar]        (14.17.c)

                             P0 T

As the pressure at point (b) is smaller than the actual pressure P < P2 than the
actual pressure one must conclude that the flow is not choked. The solution is an
iterative process.

19It is unfortunate, but it seems that this standard will be around in USA for some time.

model described here. The main restric-
tion for this model is that heat transfer
is negligible and can be ignored 20. This
model is applicable to flow processes which
are very fast compared to heat transfer
mechanisms with small Eckert number.
This model explains many industrial flow
processes which includes emptying of pressured container through a relatively short
tube, exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, compressed air systems, etc.
As this model raised from the need to explain the steam flow in turbines.

14.7.1 Introduction

Consider a gas flowing through a conduit with a friction (see Figure 14.19). It is
advantages to examine the simplest situation and yet without losing the core properties
of the process. The mass (continuity equation) balance can be written as

                         m =  A U = constant               (14.150)
                              1 U1 = 2 U2

       The energy conservation (under the assumption that this model is adiabatic flow
and the friction is not transformed into thermal energy) reads

                                    T01  = T02             (14.151)
                                    U12            U22     (14.152)
                          T1 + 2 cp
                                         = T2 + 2 cp

Or in a derivative from

                                         U2
                         Cp dT + d 2 = 0

Again for simplicity, the perfect gas model is assumed21.

                             P = RT                        (14.153)
                          P1 = P2

                             1 T1 2 T2

       It is assumed that the flow can be approximated as one-dimensional. The force
acting on the gas is the friction at the wall and the momentum conservation reads

                         -A dP - w dAw = m dU              (14.154)

20Even the friction does not convert into heat
21The equation of state is written again here so that all the relevant equations can be found.

It is convenient to define a hydraulic diameter as

                                    4  Cross Section Area               (14.155)
                           DH = wetted perimeter

Or in other words

                                  DH 2                                   (14.156)
                           A=

                                     4

It is convenient to substitute D for DH and yet it still will be referred to the same name
as the hydraulic diameter. The infinitesimal area that shear stress is acting on is

                           dAw =  D dx                                   (14.157)

Introducing the Fanning friction factor as a dimensionless friction factor which is some
times referred to as the friction coefficient and reads as the following:

                                   w                                     (14.158)
                           f= 1 2

                                 2 U

By utilizing equation (14.150) and substituting equation (14.158) into momentum equa-
tion (14.154) yields

                      A                                              m
                                                                      A
                   -   D2  dP -  D dx f   w                              (14.159)
                                                           = A  U dU
                      4                  12  U 2

Dividing equation (14.159) by the cross section area, A and rearranging yields

                         -dP + D 2 4 f dx 1  U 2 =  U dU                 (14.160)

The second law is the last equation to be utilized to determine the flow direction.

14.7.2 Non-Dimensionalization of the Equations

Before solving the above equation a dimensionless process is applied. By utilizing the
definition of the sound speed to produce the following identities for perfect gas

                           M2 = U 2 = U2                                 (14.162)
                           c             k RT

                                                        P
                                                        

Utilizing the definition of the perfect gas results in

                           M2 = U2                                       (14.163)
                                    kP
14.7. FANNO FLOW                                                               595

Using the identity in equation (14.162) and substituting it into equation (14.159) and
after some rearrangement yields

                                                        U 2

          4 f dx      12 k P M 2  = U 2 dU = k P M 2 dU                        (14.164)
-dP +                                 U                      U

           DH

By further rearranging equation (14.164) results in

                  dP 4 f dx       k M2    = k M 2 dU                           (14.165)
                  --                2                U
                  P   D

It is convenient to relate expressions of dP/P and dU/U in terms of the Mach number
and substituting it into equation (14.165). Derivative of mass conservation (14.150)
results in

                                      dU
                                       U

                      d 1 dU 2                                                 (14.166)
                          +2 2 =0
                                      U

The derivation of the equation of state (14.153) and dividing the results by equation of
state (14.153) results

                      dP d dT                                                  (14.167)
                           =+

                      P  dT

Differentiating of equation (14.162) and dividing by equation (14.162) yields

                      d(M 2) d(U 2) dT                                         (14.168)
                       M2 = U2 - T

Dividing the energy equation (14.152) by Cp and by utilizing the definition Mach number
yields

                  dT     1            1 U2 U2
                  T + kR T U2d 2 =

                      (k - 1)

                      Cp

                          dT (k - 1) U 2 U 2                                   (14.169)
                       T + kRT U2 d 2 =

                                  c2
                      dT k - 1 2 dU 2
                      +                   M 2 =0
                      T               2              U

Equations (14.165), (14.166), (14.167), (14.168), and (14.169) need to be solved.
These equations are separable so one variable is a function of only single variable (the

chosen as the independent variable). Explicit explanation is provided for only two vari-

ables, the rest variables can be done in a similar fashion. The dimensionless friction,

4f L  ,  is  chosen  as  the  independent  variable  since  the   change  in  the  dimensionless  resis-
  D
tance, D 4 f L , causes the change in the other variables.

         Combining equations (14.167) and (14.169) when eliminating dT /T results

                                  dP d (k - 1) M 2 dU 2                            (14.170)
                                  P =  - 2 U2

The term d/  can be eliminated by utilizing equation (14.166) and substituting it into
equation (14.170) and rearrangement yields

                                  dP          1 + (k - 1) M 2 dU 2                 (14.171)
                                  P = - 2 U2

The term dU 2/U 2 can be eliminated by using (14.171)

                              dP      k M 2 1 + (k - 1) M 2 4 f dx                 (14.172)
                              P = - 2 (1 - M 2) D

The second equation for Mach number, M variable is obtained by combining equation
(14.168) and (14.169) by eliminating dT /T . Then d/ and U are eliminated by
utilizing equation (14.166) and equation (14.170). The only variable that is left is P
(or dP/P ) which can be eliminated by utilizing equation (14.172) and results in

                                  4 f dx   =  1 - M 2 dM 2                         (14.173)

                                  D           4k M (1 + k-1 2
                                                                  M)
                                                            2

Rearranging equation (14.173) results in

                              dM 2 k M 2      1 + k - 1 M2        4 f dx           (14.174)
                              M2 =                    2             D

                                              1 - M2

       After similar mathematical manipulation one can get the relationship for the ve-
locity to read

                                  dU          k M 2 4 f dx                         (14.175)
                                  U = 2 (1 - M 2) D

and the relationship for the temperature is

                              dT 1 dc k (k - 1) M 4 4 f dx                         (14.176)
                                  = 2 =-
                              T           c   2 (1 - M ) D     2

density is obtained by utilizing equations (14.175) and (14.166) to obtain

                                  d           k M 2 4 f dx                         (14.177)
                                   = - 2 (1 - M 2) D
14.7. FANNO FLOW                                                        597

The stagnation pressure is similarly obtained as

                      dP0 = - k M 2 4 f dx                              (14.178)
                      P0            2D                                  (14.179)

The second law reads

                             dT                      dP
                  ds = Cp ln T - R ln P

The stagnation temperature expresses as T0 = T (1 + (1 - k)/2M 2). Taking derivative
of this expression when M remains constant yields dT0 = dT (1 + (1 - k)/2M 2) and

thus when these equations are divided they yield

                          dT /T = dT0/T0                                (14.180)

In similar fashion the relationship between the stagnation pressure and the pressure can
be substituted into the entropy equation and result in

                  ds = Cp ln dT0 - R ln dP0                             (14.181)
                             T0                      P0

The first law requires that the stagnation temperature remains constant, (dT0 = 0).
Therefore the entropy change is

                      ds = - (k - 1) dP0                                (14.182)
                      Cp            k P0                                (14.183)

Using the equation for stagnation pressure the entropy equation yields

                      ds (k - 1) M 2 4 f dx
                          =
                      Cp         2                D

14.7.3 The Mechanics and Why the Flow is Choked?

The trends of the properties can be examined by looking in equations (14.172) through
(14.182). For example, from equation (14.172) it can be observed that the critical
point is when M = 1. When M < 1 the pressure decreases downstream as can be
seen from equation (14.172) because f dx and M are positive. For the same reasons,
in the supersonic branch, M > 1, the pressure increases downstream. This pressure
increase is what makes compressible flow so different from "conventional" flow. Thus
the discussion will be divided into two cases: One, flow above speed of sound. Two,
flow with speed below the speed of sound.

14.7.3.1 Why the flow is choked?

Here, the explanation is based on the equations developed earlier and there is no known
explanation that is based on the physics. First, it has to be recognized that the critical
598      CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

point is when M = 1. It will be shown that a change in location relative to this point
change the trend and it is singular point by itself. For example, dP (@M = 1) =  and
mathematically it is a singular point (see equation (14.172)). Observing from equation
(14.172) that increase or decrease from subsonic just below one M = (1 - ) to above
just above one M = (1 + ) requires a change in a sign pressure direction. However,
the pressure has to be a monotonic function which means that flow cannot crosses over
the point of M = 1. This constrain means that because the flow cannot "crossover"
M = 1 the gas has to reach to this speed, M = 1 at the last point. This situation is
called choked flow.

14.7.3.2 The Trends

The trends or whether the variables are increasing or decreasing can be observed from
looking at the equation developed. For example, the pressure can be examined by look-
ing at equation (14.174). It demonstrates that the Mach number increases downstream
when the flow is subsonic. On the other hand, when the flow is supersonic, the pressure
decreases.

       The summary of the properties changes on the sides of the branch

14.7.4 The Working Equations

     A representative friction factor is defined as

                     1                   Lmax                     (14.185)
                     f=
                                                 f dx

                                         0

 In the isothermal flow model it was shown that friction factor is constant through the
process if the fluid is ideal gas. Here, the Reynolds number defined in equation (14.137)
14.7. FANNO FLOW                                                  599

is not constant because the temperature is not constant. The viscosity even for ideal gas
is complex function of the temperature (further reading in "Basic of Fluid Mechanics"
chapter one, Potto Project). However, the temperature variation is very limited. Simple
improvement can be done by assuming constant constant viscosity (constant friction
factor) and find the temperature on the two sides of the tube to improve the friction
factor for the next iteration. The maximum error can be estimated by looking at the
maximum change of the temperature. The temperature can be reduced by less than
20% for most range of the specific heats ratio. The viscosity change for this change is
for many gases about 10%. For these gases the maximum increase of average Reynolds
number is only 5%. What this change in Reynolds number does to friction factor? That
depend in the range of Reynolds number. For Reynolds number larger than 10,000 the
change in friction factor can be considered negligible. For the other extreme, laminar
flow it can estimated that change of 5% in Reynolds number change about the same
amount in friction factor. With the exception of the jump from a laminar flow to
a turbulent flow, the change is noticeable but very small. In the light of the about
discussion the friction factor is assumed to constant. By utilizing the mean average
theorem equation (14.184) yields

Equations (14.172), (14.175), (14.176), (14.177), (14.177), and (14.178) can be

solved. For example, the pressure as written in equation (14.171) is represented by D 4fL ,
                                                            4f L
and Mach number.  Now equation (14.172) can eliminate term   D    and describe the

pressure on the Mach number. Dividing equation (14.172) in equation (14.174) yields

                     dP

                     P = - 1 + (k - 1M 2           dM 2           (14.187)

The symbol " " denotes the state when the flow is choked and Mach number is equal
to 1. Thus, M = 1 when P = P  equation (14.187) can be integrated to yield:

                         Mach-Pressure Ratio

14.7.5 Examples of Fanno Flow

     Example 14.18: Fanno Reservoir                           Level: Intermediate

     Air flows from a reservoir and enters a uniform pipe with a diameter of 0.05 [m]
     and length of 10 [m]. The air exits to the atmosphere. The following conditions

     prevail at the exit: P2 = 1[bar]               P0 =?                      M2 = 0.9
     temperature T2 = 27C M2 =                      T0 =?C                   D = 0.05[m]
     0.922. Assume that the average
     friction factor to be f = 0.004                                           L = 10[m]
     and that the flow from the reser-
     voir up to the pipe inlet is es-                                       T2 = 27C

     Solution

     For isentropic, the flow to the pipe inlet, the temperature and the total pressure at the
     pipe inlet are the same as those in the reservoir. Thus, finding the star pressure and
     temperature at the pipe inlet is the solution. With the Mach number and temperature
     known at the exit, the total temperature at the entrance can be obtained by knowing
     the D 4fL . For given Mach number (M = 0.9) the following is obtained.

       Example 14.19: Fonno with Shock               Level: Intermediate

     A system is composed of a convergent-                               Mx =?
     divergent nozzle followed by a tube with
     length of 2.5 [cm] in diameter and 1.0 [m]      P0 = 29.65[Bar]  M1 = 3.0  D = 0.025[m]
     long. The system is supplied by a vessel.        T0 = 400K                  L = 1.0[m]
     The vessel conditions are at 29.65 [Bar],
     400 K. With these conditions a pipe inlet                                 shock
     Mach number is 3.0. A normal shock wave                          d-c nozzle atmospheric
     occurs in the tube and the flow discharges
     to the atmosphere, determine:                                                       conditions

                                                 Fig. 14.22 - The schematic of Ex-
                                                      ample (14.19).

     (a) the mass flow rate through the system;

     (b) the temperature at the pipe exit; and

     (c) determine the Mach number when a normal shock wave occurs [Mx].

     Take k = 1.4, R = 287 [J/kgK] and f = 0.005.

     Solution

     (a) Assuming that the pressure vessel is very much larger than the pipe, therefore

     the velocity in the vessel can be assumed to be small enough so it can be

     neglected. Thus, the stagnation conditions can be approximated for the condi-

     tion in the tank. It is further assumed that the flow through the nozzle can be

     approximated as isentropic. Hence, T01 = 400K and P01 = 29.65[P ar].

     The mass flow rate through the system is constant and for simplicity point 1

     is chosen in which,

                               m =  A M c                             (14.19.a)

     The density and speed of sound are unknowns and need to be computed. With
     the isentropic relationship, the Mach number at point one (1) is known, then
     the following can be found either from Table 14.6, or the popular Potto-GDC
     as

     The temperature is

                          T1 = T1 T01 = 0.357  400 = 142.8K          (14.19.b)

     Using the temperature, the speed of sound can be calculated as

       The pressure at point 1 can be calculated as              continue Ex. 14.19

       m = 1.97     0.0252     3  239.54 = 0.69              kg    (14.19.f )

(b) First, check whether the flow is shockless by comparing the flow resistance and
     the maximum possible resistance. From the Table 14.6 or by using the famous
     Potto-GDC, is to obtain the following

       and the conditions of the tube are

                        D 4fL = 4  0.005  1.0 0.025 = 0.8               (14.19.g)

       Since 0.8 > 0.52216 the flow is choked and with a shock wave.
       The exit pressure determines the location of the shock, if a shock exists, by
       comparing "possible" Pexit to PB. Two possibilities are needed to be checked;
       one, the shock at the entrance of the tube, and two, shock at the exit and
       comparing the pressure ratios. First, the possibility that the shock wave occurs
       immediately at the entrance for which the ratio for Mx are (shock wave Table

     The actual pressure ratio 1/29.65 = 0.0338 is smaller than the case in which

     shock occurs at the entrance. Thus, the shock is somewhere downstream. One

     possible way to find the exit temperature, T2 is by finding the location of the

     shock.  To  find  the  location     of  the  shock   ratio  of  the  pressure  ratio,  P2  is  needed.
                                                                                            P1
     With the location of shock, "claiming" upstream from the exit through shock

     to the entrance. For example, calculate the parameters for shock location with

     known   4f L  in  the  "y"   side.  Then     either  by  utilizing   shock  table  or  the  program,
              D

     to obtain the upstream Mach number.

     The procedure for the calculations:

         Calculate the entrance Mach number assuming the shock occurs at the exit:

     1) a) set M2 = 1 assume the flow in the entire tube is supersonic:
         b) calculated M1
         Note this Mach number is the high Value.
         Calculate the entrance Mach assuming shock at the entrance.

         a) Set M2 = 1

     2)  b)  Add   4f L  and calculated M1' for subsonic branch
                    D

         c) Calculated Mx for M1'

         Note this Mach number is the low value.

         According your root finding algorithm23 calculate or guess the shock location

         and then compute as above the new M1.

     3)  a) set M2 = 1

         b)  for the new    4f L  and compute the new My' for the subsonic branch
                             D

         c) calculated Mx' for the My'

         d)  Add the leftover of  4f L       and calculated the M1
                                   D

     4) guess new location for the shock according to your finding root procedure and
         according to the result, repeat previous stage until the solution is obtained.

Supersonic Branch

       In Section (14.6) it was shown that the isothermal model cannot describe ade-
quately the situation because the thermal entry length is relatively large compared to
the pipe length and the heat transfer is not sufficient to maintain constant temperature.
In the Fanno model there is no heat transfer, and, furthermore, because the very limited
amount of heat transformed it is closer to an adiabatic flow. The only limitation of the
model is its uniform velocity (assuming parabolic flow for laminar and different profile
for turbulent flow.). The information from the wall to the tube center24 is slower in re-
ality. However, experiments from many starting with 1938 work by Frossel25 has shown
that the error is not significant. Nevertheless, the comparison with reality shows that
heat transfer cause changes to the flow and they need/should to be expected. These
changes include the choking point at lower Mach number.

14.7.5.1 Maximum Length for the Supersonic Flow

It has to be noted and recognized that as opposed to subsonic branch the supersonic
branch has a limited length. It also must be recognized that there is a maximum
length for which only supersonic flow can exist26. These results were obtained from the
mathematical derivations but were verified by numerous experiments27. The maximum

   23You can use any method you wish, but be-careful second order methods like Newton-Rapson
method can be unstable.

   24The word information referred to is the shear stress transformed from the wall to the center of the
tube.

                  4 f Lmax D = D 4fL (M  , k = 1.4) = 0.8215                     (14.199)

The maximum length of the supersonic flow is limited by the above number. From the
above analysis, it can be observed that no matter how high the entrance Mach number
will be the tube length is limited and depends only on specific heat ratio, k.

14.7.6 Working Conditions

It has to be recognized that there are two              s 4 f L1 <s 4 f L2
regimes that can occur in Fanno flow model                   D                   D
one of subsonic flow and the other super-          T
sonic flow. Even the flow in the tube starts  T0                 Larger = 4 f L
                                                                                     D

as a supersonic in parts of the tube can be

transformed into the subsonic branch. A

shock wave can occur and some portions of

the tube will be in a subsonic flow pattern. s
       The discussion has to differenti-

ate between two ways of feeding the           Fig. 14.23 - The effects of increase of

diverging nozzle. Three parameters, the       4f L  on  the  Fanno        line.

dimensionless friction, D 4 f L , the entrance Mach number, M1, and the pressure ratio,
P2/P1 are controlling the flow. Only a combination of these two parameters is truly

independent. However, all the three parameters can be varied and some are discussed

separately here.

14.7.6.1 Variations of The Tube Length ( D 4fL ) Effects
In the analysis of this effect, it should be assumed that back pressure is constant and/or
low as possible as needed to maintain a choked flow. First, the treatment of the two
branches are separated.

sure ratio mass flow rate. For increase in the

pipe length results in mass flow rate decreases. Fig. 14.24 - The effects of the increase of

It is worth noting that entrance Mach number      D        on    the  Fanno  Line.

is reduced (as some might explain it to reduce

the flow rate). The entrance temperature in-

creases as can be seen from Figure 14.24. The velocity therefore must decrease because

the loss of the enthalpy (stagnation temperature) is "used." The density decrease be-

cause  =   P  and when pressure is remains almost constant the density decreases.
          RT

Thus, the mass flow rate must decrease. These results are applicable to the converging

nozzle.

       In the case of the converging-diverging feeding nozzle, increase of the dimension-

less friction, D 4fL , results in a similar flow pattern as in the converging nozzle. Once
the flow becomes choked a different flow pattern emerges.

14.7.6.2 Fanno Flow Supersonic Branch

There are several transitional points that

change the pattern of the flow. Point a         M                M1                 bc
is the choking point (for the supersonic        m                a
branch) in which the exit Mach number
reaches to one. Point b is the maximum              M2               M=1
possible flow for supersonic flow and is not
                                                 all supersonic

dependent on the nozzle. The next point,        m = const        mixed supersonic
referred here as the critical point c, is the                    with subsonic

                                                                                       4f L

the entire nozzle-tube system. Between Fig. 14.25 - The Mach numbers at entrance and

exit Mach number are discussed.

At the starting point the flow is choked in the nozzle, to achieve supersonic flow.

The following ranges that has to be discussed includes (see Figure 14.25):

includes (see Figure 14.25):

     The 0-a range, the mass flow rate is constant because the flow is choked at the

nozzle. The entrance Mach number, M1 is constant because it is a function of the

nozzle design only. The exit Mach number, M2 decreases (remember this flow is on
the supersonic branch) and starts ( D 4 f L = 0) as M2 = M1. At the end of the range a,
M2 = 1. In the range of a - b the flow is all supersonic.

     In the next range a - b the flow is double choked and make the adjustment for

the flow rate at different choking points by changing the shock location. The mass flow

rate continues to be constant. The entrance Mach continues to be constant and exit

Mach number is constant.

     The total maximum available for supersonic flow b - b ,   4f L       , is only a
                                                                 D
                                                                     max
theoretical length in which the supersonic flow can occur if nozzle is provided with a

larger Mach number (a change to the nozzle area ratio which also reduces the mass

flow rate). In the range b - c, it is a more practical point.

     In semi supersonic flow b - c (in which no supersonic is available in the tube but

only in the nozzle) the flow is still double choked and the mass flow rate is constant.

Notice that exit Mach number, M2 is still one. However, the entrance Mach number,
M1, reduces with the increase of D 4 f L .

       It is worth noticing that in the a - c the mass flow rate nozzle entrance velocity

and the exit velocity remains constant!28

     In the last range c -  the end is really the pressure limit or the break of the

model and the isothermal model is more appropriate to describe the flow. In this range,

the flow rate decreases since (m  M1)29.

       To summarize the above discussion, Figures 14.25 exhibits the development of

M1, M2 mass flow rate as a function of D 4 f L . Somewhat different then the subsonic
branch the mass flow rate is constant even if the flow in the tube is completely subsonic.

This situation is because of the "double" choked condition in the nozzle. The exit Mach

M2 is a continuous monotonic function that decreases with D 4 f L . The entrance Mach
M1 is a non continuous function with a jump at the point when shock occurs at the

entrance "moves" into the nozzle.

   28On a personal note, this situation is rather strange to explain. On one hand, the resistance increases
and on the other hand, the exit Mach number remains constant and equal to one. Does anyone have
an explanation for this strange behavior suitable for non-engineers or engineers without background in
fluid mechanics?

   29Note that 1 increases with decreases of M1 but this effect is less significant.

The Figure (14.27) exhibits the entrance Mach number as a function of the M2. Ob-

viously there can be two extreme possibilities for the subsonic exit branch. Subsonic

velocity occurs for supersonic entrance velocity, one, when the shock wave occurs at

the   tube   exit  and   two,    at  the    tube  entrance.  In    Figure     14.27  only  for    4f L  = 0.1   and

exit  only.  Obviously,      and     as  can  be  observed,  the   larger     4f L   creates  larger    differences

must occurs even for shock at the entrance.

      For a given D 4 f L , below the maximum critical length, the supersonic entrance

flow has three different regimes which depends on the back pressure. One, shockless

flow, tow, shock at the entrance, and three, shock at the exit. Below, the maximum

critical length is mathematically

14.7.7 The Pressure Ratio, P2/ P1, effects

In this section the studied parameter is the variation of the back pressure and thus, the

pressure ratio ( P2/ P1) variations. For very low pressure ratio the flow can be assumed

as incompressible with exit Mach number smaller than < 0.3. As the pressure ratio

increases (smaller back pressure, P2), the exit and entrance Mach numbers increase.
                                                4f L
According  to  Fanno     model  the  value  of    D   is     constant  (friction  factor,       f,  is  indepen-

dent of the parameters such as, Mach number, Reynolds number et cetera) thus the

flow remains on the same Fanno line. For cases where the supply come from a reservoir

with a constant pressure, the entrance pressure decreases as well because of the increase

in the entrance Mach number (velocity).

Again a differentiation of the feeding is important to point out. If the feeding

nozzle is converging than the flow will be only subsonic. If the nozzle is "converging-

diverging" than in some part supersonic flow is possible. At first the converging nozzle

is presented and later the converging-diverging nozzle is explained.

14.7.7.1 Choking explanation for pressure variation/reduction

Decreasing the pressure ratio or in actuality the back pressure, results in increase of the

entrance and the exit velocity until a maximum is reached for the exit velocity. The

maximum velocity is when exit Mach number equals one. The Mach number, as it was

shown in Section 14.4, can increases only if the area increase. In our model the tube area

is postulated as a constant therefore the velocity cannot increase any further. However,

for the flow to be continuous the pressure must decrease and for that the velocity must

increase. Something must break since there are conflicting demands and it result in a

"jump" in the flow. This jump is referred to as a choked flow. Any additional reduction

in the back pressure will not change the situation in the tube. The only change will be

at tube surroundings which are irrelevant to this discussion.

      If the feeding nozzle is a "converging-diverging" then it has to be differentiated

between  two  cases;   One  case  is  where  the  4f L     is  short    or  equal  to  the    critical     length.

Figure 14.29 shows different pressure profiles for different back pressures. Before the
flow reaches critical point a (in the Figure 14.29) the flow is subsonic. Up to this
14.7. FANNO FLOW                                                                                                        615

stage the nozzle feeding the tube increases the mass flow rate (with decreasing back
pressure). Pressure between point a and point b the shock is in the nozzle. In this
range and further reduction of the pressure the mass flow rate is constant no matter
how low the back pressure is reduced. Once the back pressure is less than point b the
supersonic reaches to the tube. Note however that exit Mach number, M2 < 1 and is
not 1. A back pressure that is at the critical point c results in a shock wave that is at
the exit. When the back pressure is below point c, the tube is "clean" of any shock31.
The back pressure below point c has some adjustment as it occurs with exceptions of
point d.

different from point c at the case of short tube                    4f L   <  4f L                  . In this point the

exit Mach number is equal to 1 and the flow is double shock. Further reduction of the

back pressure at this stage will not "move" the shock wave downstream the nozzle. At

point c or location of the shock wave, is a function entrance Mach number, M1 and
the "extra" D 4 f L . There is no analytical solution for the location of this point c. The
procedure is (will be) presented in later stage.

The Maximum Location of the Shock

        The main point in this discussion however, is to find the furthest shock location

downstream. Figure 14.32a shows the possible                   4f L   as a function of retreat of
                                                                 D

the location of the shock wave from the maximum location. When the entrance Mach

number is infinity, M1 = , if the shock location is at the maximum length, then shock

at Mx = 1 results in My = 1.

        The proposed procedure is based on Figure 14.32a.

i)   Calculate   the  extra  4f L  and  subtract  the  actual  extra  4f L  assuming  shock  at
                               D                                        D

     the left side (at the max length).

ii)  Calculate   the  extra  4f L  and  subtract  the  actual  extra  4f L  assuming  shock  at
                               D                                        D

     the right side (at the entrance).

iii) According to the positive or negative utilizes your root finding procedure.

       From numerical point of view, the Mach number equal infinity when left side
assumes result in infinity length of possible extra (the whole flow in the tube is subsonic).
To overcome this numerical problem, it is suggested to start the calculation from
distance from the right hand side.

       Let denote

                                4 f L 4 f L                   4f L                   (14.200)

The solution is obtained by an iterative process. The maximum 4 Df L max for k = 1.4
                                  4f L                                      4f L
is 0.821508116.          Hence,     D     exceed   the  maximum     length    D         for  this  entrance

Mach number.         The maximum for M1 = 8 is             4f L  = 0.76820, thus the extra tube
                                                             D
is  D 4 f L = 0.9 - 0.76820 = 0.1318. The left side is when the shock occurs at

4f L  =   0.76820    (flow    is  choked  and  no  additional  D 4 f L ).  Hence,    the   value  of  left  side
  D

is -0.1318. The right side is when the shock is at the entrance at which the extra

The extra          4f L  is 2.442-0.1318 = 2.3102 Now the solution is somewhere between

In a summary of the actions is done by the following algorithm:

(a) check if the 4 Df L exceeds the maximum 4 Df L max for the supersonic flow.
     Accordingly continue.

(b) Guess D up 4 f L = D 4 f L - D max 4 f L

nozzle before entering the tube. Or in a very long tube the whole flow will be subsonic.

14.7.9 The Practical Questions and Examples of Subsonic branch

The Fanno is applicable also when the flow isn't choke32. In this case, several questions
appear for the subsonic branch. This is the area shown in Figure 14.25 in beginning for
between points 0 and a. This kind of questions made of pair given information to find
the conditions of the flow, as oppose to only one piece of information given in choked
flow. There many combinations that can appear in this situation but there are several
more physical and practical that will be discussed here.

exact analytical solution. There are

two possible approaches to solve this problem: one, by building a representative func-

tion and find a root (or roots) of this representative function. Two, the problem can be

solved by an iterative procedure. The first approach require using root finding method

and either method of spline method or the half method or the combination of the two. In

the past, this book advocated the integrative method. Recently, this author investigate

proposed an improved method.

       This method is based on the entrance Mach number as the base. The idea based

on the idea that the pressure ratio can be drawn as a function of the entrance Mach

number. One of difficulties lays in the determination the boundaries of the entrance

Mach number. The maximum entrance Mach number is chocking Mach number. The

lower possible Mach number is zero which creates very large D 4 f L . The equations are

P2/P1 = 0.8 yield the solution of M  0.5. The whole solution obtained in 7 iterations
with accuracy of 10-12.

In Potto-GDC there is another older iterative method used to solve constructed

on the properties of several physical quantities must be in a certain range. The first fact

is that the pressure ratio P2/P1 is always between 0 and 1 (see Figure 14.34). In the

figure, a theoretical extra tube is added in such a length that cause the flow to choke

(if it really was there). This length is always positive (at minimum is zero).

The procedure for the calculations is as the following:

1) Calculate the entrance Mach number, M1          assuming      the   4f L  =   4f L
                                                                         D         D
                                                                                       max

(chocked flow);

Calculate the minimum pressure ratio (P2/P1)min for M1 (look at table 14.6)

2) Check if the flow is choked:
    There are two possibilities to check it.
622                       CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

a)    Check      if  the  given  4f L  is  smaller  than  4f L  obtained  from  the  given  P1/P2,  or
                                   D                        D

b) check if the (P2/P1)min is larger than (P2/P1),

    continue if the criteria is satisfied. Or if not satisfied abort this procedure and
    continue to calculation for choked flow.
3) Calculate the M2 based on the (P /P2) = (P1/P2),

4) calculate  D 4 f L based on M2,

5) calculate the new (P2/P1), based on the new f                  D 4 f L , D 4 f L ,
    (remember that  4 f L = 4 f L ),                                      1          2

                                          D D2

6) calculate the corresponding M1 and M2,
7) calculate the new and "improved" the  D 4 f L by

                                 4f L      =          4f L         P2                   (14.204)
                                                                   P1 given
                                 D new                D old
                                                                     P2
                                                                     P1 old

Note, when the pressure ratios are matching also the  D 4 f L will also match.

8) Calculate the "improved/new" M2 based on the improve  D 4 f L

9) calculate the improved 4 f L D as 4 f L D = 4 f L D      given  +  D 4 f L   new

10) calculate the improved M1 based on the improved D 4 f L .

11) Compare the abs ((P2/P1)new - (P2/P1)old ) and if not satisfied
     returned to stage (5) until the solution is obtained.

      To demonstrate how this procedure is working consider a typical example of

4f L  =  1.7  and    P2/P1       =  0.5.   Using the above algorithm the results are exhibited

better first guess this conversion procedure converts much faster but at a certain range

it is unstable.

14.7.11 Subsonic Fanno Flow for a Given M1 and Pressure Ratio

This situation pose a simple mathematical problem while the physical situation occurs
in cases where a specific flow rate is required with a given pressure ratio (range) (this
problem was considered by some to be somewhat complicated). The specific flow rate
can be converted to entrance Mach number and this simplifies the problem. Thus,

the problem is reduced to find for given entrance Mach, M1, and given pressure ratio
calculate the flow parameters, like the exit Mach number, M2. The procedure is based
on the fact that the entrance star pressure ratio can be calculated using M1. Thus,
using the pressure ratio to calculate the star exit pressure ratio provide the exit Mach

number, M2. An example of such issue is the following example that combines also the
"Naughty professor" problems.

Example 14.21: Mexist for Min                                     Level: Intermediate

M1 = 0.25.

Solution

The star pressure can be obtained from a table or Potto-GDC as

14.9 Rayleigh Flow

Rayleigh flow is a model describing a frictionless flow with heat transfer through a
pipe of constant cross sectional area. In practice, Rayleigh flow isn't a really good
model to describe real situations. Yet, Rayleigh flow is practical and useful concept in
a obtaining trends and limits such as the density and pressure change due to external
cooling or heating. As opposed to the two previous models, the heat transfer can be in
two directions not like the friction (there is no negative friction). This fact creates a
different situation as compared to the previous two models. This model can be applied
to cases where the heat transfer is significant and the friction can be ignored. Flow of
steam in steam boiler is good example where Rayleigh flow can be used.

the literature as Rayleigh Flow (see histor-       횟 direction     heat transfer 횡

case in which the friction effects are ne-

assumption was that relative length is en-

ables significant heat transfer to occur between the surroundings and tube. In contrast,

the heat transfer in Rayleigh flow occurs between unknown temperature and the tube

and the heat flux is maintained constant. As before, a simple model is built around the

assumption of constant properties (poorer prediction to case where chemical reaction

take a place).

     This model is used to roughly predict the conditions which occur mostly in sit-

uations involving chemical reaction. In analysis of the flow, one has to be aware that

properties do change significantly for a large range of temperatures. Yet, for smaller

range of temperatures and lengths the calculations are more accurate. Nevertheless,

the main characteristics of the flow such as a choking condition etc. are encapsulated

in this model.
14.9. RAYLEIGH FLOW                                                  629

       The basic physics of the flow revolves around the fact that the gas is highly
compressible. The density changes through the heat transfer (temperature change).
Contrary to Fanno flow in which the resistance always oppose the flow direction, Rayleigh
flow, also, the cooling can be applied. The flow acceleration changes the direction when
the cooling is applied.

14.9.2 Governing Equations

The energy balance on the control volume reads

                                         Q = Cp (T02 - T01)          (14.205)
The momentum balance reads

                                     A (P1 - P2) = m (V2 - V1)       (14.206)
The mass conservation reads

                     1U1A = 2U2A = m                                 (14.207)

Equation of state

                              P1 = P2                                (14.208)
                             1 T1 2 T2

There are four equations with four unknowns, if the upstream conditions are known (or
downstream conditions are known). Thus, a solution can be obtained. One can notice
that equations (14.206), (14.207) and (14.208) are similar to the equations that were
solved for the shock wave. Thus, results in the same as before (14.80)

                             P1 = 1 + k M22

The equation of state (14.208) can further assist in obtaining the temperature ratio as

                               T2 = P2 1                             (14.210)
                               T1 P1 2

The density ratio can be expressed in terms of mass conservation as

                   1 = U2 =   U2 k R T2         = M2 T2
                   2 U1        k R T2              M1 T1
                                U1                                   (14.211)

or in simple terms as

                                        Density Ratio

                               1 = U2 = M2 T2                                                (14.212)
                               2 U1 M1 T1

or substituting equations (14.209) and (14.212) into equation (14.210) yields

                              T2 1 + k M12 M2 T2                                             (14.213)
                              T1 = 1 + k M22 M1 T1

Transferring the temperature ratio to the left hand side and squaring the results gives

                                    Temperature Ratio

                              T2 =  1 + k M12 2        M2 2                                  (14.214)

     Cp = 2 ln ( (1 + k M22) M1 + k ln 1 + k M12

Let the initial condition M1, and s1 be constant and the variable parameters are M2,
and s2. A derivative of equation (14.216) results in

                               1 ds         2 (1 - M 2)                                      (14.217)
                               Cp dM = M (1 + k M 2)

Taking the derivative of equation (14.217) and letting the variable parameters be T2,
and M2 results in

                           dT               1 - kM2                                          (14.218)
                           dM = constant  (1 + k M 2)3

Combining equations (14.217) and (14.218) by eliminating dM results in

                       dT                   M (1 - kM 2)                                     (14.219)
                       ds = constant  (1 - M 2)(1 + kM 2)2

On T-s diagram a family of curves can be drawn for a given constant. Yet for every

curve, several observations can be generalized. The derivative is equal to zero when
1 - kM 2 = 0 or M = 1/ k or when M  0. The derivative is equal to infinity,

dT /ds =  when M = 1. From thermodynamics, increase of heating results in increase

of entropy. And cooling results in reduction of entropy. Hence, when cooling is applied

to a tube the velocity decreases and when heating is applied the velocity increases. At
peculiar point of M = 1/ k when additional heat is applied the temperature decreases.

The derivative is negative, dT /ds < 0, yet note this point is not the choking point. The

choking occurs only when M = 1 because it violates the second law. The transition to

supersonic flow occurs when the area changes, somewhat similarly to Fanno flow. Yet,

choking can be explained by the fact that increase of energy must be accompanied by

increase of entropy. But the entropy of supersonic flow is lower (see Figure 14.40) and

therefore it is not possible (the maximum entropy at M = 1.).

       It is convenient to refer to the value of M = 1. These values are referred to as
the "star"33 values. The equation (14.209) can be written between choking point and

any point on the curve.

14.9.4 Examples For Rayleigh Flow

The typical questions that are raised in Rayleigh Flow are related to the maximum heat
that can be transferred to gas (reaction heat) and to the maximum flow rate.
636               CHAPTER 14. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW ONE DIMENSIONAL

     Example 14.23: Rayleigh Mexit                              Level: Simple

     Air enters a pipe with pressure of 3[Bar] and temperature of 27C at Mach

     number of M = 0.25. Due to internal combustion heat was released and the
     exit temperature was found to be 127C. Calculate the exit Mach number,

     the exit pressure, the total exit pressure, and heat released and transferred to

     the air. At what amount of energy the exit temperature will start to decrease?

     Assume CP = 1.004    kJ
                        kg C

     Solution

Solution

The entrance Mach number and the exit temperature are given and from Table ?? or
from Potto-GDC the initial ratio can be calculated. From the initial values the ratio at
the exit can be computed as the following.

     The exit Mach number is known, the exit pressure can be calculated as

                        P  P2           1     2.1341 = 2.901[Bar]

For the entrance, the stagnation values are

                                                0.95745 2.3005

     The total exit pressure, P02 can be calculated as the following:

          isentropic

P02 = P1       P01 P0 P02  =3          1           1   1.1992 = 3.08572[Bar]

The heat released (heat transferred) can be calculated from obtaining the stagnation
temperature from both sides. The stagnation temperature at the entrance, T01

                             isentropic

            T01 = T1 T01 = 300/0.98765 = 303.75[K]

The exit stagnation temperature is

                                         isentropic

                 T02 = T2 T02 = 400/0.98765 = 407.12[K]
                                 T2

The heat released becomes

Q                                                                        kJ

    The maximum temperature occurs at the point where the Mach number reaches
1/ k and at this point the Rayleigh relationship are:

     M           T             T0                    P      P0

The maximum heat before the temperature can be calculated as following:

   Tmax = T1         T  Tmax               300      1.0286 = 1013.7[K]
                           
                     T1 T                  0.3044

The isentropic relationships at the maximum energy are

The maximum heat can be calculated as

Note that this point isn't the choking point. After this point additional heat results in
temperature reduction.

     Example 14.24: Rayleigh Flow Choked                   Level: Intermediate

     Heat is added to the air until the flow is choked in amount of 600 [kJ/kg].

     The exit temperature is 1000 [K]. Calculate the entrance temperature and the

     entrance Mach number.

     Solution

     The solution involves finding the stagnation temperature at the exit and subtracting
     the heat (heat equation) to obtain the entrance stagnation temperature. From the
     Table 14.7 or from the Potto-GDC the following ratios can be obtained.

     The stagnation temperature

                                 T2 0.83333

     The entrance temperature is

     T01       =1-  Q/m                         600                     (14.24.b)
                                  = 1200 -                 = 0.5016
     T02            T02 CP                   1200  1.004

     It must be noted that T02 = T0. Therefore with TT01 0 = 0.5016 either by using Table
     (14.7) or by Potto-GDC the following is obtained

       M            T                   T0           P         P0

     Thus, entrance Mach number is 0.38454 and the entrance temperature can be calcu-
     lated as following

               T1 = T T   T1 = 1000  0.58463 = 584.6[K]                (14.24.c)

Example 14.25: Supersonic Rayleigh Flow           Level: Intermediate

Air with Mach 3 enters a frictionless duct with heating. What is the maximum

heat that can be added so that there is no subsonic flow? If a shock occurs

immediately at the entrance, what is the maximum heat that can be added?

Solution

To achieve maximum heat transfer the exit Mach number has to be one, M2 = 1.

The higher the entrance stagnation temperature the larger the heat amount that can
be absorbed by the flow. In subsonic branch the Mach number after the shock is

With Mach number of M = 0.47519 the maximum heat transfer requires information

     One of the reason that Rayleigh flow model was invented is to be analyzed the

     flow in a combustion chamber. Consider a flow of air in conduct with a fuel

     Under these assumptions, the maximum fuel air ratio is obtained when the flow is

15.1 Introduction

In Chapter 14 the discussed dealt with one-dimensional and semi one-dimensional flow.
In this Chapter the focus is around the two diminsional effect which focus around the
oblique shock and Prandtl-Meyer flow (in other word it focus around Theodor Meyer's
thesis). This Chapter present a simplified summary of two chapters from the book
"Fundamentals of Compressible Flow" by this author.

15.1.1 Preface to Oblique Shock

In Section 14.5, a discussion on a nor-

mal shock was presented. A normal shock         U1

is a special type of shock wave. An-                U2

shock. In the literature oblique shock, nor-                                       = 0

ferent issues. However, one can view all Fig. 15.1 - A view of a straight normal shock as

flow over a plate with a deflection section.

Clearly, variation of the deflection angle from a zero ( = 0) to a positive value results

in oblique shock (see Figure 15.1). Further changing the deflection angle to a negative

value results in expansion waves. The common representation is done by ignoring the

boundaries of these models. However, this section attempts to show the boundaries

and the limits or connections of these models.

644                       CHAPTER 15. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW 2-DIMENSIONAL

     A normal shock occurs when there is a disturbance downstream which imposes

a boundary condition on the flow in which the fluid/gas can react only by a sharp

change in the flow direction. As it may be recalled, normal shock occurs when a wall is

straight/flat ( = 0) as shown in Figure 15.1 due to disturbance. When the deflection

angle is increased, the gas flow must match the boundary conditions. This matching

can occur only when there is a discontinuity in the flow field. Thus, the direction of the

flow is changed by a shock with an angle to the flow. This shock is commonly referred

to as the oblique shock.

     It has to be pointed out that both the oblique shock and the Prandtl-Meyer

function have a maximum point for M1  . However, the maximum point for the

Prandtl-Meyer function is much larger than the oblique shock by a factor of more than

2. What accounts for the larger maximum point is the effective turning (less entropy

production) which will be explained in the next chapter (see Figure 15.2).

15.2. OBLIQUE SHOCK                                              645

15.2 Oblique Shock

The shock occurs in reality in situations where the shock has three-dimensional effects.
The three-dimensional effects of the shock make it appear as a curved plane. However,
one-dimensional shock can be considered a representation for a chosen arbitrary accu-
racy with a specific small area. In such a case, the change of the orientation makes
the shock considerations two-dimensional. Alternately, using an infinite (or a two-
dimensional) object produces a two-dimensional shock. The two-dimensional effects
occur when the flow is affected from the "side," i.e., the change is in the flow direction.
An example of such case is creation of shock from the side by deflection shown in Figure
15.3.

       To match the boundary conditions, the flow turns after the shock to be parallel
to the inclination angle schematicly shown in Figure 15.3. The deflection angle, ,
is the direction of the flow after the shock (parallel to the wall). The normal shock
analysis dictates that after the shock, the flow is always subsonic. The total flow after
the oblique shock can also be supersonic, which depends on the boundary layer and the
deflection angle.

       The velocity has two components (with respect to the shock plane/surface). Only
the oblique shock's normal component undergoes the "shock." The tangent component
does not change because it does not "move" across the shock line. Hence, the mass
balance reads

                     1 U1n = 2 U2n                               (15.1)

The momentum equation reads                                      (15.2)
                                   P1 + 1 U1n2 = P2 + 2 U2n2

The momentum equation in the tangential direction is reduced to

                             U1t = U2t                           (15.3)

The energy balance in coordinates moving with shock reads

                     CpT1 +  U1n2  = CpT2 +  U2n2                (15.4)

                             2               2

Equations (15.1), (15.2), and (15.4) are the same as the equations for normal shock
with the exception that the total velocity is replaced by the perpendicular components.
Yet, the new relationship between the upstream Mach number, the deflection angle, ,
and the Mach angle,  has to be solved. From the geometry it can be observed that

                             tan  = U1n                          (15.5)

and

646  CHAPTER 15. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW 2-DIMENSIONAL

       Unlike in the normal shock, here there are three possible pairs1 of solutions to

these equations. The first is referred to as the weak shock; the second is the strong
shock; and the third is an impossible solution (thermodynamically)2. Experiments and

experience have shown that the common solution is the weak shock, in which the shock
turns to a lesser extent3.

The above velocity-geometry equations can also be expressed in term of Mach number,
as

     sin  = M1n                                                  (15.8)
               M1

and in the downstream side reads                                 (15.9)
                                           sin( - ) = M2n
                                                             M2

Equation (15.8) alternatively also can be expressed as

     cos  = M1t                                                  (15.10)
                M1

And equation (15.9) alternatively also can be expressed as

     cos ( - ) = M2t                                             (15.11)
                        M2

       The total energy across a stationary oblique shock wave is constant, and it follows
that the total speed of sound is constant across the (oblique) shock. It should be noted
that although, U1t = U2t the Mach number is M1t = M2t because the temperatures
on both sides of the shock are different, T1 = T2.

       As opposed to the normal shock, here angles (the second dimension) have to
be determined. The solution from this set of four equations, (15.8) through (15.11),
is a function of four unknowns of M1, M2, , and . Rearranging this set utilizing
geometrical identities such as sin  = 2 sin  cos  results in

     tan  = 2 cot  M12 (k + cos 2) + 2

    1This issue is due to R. Menikoff, who raised the solution completeness issue.
    2The solution requires solving the entropy conservation equation. The author is not aware of

"simple" proof and a call to find a simple proof is needed.
    3Actually this term is used from historical reasons. The lesser extent angle is the unstable angle

and the weak angle is the middle solution. But because the literature referred to only two roots, the

term lesser extent is used.

       The relationship between the properties can be determined by substituting
M1 sin  for of M1 into the normal shock relationship, which results in

The density and normal velocity ratio can be determined by the following equation

15.2.1 Solution of Mach Angle

Oblique shock, if orientated to a coordinate perpendicular and parallel shock plane is
like a normal shock. Thus, the relationship between the properties can be determined by
using the normal components or by utilizing the normal shock table developed earlier.
One has to be careful to use the normal components of the Mach numbers. The
stagnation temperature contains the total velocity.

       Again, the normal shock is a one-dimensional problem, thus, only one parameter
is required (to solve the problem). Oblique shock is a two-dimensional problem and
two properties must be provided so a solution can be found. Probably, the most useful
properties are upstream Mach number, M1 and the deflection angle, which create a
somewhat complicated mathematical procedure, and this will be discussed later. Other
combinations of properties provide a relatively simple mathematical treatment, and the
solutions of selected pairs and selected relationships will be presented.
648    CHAPTER 15. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW 2-DIMENSIONAL

15.2.1.1 Upstream Mach Number, M1, and Deflection Angle, 

Again, this set of parameters is, perhaps, the most common and natural to examine.
Thompson (1950) has shown that the relationship of the shock angle is obtained from
the following cubic equation:

               Governing Angle Equation           (15.18)
               x3 + a1 x2 + a2 x + a3 = 0

where

                       x = sin2                   (15.19)

and

               M12 + 2 2                          (15.20)
       a1 = -      2 - k sin                      (15.21)
               M1                                 (15.22)

               2M12 + 1 (k + 1)2 k - 1     sin2 
       a2 = - M14 +       4 + M12

                cos2 
       a3 = - M14

       Equation (15.18) requires that x has to be a real and positive number to obtain
a real deflection angle4. Clearly, sin  must be positive, and the negative sign refers to

the mirror image of the solution. Thus, the negative root of sin  must be disregarded
       The solution of a cubic equation such as (15.18) provides three roots5. These

roots can be expressed as

                      First Root                  (15.23)
                        1

               x1 = - 3 a1 + (S + T )

                       Second Root  

       x2 = - a1 - (S + T ) + i 3 (S - T )        (15.24)
               3       2               2

and

                       Third Root   

       x3 = - a1 - (S + T ) - i 3 (S - T )        (15.25)
               3       2               2

    4 This point was pointed out by R. Menikoff. He also suggested that  is bounded by sin-1 1/M1
and 1.

    5The highest power of the equation (only with integer numbers) is the number of the roots. For

example, in a quadratic equation there are two roots.

                     3                    

                     S = R + D,

                     3                    

                     T = R- D                             (15.27)

and where the definition of the D is                      (15.28)
                                             D = Q3 + R2

and where the definitions of Q and R are

                     Q = 3a2 - a12                        (15.29)
                                 9

and

                     R = 9a1a2 - 27a3 - 2a13              (15.30)
                                       54

Only three roots can exist for the Mach angle, . From a mathematical point of view,
if D > 0, one root is real and two roots are complex. For the case D = 0, all the roots
are real and at least two are identical. In the last case where D < 0, all the roots are
real and unequal.

       The physical meaning of the above analysis demonstrates that in the range where
D > 0 no solution can exist because no imaginary solution can exist6. D > 0 occurs
when no shock angle can be found, so that the shock normal component is reduced
to subsonic and yet parallel to the inclination angle. Furthermore, only in some cases
when D = 0 does the solution have a physical meaning. Hence, the solution in the case
of D = 0 has to be examined in the light of other issues to determine the validity of
the solution.

       When D < 0, the three unique roots are reduced to two roots at least for the
steady state because thermodynamics dictates7 that. Physically, it can be shown that
the first solution (15.23), referred sometimes as a thermodynamically unstable root,
which is also related to a decrease in entropy, is "unrealistic." Therefore, the first
solution does not occur in reality, at least, in steady-state situations. This root has
only a mathematical meaning for steady-state analysis8.

    6A call for suggestions, to explain about complex numbers and imaginary numbers should be in-
cluded. Maybe insert an example where imaginary solution results in no physical solution.

    7This situation is somewhat similar to a cubical body rotation. The cubical body has three sym-
metrical axes which the body can rotate around. However, the body will freely rotate only around two
axes with small and large moments of inertia. The body rotation is unstable around the middle axes.
The reader can simply try it.

    8There is no experimental or analytical evidence, that the author has found, showing that it is
totally impossible. The "unstable" terms can be thermodynamically stable in unsteady case. Though,
those who are dealing with rapid transient situations should be aware that this angle of oblique shock
can exist. There is no theoretical evidence that showing that in strong unsteady state this angle is
unstable. The shock will initially for a very brief time transient in it and will jump from this angle to
the thermodynamically stable angles.
650            CHAPTER 15. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW 2-DIMENSIONAL

     These two roots represent

two different situations. First,     Normal
for the second root, the shock       Shock
wave keeps the flow almost all the

time as a supersonic flow and it

is referred to as the weak solu-

tion (there is a small section that

the flow is subsonic). Second, the

third root always turns the flow

into subsonic and it is referred to

as the strong solution. It should

be noted that this case is where

entropy increases in the largest     Fig. 15.4 - Flow around spherically blunted 30 cone-

hand moves the shock angle start-

ing from the deflection angle and

reaching the first angle that satisfies the boundary condition, this situation is unstable

and the shock angle will jump to the second angle (root). If an additional "push" is

given, for example, by additional boundary conditions, the shock angle will jump to

the third root9. These two angles of the strong and weak shock are stable for a two-

dimensional wedge (see the appendix of this chapter for a limited discussion on the

stability10).

15.2.2 When No Oblique Shock Exist or the case of D > 0

15.2.2.1 Large deflection angle for given, M1

The first range is when the deflection angle reaches above the maximum point. For a
given upstream Mach number, M1, a change in the inclination angle requires a larger
energy to change the flow direction. Once, the inclination angle reaches the "maximum
potential energy," a change in the flow direction is no longer possible. As the alternative
view, the fluid "sees" the disturbance (in this case, the wedge) in front of it and hence
the normal shock occurs. Only when the fluid is away from the object (smaller angle)
liquid "sees" the object in a different inclination angle. This different inclination angle
is sometimes referred to as an imaginary angle.

The Simple Calculation Procedure

       For example, in Figure 15.4 and 15.5, the imaginary angle is shown. The flow is
far away from the object and does not "see' the object. For example, for, M1 - 
the maximum deflection angle is calculated when D = Q3 + R2 = 0. This can be done

    9See the discussion on the stability. There are those who view this question not as a stability
equation but rather as under what conditions a strong or a weak shock will prevail.

       Solving equation (15.28) after substituting these values of Q and R provides series

of roots from which only one root is possible. This root, in the case k = 1.4, is just

above  max       (note  that  the  maximum  is  also  a  function  of  the     heat  ratio,  k).

       While the above procedure provides the general solution for the three roots, there

is simplified transformation that provides solution for the strong and weak solution. It

must be noted that in doing this transformation, the first solution is "lost" suppos-
edly because it is "negative." In reality the first solution is not negative but rather
some value between zero and the weak angle. Several researchers11 suggested that
instead Thompson's equation should be expressed by equation (15.18) by tan  and is
transformed into

almost linear function of the upstream Mach number and almost not affected by the
deflection angle.

The Procedure for Calculating The Maximum Deflection Point

       The maximum angle is obtained when D = 0. When the right terms defined in
(15.20)-(15.21), (15.29), and (15.30) are substituted into this equation and utilizing the
trigonometrical identity sin2  + cos2  = 1 and other trigonometrical identities results
in Maximum Deflection Mach Number's equation in which is

M12 (k + 1) (M1n2 + 1) = 2 (k M1n4 + 2 M1n2 - 1)        (15.36)

This equation and its twin equation can be obtained by an alternative procedure pro-
posed by someone12 who suggested another way to approach this issue. It can be
noticed that in equation (15.12), the deflection angle is a function of the Mach an-
gle and the upstream Mach number, M1. Thus, one can conclude that the maximum
Mach angle is only a function of the upstream Much number, M1. This can be shown
mathematically by the argument that differentiating equation (15.12) and equating the
results to zero creates relationship between the Mach number, M1 and the maximum
Mach angle, . Since in that equation there appears only the heat ratio k, and Mach

version by several months was proposed by Bernard Grossman. At this stage, it is not clear who was
the first to propose it.

number, M1, max is a function of only these parameters. The differentiation of the
equation (15.12) yields

     d tan    kM14 sin4  + 2 - (k + 1) M12 M12 sin2  - 1 + (k + 1) M12
                                         2                                 2

Because tan is a monotonous function, the maximum appears when  has its maximum.

The numerator of equation (15.37) is zero at different values of the denominator. Thus,

it is sufficient to equate the numerator to zero to obtain the maximum. The nominator
produces a quadratic equation for sin2  and only the positive value for sin2  is applied
here. Thus, the sin2  is

                     -1 + i k + 1 M12 +     (k + 1) 1 + k - 1 M12 +  k+1 4

                                                                                  (15.38)
     sin2 max =                                     k M12

Equation (15.38) should be referred to as the maximum's equation. It should be noted
that both the Maximum Mach Deflection equation and the maximum's equation lead
to the same conclusion that the maximum M1n is only a function of upstream the
Mach number and the heat ratio k. It can be noticed that the Maximum Deflection
Mach Number's equation is also a quadratic equation for M1n2. Once M1n is found,
then the Mach angle can be easily calculated by equation (15.8). To compare these
two equations the simple case of Maximum for an infinite Mach number is examined.
It must be pointed out that similar procedures can also be proposed (even though it
does not appear in the literature). Instead, taking the derivative with respect to , a
derivative can be taken with respect to M1. Thus,

                                         d tan                                (15.39)
                                                  =0

                                          dM1

and then solving equation (15.39) provides a solution for Mmax.
       A simplified case of the Maximum Deflection Mach Number's equation for large

Mach number becomes

              M1n =  k+1                                                      (15.40)
                      2 k M1 for M1 >> 1

Hence, for large Mach numbers, the Mach angle is sin  =  k+1         (for  k=1.4),  which
makes  = 1.18 or  = 67.79.                                2k

     With the value of  utilizing equation (15.12), the maximum deflection angle can

be computed. Note that this procedure does not require an approximation of M1n to

be made. The general solution of equation (15.36) is

Note that Maximum Deflection Mach Number's equation can be extended to deal with
more complicated equations of state (aside from the perfect gas model).

       This typical example is for those who like mathematics.

Derive the perturbation of Maximum Deflection Mach Number's equation for

the case of a very small upstream Mach number number of the form M1 = 1+ .
Hint, Start with equation (15.36) and neglect all the terms that are relatively

small.

Solution

The solution can be done by substituting (M1 = 1 + ) into equation (15.36) and it
results in

                     Normal Shock Small Values

          M1n =      (k) + 2 + 2 - 3 + k 2 + 2 k + k                       (15.42)

where the epsilon function is

(k) = (k2 + 2k + 1) 4 + (4 k2 + 8 k + 4) 3+                                (15.43)
                   (14 k2 + 12 k - 2) 2 + (20 k2 + 8 k - 12) + 9 (k + 1)2

Now neglecting all the terms with results for the epsilon function in      (15.1.a)
                                             (k)  9 (k + 1)2

And the total operation results in

                     M1n =          3 (k + 1) - 3 + k = 1                  (15.1.b)
                                             4k

Interesting to point out that as a consequence of this assumption the maximum shock
angle,  is a normal shock. However, taking the second term results in different value.
Taking the second term in the explanation results in

M1n =     9 (k + 1)2 + (20 k2 + 8 k - 12) - 3 + k + 2 (1 + k)              (15.1.c)

     Note this equation (15.1.c) produce an un realistic value and additional terms are

     required to obtained to produce a realistic value.

15.2.2.2 The case of D  0 or 0  

The second range in which D > 0 is when  < 0. Thus, first the transition line in
which D = 0 has to be determined. This can be achieved by the standard mathematical
procedure of equating D = 0. The analysis shows regardless of the value of the upstream
Mach number D = 0 when  = 0. This can be partially demonstrated by evaluating
the terms a1, a2, and a3 for the specific value of M1 as following

                                          M12 + 2                               (15.44)

demonstrated by checking several points for example, M1 = 1., 2.0,  and addtional

discussion and proofs can be found in "Fundamentals of Compressible Flow" by this

author.

In the range where   0, the

question is whether it is possible for

an oblique shock to exist? The answer

according to this analysis and stabil-

ity analysis is no. Suppose that there

is a Mach wave at the wall at zero

inclination (see Figure 15.7). Obvi-

ously, another Mach wave occurs af-     1 2 3                        
ter a small distance. But because the

velocity after a Mach wave (even for

an extremely weak shock wave) is re-

duced, thus, the Mach angle will be Fig. 15.7 - The Mach waves that are supposed to be

larger (2 > 1). If the situation      generated at zero inclination.

keeps on occurring over a finite distance, there will be a point where the Mach number

will be 1 and a normal shock will occur, according the common explanation. However,

the reality is that no continuous Mach wave can occur because of the viscosity (bound-

ary layer). In reality, there are imperfections in the wall and in the flow and there is

the question of boundary layer. It is well known, in the engineering world, that there is

no such thing as a perfect wall. The imperfections of the wall can be, for simplicity's

sake, assumed to be as a sinusoidal shape. For such a wall the zero inclination changes

from small positive value to a negative value. If the Mach number is large enough and

the wall is rough enough, there will be points where a weak14 weak will be created.

On the other hand, the boundary layer covers or smooths out the bumps. With these

conflicting mechanisms, both will not allow a situation of zero inclination with emission

of Mach wave. At the very extreme case, only in several points (depending on the

bumps) at the leading edge can a very weak shock occur. Therefore, for the purpose

of an introductory class, no Mach wave at zero inclination should be assumed.

Furthermore, if it was assumed that no boundary layer exists and the wall is

perfect, any deviations from the zero inclination angle creates a jump from a positive

angle (Mach wave) to a negative angle (expansion wave). This theoretical jump occurs

because in a Mach wave the velocity decreases while in the expansion wave the velocity

increases. Furthermore, the increase and the decrease depend on the upstream Mach

number but in different directions. This jump has to be in reality either smoothed out

or has a physical meaning of jump (for example, detach normal shock). The analysis

started by looking at a normal shock which occurs when there is a zero inclination.

After analysis of the oblique shock, the same conclusion must be reached, i.e. that the

normal shock can occur at zero inclination. The analysis of the oblique shock suggests

that the inclination angle is not the source (boundary condition) that creates the shock.

There must be another boundary condition(s) that causes the normal shock. In the light

   14It is not a mistake, there are two "weaks." These words mean two different things. The first
"weak" means more of compression "line" while the other means the weak shock.
658            CHAPTER 15. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW 2-DIMENSIONAL

of this discussion, at least for a simple engineering analysis, the zone in the proximity
of zero inclination (small positive and negative inclination angle) should be viewed
as a zone without any change unless the boundary conditions cause a normal shock.
Nevertheless, emission of Mach wave can occur in other situations. The approximation
of weak weak wave with nonzero strength has engineering applicability in a very limited
cases, especially in acoustic engineering, but for most cases it should be ignored.

15.2.2.3 Upstream Mach Number, M1, and Shock Angle,

and a unique solution exists. The deflection angle can be expressed as a function of
these variables as

 Even though the solution for these variables, M1 and , is unique, the possible range
deflection angle, , is limited. Examining equation (15.48) shows that the shock angle,
 , has to be in the range of sin-1(1/M1)    (/2) (see Figure 15.8). The range
of given , upstream Mach number M1, is limited between  and 1/ sin2 .

15.2.2.4 Given Two Angles,  and 

It is sometimes useful to obtain a relationship where the two angles are known. The
first upstream Mach number, M1 is

                        M12 =       2 (cot  + tan )        (15.56)

                               sin 2 - (tan ) (k + cos 2)

The reduced pressure difference is

                        2 (P2 - P1) = 2 sin  sin           (15.57)
                               U2         cos( - )

The reduced density is

                        2 - 1 = sin                        (15.58)
                               2    sin  cos( - )

       For a large upstream Mach number M1 and a small shock angle (yet not ap-
proaching zero), , the deflection angle,  must also be small as well. Equation (15.48)
can be simplified into

                                     k+1                   (15.59)

                                       2

The results are consistent with the initial assumption which shows that it was an ap-
propriate assumption.

     Example 15.2: Wedge Mach Number                     Level: Intermediate

     In Figure 15.9 exhibits wedge in a supersonic flow with unknown Mach number.

     Examination of the Figure reveals that it is in angle of attack. 1) Calculate the

     Mach number assuming that the lower and the upper Mach angles are identical
     and equal to  30 each (no angle of attack). 2) Calculate the Mach number

     and angle of attack assuming that the pressure after the shock for the two

     oblique shocks is equal. 3) What kind are the shocks exhibits in the image?

     (strong, weak, unsteady) 4) (Open question) Is there possibility to estimate the

     air stagnation temperature from the information provided in the image. You

     can assume that specific heats, k is a monotonic increasing function of the

     temperature.

The Mach angle and deflection angle can be obtained from the Figure 15.9. With this
data and either using equation (15.56) or potto-GDC results in

The actual Mach number after the shock is then                        (15.2.a)

The flow after the shock is subsonic flow.

From the last table, it is clear that Mach number is between the two values of 2.9168
and 2.6810 and the pressure ratio is between 0.96549 and 0.97172. One of procedure

     Mach number between the extreme values.

     Part (3)
     The shock must be weak shock because the shock angle is less than 60.

15.2.2.6 Close and Far Views of the Oblique Shock

In many cases, the close proximity view pro-

vides a continuous turning of the deflection

angle, . Yet, the far view shows a sharp

transition. The traditional approach to recon-

cile these two views is by suggesting that the                              

far view shock is a collection of many small

weak shocks (see Figure 15.10). At the lo-                                    

cal view close to the wall, the oblique shock

is a weak "weak oblique" shock. From the far

view, the oblique shock is an accumulation of

many small (or again weak) "weak shocks." Fig. 15.10 - A local and a far view of the

cumulate into a large and abrupt change (shock). In this theory, the boundary layer

(B.L.) does not enter into the calculation. In reality, the boundary layer increases the

zone where a continuous flow exists. The boundary layer reduces the upstream flow

velocity and therefore the shock does not exist at close proximity to the wall. In larger

distance from the wall, the shock becomes possible.

       It must be noted that the calculations are for the perfect gas model. In some cases,
this assumption might not be sufficient and different analysis is needed. Henderson
and Menikoff15 suggested a procedure to calculate the maximum deflection angle for
arbitrary equation of state16.

   15Henderson and Menikoff "Triple Shock Entropy Theorem" Journal of Fluid Mechanics 366 (1998)

   16The effect of the equation of state on the maximum and other parameters at this state is unknown
at this moment and there are more works underway.
664                   CHAPTER 15. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW 2-DIMENSIONAL

       When the mathematical quantity D becomes positive, for large deflection angle,
there isn't a physical solution to an oblique shock. Since the flow "sees" the obstacle,
the only possible reaction is by a normal shock which occurs at some distance from the
body. This shock is referred to as the detach shock. The detached shock's distance
from the body is a complex analysis and should be left to graduate class and researchers
in this area.

15.2.2.8 Oblique Shock Examples

     Example 15.3: Max Angle for Oblique                  Level: Simple

     Air flows at Mach number (M1) or Mx = 4 is approaching a wedge. What is
     the maximum wedge angle at which the oblique shock can occur? If the wedge
     angle is 20, calculate the weak, the strong Mach numbers, and the respective

     shock angles.

     Solution

     The maximum wedge angle for (Mx = 4) D has to be equal to zero. The wedge angle
     that satisfies this requirement is by equation (15.28) (a side to the case proximity of
      = 0). The maximum values are:

                Mx              My        max      max
               4.000           0.97234  38.7738  66.0407

     To obtain the results of the weak and the strong solutions either utilize the equation
     (15.28) or the GDC which yields the following results

      Mx               My s    My w       s        w

Fig. 15.11 - Oblique shock occurs around a cone. This photo is courtesy of Dr. Grig-

     ory Toker, a Research Professor at Cuernavaco University of Mexico. According to his
     measurement, the cone half angle is 15 and the Mach number is 2.2.

Example 15.4: Is Weak or Strong                                  Level: Simple

A cone shown in Figure 15.11 is exposed to supersonic flow and create an
oblique shock. Is the shock shown in the photo weak or strong shock? Explain.
Using the geometry provided in the photo, predict at which Mach number was
the photo taken based on the assumption that the cone is a wedge.

Solution

The measurements show that cone angle is 14.43 and the shock angle is 30.099.
With given two angles the solution can be obtained by utilizing equation (15.56) or
the Potto-GDC.

Because the flow is around the cone it must be a weak shock. Even if the cone was a
wedge, the shock would be weak because the maximum (transition to a strong shock)
occurs at about 60. Note that the Mach number is larger than the one predicted by
the wedge.

design, the flow can be brought to a subsonic flow just below M = 1. In such a case,
there is less entropy production (less pressure loss). To illustrate the design significance
of the oblique shock, the following example is provided.

   17In fact, there is general proof that regardless to the equation of state (any kind of gas), the entropy
is to be minimized through a series of oblique shocks rather than through a single normal shock. For
details see Henderson and Menikoff "Triple Shock Entropy Theorem," Journal of Fluid Mechanics 366,

     An oblique shock is not possible and normal shock occurs. In such a case, the results

     are:

            Mx       My         Ty                y       Py          P0 y

     With two weak shock waves and a normal shock the total pressure loss is

                   P04 = P04 P03 P02 = 0.98903  0.96524  0.99445 = 0.9496
                   P01 P03 P02 P01

     The static pressure ratio for the second case is

                         P4 = P4 P3 P2 = 1.6116  1.2626  1.285 = 2.6147
                         P1 P3 P2 P1

     The loss in this case is much less than in a direct normal shock. In fact, the loss in
     the normal shock is above than 31% of the total pressure.

         aThe results in this example are obtained using the graphical interface of POTTO-GDC
     thus, no input explanation is given. In the past the input file was given but the graphical
     interface it is no longer needed.

     Example 15.6: Supersonic Wedge                                Level: Simple

     A supersonic flow is approaching a very         A Myw
     long two-dimensional bland wedge body
     and creates a detached shock at Mach                             10

     Solution

     The detached shock is a normal shock and the results are

     Now utilizing the isentropic relationship for k = 1.4 yields

                                                                          End of Ex. 15.6

Thus the area ratio has to be 1.4458. Note that the pressure after the weak shock is
irrelevant to the area ratio between the normal shock and the "throat" according to
the standard nozzle analysis.

Solution

The shock BD is an oblique shock with a response to a total turn of 6. The conditions
for this shock are:

 Mx      My s        My w                  s  w                                     P0 y

                                                                                 0.99105

The transition for shock AB is

 Mx      My s        My w                  s  w                                     P0 y

                                                                                 0.99879

For the shock BC the results are

 Mx      My s        My w                  s  w                                     P0 y

And the isentropic relationships for M = 2.7049, 2.7008 are

                                                                       End of Ex. 15.7

     2.7008 0.40669 0.10548 3.1854 0.04290 0.13665

     The combined shocks AB and BC provide the base of calculating the total pressure
     ratio at zone 3. The total pressure ratio at zone 2 is

                         P02 = P02 P01 = 0.99894  0.99879 = 0.997731283
                         P00 P01 P00
     On the other hand, the pressure at 4 has to be

                          P4 = P4 P04 = 0.04290  0.99105 = 0.042516045
                         P01 P04 P01
     The static pressure at zone 4 and zone 3 have to match according to the government
     suggestion hence, the angle for BE shock which cause this pressure ratio needs to be
     found. To do that, check whether the pressure at 2 is above or below or above the
     pressure (ratio) in zone 4.

                       P2 = P02 P2 = 0.997731283  0.04263 = 0.042436789
                      P02 P00 P02
     Since PP022 < PP041 a weak shock must occur to increase the static pressure (see Figure
     14.13). The increase has to be

                          P3/P2 = 0.042516045/0.042436789 = 1.001867743

      To achieve this kind of pressure ratio the perpendicular component has to be

      Mx       My         Ty           y       Py                         P0 y
     1.0008  0.99920      Tx           x       Px                         P0 x

     The shock angle,  can be calculated from
                                 = sin-1 1.0008/2.7049 = 21.715320879

      The deflection angle for such shock angle with Mach number is

      Mx     My s     My w      s      w       P0y
     2.7049                  0.0   21.72
             0.49525 2.7037                                      P0 x

                                           0.026233 1.00000

     From the last calculation it is clear that the government proposed schematic of the

     double wedge is in conflict with the boundary condition. The flow in zone 3 will flow
     into the wall in about 2.7. In reality the flow of double wedge will produce a curved

     shock surface with several zones. Only when the flow is far away from the double
     wedge, the flow behaves as only one theoretical angle of 6 exist.

Example 15.8: Deflection Angle                             Level: Intermediate

Calculate the flow deflection angle and other parameters downstream when the
Mach angle is 34 and P1 = 3[bar], T1 = 27C, and U1 = 1000m/sec. Assume
k = 1.4 and R = 287J/KgK.

Solution

The Mach angle of 34 is below maximum deflection which means that it is a weak
shock. Yet, the Upstream Mach number, M1, has to be determined

                    M1 =  U1 =             1000       = 2.88            (15.8.a)

                               k R T 1.4  287  300

Using this Mach number and the Mach deflection in either using the Table or the
figure or POTTO-GDC results in

The relationship for the temperature and pressure can be obtained by using equation
(15.15) and (15.13) or simply converting the M1 to perpendicular component.

                    M1n = M1 sin  = 2.88 sin(34.0) = 1.61               (15.8.b)

From the Table (??) or GDC the following can be obtained.

The temperature ratio combined upstream temperature yield

                          T2 = 1.3949  300  418.5K                     (15.8.c)

and the same for the pressure                                           (15.8.e)

     Example 15.10: Maximum Pressure Ratio                  Level: Simple

     What is the maximum pressure ratio that can be obtained on wedge when the
     gas is flowing in 2.5 Mach without any close boundaries? Would it make any
     difference if the wedge was flowing into the air? If so, what is the difference?

     Solution

     It has to be recognized that without any other boundary condition, the shock is weak
     shock. For a weak shock the maximum pressure ratio is obtained at the deflection
     point because it is closest to a normal shock. To obtain the maximum point for 2.5
     Mach number, either use the Maximum Deflection Mach number's equation or the
     Potto-GDC

     In these calculations, Maximum Deflection Mach's equation was used to calculate the

     normal component of the upstream, then the Mach angle was calculated using the
     geometrical relationship of  = sin-1 M1n/M1. With these two quantities, utilizing
     equation (15.12) the deflection angle, , is obtained.

Solution

This kind of problem is essentially two wedges placed in a certain geometry. It is clear
that the flow must be parallel to the wall. For the first shock, the upstream Mach
number is known together with deflection angle. Utilizing the table or the Potto-GDC,
the following can be obtained:

The conditions in zone 4 and zone 3 have two things that are equal. They are the

pressure and the velocity direction. It has to be noticed that the velocity magnitudes

in zone 3 and 4 do not have to be equal. This non-continuous velocity profile can

occur in our model because it is assumed that fluid is non-viscous.

If the two sides were equal because of symmetry the slip angle is also zero. It is to say,

for the analysis, that only one deflection angle exist. For the two different deflection

angles, the slip angle has two extreme cases. The first case is where match lower

deflection angle and second is to match the higher deflection angle. In this case, it is

assumed that the slip angle moves half of the angle to satisfy both of the deflection

angles (first approximation). Under this assumption the conditions in zone 3 are solved
by looking at the deflection angle of 12 + 1.5 = 13.5 which results in

To reduce the pressure ratio the deflection angle has to be reduced (remember that
at weak weak shock almost no pressure change). Thus, the pressure at zone 3 has to
be reduced. To reduce the pressure the angle of slip plane has to increase from 1.5
to a larger number.

     Example 15.15: Entropy Order                                 Level: Advance

     The previous example gave rise to another question on the order of the deflection

     angles. Consider the same values as previous analysis, will the oblique shock with
     first angle of 15 and then 12 or opposite order make a difference (M = 5)?

     If not, what order will make a bigger entropy production or pressure loss? (No

     general proof is needed).

are bended. There two main points that

should be discussed in this context are the additional effects and infinite/final structure.

The additional effects are the mass start to have a vertical component. The vertical

component one hand increase the energy needed and thus increase need to move the

body (larger shock drag) (note the there is a zero momentum net change for symmetri-

cal bodies.). However, the oblique shock reduces the normal component that undergoes

the shock and hence the total shock drag is reduced. The oblique shock creates a finite

amount of drag (momentum and energy lost) while a normal shock as indirectly implied

in the common explanation creates de facto situation where the shock grows to be

infinite which of course impossible. It should be noted that, oblique shock becomes less

"oblique" and more parallel when other effects start to kick in.

As opposed to the oblique shock, there is no limitation for the Prandtl-Meyer function

to approach zero. Yet, for very small angles, because of imperfections of the wall and

the boundary layer, it has to be assumed to be insignificant.

A Mach line results because of a small disturbance in the wall contour. This Mach line
is assumed to be a result of the positive angle. The reason that a "negative" angle is
not applicable is that the coalescing of the small Mach wave which results in a shock
wave. However, no shock is created from many small positive angles.

       The Mach line is the chief line in the analysis because of the wall contour shape
information propagates along this line. Once the contour is changed, the flow direction
will change to fit the wall. This direction change results in a change of the flow
properties, and it is assumed here to be isotropic for a positive angle. This assumption,
as it turns out, is close to reality. In this chapter, a discussion on the relationship
between the flow properties and the flow direction is presented.

Later, this assumption will be examined.

The typical simplifications for geometrical functions are used:

      d  sin(d);                                                            (15.62)
cos(d)  1

These simplifications are the core reasons why the change occurs only in the perpen-
dicular direction (d << 1). The change of the velocity in the flow direction, dx
is

dx = (U + dU ) cos  - U = dU                                                (15.63)

In the same manner, the velocity perpendicular to the flow, dy, is

dy = (U + dU ) sin(d) = U d                                                 (15.64)

The tan  is the ratio of dy/dx (see Figure (15.23))

           dx dU                                                            (15.65)
tan  = =

The ratio dU/U was shown to be

explanation is provided. It must be recog-                         
nized that here the cylindrical coordinates
are advantageous because the flow turns
around a single point.

       For this coordinate system, the mass
conservation can be written as

      ( r Ur) +  ( U) = 0  (15.69)
     r

The momentum equations are expressed as based on the mathematical description.

            Ur U Ur U2                           1 P     c2              (15.70)

and

            U U U UUr                        =-  1 P         c2          (15.71)
        Ur    +            -                             =-
            r r               r                  r           r  

If the assumption is that the flow isn't a function of the radius, r, then all the derivatives
with respect to the radius will vanish. One has to remember that when r enters to the
function, like the first term in the mass equation, the derivative isn't zero. Hence, the
mass equation is reduced to

                                          Ur +  (U) = 0                  (15.72)
                                                      

Equation (15.72) can be rearranged as transformed into

                    1      Ur + U                 1                      (15.73)

Substituting  the  term  1   from  equation  (15.73)  into  equation  (15.75)  results  in
                          

                         U   U     - Ur =       c2    Ur +  U                           (15.76)

                                                U           

or

                         U2 Ur + U           = c2 Ur + U                                (15.77)
                                                              

And an additional rearrangement results in

                             c2 - U2         Ur + U = 0                                 (15.78)
                                                     

From equation (15.78) it follows that

                                       U = c                                            (15.79)

It is remarkable that the tangential velocity at every turn is at the speed of sound!
It must be pointed out that the total velocity isn't at the speed of sound, but only
the tangential component. In fact, based on the definition of the Mach angle, the
component shown in Figure (15.23) under Uy is equal to the speed of sound, M = 1.

       After some additional rearrangement, equation (15.74) becomes

                                   U Ur - U = 0                                         (15.80)
                                   r 

If r isn't approaching infinity,  and since U = 0 leads to

                                       Ur = U                                           (15.81)
                                       

In the literature, these results are associated with the characteristic line. This analysis
can be also applied to the same equation when they are normalized by Mach number.
However, the non-dimensionalization can be applied at this stage as well.

     The energy equation for any point on a stream line is

                                           k

and substituting this equality, equation (15.83), into equation (15.82) results in

            c2          U2 + Ur2                                        (15.84)
         k - 1 + 2 = h0

Utilizing equation (15.79) for the speed of sound and substituting equation (15.81)
which is the radial velocity transforms equation (15.84) into

         Ur 2                           Ur + Ur2 2                      (15.85)

                                              2

After some rearrangement, equation (15.85) becomes

         k+1         Ur + Ur2 2 = 2h0                                   (15.86)
         k-1         

Note that Ur must be positive. The solution of the differential equation (15.86) incor-
porating the constant becomes

         Ur =        2h0 sin               k-1                          (15.87)
                                           k+1

which satisfies equation (15.86) because sin2  + cos2  = 1. The arbitrary constant in
equation (15.87) is chosen such that Ur( = 0) = 0. The tangential velocity obtains
the form

     U = c = Ur =       k-1                                     k-1     (15.88)

15.3. PRANDTL-MEYER FUNCTION                                    685

Now utilizing the expression that was obtained for Ur and U equations (15.88) and
(15.87) results for the Mach number is

        M 2 = 1 + k + 1 tan2  k - 1                             (15.90)
                                 k-1               k+1

or the reverse function for  is

         = k + 1 tan-1                k - 1 M2 - 1              (15.91)
                k-1                   k+1

       What happens when the upstream Mach number is not 1? That is when the
initial condition for the turning angle doesn't start with M = 1 but is already at a
different angle. The upstream Mach number is denoted in this segment as Mstarting.
For this upstream Mach number (see Figure (15.22))

                                 tan  = Mstarting2 - 1          (15.92)

The deflection angle , has to match to the definition of the angle that is chosen here
( = 0 when M = 1), so

        (M ) = (M ) - (Mstarting)                               (15.93)

                                 Deflection Angle

(M ) =  k + 1 tan-1              k - 1 M 2 - 1 - tan-1  M2 - 1  (15.94)
        k-1                      k+1

These relationships are plotted in Figure 15.26.

15.3.4 Comparison And Limitations between the Two Ap-
           proaches

The two models produce exactly the same results, but the assumptions for the construc-
tion of these models are different. In the geometrical model, the assumption is that the
velocity change in the radial direction is zero. In the rigorous model, it was assumed
that radial velocity is only a function of . The statement for the construction of the
geometrical model can be improved by assuming that the frame of reference is moving
radially in a constant velocity.

       Regardless of the assumptions that were used in the construction of these models,
the fact remains that there is a radial velocity at Ur(r = 0) = constant. At this point
(r = 0) these models fail to satisfy the boundary conditions and something else happens
there. On top of the complication of the turning point, the question of boundary layer
686            CHAPTER 15. COMPRESSIBLE FLOW 2-DIMENSIONAL

arises. For example, how did the gas accelerate to above the speed of sound when
there is no nozzle (where is the nozzle?)? These questions are of interest in engineering
but are beyond the scope of this book (at least at this stage). Normally, the author
recommends that this function be used everywhere beyond 2-4 the thickness of the
boundary layer based on the upstream length.

       In fact, analysis of design commonly used in the industry and even questions
posted to students show that many assume that the turning point can be sharp. At a
small Mach number, (1 + ) the radial velocity is small . However, an increase in the
Mach number can result in a very significant radial velocity. The radial velocity is "fed"
through the reduction of the density. Aside from its close proximity to turning point,
mass balance is maintained by the reduction of the density. Thus, some researchers
recommend that, in many instances, the sharp point should be replaced by a smoother
transition.

15.4 The Maximum Turning Angle                            slip line turning Maximum

The maximum turning angle is obtained when the
starting Mach number is 1 and the end Mach num-
ber approaches infinity. In this case, Prandtl-Meyer
function becomes

     Maximum Turning Angle

      = 2             -1                                   Meyer function when it exceeds the

               k-1

       The maximum of the deflection point and the
maximum turning point are only a function of the specific heat ratios. However, the
maximum turning angle is much larger than the maximum deflection point because the
process is isentropic.

       What happens when the deflection angel exceeds the maximum angle? The flow
in this case behaves as if there is almost a maximum angle and in that region beyond
the flow will became vortex street see Figure 15.25

15.6 d'Alembert's Paradox                                                     3

In ideal inviscid incompressible flows, the move-  1                       2
ment of body does not encounter any resistance.
This result is known as d'Alembert's Paradox,                                               4
and this paradox is examined here.
                                                                       1 W2

 D = 2 2 (P2 - P4) = w (P2 - P4) (15.97)

                                                        d'Alembert's Paradox.

       It can be observed that only the area that "seems" to be by the flow was used

in expressing equation (15.97). The relation between P2 and P4 is such that the flow
depends on the upstream Mach number, M1, and the specific heat, k. Regardless in the
equation of the state of the gas, the pressure at zone 2, P2, is larger than the pressure
at zone 4, P4. Thus, there is always drag when the flow is supersonic which depends on
the upstream Mach number, M1, specific heat, k, and the "visible" area of the object.
This drag is known in the literature as (shock) wave drag.

Previously, the thickness of a body was shown to

have a drag. Now, a body with zero thickness but                                                                      e

posed to the thickness of the body, in addition to
the drag, the body also obtains lift. Again, the                                                                          Slip plane

slip condition is such that the pressure in region 5                                                                           6

and 7 are the same, and additionally the direction

of the velocity must be the same. As before, the Fig. 15.28 - The definition of attack

     k = 1.4.

     Solution

     First, the initial Mach number has to be calculated (the initial speed of sound).

                                                                                                                      (15.16.a)

                  c = k R T = 1.4  287  293 = 343.1m/sec

     The Mach number is then  M = 450 = 1.31
                                     343.1
                                                                                                                      (15.16.b)

Note that the compression "fan" stream lines are note and their function can be

The Mach number is determined by satisfying the condition that the pressure down-

by the relationship

                      0.28418               0.60365  0.47077

With this pressure ratio P = 0.2619 require either locking in the table or using the
enclosed program.

For the rest of the calculation the initial condition is used. The Mach number after
the bend is M = 1.4576. It should be noted that specific heat isn't k = 1.4 but
k = 1.67. The bend angle is

              = 9.1719 - 7.7720  1.4                          (15.17.b)

              = 55.5479 - 54.4623 = 1.0                      (15.17.c)

     15.31. The flow is choked and additionally the flow pressure reaches the nozzle

     exit above the surrounding pres-

     throat area ratio is 1.4. The stag-

     nation pressure is 1000 [kPa]. The                       Slip lines        expenssion

     ter the expansion.

     Solution

     The Mach number a the nozzle exit can be calculated using Potto-GDC which provides

       M     T                             A              P   AP            F
     1.7285
             T0       0                    A              P0  A P0          F

     Thus, the exit Mach number is 1.7285 and the pressure at the exit is

     Pexit = P0 Pexit = 1000  0.20096 = 200.96[kP a]                           (15.19.a)
                    P0

     This pressure is higher than the surroundings pressure and an expansion must occur.
     This pressure ratio is associated with a expansion angle that Potto-GDC provide as

       M                     P                           T                        
     1.7285  20.0641        P0                          T0        0          59.9491

                        0.20097                     0.69053   0.29104

     The final pressure ratio ultimately has to be

                      Psurroundings = 100 = .1                                  (15.19.b)
                         P0                         1000

     Hence the information for this pressure ratio can be provided by Potto-GDC as

       M                     P                           T

                        0.10000                     0.51795   0.19307

The pressure at this point is as the surroundings. However, the stagnation pressure is
the same as originally was enter the nozzle! This stagnation pressure has to go through
serious of oblique shocks and Prandtl-Meyer expansion to match the surroundings

16.1 Introduction

Traditionally, the topic of multi-phase flow is ignored in an introductory class on fluid
mechanics. For many engineers, this class will be the only opportunity to be exposed
to this topic. The knowledge in this topic without any doubts, is required for many
engineering problems. Calculations of many kinds of flow deals with more than one
phase or material flow1.The author believes that the trends and effects of multiphase
flow could and should be introduced and considered by engineers. In the past, books on
multiphase flow were written more as a literature review or heavy on the mathematics.
It is recognized that multiphase flow is still evolving. In fact, there is not a consensus to
the exact map of many flow regimes. This book attempts to describe these issues as a
fundamentals of physical aspects and less as a literature review. This chapter provides
information that is more or less in consensus2. Additionally, the nature of multiphase
flow requires solving many equations. Thus, in many books the representations is by
writing the whole set governing equations. Here, it is believed that the interactions/-
calculations requires a full year class and hence, only the trends and simple calculations
are described.

    1An example, there was a Ph.D. working for the government who analyzed filing cavity with liquid
metal (aluminum), who did not consider the flow as two-phase flow and ignoring the air. As result,
his analysis is in the twilight zone not in the real world.

    2Or when the scientific principles simply dictate.

698           CHAPTER 16. MULTI-PHASE FLOW

16.2 History

The study of multi-phase flow started for practical purposes after World War II. Initially
the models were using simple assumptions. For simple models,there are two possibilities
(1) the fluids/materials are flowing in well homogeneous mixed (where the main problem
to find the viscosity), (2) the fluids/materials are flowing separately where the actual
total loss pressure can be correlated based on the separate pressure loss of each of
the material. If the pressure loss was linear then the total loss will be the summation
of the two pressure losses (of the lighter liquid (gas) and the heavy liquid). Under
this assumption the total is not linear and experimental correlation was made. The flow
patterns or regimes were not considered. This was suggested by Lockhart and Martinelli
who use a model where the flow of the two fluids are independent of each other. They
postulate that there is a relationship between the pressure loss of a single phase and
combine phases pressure loss as a function of the pressure loss of the other phase. It
turned out this idea provides a good crude results in some cases.

       Researchers that followed Lockhart and Martinelli looked for a different map for
different combination of phases. When it became apparent that specific models were
needed for different situations, researchers started to look for different flow regimes
and provided different models. Also the researchers looked at the situation when the
different regimes are applicable. Which leads to the concept of flow regime maps. Taitle
and Duckler suggested a map based on five dimensionless groups which are considered
as the most useful today. However, Taitle and Duckler's map is not universal and it is
only applied to certain liquid-gas conditions. For example, Taitle-Duckler's map is not
applicable for microgravity.

16.3 What to Expect From This Chapter

As oppose to the tradition of the other chapters in this book and all other Potto project
books, a description of what to expect in this chapter is provided. It is an attempt
to explain and convince all the readers that the multi-phase flow must be included
in introductory class on fluid mechanics3. Hence, this chapter will explain the core
concepts of the multiphase flow and their relationship, and importance to real world.

       This chapter will provide: a category of combination of phases, the concept of
flow regimes, multi-phase flow parameters definitions, flow parameters effects on the
flow regimes, partial discussion on speed of sound of different regimes, double chok-
ing phenomenon (hopefully), and calculation of pressure drop of simple homogeneous
model. This chapter will introduce these concepts so that the engineer not only be able
to understand a conversation on multi-phase but also, and more importantly, will know
and understand the trends. However, this chapter will not provide a discussion of tran-
sient problems, phase change or transfer processes during flow, and actual calculation

    3This author feels that he is in an unique position to influence many in the field of fluid mechanics.
This fact is due to the shear number of the downloaded Potto books. The number of the downloads
of the book on Fundamental of compressible flow has exceed more than 100,000 in about two and half
years. It also provides an opportunity to bring the latest advances in the fields since this author does
not need to "sell" the book to a publisher or convince a "committee."

16.4 Classification of Multi-Phase Flow

All the flows are a form of multiphase flow. The discussion in the previous chapters is
only as approximation when multiphase can be "reduced" into a single phase flow. For
example, consider air flow that was discussed and presented earlier as a single phase
flow. Air is not a pure material but a mixture of many gases. In fact, many proprieties
of air are calculated as if the air is made of well mixed gases of Nitrogen and Oxygen.
The results of the calculations of a mixture do not change much if it is assumed that the
air flow as stratified flow4 of many concentration layers (thus, many layers (infinite) of
different materials). Practically for many cases, the homogeneous assumption is enough
and suitable. However, this assumption will not be appropriate when the air is stratified
because of large body forces, or a large acceleration. Adopting this assumption might
lead to a larger error. Hence, there are situations when air flow has to be considered as
multiphase flow and this effect has to be taken into account.

       In our calculation, it is assumed that air is made of only gases. The creation
of clean room is a proof that air contains small particles. In almost all situations, the

tration between the top to button is insignificant, nonetheless it exists.
700  CHAPTER 16. MULTI-PHASE FLOW

cleanness of the air or the fact that air is a mixture is ignored. The engineering accuracy
is enough to totally ignore it. Yet, there are situations where cleanness of the air can
affect the flow. For example, the cleanness of air can reduce the speed of sound. In
the past, the breaks in long trains were activated by reduction of the compressed line
(a patent no. 360070 issued to George Westinghouse, Jr., March 29, 1887). In a four
(4) miles long train, the breaks would started to work after about 20 seconds in the last
wagon. Thus, a 10% change of the speed of sound due to dust particles in air could
reduce the stopping time by 2 seconds (50 meter difference in stopping) and can cause
an accident.

       One way to categorize the multiphase is by the materials flows. For example, the
flow of oil and water in one pipe is a multiphase flow. This flow is used by engineers
to reduce the cost of moving crude oil through a long pipes system. The "average"
viscosity is meaningless since in many cases the water follows around the oil. The
water flow is the source of the friction. However, it is more common to categorize
the flow by the distinct phases that flow in the tube. Since there are three phases,
they can be solid-liquid, solid-gas, liquid-gas and solid-liquid-gas flow. This notion
eliminates many other flow categories that can and should be included in multiphase
flow. This category should include any distinction of phase/material. There are many
more categories, for example, sand and grain (which are "solids") flow with rocks and
is referred to solid-solid flow. The category of liquid-gas should be really viewed as the
extreme case of liquid-liquid where the density ratio is extremely large. The same can
be said for gas-gas flow. For the gas, the density is a strong function of the temperature
and pressure. Open Channel flow is, although important, is only an extreme case of
liquid-gas flow and is a sub category of the multiphase flow.

       The multiphase is an important part of many processes. The multiphase can
be found in nature, living bodies (bio-fluids), and industries. Gas-solid can be found
in sand storms, and avalanches. The body inhales solid particle with breathing air.
Many industries are involved with this flow category such as dust collection, fluidized
bed, solid propellant rocket, paint spray, spray casting, plasma and river flow with live
creatures (small organisms to large fish) flow of ice berg, mud flow etc. The liquid-solid,
in nature can be blood flow, and river flow. This flow also appears in any industrial
process that are involved in solidification (for example die casting) and in moving solid
particles. Liquid-liquid flow is probably the most common flow in the nature. Flow of
air is actually the flow of several light liquids (gases). Many natural phenomenon are
multiphase flow, for an example, rain. Many industrial process also include liquid-liquid
such as painting, hydraulic with two or more kind of liquids.

16.5 Classification of Liquid-Liquid Flow Regimes

The general discussion on liquid-liquid will be provided and the gas-liquid flow will
be discussed as a special case. Generally, there are two possibilities for two different
materials to flow (it is also correct for solid-liquid and any other combination). The
materials can flow in the same direction and it is referred as co-current flow. When the
materials flow in the opposite direction, it is referred as counter-current. In general,
16.5. CLASSIFICATION OF LIQUID-LIQUID FLOW REGIMES               701

the co-current is the more common. Additionally, the counter-current flow must have
special configurations of long length of flow. Generally, the counter-current flow has a
limited length window of possibility in a vertical flow in conduits with the exception of
magnetohydrodynamics. The flow regimes are referred to the arrangement of the fluids.

       The main difference between the liquid-liquid flow to gas-liquid flow is that gas
density is extremely lighter than the liquid density. For example, water and air flow as
oppose to water and oil flow. The other characteristic that is different between the gas
flow and the liquid flow is the variation of the density. For example, a reduction of the
pressure by half will double the gas volumetric flow rate while the change in the liquid
is negligible. Thus, the flow of gas-liquid can have several flow regimes in one situation
while the flow of liquid-liquid will (probably) have only one flow regime.

16.5.1 Co-Current Flow

In Co-Current flow, two liquids can have three main categories: vertical, horizontal,
and what ever between them. The vertical configuration has two cases, up or down.
It is common to differentiate between the vertical (and near vertical) and horizontal
(and near horizontal). There is no exact meaning to the word "near vertical" or "near
horizontal" and there is no consensus on the limiting angles (not to mention to have
limits as a function with any parameter that determine the limiting angle). The flow
in inclined angle (that not covered by the word "near") exhibits flow regimes not much
different from the other two. Yet, the limits between the flow regimes are considerably
different. This issue of incline flow will not be covered in this chapter.

16.5.1.1 Horizontal Flow

The typical regimes for horizontal flow

are stratified flow (open channel flow,            Light Liquid
and non open channel flow), dispersed

bubble flow, plug flow, and annular flow.          Heavy Liquid

For low velocity (low flow rate) of the

two liquids, the heavy liquid flows on the  Fig. 16.2 - Stratified flow in horizontal tubes when

bottom and lighter liquid flows on the
top5 as depicted in Figure 16.2. This

kind of flow regime is referred to as horizontal flow. When the flow rate of the lighter

liquid is almost zero, the flow is referred to as open channel flow. This definition (open

channel flow) continues for small amount of lighter liquid as long as the heavier flow can

be calculated as open channel flow (ignoring the lighter liquid). The geometries (even

the boundaries) of open channel flow are very diverse. Open channel flow appears in

many nature (river) as well in industrial process such as the die casting process where

liquid metal is injected into a cylinder (tube) shape. The channel flow will be discussed

in a greater detail in Open Channel Flow chapter.

    5With the exception of the extremely smaller diameter where Rayleigh-Taylor instability is an im-
portant issue.
702                                           CHAPTER 16. MULTI-PHASE FLOW

     As the lighter liquid (or the gas phase) flow rate increases (superficial velocity),

the friction between the phases increase. The superficial velocity is referred to as the

velocity that any phase will have if the other phase was not exist. This friction is one of

the cause for the instability which manifested itself as waves and changing the surface

from straight line to a different configuration (see Figure 16.3). The wave shape is

created to keep the gas and the liquid velocity equal and at the same time to have

shear stress to be balance by surface tension. The configuration of the cross section

not only depend on the surface tension, and other physical properties of the fluids but

also on the material of the conduit.

     As the lighter liquid velocity increases two

things can happen (1) wave size increase, and (2)

the shape of cross section continue to deform.                 LLigghhtt LLiiqquuidid  Light Liquid

Some referred to this regime as wavy stratified flow           Heavy Liquid            Heavy Liquid
but this definition is not accepted by all as a cat-

egory by itself. In fact, all the two phase flow are

categorized by wavy flow which will proven later. Fig. 16.3 - Kind of Stratified flow in

liquid flow rate. If the heavier flow rate is small,

then the wave cannot reach to the crown and the shape is deformed to the point that

all the heavier liquid is around the periphery. This kind of flow regime is referred to as

annular flow. If the heavier liquid flow rate is larger6 than the distance, for the wave

to reach the conduit crown is smaller. At some point, when the lighter liquid flow

increases, the heavier liquid wave reaches to the crown of the pipe. At this stage, the

flow pattern is referred to as slug flow or plug flow. Plug flow is characterized by regions

of lighter liquid filled with drops of the heavier liquid with Plug (or Slug) of the heavier

liquid (with bubble of the lighter liquid). These plugs are separated by large "chunks"

that almost fill the entire tube. The plugs are flowing in a succession (see Figure 16.4).

The pressure drop of this kind of regime is significantly larger than the stratified flow.

The slug flow cannot be assumed to be as homogeneous flow nor it can exhibit some

average viscosity. The "average" viscosity depends on the flow and thus making it as

insignificant way to do the calculations. Further increase of the lighter liquid flow rate

move the flow regime into annular flow. Thus, the possibility to go through slug flow

regime depends on if there is enough liquid flow rate.

this category is accepted). After a certain distance, the flow become annular or the flow
will choke. The choking can occur before the annular flow regime is obtained depend-
ing on the velocity and compressibility of the lighter liquid. Hence, as in compressible
flow, liquid-liquid flow has a maximum combined of the flow rate (both phases). This
maximum is known as double choking phenomenon.

       The reverse way is referred to the process where the starting point is high flow
rate and the flow rate is decreasing. As in many fluid mechanics and magnetic fields,
the return path is not move the exact same way. There is even a possibility to return on
different flow regime. For example, flow that had slug flow in its path can be returned
as stratified wavy flow. This phenomenon is refer to as hysteresis.

       Flow that is under small angle from the horizontal will be similar to the horizontal
flow. However, there is no consensus how far is the "near" means. Qualitatively, the
"near" angle depends on the length of the pipe. The angle decreases with the length
of the pipe. Besides the length, other parameters can affect the "near."

       The results of the above discussion are depicted in Figure 16.5. As many things in
multiphase, this map is only characteristics of the "normal" conditions, e.g. in normal
gravitation, weak to strong surface tension effects (air/water in "normal" gravity), etc.

16.5.1.2 Vertical Flow

The vertical flow has two possibilities, with the gravity or against it. In engineering
application, the vertical flow against the gravity is more common used. There is a dif-
ference between flowing with the gravity and flowing against the gravity. The buoyancy

is acting in two different directions for these two flow regimes. For the flow against
gravity, the lighter liquid has a buoyancy that acts as an "extra force" to move it faster
and this effect is opposite for the heavier liquid. The opposite is for the flow with grav-
ity. Thus, there are different flow regimes for these two situations. The main reason
that causes the difference is that the heavier liquid is more dominated by gravity (body
forces) while the lighter liquid is dominated by the pressure driving forces.

Flow Against Gravity

       For vertical flow against gravity, the flow cannot start as a stratified flow. The
heavier liquid has to occupy almost the entire cross section before it can flow because
of the gravity forces. Thus, the flow starts as a bubble flow. The increase of the lighter
liquid flow rate will increase the number of bubbles until some bubbles start to collide.
When many bubbles collide, they create a large bubble and the flow is referred to as
slug flow or plug flow (see Figure 16.6). Notice, the different mechanism in creating
the plug flow in horizontal flow compared to the vertical flow.

       Further increase of lighter liquid flow rate will increase the slug size as more
bubbles collide to create "super slug"; the flow regime is referred as elongated bubble
flow. The flow is less stable as more turbulent flow and several "super slug" or churn
flow appears in more chaotic way, see Figure 16.6. After additional increase of "super
slug" , all these "elongated slug" unite to become an annular flow. Again, it can be
noted the difference in the mechanism that create annular flow for vertical and horizontal
flow. Any further increase transforms the outer liquid layer into bubbles in the inner
liquid. Flow of near vertical against the gravity in two-phase does not deviate from
vertical. The choking can occur at any point depends on the fluids and temperature
and pressure.

16.5.1.3 Vertical Flow Under Micro Gravity

The above discussion mostly explained the

flow in a vertical configuration when the

surface tension can be neglected. In cases

where the surface tension is very important.

For example, out in space between gas and

liquid (large density difference) the situation

is different. The flow starts as dispersed

bubble (some call it as "gas continuous")

because the gas phase occupies most of col-

umn. The liquid flows through a trickle or

channeled flow that only partially wets part

of the tube. The interaction between the

phases is minimal and can be considered as       Fig. 16.7 - A dimensional vertical flow map

figuration. As the gas flow increases, the liquid becomes more turbulent and some parts

enter into the gas phase as drops. When the flow rate of the gas increases further, all

the gas phase change into tiny drops of liquid and this kind of regime referred to as mist

flow. At a higher rate of liquid flow and a low flow rate of gas, the regime liquid fills the

entire void and the gas is in small bubble and this flow referred to as bubbly flow. In

the medium range of the flow rate of gas and liquid, there is pulse flow in which liquid

is moving in frequent pulses. The common map is based on dimensionless parameters.

Here, it is presented in a dimension form to explain the trends (see Figure 16.7). In

the literature, Figure 16.7 presented in dimensionless coordinates. The abscissa is a

function of combination of Froude ,Reynolds, and Weber numbers. The ordinate is a

combination of flow rate ratio and density ratio.

Flow With The Gravity

       As opposed to the flow against gravity, this flow can starts with stratified flow. A
good example for this flow regime is a water fall. The initial part for this flow is more
significant. Since the heavy liquid can be supplied from the "wrong" point/side, the
initial part has a larger section compared to the flow against the gravity flow. After the
flow has settled, the flow continues in a stratified configuration. The transitions between
the flow regimes is similar to stratified flow. However, the points where these transitions
occur are different from the horizontal flow. While this author is not aware of an actual
model, it must be possible to construct a model that connects this configuration with
the stratified flow where the transitions will be dependent on the angle of inclinations.

16.6 Emptying and Filling Pipes

In many industrial and in nature where there is a conduit is full of gas and a liquid
entering it and it refers to as filling process. On the other hand there is a situation
where the conduit is full of liquid and gas enter it and it is refers as emptying process.
In both processes there is a similar mixing process which lead to multiphase flow.
706                                         CHAPTER 16. MULTI-PHASE FLOW

       In die casting provide example of such situation where liquid metal under high
pressure is injected into a mold (cavity) and it has to flow trough a conduit (it is called
the runner) full of air. While the liquid metal flow in the runner has at least two
flow reigns. This initial where the flow start with a sharp interface and later part is
continuous. In this discussion the initial part determines how much liquid has to be
wasted and flush out. This situation is common when hose is fill with water to irrigate
the fields. The liquid flow enters to conduit full with gas (mostly air) is analyzed
here.

instabilities affected by the temperature.

In the typical numerical simulation the flow enters into conduit and the boundary

condition is assumed to be of "no slip". Under this assumption, the velocity of at the

wall is zero. While the instabilities due to the temperature might be significant, here

the focus is the hydrodynamics and hence are ignored for this analysis.

     The purpose in this section is to demonstrate that a sharp interface is not possible

and actuality has to be two phase flow. Assume that the velocity profile in the runner is

parabolic (or similar). The liquid can be considered incompressible material and hence

the parabolic profile is the same in the conduit in any cross section before the interface.

After sometime for the flow downstream the interface moves to another cross section

yet the velocity profile remains the same even though the same material is not at the

new cross section. What happens to the cross section at the interface. At time, t1 the

interfaced is assumed to be a straight line. In this case, the flow velocity (actually the

mass of liquid) and the interface at t1 will be the same line exhibited in Fig. 16.8. After

some time the interface moves to t2 line. However the cross section at the distance

equals to average velocity times the time has some gas (air). For continuous interface,

the velocity profile should be the same. Yet, at this case part of the cross section has

mix fluids: liquid on the inside and gas on the outer layer. If the flow is one dimensional

than the parabolic profile cannot coexist with no-slip boundary conditions for flow with

interface. The contradiction created by the coexist is that at t2 location part of the

surface is air. A control volume is build around the pipe starting from point t1 to point

t2 leads to a mass balance conflicts with the keeping the velocity profile. The averaged

velocity at the pipe is the standard definition of

               1                                                         (16.1)
     Uave = A A U dA
16.7. MULTI-PHASE FLOW VARIABLES DEFINITIONS  707

This velocity is calculated at t1. At t2 the velocity should be calculated in the same
fashion but here the area is smaller since part of cross section "became" air (gas).
According the definition of the location t2 the amount of material enter into the control
volume should be original Uave times the area. This conflicting the two assumptions
which leads to the conclusion that velocity at t2 has to be higher. Additional point
must be examine is the control volume on the air (gas) between point t1 and t2. The
flow in is zero while the flow out is positive to keep with no-slip condition at t2 point.
To maintain this situation, the control volume must shrink. However, according the
common logic the control volume increases (see the common logic at point t3). This
conflict suggest these assumption are conflict with the reality.

       This enjoyable explanation, did not considered the issue of the compressibility of
the air (gas). Essentially, the Mach number suggests that there might be situation
that gas flow into liquid. This author is not aware of this explanation in the literature
dealing with the physical with the interface. The experimental observations shows that
the liquid interface indeed increases the speed and some gas bubbles in certain ranges.
Furthermore, how long the sharp interface transition is converted into a interface zone
is not settled. The personal observation of this author suggests that this range is about
1 to 5 times the pipe diameter. It has to emphases that this statement is not conclusive
and not clear under what conditions and it should be treated as a educated guess.
Nevertheless, all the numerical works in the area which assuming sharp interface are
simply wrong.

16.7 Multi-Phase Flow Variables Definitions

Since the gas-liquid system is a specific case of the liquid-liquid system, both will be
united in this discussion. However, for the convenience of the terms "gas and liquid"
will be used to signify the lighter and heavier liquid, respectively. The liquid-liquid (also
gas-liquid) flow is an extremely complex three-dimensional transient problem since the
flow conditions in a pipe may vary along its length, over its cross section, and with
time. To simplify the descriptions of the problem and yet to retain the important
features of the flow, some variables are defined so that the flow can be described as
a one-dimensional flow. This method is the most common and important to analyze
two-phase flow pressure drop and other parameters. Perhaps, the only serious missing
point in this discussion is the change of the flow along the distance of the tube.

16.7.1 Multi-Phase Averaged Variables Definitions

The total mass flow rate through the tube is the sum of the mass flow rates of the two
phases

m = m G + m L                                 (16.2)
708                                CHAPTER 16. MULTI-PHASE FLOW

It is common to define the mass velocity instead of the regular velocity because the
"regular" velocity changes along the length of the pipe. The gas mass velocity is

                                   GG = m G       (16.3)
                                             A

Where A is the entire area of the tube. It has to be noted that this mass velocity does
not exist in reality. The liquid mass velocity is

                                   GL = m L       (16.4)
                                            A

The mass flow of the tube is then

                                         m        (16.5)
                                   G=

                                         A

It has to be emphasized that this mass velocity is the actual velocity.
       The volumetric flow rate is not constant (since the density is not constant) along

the flow rate and it is defined as

                                   QG = GG = UsG  (16.6)
                                            G

and for the liquid

                                   QL = GL        (16.7)
                                            L

For liquid with very high bulk modulus (almost constant density), the volumetric flow
rate can be considered as constant. The total volumetric volume vary along the tube
length and is

                                   Q = QL + QG    (16.8)

Ratio of the gas flow rate to the total flow rate is called the 'quality' or the "dryness
fraction" and is given by

                                   X = m G = GG   (16.9)
                                           m G

In a similar fashion, the value of (1 - X) is referred to as the "wetness fraction." The
last two factions remain constant along the tube length as long the gas and liquid
masses remain constant. The ratio of the gas flow cross sectional area to the total
cross sectional area is referred as the void fraction and defined as

                                    = AG          (16.10)
                                          A

This fraction is vary along tube length since the gas density is not constant along the
tube length. The liquid fraction or liquid holdup is

                    LH = 1 -  = AL                (16.11)

16.7. MULTI-PHASE FLOW VARIABLES DEFINITIONS                      709

It must be noted that Liquid holdup, LH is not constant for the same reasons the void
fraction is not constant.

       The actual velocities depend on the other phase since the actual cross section the
phase flows is dependent on the other phase. Thus, a superficial velocity is commonly
defined in which if only one phase is using the entire tube. The gas superficial velocity
is therefore defined as

           UsG = GG = X m = QG                                    (16.12)
                     G G A

The liquid superficial velocity is

UsL = GL = (1 - X) m = QL                                         (16.13)
                                    L        L A

Since UsL = QL and similarly for the gas then

                                    Um = UsG + UsL                (16.14)

Where Um is the averaged velocity. It can be noticed that Um is not constant along
the tube.

       The average superficial velocity of the gas and liquid are different. Thus, the ratio
of these velocities is referred to as the slip velocity and is defined as the following

                                       SLP = UG                   (16.15)
                                                 UL

Slip ratio is usually greater than unity. Also, it can be noted that the slip velocity is not
constant along the tube.

       For the same velocity of phases (SLP = 1), the mixture density is defined as

           m =  G + (1 - ) L                                      (16.16)

This density represents the density taken at the "frozen" cross section (assume the
volume is the cross section times infinitesimal thickness of dx).

       The average density of the material flowing in the tube can be evaluated by
looking at the definition of density. The density of any material is defined as  = m/V
and thus, for the flowing material it is

                                            m                     (16.17)
                                       =

                                             Q

Where Q is the volumetric flow rate. Substituting equations (16.2) and (16.8) into
equation (16.17) results in

Equation (16.18) can be simplified by canceling the m and noticing the (1-X)+X = 1
to become

The average specific volume of the flow is then

If the slip is one SLP = 1, thus equation (16.21) becomes

        X=                               G                    (16.22)

16.8 Homogeneous Models

Before discussing the homogeneous models, it is worthwhile to appreciate the complexity
of the flow. For the construction of fluid basic equations, it was assumed that the flow
is continuous. Now, this assumption has to be broken, and the flow is continuous
only in many chunks (small segments). Furthermore, these segments are not defined
but results of the conditions imposed on the flow. In fact, the different flow regimes
are examples of typical configuration of segments of continuous flow. Initially, it was
assumed that the different flow regimes can be neglected at least for the pressure loss
(not correct for the heat transfer). The single phase was studied earlier in this book
and there is a considerable amount of information about it. Thus, the simplest is to
used it for approximation.

       The average velocity (see also equation (16.14)) is

                              Um = QL + QG = UsL + UsG = Um   (16.23)
                                            A

It can be noted that the continuity equation is satisfied as

       The governing momentum equation can be approximated as

16.8.1 Pressure Loss Components

In a tube flowing upward in incline angle , the pressure loss is affected by friction loss,
acceleration, and body force(gravitation). These losses are non-linear and depend on
each other. For example, the gravitation pressure loss reduce the pressure and thus the
density must change and hence, acceleration must occur. However, for small distances
(dx) and some situations, this dependency can be neglected. In that case, from equation
(16.26), the total pressure loss can be written as

                      Pressure Loss                     gravity

                 f riction acceleration

          dP dP                         dP            dP                                                           (16.28)
              =                      +  dx a       +

                                                       dx g

Every part of the total pressure loss will be discussed in the following section.

16.8.1.1 Friction Pressure Loss
The frictional pressure loss for a conduit can be calculated as

           dP                              S                          (16.29)
     -                                     = w
           dx f A

Where S is the perimeter of the fluid. For calculating the frictional pressure loss in the
pipe is

     - dP = 4 w                                                       (16.30)
        dx f D

The wall shear stress can be estimated by

              m Um2                                                   (16.31)
     w = f 2

The friction factor is measured for a single phase flow where the average velocity is
directly related to the wall shear stress. There is not available experimental data for
the relationship of the averaged velocity of the two (or more) phases and wall shear
stress. In fact, this friction factor was not measured for the "averaged" viscosity of the
two phase flow. Yet, since there isn't anything better, the experimental data that was
developed and measured for single flow is used.

       The friction factor is obtained by using the correlation

     f =C      m Um D -n                                              (16.32)
                  탆

Where C and n are constants which depend on the flow regimes (turbulent or laminar
flow). For laminar flow C = 16 and n = 1. For turbulent flow C = 0.079 and n = 0.25.
There are several suggestions for the average viscosity. For example, Duckler suggest
the following

     탆 = 킛 QG + 킠 QL                                               (16.33)
             QG + QL QG + QL

Duckler linear formula does not provide always good approximation and Cichilli suggest
similar to equation (16.19) average viscosity as

                                              1                       (16.34)
     킳verage = X (1 - X)
                                           +
               킛                                킠

Or simply make the average viscosity depends on the mass fraction as

     탆 = X 킛 + (1 - X) 킠                                           (16.35)

Using this formula, the friction loss can be estimated.

16.8.1.2 Acceleration Pressure Loss

The acceleration pressure loss can be estimated by

                              - dP = m dUm                        (16.36)
                                dx a            dx

The acceleration pressure loss (can be positive or negative) results from change of
density and the change of cross section. Equation (16.36) can be written as

                 -  dP              = m    d     m                (16.37)
                                                A m
                              dx a         dx

Or in an explicit way equation (16.37) becomes

                                                                

               pressure loss due to pressure loss due to 
- dP = m 2 density change  area change 
dx a                                                              (16.38)

                1d 1                                 1 dA       
                 A dx m + m A2 dx

       There are several special cases. The first case where the cross section is constant,
dA/ dx = 0. In second case is where the mass flow rates of gas and liquid is constant
in which the derivative of X is zero, dX/ dx = 0. The third special case is for constant
density of one phase only, dL/ dx = 0. For the last point, the private case is where
densities are constant for both phases.

16.8.1.3 Gravity Pressure Loss

Gravity was discussed in Chapter 4 and is

                              dP                                  (16.39)
                                     = g m sin 

                              dx g

The density change during the flow can be represented as a function of density. The
density in equation (16.39) is the density without the "movement" (the "static" den-
sity).

16.8.1.4 Total Pressure Loss

The total pressure between two points, (a and b) can be calculated with integration as

and therefore                              b dP                   (16.40)

16.8.2 Lockhart Martinelli Model

The second method is by assumption that every phase flow separately One such popular
model by Lockhart and Martinelli8. Lockhart and Martinelli built model based on the
assumption that the separated pressure loss are independent from each other. Lockhart
Martinelli parameters are defined as the ratio of the pressure loss of two phases and
pressure of a single phase. Thus, there are two parameters as shown below.

     G =                                 dP          dP                               (16.42)
                                         dx T P      dx SG f

Where the T P denotes the two phases and SG denotes the pressure loss for the single
gas phase. Equivalent definition for the liquid side is

     L =                                 dP          dP                               (16.43)
                                         dx T P      dx SL f

Where the SL denotes the pressure loss for the single liquid phase.
       The ratio of the pressure loss for a single liquid phase and the pressure loss for a

single gas phase is

     =      dP                                   dP                                   (16.44)

              dx SL dx SG f

where  is Martinelli parameter.
       It is assumed that the pressure loss for both phases are equal.

          dP                                  =  dP                                   (16.45)

          dx SG dx SL

The pressure loss for the liquid phase is

        dP                                 =  2 fL UL2 l                              (16.46)

        dx L                                     DL

For the gas phase, the pressure loss is

     dP                                  =    2 fG UG2 l                              (16.47)

16.9 Solid-Liquid Flow

Solid-liquid system is simpler to analyze than the liquid-liquid system. In solid-liquid,
the effect of the surface tension are very minimal and can be ignored. Thus, in this
discussion, it is assumed that the surface tension is insignificant compared to the gravity
forces. The word "solid" is not really mean solid but a combination of many solid par-
ticles. Different combination of solid particle creates different "liquid." Therefor,there
will be a discussion about different particle size and different geometry (round, cubic,
etc). The uniformity is categorizing the particle sizes, distribution, and geometry. For
example, analysis of small coal particles in water is different from large coal particles in
water.

       The density of the solid can be above or below the liquid. Consider the case
where the solid is heavier than the liquid phase. It is also assumed that the "liquids"
density does not change significantly and it is far from the choking point. In that case
there are four possibilities for vertical flow:

1. The flow with the gravity and lighter density solid particles.

2. The flow with the gravity and heavier density solid particles.

3. The flow against the gravity and lighter density solid particles.

4. The flow against the gravity and heavier density solid particles.

       All these possibilities are different. However, there are two sets of similar char-
acteristics, possibility, 1 and 4 and the second set is 2 and 3. The first set is similar
because the solid particles are moving faster than the liquid velocity and vice versa for
the second set (slower than the liquid). The discussion here is about the last case (4)
because very little is known about the other cases.

16.9.1 Solid Particles with Heavier Density S > L

Solid-liquid flow has several combination flow regimes.
       When the liquid velocity is very small, the liquid cannot carry the solid particles

because there is not enough resistance to lift up the solid particles. A particle in
a middle of the vertical liquid flow experience several forces. The force balance of
spherical particle in field viscous fluid (creeping flow) is

Equation (16.50) relates the liquid velocity that needed to maintain the particle "float-
ing" to the liquid and particles properties. The drag coefficient, CD is complicated
function of the Reynolds number. However, it can be approximated for several regimes.
The first regime is for Re < 1 where Stokes' Law can be approximated as

                                             24                          (16.51)

                                  Re     6

For larger Reynolds numbers, the Newton's Law region, CD, is nearly constant as

                                  CD = 0.44                              (16.53)

In most cases of solid-liquid system, the Reynolds number is in the second range9. For
the first region, the velocity is small to lift the particle unless the density difference is
very small (that very small force can lift the particles). In very large range (especially
for gas) the choking might be approached. Thus, in many cases the middle region is
applicable.

       So far the discussion was about single particle. When there are more than one
particle in the cross section, then the actual velocity that every particle experience
depends on the void fraction. The simplest assumption that the change of the cross
section of the fluid create a parameter that multiply the single particle as

                           CD| = CD f ()                                 (16.54)

When the subscript  is indicating the void, the function f () is not a linear function.

In the literature there are many functions for various conditions.

     Minimum velocity is the velocity when the particle is "floating". If the velocity is

larger, the particle will drift with the liquid. When the velocity is lower, the particle will

sink into the liquid. When the velocity of liquid is higher than the minimum velocity

many particles will be floating. It has to remember that not all the particle are uniform

in size or shape. Consequently, the minimum velocity is a range of velocity rather than

a sharp transition point.

     As the solid particles are not

pushed by a pump but moved by the

forces the fluid applies to them. Thus,

the only velocity that can be applied is
the fluid velocity. Yet, the solid particles
can be supplied at different rate. Thus,
the discussion will be focus on the fluid
velocity. For small gas/liquid velocity,
the particles are what some call fixed flu-
idized bed. Increasing the fluid velocity
beyond a minimum will move the parti-
cles and it is referred to as mix fluidized
bed. Additional increase of the fluid ve-
locity will move all the particles and this
is referred to as fully fluidized bed. For
the case of liquid, further increase will
create a slug flow. This slug flow is when slug shape (domes) are almost empty of the
solid particle. For the case of gas, additional increase create "tunnels" of empty almost
from solid particles. Additional increase in the fluid velocity causes large turbulence and
the ordinary domes are replaced by churn type flow or large bubbles that are almost
empty of the solid particles. Further increase of the fluid flow increases the empty spots
to the whole flow. In that case, the sparse solid particles are dispersed all over. This
regimes is referred to as Pneumatic conveying (see Figure 16.10).

       One of the main difference between the liquid and gas flow in this category is
the speed of sound. In the gas phase, the speed of sound is reduced dramatically with
increase of the solid particles concentration (further reading Fundamentals of Compress-
ible Flow" chapter on Fanno Flow by this author is recommended). Thus, the velocity
of gas is limited when reaching the Mach somewhere between 1/ k and 1 since the
718     CHAPTER 16. MULTI-PHASE FLOW

gas will be choked (neglecting the double choking phenomenon). Hence, the length of
conduit is very limited. The speed of sound of the liquid does not change much. Hence,
this limitation does not (effectively) exist for most cases of solid-liquid flow.

16.9.2 Solid With Lighter Density S <  and With Gravity

This situation is minimal and very few cases exist. However, it must be pointed out
that even in solid-gas, the fluid density can be higher than the solid (especially with
micro gravity). There was very little investigations and known about the solid-liquid
flowing down (with the gravity). Furthermore, there is very little knowledge about the
solid-liquid when the solid density is smaller than the liquid density. There is no known
flow map for this kind of flow that this author is aware of.

       Nevertheless, several conclusions and/or expectations can be drawn. The issue of
minimum terminal velocity is not exist and therefor there is no fixed or mixed fluidized
bed. The flow is fully fluidized for any liquid flow rate. The flow can have slug flow
but more likely will be in fast Fluidization regime. The forces that act on the spherical
particle are the buoyancy force and drag force. The buoyancy is accelerating the particle
and drag force are reducing the speed as

      D3 g(S - L) = CD  D2L (US - UL)2  (16.55)
     6  8

From equation 16.55, it can observed that increase of the liquid velocity will increase
the solid particle velocity at the same amount. Thus, for large velocity of the fluid it
can be observed that UL/US  1. However, for a small fluid velocity the velocity ratio
is very large, UL/US  0. The affective body force "seems" by the particles can be in
some cases larger than the gravity. The flow regimes will be similar but the transition
will be in different points.

       The solid-liquid horizontal flow has some similarity to horizontal gas-liquid flow.
Initially the solid particles will be carried by the liquid to the top. When the liquid
velocity increase and became turbulent, some of the particles enter into the liquid core.
Further increase of the liquid velocity appear as somewhat similar to slug flow. However,
this author have not seen any evidence that show the annular flow does not appear in
solid-liquid flow.

16.10 Counter-Current Flow

This discussion will be only on liquid-liquid systems (which also includes liquid-gas
systems). This kind of flow is probably the most common to be realized by the masses.
For example, opening a can of milk or juice. Typically if only one hole is opened on the
top of the can, the liquid will flow in pulse regime. Most people know that two holes
are needed to empty the can easily and continuously. Otherwise, the flow will be in a
pulse regime.
16.10. COUNTER-CURRENT FLOW                                                                                     719

Fig. 16.12 - Counter-current flow in a can (the left figure) has only one hole thus pulse flow
     and a flow with two holes (right picture).

In most cases, the possibility to

have counter-current flow is limited to

having short length of tubes. In only

certain configurations of the infinite long  Liquid Body Foreces                      Annular         Extented

In that case, the pressure difference and                                                             Channel

the other phase can be negative. The Fig. 16.11 - Counter-flow in vertical tubes map.

pressure difference in the interface must

be finite. Hence, the counter-current

flow can have opposite pressure gradient

for short conduit. But in most cases, the heavy phase (liquid) is pushed by the gravity

and lighter phase (gas) is driven by the pressure difference.

The counter-current flow occurs, for example, when cavity is filled or emptied

with a liquid. The two phase regimes "occurs" mainly in entrance to the cavity. For

example, Figure ?? depicts emptying of can filled with liquid. The air is "attempting"

to enter the cavity to fill the vacuum created thus forcing pulse flow. If there are two

holes, in some cases, liquid flows through one hole and the air through the second

hole and the flow will be continuous. It also can be noticed that if there is one hole

(orifice) and a long and narrow tube, the liquid will stay in the cavity (neglecting other

phenomena such as dripping flow.).

There are three flow regimes10 that have been observed. The first flow pattern

is pulse flow regime. In this flow regime, the phases flow turns into different direction

(see Figure 16.13). The name pulse flow is used to signify that the flow is flowing in

pulses that occurs in a certain frequency. This is opposed to counter-current solid-gas

   10Caution! this statement should be considered as "so far found". There must be other flow regimes
that were not observed or defined. For example, elongated pulse flow was observed but measured. This
field hasn't been well explored. There are more things to be examined and to be studied.

flow when almost no pulse was observed. Initially, due to the gravity, the heavy liquid is
leaving the can. Then the pressure in the can is reduced compared to the outside and
some lighter liquid (gas)entered into the can. Then, the pressure in the can increase,
and some heavy liquid will starts to flow. This process continue until almost the liquid
is evacuated (some liquid stay due the surface tension). In many situations, the volume
flow rate of the two phase is almost equal. The duration the cycle depends on several
factors. The cycle duration can be replaced by frequency. The analysis of the frequency
is much more complex issue and will not be dealt here.

Annular Flow in Counter-current flow

     The other flow regime is annular flow in

which the heavier phase is on the periphery of    Water
the conduit (In the literature, there are some-    Flow

one who claims that heavy liquid will be in-

side). The analysis is provided, but somehow             Steam

diameters of tubes the counter-current flow is

not possible because of the surface tension (see

section 4.7). The ratio of the diameter to the length with some combinations of the

physical properties (surface tension etc) determines the point where the counter flow

can start. At this point, the pulsing flow will start and larger diameter will increase

the flow and turn the flow into annular flow. Additional increase of the diameter will

change the flow regime into extended open channel flow. Extended open channel flow

retains the characteristic of open channel that the lighter liquid (almost) does not effect

the heavier liquid flow. Example of such flow in the nature is water falls in which water
16.10. COUNTER-CURRENT FLOW                                                                     721

flows down and air (wind) flows up.
       The driving force is the second parameter which effects the flow existence. When

the driving (body) force is very small, no counter-current flow is possible. Consider
the can in zero gravity field, no counter-current flow possible. However, if the can was
on the sun (ignoring the heat transfer issue), the flow regime in the can moves from
pulse to annular flow. Further increase of the body force will move the flow to be in
the extended "open channel flow."

       In the vertical co-current flow there are two possibilities, flow with gravity or
against it. As opposed to the co-current flow, the counter-current flow has no possibility
for these two cases. The heavy liquid will flow with the body forces (gravity). Thus it
should be considered as non existent flow.

       When the flow rate of both fluids is very small, the flow will be stratified counter-
current flow. The flow will change to pulse flow when the heavy liquid flow rate increases.
Further increase of the flow will result in a single phase flow regime. Thus, closing the
window of this kind of flow. Thus, this increase terminates the two phase flow possibility.
The flow map of the horizontal flow is different from the vertical flow and is shown in
Figure 16.15. A flow in an angle of inclination is closer to vertical flow unless the angle
of inclination is very small. The stratified counter flow has a lower pressure loss (for the
liquid side). The change to pulse flow increases the pressure loss dramatically.

consider a two dimensional conduit with a

liquid inserted in the left side as depicted in Figure 16.14. The liquid velocity at very

low gas velocity is constant but not uniform. Further increase of the gas velocity will

reduce the average liquid velocity. Additional increase of the gas velocity will bring it

to a point where the liquid will flow in a reverse direction and/or disappear (dried out).

A simplified model for this situation is for a two dimensional configuration where

the liquid is flowing down and the gas is flowing up as shown in Figure 16.16. It is

assumed that both fluids are flowing in a laminar regime and steady state. Additionally,

it is assumed that the entrance effects can be neglected. The liquid flow rate, QL, is

unknown. However, the pressure difference in the (x direction) is known and equal to

zero. The boundary conditions for the liquid is that velocity at the wall is zero and the

velocity at the interface is the same for both phases UG = UL or i|G = i|L. As it
will be shown later, both conditions cannot coexist. The model can be improved by

considering turbulence, mass transfer, wavy interface, etc11. This model is presented

to exhibits the trends and the special features of counter-current flow. Assuming the

pressure difference in the flow direction for the gas is constant and uniform. It is assumed

that the last assumption does not contribute or change significantly the results. The

underline rational for this assumption is that gas density does not change significantly

for short pipes (for more information look for the book "Fundamentals of Compressible

Flow" in Potto book series in the Fanno flow chapter.).

The liquid film thickness is unknown and can be expressed as a function of the

above boundary conditions. Thus, the liquid flow rate is a function of the boundary

conditions. On the liquid side, the gravitational force has to be balanced by the shear

forces as

           dxy = L g                                                        (16.56)

The integration of equation (16.56) results in

                                     xy = L g x + C1            (16.57)

The integration constant, C1, can be found from the boundary condition where xy(x =
h) = i. Hence,

                                     i = L g h + C1             (16.58)

The integration constant is then Ci = i - L g h which leads to

                            xy = L g (x - h) + i                (16.59)

or in a simplified form as

Equation (16.61) can be integrate to yield

The liquid velocity at the wall, [U (x = 0) = 0], is zero and the integration coefficient

       The velocity can vanish (zero) inside the film in another point which can be
obtained from

The solution for equation (16.66) is

         x |@UL=0 = 2 h - 2 i 킠 g L                                          (16.67)

The maximum x value is limited by the liquid film thickness, h. The minimum shear
stress that start to create reversible velocity is obtained when x = h which is

         0 = L g                                h2 - h h + i h                (16.68)

If the shear stress is below this critical shear stress i0 then no part of the liquid will have
a reversed velocity. The notation of i0 denotes the special value at which a starting
shear stress value is obtained to have reversed flow. The point where the liquid flow
rate is zero is important and it is referred to as initial flashing point.

       The flow rate can be calculated by integrating the velocity across the entire liquid
thickness of the film.

Where w is the thickness of the conduit (see Figure 16.16).                   Integration equation
(16.69) results in

         Q = h2 (3 i - 2 g h L)                                               (16.70)

It is interesting to find the point where the liquid mass flow rate is zero. This point can
be obtained when equation (16.70) is equated to zero. There are three solutions for
equation (16.70). The first two solutions are identical in which the film height is h = 0
and the liquid flow rate is zero. But, also, the flow rate is zero when 3 i = 2 g h L.
This request is identical to the demand in which

This critical shear stress, for a given film thickness, reduces the flow rate to zero or
effectively "drying" the liquid (which is different then equation (16.68)).

       For this shear stress, the critical upward interface velocity is

The wall shear stress is the last thing that will be done on the liquid side.      The wall

Simplifying equation (16.73)12 becomes (notice the change of the sign accounting for
the direction)

                       L|@wall = g h L                                             (16.74)

       Again, the gas is assumed to be in a laminar flow as well. The shear stress on gas
side is balanced by the pressure gradient in the y direction. The momentum balance on
element in the gas side is

                       dxyG = dP                                                   (16.75)
                         dx dy

The pressure gradient is a function of the gas compressibility. For simplicity, it is
assumed that pressure gradient is linear. This assumption means or implies that the
gas is incompressible flow. If the gas was compressible with an ideal gas equation of
state then the pressure gradient is logarithmic. Here, for simplicity reasons, the linear
equation is used. In reality the logarithmic equation should be used ( a discussion can be
found in "Fundamentals of Compressible Flow" a Potto project book). Thus, equation
(16.75) can be rewritten as

                       dxyG = P = P                                                (16.76)
                         dx y L

Where y = L is the entire length of the flow and P is the pressure difference of the
entire length. Utilizing the Newtonian relationship, the differential equation is

                       d2UG = P                                                    (16.77)
                        dx2 킛 L

Equation (16.77) can be integrated twice to yield

                       UG = P x2 + C1 x + C2                                       (16.78)
                               킛 L

This velocity profile must satisfy zero velocity at the right wall. The velocity at the
interface is the same as the liquid phase velocity or the shear stress are equal. Mathe-
matically these boundary conditions are

                       UG(x = D) = 0                                               (16.79)

12Also noticing that equation (16.71) has to be equal g h L to support the weight of the liquid.

and

                UG(x = h) = UL(x = h) (a)                     or       (16.80)

                G(x = h) = L(x = h) (b)

Applying B.C. (16.79) into equation (16.78) results in

     UG = 0 = P D2 + C1 D + C2 = C2 = - P D2 + C1 D                    (16.81)

Which leads to

                      UG = P x2 - D2 + C1 (x - D)
                              킛 L

At the other boundary condition, equation (16.80)(a), becomes

                L g h2 = P h2 - D2 + C1 (h - D)                        (16.83)

The last integration constant, C1 can be evaluated as

                      C1 =     L g h2             P (h + D)
                                               -
                            6 킠 (h - D)           킛 L

With the integration constants evaluated, the gas velocity profile is

     U P G = x2 - D2 + L g h2 (x - D) - P (h + D) (x - D)              (16.85)
     킛 L                      6 킠 (h - D)                   킛 L

The velocity in equation (16.85) is equal to the velocity equation (16.65) when (x = h).
However, in that case, it is easy to show that the gas shear stress is not equal to the
liquid shear stress at the interface (when the velocities are assumed to be the equal).
The difference in shear stresses at the interface due to this assumption, of the equal
velocities, cause this assumption to be not physical.

       The second choice is to use the equal shear stresses at the interface, condition
(16.80)(b). This condition requires that

                               킛 dUG = 킠 dUL                         (16.86)
                                        dx     dx

The expressions for the derivatives are

                               gas side        liquid side

                      2 h P + 킛 C1 = 2 g h L                          (16.87)
                            L                      3

As result, the integration constant is

                            C1 = 2 g h L - 2 h P                       (16.88)

The gas velocity profile is then

UG = P x2 - D2 +                  2 g h L - 2 h P                 (x - D)     (16.89)

The gas velocity at the interface is then

                P           h2 - D2 +  2 g h L - 2 h P            (h - D)     (16.90)

       This gas interface velocity is different than the velocity of the liquid side. The
velocity at interface can have a "slip" in very low density and for short distances. The
shear stress at the interface must be equal, if no special effects occurs. Since there
no possibility to have both the shear stress and velocity on both sides of the interface,
different thing(s) must happen. It was assumed that the interface is straight but is
impossible. Then if the interface becomes wavy, the two conditions can co-exist.

       The wall shear stress is

G|@wall = 킛 dUG            = 킛  P 2 x             2 g h L - 2 h P                   (16.91)

                                   킛 L

or in a simplified form as

                  G|@wall = 2 P (D - h) + 2 g h L                             (16.92)

ever, this explanation is to show magnitudes

       To calculate the required pressure that cause the liquid to dry, the total balance is
needed. The control volume include the gas and liquid volumes. Figure 16.17 describes
the general forces that acts on the control volume. There are two forces that act
728                                              CHAPTER 16. MULTI-PHASE FLOW

against the gravity and two forces with the gravity. The gravity force on the gas can
be neglected in most cases. The gravity force on the liquid is the liquid volume times
the liquid volume as

                              V olme                                    (16.93)

The total momentum balance is (see Figure 16.17)

Substituting the different terms into (16.94) result in

       This analysis shows far more reaching conclusion that initial anticipation expected.
The interface between the two liquid flowing together is wavy. Unless the derivations
or assumptions are wrong, this analysis equation (16.97) indicates that when D > 2 h
is a special case (extend open channel flow).

16.11 Multi-Phase Conclusion

For the first time multi-phase is included in a standard introductory textbook on fluid
mechanics. There are several points that should be noticed in this chapter. There are
many flow regimes in multi-phase flow that "regular" fluid cannot be used to solve
it such as flooding. In that case, the appropriate model for the flow regime should
be employed. The homogeneous models or combined models like Lockhart-Martinelli
can be employed in some cases. In other case where more accurate measurement are
needed a specific model is required. Perhaps as a side conclusion but important, the
assumption of straight line is not appropriate when two liquid with different viscosity
are flowing.
                                                17 Open Channel Flow

17.1 What is Open Channel Flow?

17.1.1 Introduction

Open channel flow is a branch of multi phase flow. Traditionally, open channel flow

is considered as a direct branch of fluid machines because it was studied much earlier.

However, one can view the open channel flow as (almost) horizontal two phase flow

with extremely large ratio of gas flow to liquid flow. In that case, the flow is stratified

flow (as can be observed from the two phase flow regime map). Furthermore, the gas

phase can be assumed almost unchanged, and therefore, the liquid upper surface can

be assumed to be under constant pressure.

The open channel flow and the pipe flow move liquids from one place to another.

Yet, the main different between these two

flows is that, in pipe flow, the shape of

the pipe determines the flow cross sec-         P ouring  vents die
tion shape while in open channel flow the         hole     gate
shape of the flow is determined by the                    runner
flow. The secondary difference is that

in pipe flow the pressure determined from                           cold
the flow while in open channel flow, the                         chamber
pressure is determined from the gas phase

face determines the pressure in the flow down stream. In the limiting case, the pressure

remains constant. This limiting case is what will be discussed mostly in this chapter.

     The open channel flow occurs in nature as can be observed in river flow (and

many water running systems). Open channel flow occurs in many man made situations

like sewer systems and many water supply systems. While the open channel flow was

traditionally dealt with mostly water (or water base) as the substance it also can be

applied to many kind of substances, oil, methanol, liquid metal etc. It also can appear

in situations that one does not expect it. For example, in die casting process (see

Fig. 17.1), where a liquid metal is injected into the cavity, creates open channel flow a

in contrast to solid boundary (almost).

The conditions at boundary for true open channel are different from the multi-phase

which the shear stress is zero and the pressure is atmospheric. The flow in pipe

sometimes referred as a stratified flow. In this chapter only true open channel is

discussed. If one is particular about the definition, the flow in rivers and other channel

is not a open channel flow according to this definition. However, the effect is not that

significant and hence it is considered to be open channel flow.

     All the equations and principles devel-

oped earlier still can be applied to new situa-                  1

complexity is one of the main topics in the chapter. The change of the boundary also

affect the kind of flow in open channel flow. As oppose to the close conduit flow, the

open channel flow is strongly affected by the gravity. Additional difference, the waves

can be generated on the free surface regardless to the movement of the liquid.

17.1.2 Open Channel "Intuition'

As in compressible flow, the open channel flow, one has to gain new intuition. Supposed
that flow exposed to a change of the height of the channel bottom as shown in Fig. 17.3.

The change can be also negative, in other words the bottom located in lower position.
Assume the flow is a two dimensional case (other limitations such as surface tension
are insignificant.). What the height of the liquid will be after the obstacle? There is
two possibilities, one, the liquid level increases, and two, the liquid level decreases.

       To consider what direction the height                    A
takes, one has to get information from the fa-
miliar. Instinctively as the situation described                    B

In general as shown in Fig. 17.8, any cross

used to obtain an expression for two dimensional flow. In that case, Eq. (17.2) reduces

       The shear stress in the rectangle case changes with the height of the liquid.
Consider the control volume shown in Fig. 17.9 in which forces are similar to previ-
ous. For the same reasons as before, the net momentum flux is zero as well as the
net pressure difference on both side. The
net shear stress (force) balance reads

         =  g sin  (h - y)         (17.5)                                           L

       In real application, the flow is not laminar even for relatively small Reynolds
numbers. For extremely small Reynolds number (and high viscosity) there is a good
734                       CHAPTER 17. OPEN CHANNEL FLOW

agreement between the theory and the experiments. Please note that there is Reynolds
below which no 2-dimensional flow can exist. The change is that information passes
from a layer to another later. The shear stress (viscosity) can be viewed as a transfer of
momentum like a transfer of heat or mass across layers. Another view of the thickness of
the liquid essentially depends on the shear stress at the wall. Larger forces (shear stress)
at the bottom can carry more weight. Alternatively, the velocity is reduced because the
shear force at the bottom overcome it and to compensate for larger resistance by the
liquid height has to increase.

       Some empirical equations describes the shear stress such as Ch큖zy coefficient
(Manning, Griffith, Pigot, and Vernon-Harcourt 1890) as

                     f U2                                (17.10)
              0 = 8

With this shear stress, the flow rate can be obtained. A better coefficient is Manning
coefficient. Regardless to specific (it not turbulence book) the reader should be aware
of the topic.

17.2 Energy conservation

The energy is conserved as long there is no energy loss (by definition) significant.
Hence, the energy equation has to be developed. The energy at every cross section
has to include the kinetic and potential, as they changed from a cross section to a
cross section. Bernoulli equation per unit volume of fluid moving along a streamline,
 U 2/2 + P +  g h and is constant. Or it can be written for dividing by g which the
energy per unit weight of fluid (as  g is weight).

                   U2 P                                  (17.11)
           Ew = 2 g +  g + H

where H is liquid height from arbitrary point (not the bottom of the channel). This

equation (17.11) is exact for on the same stream line. In order to generalize this equation

two assumptions have to be made. One, the acceleration perpendicular to the flow is

insignificant thus the pressure is basically the hydrostatic pressure, almost the actual
pressure P =  g (h - y). Two, the sum of the height and the pressure can be written
as

        H
     H + P = H0 + y + P = H0 + y + rrg (h - y) = h + H0
     g     g               rrg                           (17.12)

where H0 is height from arbitrary datum to channel bottom shown in Fig. 17.10.
Eq. (17.11) can be written as

                   U2                                    (17.13)
           Ew = 2 g + h + H0

       The energy Ew plot as a function of horizontal line is referred to as the energy
grade line. For any kind of the open channel which was discussed here, the energy
17.2. ENERGY CONSERVATION                                                                                 735

line decreases with the horizontal (in the flow direction). The reason for the decrease
is because the pressure remains the same and the liquid height is the same while the
elevation (H) is lower with the downstream progression. The head loss is defined as

Ew2 - Ew1 =       Head Loss Rec                                 H1          (17.14)

             U22
              2 + h2 +H02 -

While technically this equation is not appropriate for the rapid acceleration still for a
quick result, Eq. (17.12) can be used for a quick calculation.

       For this uniform flow, the pressure remains the same on a stream line and the
velocity as well, while the potential energy decreases downstream. The energy loss is
actually the change in elevation or in another view, the rate loss is the slop of the
channel bottom. When the change in bottom are relatively small, the loss is negligible
and energy (head) Eq. (17.14) reads

                     H02 + H2 = H01 + H1 -- H2 = H01 - H02 + H1             (17.15)
An energy specific variable is defined as

             Specific Energy Rec                                            (17.16)

736  CHAPTER 17. OPEN CHANNEL FLOW

Fig. 17.12 - The energy lines in general and specific case The reduction of in H result in
     two possibilities depending if the flow in the "high" speed or the "low" speed. Points b1
     and b2 are denoted the point on subcritical flow and points p1 and p2 supercritical flow
     see fig. (b).

This quantify remains the same (constant) for uniform flow at steady state. This
equation, Eq. (17.15), can be used to evaluate the height of the channel for a given
flow rate, q. The value of H is defined from the slope of the channel which determines
the velocity of the liquid. That is, for a given sloop the energy (velocity) is determined
by it. For a specific energy and fixed flow rate there is a height that correspond to these
data. Eq. (17.17) is a cubic equation which means that there are three possible solutions.
This equation can be solved analytically and the solution of quadratic equation is given
in (Bar-Meir 2021b). Yet the expressions are very long and thus not presented here.
For a small range of H, there is only one real negative solution and two imaginary
solutions. For larger values of H, the solution has two positive roots and one negative
root. The negative root is rejected as it is not physically possible (no negative height).
The solution (actually the governing equation) becomes a parabola (two roots) since one
of the root was rejected. In other words, the cubic equation is reduced to a quadratic
equation. The solution is plotted on the diagram Fig. 17.12 (part a). These two roots
represent the two different regimes for flow. Similar to compressible flow, one) branch
with the smaller height, h thus with larger velocity and two) branch with the larger
height thus smaller velocity.

       Fig. 17.3 exhibits a situation of the flow in a open channel for which the bottom is
elevated. The value of H0 = H02 - H01 is positive. That is according to Eq. (17.15)
the value of H decreases (note the order in the equation). The flow rate is a constant
(the flow rate did not change for the different height). The H reduced is exhibited in
Fig. 17.12b. There is two possibilities either the "high" speed and "low" speed. For the
"high speed" (the lower branch), the height increase and therefore the velocity reduces.
The opposite occurs on the "low" speed branch. Again it is similar to compressible flow.
The points where the "high" and "low" heights are the same is refers as the critical
height. The speed that correspond to this height is the critical speed. At this stage the
upper branch can be referred to subcritical flow and the lower branch is referred as the
supercritical critical flow.

       The reverse situation occurs when the bottom elevation is lowered. In this case,
the H is negative, and thus the new H is larger. For flow that is in the supercritical
branch, the velocity increases while on the subcritical branch the velocity describes. As
oppose earlier case, step up (obstacle), there is a critical height above which the flow
upstream become affected. In this case there is no such a limiting case (at least not
obvious).

       The critical point can be found by taking the derivative of Eq. (17.17) with respect
to h and equating to zero.

            q2 = g hc3

The notation of subscript c is to indicate that it refers to the critical height. Using
this value for hc, the critical specific energy is obtained by substituting the value in
Eq. (17.17) to get

       Hc = hc +           g hc3 3                  (17.20)

                           2 g hc 2

Note this value is correct (only? maybe) to the rectangular shape.
       Equation Eq. (17.20) demonstrates that the critical energy linearly depends on

the critical height with as a slope of 2/3. This line is shown in Fig. 17.12a. Flow that is
above this line is subcritical and flow below this line is supercritical. As in compressible
flow, is possible to move from one branch to another? In other words, it possible to
move from supercritical to subcritical flow or from supercritical to subcritical? The
answer is yes from subcritical to subcritical but requires a step up change (or similar)
and it will remains subcritical for a short distance (unless there is a steeper slop). It can
be noticed that Eq. (17.18) can be rearranged by substituting q = h U into Eq. (17.18)

 Froude number for critical flow is F r = 1. This definition of Froude number is at the
critical condition which equals to one. This situation is similar to situation that occurs
at at compressible flow for M ach = 1. Supercritical flows occur for Froude numbers
greater than one while subcritical flows occur at Froude number < 1. The difference in
the behavior of the flow for different regimes is important in analyzing the flow.

       The open channel flow has mostly hyperbolic character which is the downstream
flow does not affect the flow upstream. In Fig. 17.3 the bottom was raised and the
subcritical the height was lower (and opposite for the supercritical branch). The larger
change in bottom height, the larger the effect is. When the change in the bottom
reach to the point that the liquid reached the critical condition. Any increase of further
creates a local dam situation. In other words, the flow upstream has to increase. The
flow rate does not change because the dam and it remains as before. The nature fixes
the situation by changing the height of the liquid (upstream) approaching the step (the
bottom raised to about the critical point). The flow in this case over the step must be
at critical condition. That is, the reason the word mostly was used in the beginning
of this paragraph. As long as the raise is below the critical point no effect upstream

occurs. How far upstream the effect taking place? At this stage, without doing analysis

it cannot be answered precisely. However, a rough estimate can be made. The distance

should be in a magnitude of such that the channel bottom raised as the critical step

(the critical step is the amount needed to get the flow to be at the critical conditions).

point that is, i = 1 or i = 2. For smooth

transition and gradual enough no significant energy loss and hence energy remains

constant along the path. Rephrasing the statement: the energy in b and p is the same.

Physically, the flow at the end of the step accelerates and there no sufficient mechanism

to elevate the liquid level. This situation is similar to a nozzle in compressible flow.

This situation is not difficult to achieve by making the step higher even than necessary.

In that case, the flow upstream will be higher. The flow changes to subcritical shortly

after the conversion to supercritical downstream after step for the same slope or

smaller.

velocity. After the critical height, the liquid height is recessed but with the same

energy.

     The step height (s) as shown in Fig. 17.13. Assume that the step can be raised

     slowly from zero without creating any energy losses. Quantitatively describe

     the height of the flow downstream the step. The initial height of the subcritical

     flow is 0. At what stage the critical condition start to occur?

     Solution

     The height downstream is constant until the critical condition is attained. At the
     critical condition, the downstream regimes change to supercritical flow. After this
     stage and continue, the flow at the step flow is critical. However, Hc increases
     because overcome the obstacle to keep the same flow rate. The Fr number is one (the
     flow is sat the critical conditions). Hence,

  Example 17.2: Given Step what Upstream Height Level: Advance
The flow rate in a wide channel is 10[m2/sec] (notice the units are m2 and
not m3 because it is flow rate per width). Before the insertion of the step,
the water level was 2.5[m]. A step with a height of 0.5[m] is inserted. What
is water height above the step? Assume no energy loss occurs. Is the flow
immediately downstream the step subcritical or supercritical? Estimate the
height immediately upstream of the step? What is the velocity immediately
upstream the step? Estimate the water height immediately downstream the
step? If the step is 1.2[m] what will be the velocity at the step? Estimate the
height of the water just upstream the step.

     from the graph the value is obtained h  3.4[m]. The velocity upstream the step is
     the same velocity. The downstream the velocity remain the same as upstream and the
     same as the height (no change because no dam effect).

             If the height of the step increases than velocity at step is the critical velocity
     and the upstream H is 3.25 + 1.2 = 4.45. The corresponding height is h = 4.2[m]
     with the velocity of 10/4.45 = 2.25[m/sec]. The water will raise upstream the step
     about 4.2 - 2.5 = 1.7[m] much more than the step itself.

It can be noticed in the case, the height ratio is really single value function (only one
value between zero and one) for given flow rate. The maximum occurs at h/H =
2/3 and the maximum value is 4/27. The meaning of the last statement is if the
calculations show that if the value of left hand side of Eq. (17.28) greater than 4/27
the flow is chocked. The value of H has to be adjusted so that the value of the
dimensionless quantity is equal to 4/27. As approximate value height ratio can assumed
(small perturbation analysis) to be

The accuracy is greater for supercritical flow. Nevertheless, it acceptable for first ap-

tions). Fig. 17.20 depicts four possible

situations: gradual and abrupt and for these two also contraction and expansion. Due

to the complications with the energy losses, the abrupt changes are out of the scope

of this book. Also as in the step change, the acceleration effects and 3-dimensional

effects are neglected.

The first issue that stare at this topic is the flow rate. In the regular rectangular

cross section the flow rate q and Q are constant. In the present situation, only the total

flow rate, Q is constant, The flow rate per width is at the cross section 1 is q1 = Q/b1

and same for cross 2 which is q2 = Q/b2. It turned out there are four possible regimes

that have to be considered: contraction/expansion and subcritical/supercritical. The

emphasis will be on the subcritical flow as it more common. The choked flow will be

briefly considered for this version. The heavy lifting for chocking flow will be in future

versions. The heavy lifting for chocking flow will be in future versions.

17.2.2.1 Subcritical Regime; Contraction

The first case is of flow that undergoes contraction arriving with subcritical flow (F r <
1). For contraction b1 > b2 hence q2 > q1 (b1 q1 = b2 q2). If the 3-dimensional effects
are ignored then the energy is conserved and can be expressed as

                        H = H1 = H2                                        (17.30)

The energy assumed to be constant through out the channel. Hence, it is reasonable
to examine the flow in constant specific energy.

What happen when the flow rate at section 2 is greater than the maximum flow rate.
The flow rate is chocked and maximum flow rate is at section 2 is the maximum
possible and energy has to change as it was discussed just before Eq. (17.29). The
flow downstream with a change area is similar to the flow with a step. Yet there some
differences, quantities that remains constant in each case are different (see the question
at the end of the chapter).

Example 17.4: Simple Contraction                       Level: Intermediate

The water enters to a wide side of contracted section at averaged velocity of

0.3[m/sec] and the water height is 2.0[m]. The ratio of the wide to narrow

cross section is 3.0 for this rectangular shape channel. What is the height and

velocity at the exit of the contracted section?

With knowledge of the height, the velocity can be calculated as

17.2.2.2 Supercritical Regime; Contraction

In this cases the supercritical flow approaches a contraction is dealt in a similar logic
to the previous case. The flow rate increases and thus the "left" side of the graph is
controlling the phenomenon. As oppose to the previous case the increase in the flow
rate actually reduce the velocity was it will shown in the following Ex. 17.5. The

A flow enters a channel with a contraction with ratio of b1/b2 = 1.5 with
velocity of 7[m/sec]. The height at section 1 is 0.8[m]. What is the velocity

The specific energy that appear at section 1 is

The flow rate at section 2 is q2 = q1 b1/b2. The flow rate at section 1 is

     q1 = h1 U1 = 0.8  7 = 5.6[m2/sec]                                     (17.31)

The flow rate per width at section 2 is

       q2 = 5.6  1.5 = 8.4[m/sec]                                          (17.32)

For a rectangular channel the height of flow was observed to have value, h1 =
2[m]. A hump or step was inserted and downstream the flow was observed to

height of h2 = 0.8[m]. Assume that there was no energy lost by inserting the
step and the flow at after insertion of the step is supercritical (this should a

conclusion). What is the critical height? What is the specific energy? what is

the critical velocity? (this part left as a challenge).

Solution

by the geometry such radial or two dimensional (there are more). The hydraulic jump

also classified as uniform density (or material) or mixing or chemical interaction also

involve. No mater how complicated the situation considered, it is assumed the jump

occurs at very narrow width. The flow changes from supercritical to subcritical flow.

The hydraulic jump is depicted in Fig. 17.26.

The mixing processes at the surface and additionally the mixing inside the jump

are very substantial hence the energy is not conserved. Some of the energy dissipates

in these eddy in the turbulent processes. Only some of the energy converted into heat

and some for other form of energy like sound energy (slightly compressed air) and other

energies. The amount of lost energy is unknown and hence cannot be used to solve the

problem. Another quantity is needed to solve the problem. Under the assumption that

jump occurs at very narrow space, the shear stress can be assumed to negligible (similar

assumption to shock wave). The same argument can be made for the upper surface.
Furthermore, at the upper surface, the air is a light gas (relatively) and hence the shear
force is small2. There are several methods to analyze this situation. A simple control
volume is used for this analysis. The assumption taken here are: the height of the flow
is uniform (2D assumption) on both sides of the jump, (initially) the rectangular cross
section is assumed, a plug flow (or averaged velocity is assumed). It is further assumed
that the jump occurs at short distance and hence the shear stress at the bottom and
air are negligible.

       The mass conservation of the control volume show that control volume itself is
not moving and there is only one stream in and one stream out.

                                 U (y)dA = U (y)dA                       (17.34)

     If plug flow is assumed (or averaged velocity)

                                 U r1 h1 = U2 h2                         (17.35)

       It is assumed that the streamlines are parallel pressure made mostly from the
hydrostatic. The pressure at stations 1 and 2 the average hydrostatic pressure is given
by Pa = g h/2. The momentum conservation can be expressed as

                         U22 h2 - U12 h1 = g h12 - h22                   (17.36)
                                                 2

Substituting Eq. (17.35) into Eq. (17.36) provides

     U12 h12 - h g 1 = h12 - h22 = g (h1 - h2) (h1 + h2)                 (17.37)
     h2                      2             2

which can be reduced to

         U12             h1             g(h1 -h2) (h1  +  h2)            (17.38)
                            (h1 -h2) =  2
                         h2

Which be expressed as

Under the symmetry argument Eq. (17.39) can be written for the other velocity. In
other words 1 and 2 and can be interchanged and there is nothing significant about
their location yet.

                                          2 h2

2Why the term light gas is used? Because, the force is related to mass.

       If the momentum is conserved that indirectly imply that some energy is lost
(elementary physics which shows no energy lost only when U1 = U2. This situation is
similar to collision of the two balls from the equations point of view.). The total head
(energy per unit weight) change in the transition is

                                    U22 U12                          (17.41)
                      hL = h2 + 2 g - h1 + 2 g

which can be rearranged as

                                                   U22 U12           (17.42)
                              hL = h2 - h1 + 2 g - 2 g

Utilizing Eq. (17.39) and Eq. (17.40) Eq. (17.42) can be written as

      hL = h2 - h1 + 1 ge h2 (h1 + h2) - 1 ge h1 (h1 + h2)           (17.43)
                              2 ge 2 h1           2 ge 2 h2

which can be also written as

hL =  4 h22 h1 - 4 h12 h2 h2 (h1 + h2) h1 (h1 + h2)                  (17.44)
                              +                   -
      4 h1 h2                            4 h1               4 h2

which can be also written as

      4 h22 h1 - 4 h12 h2 h22 (h1 + h2) h12 (h1 + h2)                (17.45)
hL =                          +                   -
      4 h1 h2                            4 h1 h2            4 h2 h1

The numerator is simply quadric equation (a - b)3 (Notice that coefficient 4 changes to
3 for both terms and the last two terms produce are in the third power.) and Eq. (17.45)
can be written as

                                        Hydraulic Energy Loss

                                     (h1 - h2)3                      (17.46)
                              hL =

                                        4 h2 h1

The conclusion from Eq. (17.46) is that hL < 0 must be negative (thermo second law).
The above statement means that h1 < h2. The jump must be from a shallow flow to a
deep flow; In plain English, the energy loss is a strong function of the hydrostatic sides
heights. Note that while the hydraulic jump goes from subcritical to subcritical, it does
not mean that it a proof that subcritical is the preferred flow.

17.3.1 Poor Man Dimensional Analysis

The topic of open channel started long before the dimensional analysis become popular
(about 150 years difference). Thus, the serious usage of the dimensional analysis started
to appear only after world war two. Here a simple dimensional analysis is offered. The
Froude number is defined as

                              F r12 = U12                            (17.47)
                                        g h1
752                                         CHAPTER 17. OPEN CHANNEL FLOW

Dividing Eq. (17.39) by g h1 and utilizing the definition r = h2/h1 to reads

     U12 h2                       1 + h2    -- F r1 = 2 r (1 - r)             (17.48)
           =                           h1

     g h1 2 h1

Similar equation can be written for F r2. It is common to solve for r as function of F r.
There are two solutions for the equation of

                                  r2 + r - 2 F r12 = 0                        (17.49)

The positive solution (no negative height possible)

                             r = h2 = -1 +        1 + 8 F r12                 (17.50)
                                  h1              2

On arguments of symmetry, the reverse equation can be written as

                                   1 = h2 = -1 +  1 + 8 F r22                 (17.51)
                                   r h1           2
For completeness, the reverse relationship is

                                  Fr for h1/h2

                                  F r1 =    r(1 + r)                          (17.52)

The energy loss in the H as

                                  H1 - H2 = (r - 1)3                          (17.53)
                                  h1              4r

The power loss is  g q(H1 - H2)

     Example 17.7: Simple Hydraulic Jump                           Level: Basic

     Flow in channel has hydraulic jump from height of 0.4[m] to 0.8[m]. What are

     the upstream and downstream velocities, the volumetric flow rate and the rate

     of energy loss at the jump?

     Solution

     height ratio is r = 2 The upstream Froude number is

     F r1 =                       r(1 + r)        2(1 + 3) = 3     (17.7.a)

Since Froude was calculated the velocity can be obtained according to Eq. (17.47) as

                  U1 = F r12 g h1 = 3  9.81  0.4  11.8[m/sec]           (17.7.b)

The velocity on the other side can be ascertained from r height ratio as

                  U2 = U1/2 = 11.8/2  5.89[m/sec]                         (17.7.c)

The flow rate is

                  q = h1  U1 = 0.4  11.8  4.72[m2/sec]                   (17.7.d)
                                                                          (17.7.e)
The energy lost in the hydraulic jump is

                                     (r - 1)3 13
                             EL = 4 r = 8 = 1/8

Example 17.8: Hydrostatic Pressure                               Level: Basic

A hydraulic jump occurs in rectangular channel with upstream velocity of

U1 = 1.2[m/sec] and h1 = .1[m]. The density of the liquid (water) is about
1000[kg/m3] Calculate the difference in the hydrostatic pressure in both sides.

Solution

The pressure on both sides of the jump is based on the height of the water (liquid). In

this case, first the height has to be calculated on the downstream side. The upstream

Froude number is             2 U12           1.22

                  F r1 =                  =        = 1.46                 (17.8.a)
                             g h1 9.81  0.1

           1+     1 + 8 F r12                               = 0.23[m]     (17.8.b)
h2 = h1                          = 0.1   1 + 1 + 8  1.46

                   2                                 2

The pressure on upstream is

                  P1 = 0.2  9.81  1000  981[N/m2]                       (17.8.c)
                           2

The force per width is also very small since the height is very small. F1 = P h1.

17.3.2 Velocity Profile

The flow regime (code name for the velocity profile) is important factor in the flow.
Up this point it was assume that there is some kind overage representing the velocity.
Intuitively, it can be observed that the velocity has effect on the flow. In this section
while still dealing with rectangular shape the velocity profile is arbitrary. In this section
the velocity profile is assumed to be known and there is no attempt to solve for it. The
question in focus, given a profile what is the change in the momentum equation and
energy equation. It suggested to isolate the velocity profile from the calculations and
754                                    CHAPTER 17. OPEN CHANNEL FLOW

to make it as a coefficient.
       In order to carry these calculations, the mass conservation has to be solved. The

velocity profile can be any kind of function. Assuming that flow is stationary and 2D,
the mass flow is given by

                                    h1                              (17.54)

                            m  U (y)dy

                                  0

In this stage, the complication of the air entrainment and similar effects are neglected.
Thus, a good approximation is to assume that the density is constant. Hence, equation
can be read

                         m             h1

                         =   = q = U (y)dy                          (17.55)

                                    0

The averaged velocity is U1 = q/h1.
       The momentum conservation required that

                   h1                      h2                       (17.56)

                       P1 +  U12 dy =          P2 +  U22 dy

     0                                 0

The pressure, under the assumptions that used in this discussion is actually linearly
related to the pressure. Again, the hydrostatic assumption is employed. Thus the first
part of the integral (for any height) is

                   h 2 h  g h2                                      (17.57)
                    g (h - ) d =  g h  -               =
                                                   20        2
     0

The part above is almost trivial. Next part is more complicated as

      h                  h U 2() 2                 2   h U 2()      (17.58)
                          2 U d =  U                          2 d
         U 2()d =     0     U
                                                      0U
     0

The combination of the integral is basically a function of velocity profile and is defined

as gamma momentum

                         Gamma Momentum

                               1 h U 2()                            (17.59)
                         =               2 d
                               h0      U

The gamma function is a dimensionless function. Notice, that for energy gamma func-
tion is defined a bit different. Using the definition Eq. (17.59) Eq. (17.56) to read

                      h P +  U (y)2 dy = g h2 +  q 2                (17.60)

                   0

       Now  can be calculated from various velocity profiles. For example, consider the
plug flow which preferred to uniform velocity.

Calculate profile factor  for two profiles: plug, laminar flow.

Solution

The calculations are straight forward for plug flow U (y) = q/h = constant. For the

plug flow

For the laminar velocity it was shown earlier that velocity profile is parabola. The

averaged velocity is

which result in averaged velocity

17.4 Cross Section Area

17.4.1 Introduction

Before considering different cross sections, so far the discussion was focus on the rect-
angular shape. At this stage, no discussion was offered on the best ratio of rectangular
sides. Now here it is postulated that reducing of the wetted area can reduced the resis-
tance. To some degree, it is a valid but it is not universally correct. Regardless to the
accuracy of the idea, it will be examined here. The rectangular cross section has width
of b and two sides with height of h. The wetted perimeter length is

                                             A                     (17.65)
                         P = b+2h = h +2h
756                                              CHAPTER 17. OPEN CHANNEL FLOW

where P denotes the wetted perimeter. The minimum wetted perimeter will at the
derivative equal zero.

               dP dh = - h2 A + 2 = - he b + 2 = - b + 2 h2g h  (17.66)

Which is h = b/2. This analysis suggests that the closer to the optimal channel is when
the liquid height is designed for width is double height. This design will minimizes the
resistance area and hopefully reduces the construction cost.

       One of the concept when discussing non-circular shape is the hydraulic radius
which represents a similarity to circular conduit. In the context of the open channel
flow it is defined as

                                      Hydraulic Radius          (17.67)
                                                   A

                                          RH = P

       The analysis of the optimal rectangular suggest that shapes that are closer to
circle are more optimal. For example, the trapezoidal cross section can be used as an
example. The closest trapezoidal shape to the circle is the shape that all the three sides
are equable which is a half of hexagon. Another example is triangular channel (see the
next example).

     Example 17.10: Optimal Triangle for OC                     Level: Basic

     A triangular open channel depicted in Fig. 17.27 the angle  is half of the total

     angle. For given amount of area find the optimal angle.

17.5 Energy For Non-Rectangular Cross-Section

In this section a discussion on the energy                b dh h
line for non-rectangular is offered. The
critical conditions can be found by gener-                sc      hc Uc2
alizing the energy equation. Eq. (17.16)                  c       2c
defines the specific energy for rectangular
shape. In that equation the averages veloc-                               H
ity was used and it will be modified to be
more general. Notice that q was replaced by   Fig. 17.28 - Specific energy lines for

have a flow rate per width. Notice the plug
flow is returned for simplification and  can
be used when velocity profile is accounted.
The velocity is replaced by U = Q/A to be

                                       U2     Q2
                  H = h + 2 g = h + 2 g A2                                (17.68)

The head loss is

                  H2                                H1

                  Q22                         Q12                         (17.69)
Ew2 - Ew1 = 2 A2 + h2 +H02 - 2 A2 + h1 +H01

While geometry of the cross section was not provided yet, the specific energy is a
function of flow depth H = f (h). If the cross section geometry is provided and for
known flow rate, Q, the specific energy can be calculated. The derivative of Eq. (17.68)
yield

                  dH                       2 Q2 dA                        (17.70)
                  dh = 1 - 2 g A3 dt

As opposed the rectangular case, another term was added. It can be noticed that ratio
of dA/dh can be only positive. The area cannot decrease with the increase of the height
at most it can be zero if the width is zero. At the surface, the differential infinitesimal
element is the width times the change of the height, b dh. Thus,

                  dA = bdh = b(h) = constant                              (17.71)

758                                   CHAPTER 17. OPEN CHANNEL FLOW

The value of b, in this case, refers to the value at the free surface width at the cross
section. Hence Eq. (17.70) reads now

                                  dH  =1-  e2 Q2 b                                  (17.72)

                                       gb

Or Eq. (17.73) can be rearranged as

                                                                     U2             (17.74)

                                                Q2 g A
                                                A2 = b
It is common to define the hydraulic diameter as

                       Hydraulic diameter, hD                                       (17.75)
                                        A

                                hD = b

With this definition, Eq. (17.75), Eq. (17.74) becomes

                       U 2 = g hD - U = g hD                                        (17.76)

Thus similar to the rectangular case, using the definition of hydraulic diameter F r at
the critical condition is one.

                                  Critical Fr number NR                             (17.77)
                                    F rc = Uc = 1
                                                g hD

The maximum flow rate can be obtained when H is constant. In other words, finding

the maximum flow for a fix specific energy is done similarly as before. Eq. (17.68) can

be written as

                                                                                    (17.78)
               Q = 2 g A2 (H - h) = 2 g A H - h

The derivative of Eq. (17.78) is

               dQ      2 g dA H - h -  A = 0                                        (17.79)
                    =             dh                                     2 H-h

               dh

Equating Eq. (17.79) to zero (to get the maximum) and using the value of dA/dh = b
provides

               b H - h =  A - H - h = A                                             (17.80)
                                  2 H-h                                         2b
17.5. ENERGY FOR NON-RECTANGULAR CROSS-SECTION                               759

This results is the critical condition substitute into Eq. (17.78) and can be written as

                                   Critical Flow Rate

Q2 = 2 g A3 = g A3 - Q2 = A3                                                 (17.81)
                                   2b       b           g b(h)

It should be noted that b is unknown but if it is obtained or known, there is a critical
and maximum flow rate at that location. Eq. (17.81) is not linear equation because b
is not a constant, the line representing this phenomenon not necessarily a straight line
for all geometry. For instance b = a h2 is parabolic is more common that one expect
and in that case it not a linear equation. In general it can be written as

Q2 b                                   Q2b                 3 Q2              (17.82)

For the rectangular shape the specific energy is

                                       H = h U c + c2                        (17.83)
                                                    2g

in general the specific energy is

                                                   Q2                        (17.84)
                                   Hc = hc + 2 g A2

Substituting Eq. (17.82) into Eq. (17.84)

                                   Hc = hc +    Q2                           (17.85)

                           Hc = hc + 2 g A2

According to Eq. (17.86) Q2/g can be replaced by A3/b and thus Eq. (17.90) becomes

     Hc = hc +                b  2 - Hc = hc +                    A            (17.91)

The generalize the treatment and to have general equations that can be used in a
general way (as possible) the following is offered. The expression A/b is a function
of the depth h for a given channel geometry. It is convenient to define

It also can be defined for the critical conditions

                           Zc = Ac Ac                                          (17.95)
                                          b

Squaring both sides results of Eq. (17.95) results in

                                     b

For critical conditions Eq. (17.73) is valid and can be used with Eq. (17.96)

17.5.2 General Points that Needed to be Mentioned

The friction coefficient was mentioned earlier with minimal discussion. without break
the flow of the presentation in this chapter has to be included which several point like
flow regimes.

17.5.2.1 Flow Regimes

It is commonly believe that Reynolds number determine the flow regime. To large
extend is correct but the reader should be surprised that it is not exact and also other
factors affect the flow regimes. As the rule of thumb, the Reynolds number, as first
approximation the determining factor. The Reynolds commonly defined as

                             U R U R                                       (17.101)

Re  500, the flow is laminar

Re > 2000, the flow is turbulent.

       The Reynolds also have two additional limits. The upper limits for open channels
normally refer to large river like the amazon and perhaps it is the larger in some sense.
At this size some of the models described are not applicable because sheer size which
introduce additional issue like 3-dimensional flow etc. Can the Amazon be considered
as an open channel flow? in very limited sense. Additionally, when Reynolds number is
very small a new parameter has stronger influence which is the surface tension. There
are papers that dealing Reynolds number approaching zero, These paper are example of
prime fantasy. There is no such thing, as every can observe the streaks in the windshield
in a rainy days.

17.6 Qualitative Questions

     There is the quantity that remains in both step change of height and change
       of width in open channel. Is the quantity is the same and if not what is the
       difference?

     Why H is assumed to be constant under certain conditions. why and when?

     What is the reason that many shapes better records to move liquid in open channel
       as compared to rectangular?

Example 17.11: Given Specific Energy                             Level: Simple

A specific energy of a channel is given as 2.4[m]. The rectangular channel has
width of 6[m]. What is the maximum total flow rate that is possible for this
conditions.

Solution

It was the relationship for rectangular channel for the maximum flow rate is

                                  yc = 2 H = 2.4  2/3 = 1.8[m]               (17.11.a)

Open channel with parabolic section that obey the law b = h2. It was observed

that the critical height for certain energy condition to be 1.4[m]. Calculate the

total discharge in the channel.

Solution

The given height also provides the width at point as

                             b = h2 = 1.42 = 1.96[m]                          (17.12.a)

A The Mathematics Backgrounds for Fluid

                                   Mechanics

In this appendix a review of selected topics in mathematics related to fluid mechanics is
presented. These topics are present so that one with some minimal background could
deal with the mathematics that encompass within basic fluid mechanics. Hence without
additional reading, this book on fluid mechanics issues could be read by most readers.
This appendix condenses material that spread in many various textbooks some of which
are advance. Furthermore, some of the material appears in specialty books such as third
order differential equations (and thus it is expected that the student is not familiar with
this material.). There is very minimal original material which appears without proofs.
The material is not presented in "educational" order but in importance order.

       Vectors have some what similar rules to scalars which will be discussed in the next
section.

A.1.1 Vector Algebra

Vectors obey several standard mathematical operations which are applicable to scalars.
The following are vectors, U , V , and W and for in this discussion a and b are scalars.
Then the following can be said

1. (U + V ) + W = (U + V + W ) = U + (V + W )

2. U + V = V + U

3. Zero vector is such that U + 0 = U

4. Additive inverse U - U = 0

5. a (U + V ) = a U + a V

6. a (b U ) = a b U

       The multiplications and the divisions have                          W
somewhat different meaning in a scalar operations.                                 V
There are two kinds of multiplications for vectors.
The first multiplication is the "dot" product which                                U
is defined by equation (A.4). The results of this
multiplication is scalar but has no negative value
as in regular scalar multiplication.

                     regular scalar           angle                Fig. A.2 - The right hand rule, mul-
                     multiplication           between                   tiplication of U  V results in W .
                                              vectors
     U  V = |U |  |V |                               (A.4)
                                     cos ((U , V ))

       The second multiplication is the "cross" product which in vector as opposed to
a scalar as in the "dot" product. The "cross" product is defined in an orthogonal
coordinate (h1, h2, and h3) as

                                                          angle

                                     U  V = |U |  |V | sin ((U , V )) n             (A.5)
A.1. VECTORS                                                          767

where  is the angle between U and V , and n is a unit vector perpendicular to both U
and V which obeys the right hand rule. The right hand rule is referred to the direction
of resulting vector. Note that U and V are not necessarily orthogonal. Additionally
note that order of multiplication is significant. This multiplication has a negative value
which means that it is a change of the direction.

       One of the consequence of this definitions in Cartesian coordinates is

                                  2    2  2                           (A.6)
                                  i =j =k =0

In general for orthogonal coordinates this condition is written as

                                     2    2            2              (A.7)
              h1  h1 = h1 = h2 = h3 = 0

where hi is the unit vector in the orthogonal system.
      In right hand orthogonal coordinate system

              h1  h2 = h3                h2  h1 = -h3               (A.8)
              h2  h3 = h1                h3  h2 = -h1
              h3  h1 = h2                h1  h3 = -h2

The "cross" product can be written as

U  V = (U2 V3 - U3 V2) h1 + (U3 V1 - U1 V3) h2 + (U1 V2 - U2 V1) h3   (A.9)
                                                                      (A.10)
Equation (A.9) in matrix form as

                                                          

                                      h1 h2 h3 
                                                          
              U  V =  U2 U2 U3 
                                                          

                                          V2 V2 V3

       The most complex of all these algebraic operations is the division. The multipli-
cation in vector world have two definition one which results in a scalar and one which
results in a vector. Multiplication combinations shows that there are at least four pos-
sibilities of combining the angle with scalar and vector. The reason that these current
combinations, that is scalar associated with cos  vectors is associated with sin , is
that these combinations have physical meaning. The previous experience is that help
to define multiplication help to definition the division. The number of the possible
combinations of the division is very large. For example, the result of the division can
be a scalar combined or associated with the angle (with cos or sin), or vector with the
angle, etc. However, these above four combinations are not the only possibilities (not
including the left hand system). It turn out that these combinations have very little1

    1This author did find any physical meaning these combinations but there could be and those the
word "little" is used.
768       APPENDIX A. MATHEMATICS FOR FLUID MECHANICS

physical meaning. Additional possibility is that every combination of one vector element

is divided by the other vector element. Since every vector element has three possible

elements the total combination is 9 = 3  3. There at least are two possibilities how

to treat these elements. It turned out that combination of three vectors has a physical

meaning. The three vectors have a need for additional notation such of vector of vector

which is referred to as a tensor. The following combination is commonly suggested

                                         

           U1    U2  U3 
                                         
           V1    V1  V1 
                                         
          U  U1  U2  U3 
             =                             (A.11)
          V  V2 V2 V2 
           U1    U2  U3 

            V3   V3  V3

One such example of this division is the pressure which the explanation is commonality
avoided or eliminated from the fluid mechanics books including the direct approach in
this book.

       This tenser or the matrix can undergo regular linear algebra operations such as
finding the eigenvalue values and the eigen "vectors." Also note the multiplying matrices
and inverse matrix are also available operation to these tensors.

A.1.2 Differential Operators of Vectors

Differential operations can act on scalar functions as well on vector and vector func-
tions. More differential operations can on scalar function can results in vector or vector
function. In multivariate calculus, derivatives of different directions can represented as
a vector or vector function. A compact presentation is a common way to handle the
mathematics which simplify the calculations and explanations. One of these operations
is nabla operator sometimes also called the "del operator." This operator is a differential
vector. For example, in Cartesian coordinates the operation is

           = ^i  + ^j  + k^                (A.12)
                 x y z

 Where ^i, ^j, and k^ are denoting unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.
Many of the operations of vector world, such as, the gradient, divergence, the curl, and
the Laplacian are based or could be constructed from this single operator.

Gradient

       This operation acts on a scalar function and results in a vector whose components
are derivatives in the principle directions of a coordinate system. A scalar function is a
function that provide a valued based on the coordinates (in Cartesian coordinates x,y,z).
For example, the temperature of the domain might be expressed as a scalar field.

                ^T ^T ^ T                  (A.13)
          =i +j +k

                  x y z
A.1. VECTORS                                                                 769

Divergence

       The same idea that was discussed in vector section there are two kinds of multipli-
cation in the vector world and two will be for the differential operators. The divergence
is the similar to "dot" product which results in scalar. A vector domain (function) as-
signs a vector to each point such as velocity for example, N , for Cartesian coordinates
is

N (x, y, z) = Nx(x, y, z)^i + Ny(x, y, z)^j + Nz(x, y, z)k^                  (A.14)

The dot product of these two vectors, in Cartesian coordinate is results in

              div N =   N = Nx + Ny + Nz                                    (A.15)
                                      x y z

 The divergence results in a scalar function which similar to the concept of the vectors
multiplication of the vectors magnitude by the cosine of the angle between the vectors.

Curl
       Similar to the "cross product" a similar operation can be defined for the nabla

(note the "right hand rule" notation) for Cartesian coordinate as

curl N =   N =  Nz Ny ^i+
                    -
                 y z
                                                                             (A.16)
                 Nx Nz ^ Ny Nx ^
                    -   j+           -       k
                 z x          x y

 Note that the result is a vector.

Laplacian
       The new operation can be constructed from "dot" multiplication of the nabla. A

gradient acting on a scalar field creates a vector field. Applying a divergence on the
result creates a scalar field again. This combined operations is known as the "div grad"
which is given in Cartesian coordinates by

                             2 2 2                                           (A.17)
                    = x2 + y2 + z2

 This combination is commonality denoted as 2. This operator also referred as the
Laplacian operator, in honor of Pierre-Simon Laplace (23 March 1749 - 5 March 1827).

Divergence Theorem

       Mathematicians call to or refer to a subset of The Reynolds Transport Theorem
as the Divergence Theorem, or called it Gauss' Theorem (Carl Friedrich Gauss 30 April
1777 - 23 February 1855), In Gauss notation it is written as

               (  N ) dV = N  n dA               (A.19)

            V              A

       In Gauss-Ostrogradsky Theorem (Mikhail Vasilievich Ostrogradsky (September
24, 1801 - January 1, 1862). The notation is a bit different from Gauss and it is
written in Ostrogradsky notation as

     P Q R                                         (A.20)
        ++     dx dy dz =       (P p + Qq + Rr) d
     V x y z
                              

Note the strange notation of "" which refers to the area. This theorem is applicable
for a fix control volume and the derivative can enters into the integral. Many engineering
class present this theorem as a theorem on its merit without realizing that it is a subset
of Reynolds Transport Theorem. This subset can further produces several interesting
identities. If N is a gradient of a scalar field (x, y, z) then it can insert into identity
to produce

        (  ()) dV =     2 dV =   n dA            (A.21)

     V                V                         A

 Since the definition of  = N .
       Special case of equation (A.21) for harmonic function (solutions Laplace equation

see2 Harmonic functions) then the left side vanishes which is useful identity for ideal flow
analysis. This results reduces equation, normally for steady state, to a balance of the
fluxes through the surface. Thus, the harmonic functions can be added or subtracted
because inside the volume these functions contributions is eliminated throughout the
volume.

A.1.3 Differentiation of the Vector Operations

The vector operation sometime fell under (time or other) derivative. The basic of these
relationships is explored. A vector is made of the several scalar functions such as

 R = f1(x1, x2, x3,    )e1 + f2(x1, x2, x3,    )e2 + f3(x1, x2, x3,    )e3 +    (A.22)

where ei is the unit vector in the i direction. The cross and dot products when the come
under differentiation can be look as scalar. For example, the dot product of operation

R  S = (x^i + y2^j)  (sin x^i + exp(y)^j) can be written as

               d (R  S ) d            x^i + y2^j  sin x^i + exp(y)^j
                        =
               dt              dt

It can be noticed that

d (R  S ) d   x sin x + y2 exp(y)
            =                             =

    dt                  dt

                               dx      sin x +  d sin x d y2            d y2
                                                      + exp(y) + exp(y)
                               dt                dt       dt            dt

It can be noticed that the manipulation of the simple above example obeys the regular
chain role. Similarly, it can done for the cross product. The results of operations of two
vectors is similar to regular multiplication since the vectors operation obey "regular"
addition and multiplication roles, the chain role is applicable. Hence, the chain role
apply for dot operation,

                            d                dR       dS                      (A.23)
                               (R  S ) =  S +  R
                           dt                dt       dt

And the chain role for the cross operation is

                        d              dR             dS                      (A.24)
                            (R  S ) =  S +  R
                        dt                   dt       dt

It follows that derivative (notice the similarity to scalar operations) of

                                   d   (R  R) = 2 R  dR

                                   dt                 at

 There are several identities that related to location, velocity, and acceleration. As in
operation on scalar time derivative of dot or cross of constant velocity is zero. Yet, the
most interesting is

                        d   (R  U ) = U  U + R         dU                  (A.25)

                        dt                                    dt

 The first part is zero because the cross product with itself is zero. The second part is
zero because Newton law (acceleration is along the path of R).

A.1.3.1 Orthogonal Coordinates

These vectors operations can appear in different orthogonal coordinates system. There
are several orthogonal coordinates which appears in fluid mechanics operation which
include this list: Cartesian coordinates, Cylindrical coordinates, Spherical coordinates,
Parabolic coordinates, Parabolic cylindrical coordinates Paraboloidal coordinates, Oblate
spheroidal coordinates, Prolate spheroidal coordinates, Ellipsoidal coordinates, Elliptic

cylindrical coordinates, Toroidal coordinates, Bispherical coordinates, Bipolar cylindrical
coordinates Conical coordinates, Flat-ring cyclide coordinates, Flat-disk cyclide coordi-
nates, Bi-cyclide coordinates and Cap-cyclide coordinates. Because there are so many
coordinates system is reasonable to develop these operations for any for any coordi-
nates system. Three common systems typical to fluid mechanics will be presented and
followed by a table and methods to present all the above equations.

Cylindrical Coordinates

       The cylindrical coordinates are common-           z
ality used in situations where there is line of                          e1
symmetry or kind of symmetry. This kind sit-
uations occur in pipe flow even if the pipe is                    y
not exactly symmetrical. These coordinates re-
duced the work, in most cases, because prob-                y r
lem is reduced a two dimensions. Historically,            x r
these coordinate were introduced for geometri-
                                                                  x

cal problems about 2000 years ago3. The cylin-

drical coordinates are shown in Figure A.3. In Fig. A.3 - Cylindrical Coordinate System.

the figure shows that the coordinates are r, ,
and z. Note that unite coordinates are denoted as r, , and z. The meaning of -r

and r are different. The first one represents the vector that is the direction of r while

the second is the unit vector in the direction of the coordinate r. These three different

rs are some what similar to any of the Cartesian coordinate. The second coordinate 

has unite coordinate . The new concept here is the length factor. The coordinate  is

angle. In this book the dimensional chapter shows that in physics that derivatives have

to have same units in order to compare them or use them. Conversation of the angel

to units of length is done by length factor which is, in this case, r. The conversion

between the Cartesian coordinate and the Cylindrical is

     r = x2 + y2                             y           z=z                 (A.26)

                                             x

The reverse transformation is

     x = r cos                 y = r sin                 z=z                 (A.27)

The line element and volume element are

     ds = dr2 + (r d)2 + dz2                             dr r d dz           (A.28)

The gradient in cylindrical coordinates is given by

                                1                                            (A.29)

A.2 Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)

In this section a brief summary of ODE is presented. It is not intent to be a replacement
to a standard textbook but as a quick reference. It is suggested that the reader interested
in depth information should read "Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems"
by Boyce de-Prima or any other book in this area. Ordinary differential equations are
defined by the order of the highest derivative. If the highest derivative is first order the
equation is referred as first order differential equation etc. Note that the derivatives are
integers e.g. first derivative, second derivative etc4. ODE are categorized into linear
and non-linear equations. The meaning of linear equation is that the operation is such
that

                             a L (u1) + b L (u2) = L (a u1 + b u2)                           (A.46)

An example of such linear operation L =         d   +   1  acting  on  y  is   dt dy1 + y1.  Or this
                                                dt
                        dy2
operation  on   y2  is   dt  + y2  and  the  summation  of    operation   the  sum  operation  of

L(y1  + y2)  =  y1 +y2  + y1  + y2.
                   dt

A.2.1 First Order Differential Equations

As expect, the first ODEs are easier to solve and they are the base for equations of
higher order equation. The first order equations have several forms and there is no one
solution fit all but families of solutions. The most general form is

                                               du                                            (A.47)

                                                dt

    4Note that mathematically, it is possible to define fraction of derivative. However, there is no
physical meaning to such a product according to this author believe.
A.2. ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (ODE)                            777
 Sometimes equation (A.47) can be simplified to the first form as  (A.48)

                                              du
                                                   = F (t, u)

                                              dt

A.2.2 Variables Separation or Segregation

In some cases equation (A.48) can be written as F (t, u) = X(t) U (u). In that case it
is said that F is spreadable and then equation (A.48) can be written as

                               du                                  (A.49)
                                     = X(t)dt

                              U (u)

Equation can be integrated either analytically or numerically and the solution is

                               du                     X (t)dt      (A.50)
                                     =

                              U (u)

The limits of the integral is (are) the initial condition(s). The initial condition is the
value the function has at some points. The name initial condition is used because the
values are given commonly at initial time.

Example A.1:

Solve the following equation

                                        du                         (1.I.a)
                                            = ut

                                        dt

with the initial condition u(t = 0) = u0.

Solution

The solution can be obtained by the variable separation method. The separation yields

                                               du                  (1.I.b)
                                                    = t dt

                                                u
The integration of equation (1.I.b) becomes

              du                                              t2   (1.I.c)
                  =           t dt = ln (u) + ln (c) =

              u                                                2

Equation (1.I.c) can be transferred to

                                        u = c et2                  (1.I.d)

For the initial condition of u(0) = u0 then                        (1.I.e)
                                               u = u0 et2

A.2.2.1 The Integral Factor Equations

Another method is referred to as integration factor which deals with a limited but very
important class of equations. This family is part of a linear equations. The general form
of the equation is

                                         dy                                                          (A.51)
                                             + g(x) y = m(x)

                                        dx
Multiplying equation (A.51) by unknown function N (x) transformed it to

                                     dy                                                              (A.52)
                             N (x) + N (x) g(x) y = N (x)m(x)

                                     dx
What is needed from N (x) is to provide a full differential such as

         dy                                        d [N (x) g(x) y]                                  (A.53)
     N (x) + N (x) g(x) y =
         dx                                                                               dx

This condition (note that the previous methods is employed here) requires that

     d N (x)  = N (x) g(x) =                       d N (x)                                = g(x) dx  (A.54)

     dx                                            N (x)

Equation (A.54) is integrated to be

                                                        g(x)dx                                       (A.55)

     ln (N (x)) = g(x)dx = N (x) = e

Using the differentiation chain rule provides

                                               dv
                                               du

              d N (x) = e                                            du                              (A.56)
                                                                                                     (A.57)
                dx                             g(x)dx dx
                                                        g(x)

which indeed satisfy equation (A.53). Thus equation (A.52) becomes

                                   d [N (x) g(x) y]
                                                       = N (x) m(x)

                                           dx
Multiplying equation (A.57) by dx and integrating results in

         N (x) g(x) y = N (x) m(x) dx                                                                (A.58)

 The solution is then                                                                                (A.59)
                                                  N (x) m(x) dx

                                        y=

                                 g(x) e g(x)dx

                                                                                   N (x)

A special case of g(t) = constant is shown next.

Find the solution for a typical problem in fluid mechanics (the problem of Stoke flow or
the parachute problem) of

                                                    +y = 1

                                               dx

Solution

Substituting m(x) = 1 and g(x) = 1 into equation (A.59) provides

                        y = e-x (ex + c) = 1 + c e-x

                            End Solution

A.2.3 Non-Linear Equations

Non-Linear equations are equations that the power of the function or the function
derivative is not equal to one or their combination. Many non linear equations can be
transformed into linear equations and then solved with the linear equation techniques.
One such equation family is referred in the literature as the Bernoulli Equations5. This
equation is

                                                          non-linear  (A.60)

                                                          part

                       du + m(t)u = n(t) up
                       dt

The transformation v = u1-p turns equation (A.60) into a linear equation which is

                       dv                                             (A.61)
                           + (1 - p) m(t) v = (1 - p) n(t)

                       dt

The linearized equation can be solved using the linear methods. The actual solution is
obtained by reversed equation which transferred solution to

                       u = v(p-1)                                     (A.62)

Example A.3:                                                          (1.III.a)
Solve the following Bernoulli equation

                                         du + t2 u = sin(t) u3
                                         dt

Solution

The transformation is

                            v = u2                                    (1.III.b)

5Not to be confused with the Bernoulli equation without the s that referred to the energy equation.
780                 APPENDIX A. MATHEMATICS FOR FLUID MECHANICS

Using the definition (1.III.b) equation (1.III.a) becomes

                                 1-p                  1-p

                             dv -2 t2 v = -2 sin(t)                     (1.III.c)
                             dt

The homogeneous solution of equation (1.III.c) is

                                                          -t3           (1.III.d)

                                  u(t) = ce 3

And the general solution is                    private solution 

                                                  t3                  
                                         t3                             (1.III.e)
                                               e 3 sin (t) dt +c
              u = e- 3 
                                             

                                               End Solution

A.2.3.1 Homogeneous Equations

Homogeneous function is given as

                             du                                         (A.63)
                                 = f (u, t) = f (a u, a t)

                             dt

for any real positive a. For this case, the transformation of u = v t transforms equation
(A.63) into

                                   dv                                   (A.64)
                                  t + v = f (1, v)

                                    dt

In another words if the substitution u = v t is inserted the function f become a function
of only v it is homogeneous function. Example of such case u = u3 - t3 /t3 becomes
u = v3 + 1 . The solution is then

                             ln |t| =               dv                  (A.65)
                                                             +c

                                               f (1, v) - v

Example A.4:
Solve the equation

                             du                u             u4 - t4    (1.IV.a)
                             dt = sin t + t4

Solution
Substituting u = v T yields

                                 du = sin (v) + v4 - 1                  (1.IV.b)

A.2. ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (ODE)                                                                            781
                                                                                                                 (1.IV.c)
or  t dv + v = sin (v) + v4 - 1 = t dv = sin (v) + v4 - 1 - v                                                    (1.IV.d)
                                                                                                                 (1.IV.e)
             dt                           dt

Now equation (1.IV.c) can be solved by variable separation as

                                    dv
                         sin (v) + v4 - 1 - v = t dt

Integrating equation (1.IV.d) results in

                         dv                                    t2
                         sin (v) + v4 - 1 - v = 2 + c

The initial condition can be inserted via the boundary of the integral.

                                                                                                   End Solution

A.2.3.2 Variables Separable Equations

In fluid mechanics and many other fields there are differential equations that referred
to variables separable equations. In fact, this kind of class of equations appears all over
this book. For this sort equations, it can be written that

                         du                                                                                      (A.66)
                             = f (t)g(u)

                         dt

The main point is that f (t) and be segregated from g(u). The solution of this kind of

equation is

                          du                  f (t) dt                                                           (A.67)
                               =

                         g(u)

Example A.5:
Solve the following ODE

                         du = -u2 t2                                                                             (1.V.a)

A.2.3.3 Other Equations

There are equations or methods that were not covered by the above methods. There
are additional methods such numerical analysis, transformation (like Laplace transform),
variable substitutions, and perturbation methods. Many of these methods will be even-
tually covered by this appendix.

A.2.4 Second Order Differential Equations

The general idea of solving second order ODE is by converting them into first order
ODE. One such case is the second order ODE with constant coefficients.

       The simplest equations are with constant coefficients such as

                          d2u du                         (A.68)
                        a dt2 + b dt + c u = 0

 In a way, the second order ODE is transferred to first order by substituting the one
linear operator to two first linear operators. Practically, it is done by substituting est

where s is characteristic constant and results in the quadratic equation

                        a s2 + b s + s = 0               (A.69)

 If b2 > 4 a c then there are two unique solutions for the quadratic equation and the
general solution form is

                        u = c1 es1 t + c2 es2 t          (A.70)

For the case of b2 = 4 a c the general solution is

                        u = c1 es1 t + c2 t es1 t        (A.71)

 In the case of b2 > 4 a c, the solution of the quadratic equation is a complex number
which means that the solution has exponential and trigonometric functions as

                        u = c1e t cos(t) + c2e t sin(t)  (A.72)

Where the real part is

                              -b                         (A.73)

and the imaginary number is

Example A.6:
Solve the following ODE

                                d2u du                                           (1.VI.a)
                                dt2 + 7 dt + 10 u = 0

Solution

The characteristic equation is

                                s2 + 7 s + 10 = 0                                (1.VI.b)
                                                                                 (1.VI.c)
The solution of equation (1.VI.b) are -2, and -5. Thus, the solution is

                                u = k1 e-2 t + k2 e-5 t

                                End Solution

A.2.4.1 Non-Homogeneous Second ODE

Homogeneous equation are equations that equal to zero. This fact can be used to solve
non-homogeneous equation. Equations that not equal to zero in this form

                                  d2u du                                         (A.75)
                                a dt2 + b dt + c u = l(x)

 The solution of the homogeneous equation is zero that is the operation L(uh) = 0,
where L is Linear operator. The additional solution of L(up) is the total solution as

                                    =0                                           (A.76)

          L (utotal) = L (uh) +L (up) = utotal = uh + up

Where the solution uh is the solution of the homogeneous solution and up is the solution
of the particular function l(x). If the function on the right hand side is polynomial than
the solution is will

                                                           n                     (A.77)

                                utotal = uh + upi

                                                          i=1

The linearity of the operation creates the possibility of adding the solutions.

                                                   36

A.2.5 Non-Linear Second Order Equations

Some of the techniques that were discussed in the previous section (first order ODE)
can be used for the second order ODE such as the variable separation.

A.2.5.1 Segregation of Derivatives

If the second order equation

                                       f (u, u , u) = 0

can be written or presented in the form

                                       f1(u)u = f2 (u ) u               (A.78)

then the equation (A.78) is referred to as a separable equation (some called it segregated
equations). The derivative of u can be treated as a new function v and v = u. Hence,
equation (A.78) can be integrated

                        u               u                    v           (A.79)

                          f1(u)u =        f2 (u ) u =         f2 (u) v

                       u0              u 0                  v0
A.2. ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (ODE)                                                       785

The integration results in a first order differential equation which should be dealt with
the previous methods. It can be noticed that the function initial condition is used
twice; first with initial integration and second with the second integration. Note that
the derivative initial condition is used once. The physical reason is that the equa-
tion represents a strong effect of the function at a certain point such surface tension
problems. This equation family is not well discussed in mathematical textbooks6.

Example A.8:
Solve the equation

                                 du                  du d2u
                                    u dt - sin dt dt2 = 0

With   the  initial  condition  of  u(0)  =  0  and  du  (t = 0)    =  0  What  happen  to  the  extra
                                                     dt

"dt"?

Solution

Rearranging the ODE to be

                                 du             du d du                                     (1.VIII.a)
                                    u = sin                                                 (1.VIII.b)
                                    &dt              dt &dt dt                              (1.VIII.c)

Thus the extra dt is disappeared and equation (1.VIII.a) becomes

                                                sin  du         d   du
                                  u du =
                                                         dt         dt

and transformation to v is

                                    
                                      u du = sin (v) dv

After the integration equation (1.VIII.c) becomes

       2 u 23 - u0 23 = cos (v0) - cos (v) = cos du0 - cos du                               (1.VIII.d)
       3                                                        dt              dt

Equation (1.VIII.d) can be rearranged as

                     du                      2  3            3                              (A.80)
                     dt = arcsin 3 u0 2 - u 2 + cos (v0)

Using the first order separation method yields

                      t             u   du                                                  (A.81)

                       dt =     arcsin u0  2 u0 23 -u 23  + cos (v0)
                                               3
                     0

                                          dt

 where a is constant. One solution is u = k1 and the second solution is obtained by
solving

                                       a = d t d t2

The  transform  of  v  =  du  results  in
                          dt

                              1 dv dt                           (A.84)
                                       = v = = v dv
                              a dt                 a

which can be solved with the previous methods.
      Bifurcation to two solutions leads

                          ta + c = 21 v2 = dudt =  2 ta + c1   (A.85)

which can be integrated as

                                                             3

                    u =  a + c1 dt =  3 a + c1 + c2           (A.86)

A.2.5.3 Energy Equation ODE

It is non-linear because the second derivative is square and the function multiply the
second derivative.

                                          d2u      du 2         (A.87)
                              u d t2 + d t = 0

It can be noticed that that c2 is actually two different constants because the plus minus
signs.

                                                                        (A.90)

 Further rearrangement and integration leads to the solution which is  (1.IX.b)

A.2.6 Third Order Differential Equation

There are situations where fluid mechanics7 leads to third order differential equation.
This kind of differential equation has been studied in the last 30 years to some degree.
The solution to constant coefficients is relatively simple and will be presented here.
Solution to more complicate linear equations with non constant coefficient (function of
t) can be solved sometimes by Laplace transform or reduction of the equation to second
order Olivier Vallee8.

       The general form for constant coefficient is

                           d3u d2u du                                  (A.91)

order polonium has always one real solution. Thus, derivation of the leading equation
(results of the ode) is reduced into quadratic equation and thus the same situation exist.

                                                            (A.96)
and              s3 = - 1 a1 - 21 (S + T ) - 21 i3(S - T )

and where the D is defined as

                               D = Q3 + R2                  (A.98)

and where the definitions of Q and R are

                               Q = 3a2 - a12                (A.99)
                                           9

and

                 R = 9a1a2 - 27a3 - 2a13                    (A.100)
                                   54

Only three roots can exist for the Mach angle, . From a mathematical point of view,
if D > 0, one root is real and two roots are complex. For the case D = 0, all the roots
are real and at least two are identical. In the last case where D < 0, all the roots are
real and unequal.

       When the characteristic equation solution has three different real roots the solu-
tion of the differential equation is

                 u = c1 es1 t + c2 es2 t + c3 es3 t         (A.101)
A.2. ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (ODE)                                        789

In the case the solution to the characteristic has two identical real roots

                      u = (c1 + c2 t) es1 t + c3 es2 t                       (A.102)

Similarly derivations for the case of three identical real roots. For the case of only one
real root, the solution is

                      u = (c1 sin b1 + c2 cos b1) ea1t + c3es3t              (A.103)

Where a1 is the real part of the complex root and b1 imaginary part of the root.

A.2.7 Forth and Higher Order ODE

The ODE and partial differential equations (PDE) can be of any integer order. Some-
times the ODE is fourth order or higher the general solution is based in idea that
equation is reduced into a lower order. Generally, for constant coefficients ODE can
be transformed into multiplication of smaller order linear operations. For example, the
equation

                      d4u            d4                                      (A.104)
                      dt4 - u = 0 =  dt4 - 1 u = 0

can be written as combination of

d2       d2                          d2          d2                          (A.105)
dt2 - 1  dt2 + 1 u = 0 or            dt2 + 1     dt2 - 1 u = 0

 The order of operation is irrelevant as shown in equation (A.105). Thus the solution
of

                                  d2                                         (A.106)
                                  dt2 + 1 u = 0

with the solution of

                                  d2                                         (A.107)
                                  dt2 - 1 u = 0

 are the solutions of (A.104). The solution of equation (A.106) and equation (A.107)
was discussed earlier.

       The general procedure is based on the above concept but is some what simpler.
Inserting es t into the ODE

an u(n) + an-1 u(n-1) + an-2 u(n-2) +    + a1 u + a0 u = 0                (A.108)

yields characteristic equation

         an sn + an-1 sn-1 + an-2 sn-2 +    + a1 s + a0 = 0               (A.109)

Example A.10:

Solve the fifth order ODE

               d5u  d4u         d3u       d2u           du          (1.X.a)
               dt5 - 11 dt4 + 57 dt3 - 149 dt2 + 192 dt - 90 u = 0

Solution

The characteristic equation is

                    s5 - 11 s4 + 57 s3 - 149 s2 + 192 s - 90 = 0    (1.X.b)

 With the roots of the equation (1.X.b) (these roots can be found using numerical
methods or Descartes' Rule) are

                                s1,2 = 3  3 i                      (1.X.c)
                                s3,4 = 2  i

                                s5 = 1

 The roots are two pairs of complex numbers and one real number. Thus the solution
is

A.3 Partial Differential Equations

Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are differential equations which include function
includes the partial derivatives of two or more variables. Example of such equation is

                                          F (ut, ux, . . .) = 0                              (A.111)

 Where subscripts refers to derivative based on it. For example, ux = x u . Note that
partial derivative also include mix of derivatives such as uxy. As one might expect PDE
are harder to solve.

       Many situations in fluid mechanics can be described by PDE equations. Gener-
ally, the PDE solution is done by transforming the PDE to one or more ODE. Partial
differential equations are categorized by the order of highest derivative. The nature of
the solution is based whether the equation is elliptic parabolic and hyperbolic. Nor-
mally, this characterization is done for for second order. However, sometimes similar
definition can be applied for other order. The physical meaning of the these definition is
that these equations have different characterizations. The solution of elliptic equations
depends on the boundary conditions The solution of parabolic equations depends on
the boundary conditions but as well on the initial conditions. The hyperbolic equations
are associated with method of characteristics because physical situations depends only
on the initial conditions. The meaning for initial conditions is that of solution depends
on some early points of the flow (the solution). The general second-order PDE in two
independent variables has the form

                       axx uxx + 2axy uxy + ayy uyy +    = 0                              (A.112)

 The coefficients axx, axy, ayy might depend upon "x" and "y". Equation (A.112) is
similar to the equations for a conic geometry:

                              axx x2 + axy x y + ayy y2 +    = 0                          (A.113)

In the same manner that conic geometry equations are classified are based on the

discriminant  a2    -  4 axx  ayy ,  the  same  can  be  done    for  a  second-order  PDE.  The  dis-

                xy

criminant can be function of the x and y and thus can change sign and thus the

characteristic of the equation. Generally, when the discriminant is zero the equation are

called parabolic. One example of such equation is heat equation. When the discriminant
792                      APPENDIX A. MATHEMATICS FOR FLUID MECHANICS

is larger then zero the equation is referred as hyperbolic equations. In fluid mechanics
this kind equation appear in supersonic flow or in supper critical flow in open channel
flow. The equations that not mentioned above are elliptic which appear in ideal flow
and subsonic flow and sub critical open channel flow.

A.3.1 First-order equations

First order equation can be written as

                                        u  u               (A.114)
                         u = ax x + ay x + . . .

 The interpretation the equation characteristic is complicated. However, the physics
dictates this character and will be used in the book.

       An example of first order equation is

                                u u                        (A.115)
                                    + =0

                                x y

The solution is assume to be u = Y (y) X(x) and substitute into the (A.115) results in

                         Y (y)   X (x)  + X(x)  Y (y)  =0  (A.116)

                                x               y

Rearranging equation (A.116) yields

                         1 X(x) 1 Y (y)                    (A.117)
                                        +              =0
                         X(x) x Y (y) y

 A possible way the equation (A.117) can exist is that these two term equal to a
constant. Is it possible that these terms not equal to a constant? The answer is no
if the assumption of the solution is correct. If it turned that assumption is wrong the
ratio is not constant. Hence, the constant is denoted as  and with this definition the
PDE is reduced into two ODE. The first equation is X function

                                  1 X(x)                   (A.118)
                                                 =

                                X(x) x

The second ODE is for Y

                                  1 Y (y)                  (A.119)
                                                = -

                                Y (y) y

Equations (A.119) and (A.118) are ODE that can be solved with the methods described
before for certain boundary condition.
