                         Preface

The climate discussion seems to divide the world into opposing parties. The
discussions are increasingly dominated by emotions and opinions, rather than
exploring the fundamental causes of climate change. Over the past years our
focus has been on research and innovation in the field of sustainable design,
reprocessing waste into raw materials and making new products from waste.

This gave us leave to stay in our shelter, as it where: a niche where everyone
seemed enthusiastic about our ideas, and we did not have to take up a position in
the climate discussion. We set up projects up in collaboration with hospitals,
companies and universities; with people who were intrinsically interested in
investing their valuable time, and sometimes even money, to reuse waste and test
our sustainable designs. Our project felt like a magnet of enthusiasm, motivation
and positivism.

This had a positive impact on our results. New possibilities and techniques
emerged, where waste is seen as a raw material and circular principles are applied
to new products and processes. After all, humans are more susceptible to positive
developments than negative ones. The climate discussion often causes fear - fear
of temperature rise, of floods, of drought. The very word "crisis", used to direct
discussions in a certain direction, is perhaps the biggest pitfall in the climate
discussion.

Behavioral studies show that engagement is higher with positive framing than with
negative and neutral framing. Positively framed messages create engagement and
motivation. Perhaps this is the key to achieving climate goals. We operate in the
special world of healthcare, and are aiming in particular to make healthcare more
sustainable. The three authors of this book - which can be considered a follow-up
to Creating a Circular Healthcare - each look at sustainable care from their own
perspective: Bruno with his background as a lawyer, politician and administrator;
Bart as a healthcare entrepreneur, researcher and manager, and Tim as a
scientist, designer and health-tech valorization expert.

With this book we want to give the circular healthcare economy a platform for
making adequate decisions and policies. We want to show the possibilities that
are there, but also the contradictions and paradoxes. By combining our
perspectives, we describe how making healthcare (and other sectors) more
sustainable is not difficult at all. The ultimate goal is to ensure that we move
towards a zero-waste society, making us independent of raw materials, and having
a positive impact on the climate. The best thing is that this approach has the power
to connect and motivate people to add their own contribution.

                     Authors' note

Our previous book Creating a Circular Economy highlighted design principles and
methods. This book focusses on policies, vision and strategies and may be
regarded as a guide to circular (healthcare) economy tactics, smart policy-making
and design principles.

Why we wrote this book

To succeed in creating circular strategies which effectively reduce or even
eliminate waste streams, the best way is to build expertise, gain knowledge and
experience. In this book we offer examples of successful projects and describe
pitfalls and solutions to conquer challenges which you will face on the path to
sustainability. Important key elements are visualized through illustrations creating
a comprehensive overview of circular economy concepts.

When starting out in order to make an organization more sustainable or to develop
circular strategies, you might have many questions. Where do I want to start? What
are the challenges? What knowledge do I need? How can I find, select and involve
the right stakeholders and how can I motivate them to support the initiative? How
much energy or CO2 do I actually save with my actions? How do I measure the
sustainability levels in my new product or process? How do I get my team on board
and deal with resistance and opposing policies and guidelines?

In this book we want to address these questions by giving examples, describing
different perspectives and explaining them.

We want to help you develop your own vision in the field of sustainability and the
best way to translate this vision into a strategy to be implemented.

Your efforts are of great importance to make the world more sustainable and to
become less dependent on raw materials from other countries. Only with
willpower and a growing number of ambassadors can we make a difference.

Outline of the book

Part I describes circular principles and policy tactics.

Chapter 1 deals with the essentials of sustainable healthcare and describes the
paradoxes inherent in daily practices of sustainability and the circular economy.

In Chapter 2 the impact of leadership on policy is discussed, with examples of best
practices. The legislation and infrastructural web, in which many stakeholders and
circular economy initiatives are strangled, is described. Despite the fact that
politicians and policymakers are motivated to encourage sustainability, the
infrastructure is designed to discourage circular economy projects. This chapter
shows examples of setting up intrinsically motivated teams of hospital staff, green
teams, industry leaders and scientifically motivated research teams.

Chapter 3 discusses the legislation paradox. It describes how legislation should
be redesigned to accomplish the goals set out in the green deal and climate
legislation.

Part II has been written as a quick guide in creating a circular healthcare
system.

In chapter 4 the reader is guided through the fundamentals of circular strategies
by visualizing the circular economy.

Chapter 5 showcases successful design strategies for products and processes
which contribute to a zero-waste society.

In chapter 6 we will explore (surgical) waste as input for new products. Recycled
materials can and should be used more. This is a fundamental concept within
circular design principles, but hardly used until now.

Part III explores circular economy design principles on basis of successful
examples.

Chapter 7 is focuses on leading by design. Success stories of circular concepts
which have effectively changed the market with circular products and services are
described, and success stories of circular economy business models are
presented.

Chapter 8 investigates how to measure the effectiveness and impact of circular
economy products and processes. In particular, it discusses how reliable some
facts are which are used to sell products or introduce new policies or legislation:
how trustworthy is data from life cycle assessments (LCA's)? Circular Economy
principles, sustainability and, in the broader sense, the climate discussion seem
to trigger emotions. Using fundamental and reliable data is essential in order to be
able to judge whether a product or process indeed reduces CO2 emissions.

                      Introduction

Part I

The world is dominated by geopolitical developments often resulting in conflicts.
Behind these conflicts is often a desire for valuable raw materials. This is clearest
in wars, but also when trade barriers and import duties are imposed. The
dependence on raw materials creates limits that hinder human development. This
is why the circular economy is so important and why sustainable policies can
eventually create peace in the world. Part I discusses the importance of the
circular economy and why we should consider waste as a raw material. We also
discuss the importance and characteristics of leadership, legislation and policy in
a sustainable world, as strong leadership is needed to make this vision a reality.

Part II

The transition to a circular economy is a fundamental shift from the traditional
linear model of production and consumption. By focusing on design strategies that
prioritize sustainability, policymakers, businesses and consumers can work
together to create a zero-waste society. Visualizing this new economic model
helps stakeholders understand the flow of materials, the impact of waste
reduction, and the benefits of closing resource loops. Governments and industries
must integrate circular principles in policies and regulations to promote
sustainable manufacturing, efficient recycling systems and extended product life
cycles.

A key component of circular design is rethinking how products are created, used
and repurposed. By adopting innovative design strategies, companies can develop
goods that are durable, repairable and recyclable, reducing the need for raw
materials. Manufacturers must also consider modular and adaptable product
designs, making it easier to replace or upgrade parts, rather than discard broken
items. These changes not only minimize waste but also encourage businesses to
shift towards service-based models, such as leasing or refurbishing products
instead of selling disposable goods.

Recycled materials play a crucial role in closing the resource loop, turning waste
into valuable raw materials for new products. Industries can leverage waste
streams from various sectors, such as plastics, textiles and metals, to create high-
quality, sustainable alternatives. By investing in advanced recycling technologies
and infrastructure, society can increase material recovery and lower its
environmental footprint, realizing economic growth while preserving natural
resources.

Part III

Part III describes the assessment of the environmental impact of "green" products
through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a crucial method for evaluating
sustainability. LCA methodologies analyze the entire life cycle of a product, from
raw material extraction to disposal, identifying areas where environmental
improvements can be made. This capability to map life cycle stages and quantify
environmental impacts makes LCAs a powerful tool for informed decision-making,
whether comparing the environmental impact of existing products for sustainable
procurement or guiding eco-design for new products entering the market.
LCAs play a growing role in the surgical field for evaluating the environmental
sustainability of surgical instruments. LCAs are valued for their ability to capture
the full environmental footprint of products across their entire life cycle. Despite
their value, LCAs applied in the surgical instrumentation sector often yield
inconsistent and occasionally contradictory results, raising concerns about their
accurate execution and reliability in this field. The reliability of LCA results
depends on factors such as data quality, assumptions and system boundaries,
leading to potential risk factors in decision-making.
The last chapter discusses the vital role that technical universities play in driving
sustainability in hospitals by advancing LCA research, developing new eco-
friendly materials, and training future professionals to implement sustainable
healthcare solutions.

The essentials of sustainable principles and
the circular economy paradox

Who cares which choices you make? Can you, as an individual, come up with
solutions that make the world more sustainable and circular? And how important
are your actions in this? Can we achieve collective solutions with our choices,
policies and initiatives? In the next chapters we will discuss how we can use policy
and decision-making effectively to achieve a society in which we produce less
waste.
Whether your individual choices create a circular and sustainable world depends
on whether your behavior makes an impact. It's your actions that matter and these
will be different for every person. The feeling that you are a tiny cog in the whole
and that you cannot change the system creates insecurity and perhaps
individualism and thus egoism. But through your behavior you can encourage
others to act the same. Thus, you may create collective behavior that influences
collective consciousness.
So, to make an impact through your actions, you must seek connection. After all,
you can increase your influence by working together, carefully choosing who you
work with. Because your actions can convince others to do the same. In a
pioneering role, you can be an example for everyone, for your children, your
environment, society. You can become a source of inspiration in many ways and
thus you can certainly make a difference as an individual.
The question then arises: what is good behavior and how do we measure that? Are
we pushing the right buttons or are we being misled by various interests and
groups? That is why it is very important to remain critical and make your own
choices, based on facts. Separate facts from emotions. Find a balance within
yourself between being a dreamer and a practical decision-maker. And above all,
keep your back straight and do not let others deviate you from your path.

1.1 Circular strategies in light of the climate discussion

A lot has been said and written about reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
Sometimes it seems like the climate debate is about nothing else. Yet opinions
differ widely; emotions run high and facts are often confused with opinions and
assumptions. We must be in favor of protecting the climate, but if you ask people
what the definition of "the climate", they remain silent or give different answers. It
is important in these types of discussions to stay close to fundamental questions.
Furthermore, it is important to know what we are talking about.

Todorov1 describes climate change as one of the most controversial and complex
definitions in meteorology. What are objective criteria which define climate
change? Werndl2 attempts to find a definition of climate and climate change, as
various definitions have been offered in climate science literature. She discusses
five definitions and argues that these definitions should meet five criteria,
including elements such as the application of the definition to the past, present
and future, as well as being mathematically confirmed. According to Werndl, the
definition "climate is the finite distribution over time under a certain regime of
varying external conditions" meets all of the defined the criteria.

NASA describes climate as the average of all regional climates in the world and
climate change as the change of average weather in a region or, on a broader scale,
on Earth.3 While weather is about short-term changes such as rain, sunshine and
drought, climate is the average over many years.

Climate change is affected by several factors, such as the orbit of the Earth, the
amount of energy coming from the sun, changes in the oceans and volcanic
eruptions. These are all natural causes of climate change.3

Climate change is not only caused by natural factors, but also by humans. This is
called anthropogenic global warming and started around 1750 during the
Industrial Revolution, with the burning of fossil fuels releasing CO and other
greenhouse gases. These gases are formed due to human activities such as
burning coal, oil and gas related to the production and consumption of energy,
deforestation, land use changes, livestock and other factors leading to the
emission of heat-trapping gases such as CO2.

According to NASA's climate scientist Peter Hildebrand, the current problem is
that in the pre-industrial age, CO2 levels responded to changes in temperature. If
the temperature increased, CO2 levels increased. If the temperature decreased,
CO2 levels also decreased. The reason for this was that if temperatures increased,
the whole biosphere accelerated and started to emit CO2, resulting in higher CO2
levels in the atmosphere.5

In the post-industrial age a change occurred. Increasing CO2 in the atmosphere
led to increased temperature. While the temperature was driving CO2 levels in pre-
industrial times, CO2 levels are driving temperature in the industrial era. This is an
entirely different physical-biological process, meaning a fundamental change in
the Earth's radiation balance. Although we have technology to combat the
increase in the Earth's temperature, this is often not used for political reasons.
Furthermore, climate change may not be the most urgent problem facing
humanity, but the depletion of scarce natural resources is.6 Scarcity of natural
resources is the basis for many geopolitical conflicts. Countries with valuable raw
materials can fall prey to other countries that want them, leading to conflicts,
(trade) wars and trade barriers.

This requires our immediate attention, as human population growth will lead to
increased consumption and production. Controlling this phenomenon should be
the major focus and responsibility of political leaders.

1.2 Valuable resources and potential for geopolitical conflicts

Critical and Strategic Raw Materials (CRMs) have large economic importance and
are essential to society. Yet, there is a high risk of disruptions in their supply, that
is why they are called `critical'. These materials are concentrated in specific
regions, as shown in Figure 1, making them vulnerable to exploitation by other
powers.

The ice-free zone of Greenland is rich in strategic minerals and rare earth elements
(REEs), which are critical for high-tech industries and the green energy transition,
such as uranium, iron ore, nickel, lithium and cobalt, all critical for battery
production.7

Ukraine is rich in critical and strategic minerals; it has the one of the largest
deposits of ilmenite in Europe, a primary source of titanium. Ukraine has,
furthermore, significant lithium reserves; other critical raw materials include
beryllium and natural graphite. Given these reserves, Ukraine has gained interest
from investors around the world and governments looking to secure these
supplies,8 making it potentially one of the wealthiest countries in Europe.8
However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was at least partially motivated by
a desire to gain control over these reserves.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) houses a very large supply of strategic
critical raw materials. The DRC extracts around 70% of the world's cobalt.9,10 High-
tech industries around the world depend on the DRC,9 especially since the
increasing demand for EV batteries and renewable energy storage is driving global
competition for cobalt. Most of the mines are controlled in the DRC by foreign
firms and influenced by foreign states.11 China has invested heavily in extraction
and mines in the DRC. China and the DRC are at the opposite ends of the supply
chain.12

In Sudan, different parties are in conflict, with one of the main reasons being gold.
Gold from "gold-conflict" zones such as Darfur has led to the term "conflict
minerals".13 Foreign investments and supplies of weapons are driven by
ownership claims to the nation's gold and uranium deposits and the supply of
mercenaries to Darfur.14 Where gold as a raw material should enrich the
population, it instead appears to be the source of conflict.

Countries in the Middle East and North Africa are considered to be the most
strategically regions for oil and gas. This region, representing only six percent of
the global population, contains 59% of the world's oil reserves and 45% of its gas
reserves.15

These are just a few of many examples of countries and regions where raw
materials are the basis for conflicts and territorial claims by governments who
seek domination over other countries for their valuable materials. Raw materials
that are strategically crucial for industries and technologies but have a high risk of
supply disruption due to scarcity, geopolitical dependence, or limited availability.
These materials are essential for sectors such as defense industry, renewable
energy, electronics, aerospace, and healthcare. The growing quest for critical raw
materials and energy is likely to reach unsustainable levels, posing risks to global
stability. A basis for potential change in world order by governments claiming
independent territories. Valuable resources that are disposed or incinerated after
use creating a further imbalance.

Many of these scarce materials are used in medical devices, making medical
waste streams valuable and worthwhile to explore for reusability. Using waste
streams as a source of raw material could have not only a positive impact on
reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. It also means that less energy is needed
to create new raw materials and that fewer materials end up in landfill or
incinerators. It also reduces geopolitical pressure on natural resource-rich areas
and reduces the risk of international conflict. However, there are further
advantages which are often forgotten, such as the prevention of waste in the
oceans, reducing their ability to absorb CO2.

Fundamental in this context is the discussion on the production and consumption
of minerals, which often seems ignored but is extremely important. Just as we use
fossil fuels on a massive scale, our mass consumption of natural resources
deserves attention. These supply of these resources in our Earth's crust is
decreasing at a disastrous pace. If we do anything for future generations, it must
be to use these increasingly scarce raw materials sparingly and with more care.

The circular economy can protect us from these negative developments, which is
why circular strategies are increasingly important for every individual, business
and nation.

In this book we focus on the principles of the circular economy, in particular with
the following purposes:

     Using waste as a raw material with the aim of reducing geopolitical
        interdependence;

     Reducing waste streams and, as a result,
     Create a positive impact on the climate.

1.3 The essentials of a circular healthcare economy
In life there are only a few fundamental aspects - one of them is to create
continuity. Our existence is about what we learn, how we adapt, and how we grow.
One of our goals in our individual and collective life is to continue to evolve by
learning. After decades of consumption and production of natural resources, we
finally learn to understand how we can reuse materials instead of disposing them
after use. Our consciousness has developed itself to become aware of the
vulnerability of the Earth's natural environment.
The principles of the circular economy is an alternative to the traditional linear
economy: the system based on make, use, dispose. The circular economy aims
to achieve a `zero-waste' society, which is no longer generates waste. It aims to
keep resources in use again and again: make, use, reuse. The fundamental
principal is to recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of each
product life.
The circular healthcare economy is a derivative from the circular economy.17 In
healthcare, a circular economy is particularly necessary, as hospitals in the
western world have become waste factories. The annual hospital waste
production in the US exceeds five million tons per year,16 or over 13.000 tons of
waste every day.

economy: Circular strategies for sustainable healthcare. Delft University of
Technology.
Exploring the circular (healthcare) economy further, we can define its principles
from a technical perspective as:

                                                            36
1. Designing products and processes for longevity and reusability
Healthcare is a product- and energy-intensive sector. The healthcare sector in the
last decades saw a transformation from reusable devices to single-use devices,
so-called disposables. Furthermore, operating rooms and central sterilization and
services departments are built as clean room facilities, using large amounts of
energy and water. It is necessary to rethink product design for both surgical
devices as well as thermal washing machines and autoclaves, so their materials
can be (re)used as long as possible, and so that they minimize or reuse waste such
as energy or water, as these become increasingly scarce goods.
Essential in the circular healthcare economy is to design products or medical
devices so that they have a longer life cycle, can withstand repeated use, and
minimize waste. Furthermore, products or medical devices should be designed in
a modular way to facilitate easy repair, upgrading, reuse, disassembly and
recycling.
2. Resource efficiency of medical devices: efficient use of materials
One of the major problems for the next generations will be the availability of
minerals: elements from the periodic table of which there are very few left in the
Earth's crust.6
From a political point of view, more attention should be paid to this phenomenon
if we want to protect coming generations from exhausting these resources.
Optimizing the use of materials to reduce waste and energy consumption during
production or during the use phase of a product is therefore, an essential aspect
of the circular healthcare economy. Exploring the possibility of using renewable
resources and materials is essential.

                                                            37
3. Product life cycle extension
Maintenance and repair are powerful tools in the circular economy. Extending the
product life cycle is not only more eco-friendly, it also decreases costs for
hospitals.18 Providing services for maintaining and repairing medical devices as
part of standard policy creates a sustainable and cost-reducing organization.
Refurbishing and remanufacturing provide medical devices and equipment is
rather difficult in the medical field due to the CE guidelines. Safety certification is
expensive and takes a long time to organize. This is an area where policymakers
can help to reduce waste by legislation to facilitate refurbishment and
remanufacturing.

4. Reuse and sharing products and equipment
In contrast to the market mechanisms of the linear economy, the sharing economy
posits a change from the ownership of products to renting or leasing products.
Product as a Service (PaaS) requires a different mindset; its success depends on
the openness of suppliers, users, administrators and managers in hospitals.
5. Recycling and resource recovery
Effective recycling systems in healthcare ensure that medical waste is collected,
decontaminated when needed, and recycled into usable materials.
In the healthcare sector, large quantities of waste can be saved from the waste
pile or incinerator. Depending on the type of waste, recycling 1 kg of plastic
reduces emissions by ca. 3 kg CO2.19 Recycling 1 kg of steel reduces emissions by
ca. 2 kg CO2. A positive side effect is that the negative ecological effects like water
and air pollution associated with mining elements such as iron ore and oil are
prevented.
Ideally, a closed-loop system would create a process where waste materials are
reprocessed into new products. An example of such a product is the GO Jack
instrument opener, that we made from recycled blue wrap and used in hospitals
in the central sterilization and services department. The GO Jack (Figure 1) was
made and CE certified as first product in the world made out of hospital waste.20,21

6. Systemic perspective: a holistic approach
Systems thinking is an important aspect of the circular economy, not only for
designers of new products but also for those who make policies or are active in
procurement. This means that one sees the whole picture, holistically, from the
beginning of the product life cycle to the end, and considers the entire life cycle of
products and systems, recognizing the interconnectedness of economic,
environmental and social factors.
Holistic thinking also means acting holistically, in collaboration with multiple
stakeholders: designers, manufacturers, buyers, users, researchers and
governments, in order to collectively drive circular practices.
7. Policy and regulation
There are few fields where policy is as important as in healthcare. Particularly
because guidelines are not always clear about sustainability, reuse and recycling,
the efforts of policymakers are necessary to achieve a zero-waste society.
Supportive policies and regulations are needed that incentivize circular practices
as well as certifications that promote circular economy principles.
8. User engagement and education
Finally, it is very important to properly educate all those involved, not only to
implement best practices of the circular economy, but also to learn what is
important to them and how to verify whether a product is sustainable.
On the one hand, we need to collect information to determine to what extent
products are circular and contribute to reducing waste streams. On the other
hand, we need to stimulate behavior that promotes sustainable initiatives and
creates circular consumption patterns.
Implementing these essentials requires a comprehensive approach that
integrates design innovation, business models, supply chain management and
policy frameworks in order to transition towards a sustainable and resilient
circular economic system.

1.4 The circular economy paradox
We find paradoxes in all types of situations, including in claims about
sustainability and the application of circular principles - claims made by suppliers
and organizations, individuals and institutions. Not all of them will consciously
provide incorrect or paradoxical information, although many engage in
`greenwashing': consciously pretending to be greener than one is. However, many
people are not aware of the downside that such actions may bring.
Field study
To gain more insight into how businesses, management and policymakers arrive
at their decisions - in the context of sustainability - we conducted a study. This
was conducted in the form of a survey among healthcare executives, purchasing
managers and senior management in the industry. Decision-making can be highly
complex in organizational circumstances, as decision-makers are influenced by
different, often contradictory interests such as financial limitations, political
interests, ethical dilemmas, beliefs, social influences and cognitive factors. It was
interesting to explore how sustainability and circular economy factors influence
current board and management rooms.
A questionnaire regarding decision-making distributed among 275CEOs and
senior managers of medium to large businesses and managers and board
members of hospital organizations. The results shows that the following factors
are most often considered when making decisions regarding sustainability:
financial restrictions are for 43% of influence, organizational objectives 17% and
personal interests 7% (Figure 2a).

Financial restrictions  Organizational objectives  Personal interests

Figure 2a. Factors most considered when making decisions regarding
sustainability.

In 60% of cases, organizational objectives appear have the most influence on
decision-making in the board room. Personal values are relevant in 20% of cases.
In 13% of cases, the expectations of stakeholders or shareholders play a role
(Figure 2b). The respondents further reported that their decisions are based on
financial results in 47% of the cases and for 53% on political influences and public
opinions.

More than half (57%) admitted to have faced internal dilemmas between
sustainability, personal values and financial returns. 53% admitted finding it
difficult to guard against bias (ignore contrary evidence and seeking data that
confirms ones existing beliefs) in decision-making when it comes to sustainability
and circular economy principles.

To prevent against bias, the respondents indicated that they ask the opinions of
others as primary strategy, followed by gathering data and evaluating
consequences in the long term. Conflicting interests are the biggest challenge for
making sustainability decisions, due to time pressure; decision-makers often do
not get enough time to thoroughly investigate all the options before the decide.

Thus, the important elements in the decision-making process are: financial
results, organizational objectives, politics and public opinion. An important aspect
is so-called `confirmation bias'. This means that when we are convinced about a
certain mindset, our mind searches for information supporting those beliefs,
whether they are true or not.

This tendency to seek validation of our existing views can cloud our judgment,
especially in complex fields like sustainability, where data can be interpreted in
multiple ways. When such cognitive biases interact with real-world complexity, we
often encounter situations that defy our expectations or logic. This brings us to the
concept of a paradox--a seemingly contradictory phenomenon that challenges
our assumptions and forces us to think more critically.

                                      46
A paradox may be described as a phenomenon that appears to contradict itself.
Paradoxes not only contradict themselves; they also challenge our intellectual
capacities, as we realize that a situation is not as it seems or a specific outcome
is contradictory to the outcome which is claimed.

Paradoxes in some scientific studies are referred to as revealing complexities,
another truth or hidden messages in logical reasoning, language or reality.
Although paradoxes intend to create confusion and mislead us, studying and
unravelling them may result in increased philosophical knowledge and deeper
understanding. Typically, paradoxes present a conflict between different reasons
and objectives22,23 and are defined as `contradictory with interrelated elements'.24

For instance, it may seem sustainable to stimulate electric driving, as it has fewer
emissions than fossil fuel cars. However, electric driving also leads to harmful
cobalt and lithium mining, as these are needed for battery packs. This may in fact
cause more human and ecological damage and increased CO2 emissions,
especially as these materials are shipped to China for further reprocessing. This
creates an apparent paradox, which can only be solved by scientific research that
shows which type of car is the most sustainable.

Within the medical field, Figure 3 shows a multi stapler which can be powered by
hand (left) or by replaceable batterie packs (right). A manual stapler seems the
best option to improve sustainability and is cheaper. However, surgeons
suggested that the force needed to operate the manually-powered instrument can
lead to fatigue and physical injury. Whether this is true or not, this argument keeps
the less sustainable and more expensive option in the market. This mindset also
hinders attempts to design better manually-operated staplers which need less
force.

Therefore, the Circular Economy Paradox maybe regarded as a paradox where
certain sustainability and circular economy actions lead to further pollution. This
may lead to false conclusions with regard to how sustainable they are. In these
cases, further evidence shows that the claim that they lower CO2 emissions is
false. Thus, the circular economy paradox means that specific change cannot be
truthfully said to lead to increased sustainability, without leading to a
contradiction. This can be explained by several examples.

From a manufacturer perspective

A circular economy business model aims to eliminate waste by designing products
and processes which are based on principles such as repairability, reuse,
refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling. However, these principles are
sometimes contradictory to a business model in which turnover is based on
maximum quantities and low production costs.

Sacrifices have to be made in order to become sustainable and apply circular
economy principles. Imagine a manufacturer making high-end, complex surgical
instruments. These instruments used to be reusable 50 years ago, but due to
product iterations and enhancements, these products have been transformed to
single-use with a cost price varying between $500-1500. The manufacturer
produces and sells 1 million of these devices annually. A redesign to a sustainable
device based on circular principles would mean that the sales of these devices
decreases to only 100.000 devices annually.

The paradox is that such an action would have the manufacturer increase its
reputation for sustainability, potentially leading to increased customers, but still
resulting in a decrease of sales. The paradox is that more demand for sustainable
manufacture may lead to contradictive situations where the manufacturers or
their shareholders realize that their earnings will decrease as a result of
sustainable behavior and therefore actively stop sustainability programs. This
paradox challenges our understanding of what it means for a manufacturer and its
shareholders to be intrinsically motivated to develop sustainable programs using
circular economy principles.

Hahn et al.13 describe the paradox perspective for corporate sustainability. They
conclude that sustainability actions that enable society and the environment to
thrive, paradoxically necessitate relinquishing the absolute priority of profitability
for businesses. This means that companies have to address the interconnected
and often conflicting demands of achieving economic prosperity, environmental
health and social equity.

                                                            51
From a material perspective

In pursuit of the green agenda, many initiatives are encouraged and subsidized,
such as battery-powered devices and electric products, such as cars. The
currently used types of battery, however, require scarce products such as lithium,
cobalt, neodymium-iron-boron magnets, dysprosium and terbium. Many of these
are mined mostly in the Democratic Republic of Congo using child labor and
leading to major impacts on ecosystems. Rather than supporting initiatives to
recycle cobalt from batteries, virgin cobalt is mined and sorted with bare hands,
leading to potential toxicity effects.

Thus, paradoxically, to reach the ultimate goal of electrifying society, we pollute
further by harvesting and consuming scarce rare earth materials. This paradox
highlights potential contradictions in making sustainable policies. Which policies
seem to stimulate sustainability and which ones create more pollution?
Policymakers should therefore always question the final outcomes and end
results of their policies. This requires holistic thinking and deep knowledge of all
potential consequences of any decision.

From a user perspective

Imagine a hospital that wants to transition from single-use products to reusable
products. It's very ambitious and starts a program to stop using disposable
stainless steel instruments, disposable laryngoscope blades and disposable
gynecology sets. In total 60.000, disposable products are changed to reusable
devices. This hospital encounters the problem that more disinfection, cleaning
and sterilization is required. This obviously costs more water and energy, but it
also requires more capacity, meaning more thermal disinfection machines and
autoclaves, as well as more personnel and/or longer working hours. Again, this
example shows the paradox that actions to promote the circular economy may
lead to less sustainable outcomes.

Thus, we might earn less, pollute more or use more energy even though we aim to
follow circular economy principles. In the discussion of the circular economy
paradox, we are left with no alternative than to conclude that our actions do
matter; they may lead to increased waste, costs and use of energy and water in the
short term, but in the long term we must pursue the progress that the circular
economy brings. This is central to the philosophy of progressivism, which
interprets progress as the set of advancements in technology, science and social
organization efficiency. Progressivism is essential part we want to achieve a zero-
waste society. Therefore, this paradox should not really be a paradox at all.

                                                            52
The circular economy paradox can be solved by having the correct knowledge and
using the correct technology. We can prevent the paradox by gaining experience,
gathering knowledge and inventing new technology that promotes circular
applications.

An important phenomenon that we must guard against is greenwashing. Since
some suppliers want to prevent a decline in their turnover, there will continue to
be situations where companies pretend to be greener than they are.
Understanding these greenwashing practices requires knowledge as well as a
critical attitude.

Philosophically, paradoxes may be thought-provoking; they may reveal deeper
truths and logics, forcing us to think more critically and creatively about the nature
of reality and knowledge - in particular when judging and evaluating sustainability
and circular economy concepts. From the perspective of philosophy, paradoxes
help us to better evaluate if a policy, product, service or organization is indeed
circular and contributes to lower CO2 emissions.

A deeper look into the matter

In decision-making, don't take anything for granted. Anyone can tell you a story
about sustainability, but is it evidence-based? Is the entire supply and production
chain presented? Ask yourself: `what are the facts and what do they indicate?'

Paradox thinking could be a good tool. First of all, paradoxes force us to critically
examine and question our assumptions. They reveal inconsistencies and
limitations in our thinking. Paradoxes are valuable tools to use to reveal deeper
truths and increase our understanding of complex concepts such as circular
economy principles. Secondly, they challenge our knowledge and help us to look
differently at a specific concept or theory. They can even lead to a new concept or
theory. Paradoxes come in many forms and appear in various fields such as
philosophy, mathematics and everyday life. Paradoxes help us to raise questions
about the nature of reality, leading to deeper exploration of the concept. Therefore,
it is sensible to think about the paradoxes that may lie behind policy and
purchasing choices, sustainable product development and circular strategies.

Being critical is important, even essential. On the contrary: not being critical can
even be dangerous when it comes to alleged climate-improving products, services
or initiatives. With policy choice, therefore, we must challenge our intuitions and
force ourselves to revise our understanding of the logic of a specific sustainable
action and meaning.

                                                            53
Be aware that paradoxes may lead to cognitive constraints; to a limitation in an
individual's mental processes that affects the ability to think, learn, remember or
interpret. Sometimes we are so focused on the desired result that we no longer
want to see the disadvantages of a particular policy choice or circular product or
service. The nature of truth and meaning is essential. Paradoxes challenge the
notion of truth and falsehood, suggesting that some statements may be context-
dependent or inherently self-contradictory.

Philosophical paradoxes

The philosophical meaning of sustainability and the circular economy involves
deeper ethical, moral and existential considerations about how humans interact
with the natural world and each other. These concepts challenge us to rethink our
economic systems, consumption patterns and responsibilities toward future
generations and the planet. Thus, paradoxes like electric cars needing cobalt,
lithium and other rare earth materials, may lead us to explore ethical dilemmas
and moral reasoning. They challenge our principles about right and wrong.

Sustainability in decision-making requires a holistic view, meaning that all
components of a system are included rather than just its individual parts. For
example, a company claims to a supply a circular product. We should ask where
the basic material comes from, if recycled materials are used, how energy is
generated during production, how the product is designed to prevent waste, how
it is shipped, if the packaging is made from biobased materials, if the manufacturer
will collect the product at the end of life, and how it will reuse the materials to
make new products. These answers should be evidence-based: we want to see
answers with substantiation, such as a list of composition of materials, also called
a bill of materials (BOM), lists with the origin of materials and calculations of
transport and CO2 emissions, so that we can be sure that these products do not
come at the expense of environmental degradation.

Sustainability and circular economy principles acknowledge the finite nature of
Earth's resources. This should be at the core of every policy, product, service or
strategy claiming to be sustainable and fulfilling the demands of the circular
economy.

                                                            54
The circular economy challenges the linear `take-make-dispose' model by
promoting the idea that waste can be used as a resource. This philosophical shift
encourages seeing materials as part of a continuous cycle. Materials should never
be thrown away, but instead always remain in use. This requires a new philosophy
in product design: the concept of designing products with infinite life cycles in
mind, guaranteeing that they can be reused, repaired, refurbished,
remanufactured or recycled at the end of their product life, thus minimizing
environmental impact. We will explore this further in chapter 4 `Visualizing the
circular economy', using the Butterfly Diagram.25

The impact of leadership on policy and best
practices

2.1 A circular economy policy agenda
How worried should we be about climate change and its impact on our lives? The
circular economy seems to be gaining in popularity. Why is it so prominent in
corporate and governmental responses in a world where everything seems to
revolve solely around the climate crisis?12
The rise in popularity of the circular economy may have several reasons, but these
are certainly not universal. Everyone views the circular economy from their own
perspective. These motives may not even be of a sustainable nature, but rather
serve a revenue model.
An important reason for the growing support of the circular economy is the
awareness that Earth's resources are finite. The traditional linear economy (make-
use-dispose) depletes natural resources. Furthermore, the circular economy may
have economic benefits, since circular economy principles reduce material costs
and dependence on raw material imports. Thus, businesses may realize
significant cost savings. Efficient use of resources and waste reduction can
enhance profitability and competitiveness.
Reducing the amount of waste, less pollution and lower emissions are
fundamental and intrinsic motivations for a circular economy. It does mean,
however, that manufacturers and suppliers have to invest in eliminating waste
through designing products for durability, reusability and recyclability. This
reduces the environmental impact of waste disposal and pollution, but it implies
redesign costs and lower volumes of sales by decreasing the number of products
intended for single use.

                                                            63
A large reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is realized by minimizing resource
extraction and processing. Raw materials produced from oil and gas
(petrochemicals) form the basic materials for millions of products used on a daily
basis. Data from 2021 show that 98% of single-use plastic products were made
from fossil fuels and approximately 400 million tons of plastic waste were
produced each year.26
Policymakers are needed to create a system where raw materials made out of
recycled waste streams are cheaper than when they are made from natural
resources. Reducing toxic and waste-generating plastics production should be
high on their agenda. This means that investors, CEOs, politicians, policymakers,
buyers and consumers must take action against current trends to change the
vision of society and current (petrochemical) industrial interests.

The impact of leadership is significant and new policies are needed to turn the tide.
Leadership helps to shape policy outcomes through vision, decisive decision-
making, advocacy and support in the implementation of new policies.

As discussed in the previous chapter, paradoxes can play a significant role in
decision-making by challenging assumptions, highlighting the complexities and
contradictions of certain policies and situations. Paradoxes force leaders to
question their assumptions and consider alternative viewpoints. This can lead to
more robust and well-rounded decisions.

Several examples will highlight how leadership impacts policy and strategies
positively:

2.2 From a vision to building alliances

1. Vision and direction

Setting priorities: Successful leaders tend to articulate a clear vision and set
priorities that guide policy agendas. This vision often reflects their values, beliefs
and goals.

Strategic planning: Effective leaders develop strategic plans that outline policy
goals, timelines and actions needed to achieve desired outcomes.

2. Decision-making

Influencing choices: Leaders influence policy decisions by weighing options,
evaluating evidence and considering the potential impact of different policy
choices.

Crisis management: Strong leadership is crucial for making swift and effective
policy decisions to address strategic issues.

3. Persuasion and consensus building

Building consensus: Leaders should be persuasive in order to create consensus
between all stakeholders and get them to support policy initiatives.

It is best practice to communicate to stakeholders with strong messages to
communicate policy ideas, mobilize support and shape the opinion of the public.

4. The power of implementation

Being able to implement: Effective leaders know how to focus on getting the job
done. The should ensure that plans do not stay plans but that the necessary
human, technical and financial resources are allocated and that there is
continuous focus on the implementation.

                                                            65
It is of great importance to establish systems which monitor policy
implementation, evaluate outcomes and make adjustments where needed.
5. Ethical and inclusive leadership
Social equity: Leaders committed to ethical principles and inclusivity ensure fair
treatment to all, including to the environment, and are transparent about their
decisions. This integrity helps to build trust.
6. Innovation
Encouraging innovation: Good leaders create a culture of innovation by
encouraging new ideas, technologies and new approaches. This means that an
attitude is needed where responses to changing circumstances are quick and are
taken with flexibility and resilience.
7. Leadership styles
Be inspiring: Leaders should inspire and motivate, creating common goals based
on their vision. A positive attitude can stimulate significant policy changes by
fostering a sense of shared purpose and commitment.
8. Building alliances: Leaders who build strong alliances and networks can create
more success. Networks provide leaders with access to diverse perspectives and
information. Connections helps decision-makers to find additional resources and
exchange ideas.

                                                            66
2.3 Balancing between intuition and facts
A good decision-maker finds a balance between intuition and facts. Effective
decision-making may be regarded as an optimal mix between an intuitive and an
analytical process. McCormack suggests to look around the fringes during
decision-making. It's important to look at what the facts indicate about trends,
biases, conflicts and opportunities.27 Good decisions ought to be self-fulfilling:
McCormack argues that if you second-guess a decision, you have most likely
made a bad one. Not necessarily because it is the wrong decision, but because
doubt undermines its success. Another pitfall is not making a decision at all or
postponing it for so long that the decision is made too late.

2.4 Green policies realized in Singapore
An example of how leadership and policymaking can come to visible results can
be seen in Singapore. Singapore has formulated and realized comprehensive
policies and strategies to promote green architecture as part of its vision to
implement a sustainability program. Singapore recognized the importance of
sustainable development and implemented steps to realize construction and
retrofitting of buildings that are environmentally friendly and energy-efficient. The
launch of the BCA Green Mark scheme in Singapore in 2005 initiated Singapore's
first Green Building Masterplan. This policy was set up to encourage and engage
industry stakeholders to develop new green buildings.28 In 2018 the Super Low
Energy (SLE) Building program was launched in order to stimulate best-in-class in
energy efficiency, including the use of renewable energy and intelligent energy
management strategies. The target is to make at least 80% of all buildings in
Singapore green by 2030.

There is a clear connection between leadership and decision-making. Leaders create a vision and
formulate strategic goals. Decision-making is the process through which this vision is turned into
actionable steps, also called `setting direction'.

71
2.5 Evidence-based decision-making
Data-driven decision-making is the analytical part of decision-making, in which
relevant information is gathered, analyzed and processed. This is of great
importance in the field of sustainability and circular economy.
There are plenty of opportunities to test and validate decisions. The resources are
there, so use them!
Some examples of analytical tools are:

     Life Cycle Assessment - Internationally accepted assessment of climate
        change impact;29

     SWOT analysis - A framework to indicate strengths, weaknesses,
        opportunities and threats;

     PEST analysis - A method to analyze external factors such as political,
        economic, social and technological factors;

     Risk assessments/Monte Carlo Simulation - A mathematical technique for
        modelling of complex situations with numerous variables to predict
        different outcomes in uncertain scenarios;

     Fishbone Diagram, Ishikawa or Cause and Effect Diagram - A visual tool
        used to identify, explore and display the possible causes of a specific
        problem, in order to identify root causes of issues;

     Scenario planning - A method used to create and analyze a set of possible
        future scenarios, in order to anticipate potential risks and opportunities by
        considering various possible futures;

     Root Cause Analysis (RCA) - A method of problem-solving used for
        identifying the root causes of faults or problems, which helps in developing
        effective solutions by addressing the underlying issues.

                                                            72
Although decision-making is often a balance between intuition and analytics, we
must realize that the analytical part is crucial. Evidence-based decision-making
involves using data, facts and empirical evidence to steer our decisions, rather
than relying solely on our intuition or anecdotal information without support.
Taking into account that there are a lot of sustainability claims without factual
substantiation such as thorough LCA studies or other calculations. This is
especially important since there are paradoxical contradictions in what is
sustainable and what is not, and because we are confronted with greenwashing.
Using evidence-based decision-making ensures that decisions are more objective
and rational, and more likely to lead to positive outcomes. In any case, using
common sense is always useful so that we do not blindly rely on others or are
seduced by beautiful brochures, but rather ask what substantiation there is to see
how sustainability is achieved.
In conclusion, leadership plays a crucial role in shaping, advocating, and
implementing policies. The effectiveness of policy outcomes often depends on the
vision, decision-making capabilities and leadership styles of those in positions of
power. Effective leaders can mobilize support, navigate complex systems, and
drive forward policies that address pressing societal challenges.

2.6 Leadership in the context of strategic and critical raw materials

Strategic and critical raw materials, including rare earth metals, are the foundation
of nearly all modern technologies--from medical devices and renewable energy
systems to advanced electronics and defence and medical applications. Their
limited availability, combined with growing geopolitical tensions, trade
restrictions, and rising global demand, makes access to these materials not just a
matter of resource management, but of strategic foresight and leadership. In a
chapter about leadership, it is essential to address this topic because true
strategic leadership involves anticipating future challenges, securing supply
chains, and making long-term decisions that align with both innovation and
sustainability goals. Leaders who understand the strategic importance of critical
raw materials are better equipped to guide organizations, industries, or
governments in developing resilient, circular strategies that reduce dependency
on vulnerable supply chains and enable more sustainable innovation.
Incorporating this awareness into leadership ensures that decisions are not only
economically sound but also geopolitically and environmentally responsible.

The increased scarcity of resources will become one of the greatest challenges in
the coming years. This an important aspect in the climate discussion, which must
be included in decision-making. However, it is a very heatedly debated topic,
especially because this discussion is ruled by opinions and biased statements; a
twilight zone where fact and fiction are mixed up as a result of emotion. It is
becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mine and process raw materials,
and it will cost more and more energy. Currently, 2% of all energy on Earth is used
to process, crush, grind and separate raw materials in mines.30

This is a reason to choose circular principles in our policies, products and
strategies. We will have to reuse products and materials; for geopolitical reasons,
in order to reduce waste, to protect the Earth and to reduce climate impact.

Several raw materials are considered scarce, strategic or critical due to their
limited availability, high demand, the degree of importance to a country,
geopolitical factors or environmental concerns associated with their extraction
and processing. Some examples of key materials that are currently facing
availability issues that are also used in medical applications include:

12. Certain types of plastics such as polypropylene used for blue wrap for
packaging of sterile surgical instruments, face masks, gowns. PET plastic used for
packaging of medical devices, ABS plastic used for handles and hand grips of
instruments. Although these raw materials are not always scarce, they are critical
for medical applications. A period of limited availability such as in the corona
period did result in imminent shortages of face masks and blue wrap.
To address the availability of these raw materials, several strategies can and
should be employed. This is where sustainable leadership is needed.

                                                            76
The most important strategy in a circular economy is reuse and recycling, which
can be applied by enhancing recycling technologies and processes to recover
valuable materials from end-of-life products. For example, rare earth materials in
surgical devices are hardly recycled; the majority is incinerated. Other strategies
include:

    · Substitution: developing alternative materials or technologies that can
        replace scarce materials.

    · Efficient use: improving the efficiency of material use in manufacturing and
        product design.

    · Sustainable mining practices: implementing and enforcing sustainable and
        ethical mining practices to reduce environmental and social impacts.

    · Diversifying supply chains: reducing dependence on single-source
        materials by developing alternative supply sources and improving
        geopolitical strategies.

The development of such strategies will create a major disruption in the
petrochemical industry and industrial sector, but will mitigate the risks associated
with raw material scarcity and ensure a more sustainable and resilient supply
chain for critical materials. It will reduce dependence on single countries as
sources for these materials.
However, the development of new recycling technologies needs to be
encouraged. Support by policymakers is needed to make virgin raw materials less
attractive by making them more expensive. For instance, it would be helpful to
decrease the prices of recycled materials, biomaterials and renewable energies
such as hydrogen so they can compete with virgin materials and fossil fuels.

                                                            77
Industry leaders need to tackle the is of critical and strategic raw materials
including plastics. Plastic waste streams furthermore, need global attention and
should be managed at its root by reducing the global production of toxic and
wasteful plastics. Instead, recycled materials should be used in new product
designs. This means that sacrifices have to be made in the form of higher
investments and engineering costs. While this benefits the environment and
society, the initial investment needed to manufacture sustainable products can
be a barrier. This is where leadership can make a difference. Thus, it is possible to
overcome the paradox that a company wants to become more sustainable by
selling products which generate less waste, but cannot afford it because this
decreases sales volumes and increases costs.

                                                            78
   Leadership, decision-making, experimental handling, and evidence-based
   working are deeply interconnected, driving innovation through research and

Swimming against the current: legislation

3.1 A regulatory paradox
Green innovation efforts often encounter a great deal of opposition. Especially in
the medical sector, there is legislation that hinders the development of
sustainability and a circular healthcare economy.
The term "legislation paradox", also known as the "regulatory paradox" or
"compliance paradox", refers to the phenomenon where the introduction of new
laws and regulations aimed at addressing a particular issue can sometimes lead
to unintended consequences that may exacerbate the original problem or create
new issues.
Chen and Li concluded that "a regulatory paradox emerges where environmental
policies produce counter-intuitive effects on manufacturers' innovation
strategies".31 Their study explores the paradoxical impact of environmental
regulations on green innovation in the manufacturing of energy vehicles. Their
findings show that environmental regulations should be calibrated according to
the diffusion stages of green innovation, and misaligned stakeholder interests can
lead to environmental regulations that inadvertently hinder, rather than promote
green innovation efforts.

Our experiences are consistent with those of Chen and Li. In 2019, the GreenCycl
FieldLab was founded by the authors Bart van Straten and Tim Horeman (not Bruno
Bruins) together with Joost van der Sijp, MD and Majid El Mortadi. The aim of this
field lab was to make healthcare more sustainable. On 17 March 2020, at the
outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I, Bart van Straten, received a call from the
director of the Franciscus hospital in Rotterdam and a medical microbiologist. At
this time, at the start of the Covid pandemic, there were growing shortages of face
masks in hospitals globally. The hospital had run out of protective face masks and
there was great concern about sending healthcare professionals into the Covid
wards without protection. The microbiologist suggested that the COVID virus
possibly could be inactivated on used face masks if they were heated. So, the
director of the hospital called us to ask whether we could find a way to heat or
sterilize used face masks at a high temperature and test whether the face mask
still filtered particles sufficiently.

We, as GreenCycl agreed to explore this and the same evening I drove to the
hospital, where people dressed in protective suits and gloves put three large boxes
of used face masks in my trunk. The face masks had been worn in the Covid
department and the intensive care unit. I drove to the Field Lab where our
researchers, also fully dressed in protective clothing, unpacked the boxes of face
masks, gloves and hats to sterilize them using steam.

The masks were first heated at 134 degrees and then at 121 degrees. A test setup
with particle counters was built in both the Field Lab and at TU Delft to test the face
masks after sterilization. We wanted to know whether the face masks still filtered
out the Covid virus after it had been sterilized at a high temperature. This way we
could determine whether the face mask was still of good enough quality to be used
again. We use the following days and nights to build the test setups and perform
the tests. In this were helped by Renewi, a waste processing partner who collected
medical waste under safe conditions from clinics and brought them to GreenCycl.

The results showed that certain types of face masks were best sterilized at 121
degrees, after which they could be reused five more times. Disposable FFP2 face
masks could reprocessed using a method that could be applied in all hospitals,
using their available equipment. Each face mask could, moreover, be reprocessed
five times without losing filter quality.

                                                            82
We shared our data with the National Institute for Public Health, and published our
data so that the rest of the world, also facing shortages, could adopt our
methods.32,33 Our research finding had major impacts, not only for the Franciscus
hospital, but also for hospitals around the world who were able to reprocess and
reuse their single-use face masks safely using our methods.
We felt we had done some good: protecting international public health by coming
up with scientifically substantiated methods for reusing disposable face masks;
coming up with new scientific insights. We had invented a method to reduce waste
by facilitating reuse and thus achieving CO2 reduction. We had provided a cost
benefit to society because resterilization at the time of Covid was much cheaper
than new, scarce face masks, if they were available at all - an apparent
contradiction.

3.2 Apparent contradiction: key aspects of the legislation paradox

Let's analyze our methods and actions in the light of legislation and in particular
medical regulations.

In the EU there is legislation formulated for the collection, management and
disposal of potentially contaminated medical waste from hospitals. The aim of this
is to protect public health and the environment; potentially contaminated medical
waste must be incinerated. We collected face masks which were used on the
Covid and Intensive Care departments, meaning they were classified as
hazardous waste. GreenCycl was co-founded by the authors to make healthcare
more sustainable. We were surprised by the shortages of face masks during the
Covid pandemic.

The Covid pandemic was a time of crisis. The consortium between GreenCycl, TU
Delft and Franciscus hospital had only three days before the hospital was out of
stock, meaning either their staff would be unable to enter the Covid and IC
departments, or they would help patients while being exposed to Covid. In other
words, there was no time to investigate which rules and regulations applied, such
as the EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD)34 and the Directive on Hazardous
Waste (91/689/EEC).35 This directive dictates requirements for the handling,
storage and disposal of hazardous waste. There is also additional national
legislation on Healthcare Waste Management, such as the regulations for the
transport of dangerous goods by road (ADR).

The WFD provides rules for labelling, record keeping, monitoring and control
obligations. This directive also forbids mixing hazardous waste with other
categories of hazardous waste and with non-hazardous waste. On 17 March 2020,
we loaded my trunk in the hospital parking lot with cardboard boxes full of used
face masks and other items: mixed together, not labelled, no records. I drove my
car with dangerous goods straight from the hospital to the Field Lab. In fact, we did
everything the law prohibited. In part, this was because we were not aware what
was in fact in the regulations and there was no time to check. Naturally, GreenCycl
did not possess the relevant permits to reprocess and recycle potentially
contaminated face masks, nor did we have an environmental permit.

All these regulations are examples of legislation that serves to protect people, but
now they turned out to be a danger to public health. If we had followed the law, we
would not have been able to help the world during the Covid pandemic to
reprocess face masks in a safe way and thus protect patients and healthcare
providers.
This paradox that applies not only to face masks, but to climate goals in general.
Because GreenCycl can be seen as an experimental lab, we have been able to gain
experience in the context of research, but we have also experienced the obstacles
to making healthcare more sustainable. The permit we applied for in 2021 to
collect medical waste for recycling in our Field Lab ran up against the same
legislation. It would take nine months before we were officially allowed to use
medical waste and recycle it. Furthermore, a restriction was imposed on the
volume, because experience first had to be gained with small volumes before
expanding to larger amounts. Setting up sustainable and circular concepts
remains a risky operation in the eyes of many: from legislators and enforcement
agencies to banks and investors who think that financing recycling will yield low
returns. Still, in our case the regional authorities and enforcement agencies were
fully on our side and just as frustrated that the permit process hardly allowed us to
set up circular economy activities.
The climate goals, which are anchored in European climate law,36 require that we
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% in 2030 compared to 1990 and
become climate neutral in 2025. With the current legislation, it is questionable
whether these goals can be achieved at all.

3.3 The paradox
The outcome of these regulations was obviously not anticipated by lawmakers.
Politicians, policymakers and legislators should anticipate circular principles and
new technologies in order to prevent legislation from lagging behind the facts.
If we want to stimulate start-ups and organizations whose mission is creating a
circular economy, we should bear in mind that the cost of compliance can be
disproportionately high for smaller entities, potentially slowing down innovation
and green initiatives. Although many policymakers do not like exemptions, it may
be necessary for this category of businesses to get exemptions, since some
regulations may be perceived as overly restrictive or unreasonable.
It is also good to realize that overregulation can lead to greenwashing and violation
of the rules. As we previously discussed with regard to the circular economy with
the financial paradox, the pressure to achieve financial returns in a commercial
organization can sometimes be too great and thus drive managers to decisions
that go against laws and regulations.
Take for instance the case of Volkswagen. Regulations to reduce emissions for
cars should have led to the development of cleaner technologies. However, the
Volkswagen emissions scandal showed that Volkswagen used software to cheat
on emissions tests. It was revealed that Volkswagen had installed software in its
diesel engines that could detect when the car was undergoing emissions testing
and alter the engine's performance to meet regulatory standards; however, under
normal driving conditions, the cars emitted up to 40 times the allowed levels of
nitrogen oxides (NOx). This led to a major corporate scandal in September 2015,
in which the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation
of the Clean Air Act to the Volkswagen Group.
Here too, as in the previous chapter on leadership and decision-making, there is a
balance between balanced regulations and law making versus a flexible climate
where sustainability can flourish optimally.

3.4 Addressing the legislation paradox: what to do in future decision-making?

It is also important for the legislator to adopt an evidence-based approach when
formulating new legislation and regulations. Policymakers should base their
decisions on robust data and analysis in order to anticipate potential unintended
consequences and design regulations that are effective and efficient.
Environmental and social impact assessments are needed to identify potential
consequences and scenarios. This requires a holistic view of a complex
environment. It also requires engagement with stakeholders, who can provide
insights into the practical implications of regulations and help design more
balanced and feasible rules.

It is necessary to create and design regulations with built-in flexibility. This allows
for adjustments as circumstances change, as in the case of the face mask
shortages during Covid. We did what we felt we had to do; we may not have got
everything right, but we were driven to find a technical solution to the face mask
problem by making it possible to reprocess them. An added benefit was that the
particle counter testing method we used to test filter quality led us to
simultaneously discover inferior new masks. Face masks were imported from
other countries with all the necessary stamps and (CE) quality marks on the
packaging, but sometimes it turned out that these new masks did not filter
sufficiently and did not meet the Dutch norms. Without our test setup, we would
not have discovered this, so that healthcare professionals would have felt they
were protected while this was not the case. This also shows how failure to enforce
or check imported products can directly damage public health.

With regard to flexibility, periodic reviews of regulations must take place in
collaboration with experts from the field in order to re-evaluate legislation and
regulations, to ensure that it remains relevant over time.

Conclusion

The development of the circular economy provides complexities and challenges
for legislators. Flexibility is needed; some laws and regulations need to be revised
in order to be able to reach the set goals of the current climate legislation. Creating
effective policy and legislation involves systematic and evidence-based methods.
Now more than ever, policymakers will have to collaborate with experts from the
field and other stakeholders.

We have to create a vision to redesign society towards the circular economy and
we must act from this vision. This means that industry, government, hospitals and
universities have to work together to enable large-scale innovation and legal
infrastructure to create a new, zero-waste system that can scale up fast.

The pictures on the next two pages show medical device products which are made
from recycled medical waste. Despite the high barrier to recycling medical waste
and the testing and production costs for medical approvals to sell these products,
it is necessary to take this path. Not only because it is surprisingly easy to come
up with new technology that allows us to reuse and recycle more, but also because
it makes us much more independent from external producers and suppliers of
materials in other countries. Furthermore, apart from the positive impact on the
climate, it is cheaper: waste flows are classified as raw materials and the costs of
waste processing and rising raw material prices are no longer relevant.

Political Vision as the Cornerstone of a
Circular Economy

4.1 A political challenge

The transition to a circular economy is not merely a matter of technological
innovation or entrepreneurial willpower--it is, above all, a political challenge. In
an era defined by climate disruption, resource scarcity, and mounting waste
streams, the urgency for a coherent and long-term political vision has never been
greater. Policymakers hold the unique position--and responsibility--to create the
legal, fiscal, and societal frameworks that can accelerate the shift from a linear to
a circular model. Without their leadership, the system-wide change required to
reach a zero-waste society will remain fragmented, slow, and insufficient.

This chapter explores the vision of politics in shaping the transition to circularity.
It features the contributions of two politicians who, each in their own way, have
placed sustainability and resource efficiency high on the agenda.

Vincent Karremans, who served as State Secretary for Sustainable Healthcare in
the Netherlands at the time of writing, offers insight into how government can
address the vast resource inefficiencies in the healthcare sector--a sector known
both for its essential function and its substantial environmental footprint. His
perspective illustrates how targeted policy can not only reduce waste but also
safeguard access to critical raw materials and stimulate innovation.

From a European perspective, Wopke Hoekstra, as European Commissioner for
Climate and Clean Growth, outlines how the EU's climate policies are increasingly
intertwined with circular economy strategies. His vision stresses that climate

                                                            99
goals cannot be reached without rethinking how we design, produce, use, and
recover resources across all sectors of the economy.
Together, these contributions underscore a vital message: political will and
direction are indispensable to overcoming structural barriers and enabling system
change. A zero-waste society does not happen by chance--it requires deliberate
choices, courageous leadership, and above all, a shared vision for a future in
which economic prosperity is decoupled from resource depletion.

4.2 The political vision: a dialogue with Vincent Karremans, State Secretary for
Sustainable Healthcare in the Netherlands
When writing this book, we were curious how the Dutch government as well as the
European Committee views our methods and the circular economy as a whole.
After all, we can only achieve a more sustainable world together, and the
government is indispensable when it comes to policy and new technologies. After
a visit by State Secretary Karremans to GreenCycl in December 2024, we asked
him to give his vision on circular care in an interview followed by the vision of
Wopke Hoekstra, as European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean
Growth in the second von der Leyen commission.

Vincent Karremans has been State Secretary responsible for Sustainable Care
since 2 July 2024 in the Netherland. In a contribution, in the form of an interview,
Vincent gives his vision on sustainable healthcare at a national level including the
results he wants to achieve during his term of office?

Mr. Karremans, to my knowledge, `sustainable healthcare' has never before been
explicitly designated as a topic under the responsibility of a Minister of Health,
Welfare, and Sport. Why is that?

"Unfortunately, I do not have the honor of being the first; that was Minister Ernst
Kuipers. However, that does not matter. The explicit designation of this topic
within a minister's portfolio underscores the importance that the government
assigns to the issue. Rightly so: with its many buildings, high energy consumption
and extensive material use, the healthcare sector has a significant ecological
footprint and, therefore, a major responsibility. Healthcare accounts for 7% of all
greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands and 13% of all waste. The sector
recognizes this responsibility and acts accordingly. But as the government and the
Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport, we must also take action. By focusing on
sustainability and reducing waste, we contribute to the affordability of
healthcare."

Circularity and sustainability are now crucial themes in policy documents across
various departments, such as Infrastructure, Healthcare, and Climate & Green
Growth. Is there a shared agenda or a common thread among you and your
colleagues?

"Sustainability policy is indeed managed by multiple departments. For example,
Minister Hermans (Climate and Green Growth) coordinates climate policy.
However, as a cabinet, we are responsible for ensuring that each department
contributes to the sustainability agenda.

The sustainable goals for healthcare are set out in the Green Deal Sustainable
Healthcare 3.0. Regarding circularity, we are focusing on reusability over
disposability and aim for at least a 75% reduction in residual waste by 2030. This
is not just an isolated ambition; the Green Deal has been signed by multiple
ministries, including Infrastructure and Water Management, Economic Affairs and
Green Growth, and Health, Welfare and Sport. This serves as our joint foundation
for making healthcare more sustainable.

When it comes to sustainability policies beyond my own department, I ensure that
these policies take into account their effects on people's health and the
healthcare system. That is my guiding principle."

                                                           102
It is tempting to ask: who really owns the topic of sustainability and circularity? Is
it the responsibility of Europe, the national government, or local municipalities?
You will probably say: it's all of us. But suppose I am an small or medium business
looking to explore sustainability measures for my business operations. Who
should I turn to first, and why?

"That depends on the type of company and the approach it wants to take toward
sustainability.

If you are specifically aiming to bring sustainable medical products to market, then
European regulations come into play. For example, rules regarding the approval of
medicines and medical devices. If these products comply with European
regulations, they are also permitted in the Netherlands."

As we conduct this interview, we quickly end up discussing responsibilities and
regulations. That does not always inspire me. Our new book will be published on
TU Delft's open platform and will therefore attract the attention of students. What
would you say to students who consider sustainability and circularity important for
their future careers?

"You are absolutely right. The disposables culture that has developed is not
sustainable. To prevent shortages in healthcare, for example in medical products,
we must stop wasting valuable resources. Creative ideas and products are
urgently needed to ensure that healthcare remains available, safe and affordable
without waste and pollution; also for future generations. So, continue to engage in
this cause and challenge potential employers on their sustainability efforts."

And what would you say to students who think sustainability and circularity are just
passing trends?

"The finiteness of fossil resources is a fact. We must transition to a society where
resources are reusable or renewable. That is a major and far-reaching change.
That is why the goals we set extend far into the future: 2030, 2040, 2050. But we
must act now to achieve them.

In healthcare, sustainability and circularity are considered highly important,
particularly by younger generations. The visibility of hospital waste plays a
significant role in this. Hospitals that ignore sustainability already struggle to
attract staff. And that makes sense: after all, you choose a career in healthcare to
improve people's well-being. It is contradictory if providing care contributes to
resource waste, pollution and climate damage that ultimately harm people's
health.

                                                           103
Additionally, we see the emergence of Green Teams throughout the healthcare
sector. These teams work on making their organizations more sustainable. The
movement that has started is very powerful - it can no longer be stopped."

Can we afford this focus on circularity? Shouldn't our economy simply return to
prioritizing profit? Healthcare costs in the Netherlands and in other countries
continue to rise every year. Many argue that this is unsustainable. If you were to
scale back sustainability ambitions, significant cost savings could be achieved,
and the public might praise you for it. How do you see this?

"Precisely because of healthcare costs, we must also work on sustainability.
Firstly, there is still much to gain in reducing waste within healthcare. This also
saves costs. Energy, materials and medication can all be used more sparingly.
Every entrepreneur knows that it is essential to critically examine processes and
ways of working. There are now many examples and initiatives where healthcare
providers analyze their care processes and find ways to make them more
sustainable while saving money, and in some cases even labor time. This is a win-
win-win situation.

Furthermore, sometimes new technologies and alternative `sustainable' products
are initially more expensive. This is often the case with innovations, as their
developers invest considerable time and money. They are entitled to a return on
that investment. However, in the long run, sustainability pays for itself.

Finally, we know that doing nothing will ultimately cost us even more - in terms of
health, wealth, food and resource availability, and infrastructure. We cannot pass
this burden onto future generations. Doing nothing is not an option."

Recently, you paid a working visit to GreenCycl in Utrecht, a company in which all
three authors of this book are involved. We saw massive piles of hospital waste
and realized that this was just a few days' worth of collection from only a handful
of hospitals. You, too, were surprised by the enormous volume of hospital waste.
What approach would you take to reduce these mountains of healthcare waste?
How? Who should take the lead? What movement is needed, and how do you get
this started?

"We all have a role to play in achieving circular healthcare. Within the healthcare
sector, a great deal of work is already being done on the ground to make healthcare
delivery more sustainable and to reduce waste. It helps when administrators
provide their staff with the time and space to engage with this issue. Suppliers,
hospitals and healthcare providers must and can tackle this challenge together.
The government can provide an additional push.

                                                           104
In the Netherlands, we promote circularity through the National Circular Economy
Program and, specifically for healthcare, through the Green Deal. Because the
Dutch market is relatively small, we also rely on European collaboration. The
Netherlands is actively involved at the European level to make healthcare more
sustainable and more circular, with a focus on quality, safety, availability and
affordability of care."
Policy, financing, regulation and innovation are key approaches to achieving a
circular (healthcare) economy. Various measures can accelerate sustainable
healthcare, such as setting a minimum recycling percentage for hospitals,
requiring hospitals to procure biobased and circular products, reducing waste
streams, expediting permits, and ensuring sufficient energy supply for circular
initiatives. Do you believe these are initiatives that should be politically regulated,
or do you see other priorities? If so, which ones? How can we demonstrate to the
world that the Netherlands, just as with water management, is at the forefront of
using technology and the latest insights to make hospital waste reusable?
"In the Green Deal, agreements have been made between all relevant parties. The
Green Deal helps align everyone's efforts. As a government, our role within the
Green Deal is primarily to facilitate: we subsidize research and innovation projects
focused on sustainability, ensure the monitoring of progress and results, and
promote knowledge exchange.
Additionally, I believe it is important for the government to create space within
legislation and regulations to support sustainability. Since January 2025, for
example, the rules on reprocessing single-use medical devices have been relaxed.
This means that, under certain conditions, healthcare institutions themselves may
now reprocess and reuse single-use medical devices. Previously, this was only
allowed under the regulations applicable to manufacturers.
Where necessary, relaxed regulations can provide an extra push toward
sustainability. Consider, for example, the proposed Extended Producer
Responsibility for diapers and incontinence materials. This policy sets specific
recycling targets for these products."

                                                           105
Suppose you were to outline a pathway for an impactful circularity initiative. What
would it look like? Which stakeholders should be involved, and at what stage of the
transition? What do you see as the responsibilities of the stakeholders, and what
should not be their responsibility?
"That is a great question, and I have commissioned research on this topic. The
conclusion was that diapers and incontinence products have the highest potential
in a government strategy for circular healthcare. Washable incontinence products
can significantly reduce healthcare-related waste, since disposable incontinence
products generate 85 million kilos of waste annually. That is why I am funding a
pilot project for washable incontinence products in healthcare institutions.
The most critical step comes later, when the initiative proves successful, and
upscaling becomes the next challenge. Such a transition demands a great deal
from an organization: incontinence products must be collected separately,
washed and returned to the correct patient. Perhaps schedules for changing
materials will need to be adjusted. In this phase, it is incredibly helpful if those
involved in the initial pilot - ranging from suppliers to users - share their
experiences with other interested parties. This is something we can facilitate."
The initiators of GreenCycl - and others - argue that universities in the Netherlands
are not sufficiently involved in the transition to a more sustainable healthcare
system. Yet these institutions possess the knowledge needed to develop and
implement new processes and technologies. What is your stance on this?
"Knowledge and research play a crucial role in the transition to a more sustainable
healthcare system. This is especially true because there is still much that we do
not know: what are viable sustainable alternatives? Where are the opportunities
for sustainability? Universities play an essential role in answering these questions.
Through the Dutch Federation of University Medical Centers, the medical faculties
of universities are already connected to the Green Deal. However, further
collaboration between universities to make healthcare more sustainable is
certainly desirable. The importance of innovation for sustainability is undeniable."

                                                           106
Naturally, we also ask ourselves how we can reduce the massive amounts of
waste, not only in healthcare but in general. We see significant potential in reuse
and, ideally, in using fewer materials altogether. At TU Delft, our courses frequently
address responsible material usage. Experience shows that students are creative
and embrace `resource efficiency' as added value for future medical instruments.
How, as State Secretary for Sustainable Healthcare, do you encourage tomorrow's
students?

"This is a specific theme within the Green Deal: knowledge and awareness. I want
to ensure that we collectively develop new ideas and knowledge about
sustainability. We do this through the Knowledge and Innovation Covenant, which
fosters collaboration between businesses and the government. Additionally,
through Health Holland, we stimulate innovative research in the Dutch Life
Sciences and Health sector.

We need all the expertise available in the Netherlands to transition to a more
sustainable healthcare system while keeping care affordable for future
generations. Cost-saving techniques are therefore highly welcome. TU Delft
students will play a key role in making this possible."

As we review our notes from this conversation, we notice that the patient -the
citizen - is somewhat absent from the discussion. Do citizens have a role or
responsibility in promoting sustainable healthcare? If so, what role?

"Citizens have the right to affordable, high-quality healthcare. When you need
care, you already have enough on your mind, and you may not always want or be
able to consider whether the care you receive is sustainable. I do not expect
people to take on that responsibility.

However, citizens can certainly contribute by thinking critically and asking
questions, whether out of personal conviction or curiosity. They may see
opportunities that a healthcare provider has not yet considered or question certain
processes in ways that lead to improvements.

What I find important is that the healthcare system should enable people to make
more sustainable choices if they wish to and where possible. At present, this is
only an option in some cases. For example, asthma and COPD treatments can be
administered with two types of inhalers: one that releases a high level of
greenhouse gases and another that does not. From the patient's perspective, both
function similarly. But making an informed choice requires substantial knowledge.
That is why I believe it is essential for healthcare organizations and professionals
to critically evaluate their processes and explore where sustainability
improvements can be made."

                                                           107
We are conducting this interview at the beginning of 2025, the first year in which
large companies are required to report on circularity and sustainability in their
annual reports according to the EU directive Corporate Sustainability Reporting
Directive (CSRD). This requirement includes a standardized reporting method,
which makes sustainability progress more transparent. The number of companies
subject to this reporting obligation will expand in the coming years. At your
department, these annual reports will likely be reviewed, at least the sustainability
sections. Do you plan to use this information for future policy? Do you foresee
debates in Parliament about these reports?
"Foundations are exempt from the CSRD. As a result, this obligation currently
applies to only about 45 hospitals, mental health institutions and nursing homes
that operate as private limited companies in the Dutch healthcare sector. For
foundations, reporting remains voluntary, as we want to limit the administrative
burden on the sector.
I will read these reports with great interest. However, I cannot yet predict how they
will influence policy, as this reporting requirement is still new and currently applies
to only a small group of institutions."
Developments in circularity and sustainability are progressing rapidly. For that
reason, we expect our book to require a new edition soon, incorporating the latest
insights. If we were to interview you again for the next edition and ask what
achievement you look back on with satisfaction and pride, what would your answer
be?
"I would be satisfied if the healthcare sector would be on track to achieve the
Green Deal targets - 75% less residual waste and 50% less primary raw material
consumption by 2030, with a 25% reduction in residual waste by 2026.
The mountain of waste can and must be significantly reduced. I am convinced that
achieving this goal would not only benefit the environment but also generate
financial savings."

4.3 The political vision: a dialogue with Wopke Hoekstra, EU Commissioner
Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth in the EU
For this book commissioner Hoekstra expressed his vision on sustainable
healthcare. Wopke Hoekstra, European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and
Clean Growth, plays a central role in shaping the European Union's policies aimed
at achieving climate neutrality and strengthening sustainability across all sectors,
including healthcare. By aligning sustainable healthcare initiatives with European
climate policy, Hoekstra emphasizes the importance of systemic change in
healthcare to reduce environmental impact, secure access to critical raw
materials, and protect the health of future generations.

Mr Hoekstra, you were previously Minister for Finance and Minister for Foreign
Affairs in The Netherlands. Does your current position, as Commissioner for
Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, rely more on funding or more on cooperation
between EU countries? Why?

"From a European perspective, it is important for us to work well together and
cooperate effectively. We rely on national governments and the private sector to
drive investments in the clean transition, and we use our more limited financial
resources to crowd in this money, often by providing guarantees and derisking.

Our Innovation Fund is a good example of how we try and make impactful
investments in new technologies, using revenues from our emissions trading
system. In this way we create a virtuous circle where polluters pay for the
development of new technologies. Investment is truly at the heart of our current
climate policy agenda. We need to help our industry deliver on our clean transition
targets.

We have adopted the Clean Industrial Deal, which is our business plan to make
this happen, and we have complemented it with a Savings and Investment Union
Plan. The next big milestone will be our new long-term budget, known as the
Multiannual Financial Framework. The Commission made a proposal for
spendings from 2028 to 2034. The EU must maximise the impact of every euro it
spends."

The growth of the EU economy is by no means a small matter. How do your
colleagues look at your ambitious plans? Do they find your policy difficult or
encouraging? Why?

"Economic growth is essential for the European Union. It pays for everything we
want to have and find meaningful. We are all too aware that our slow economic
growth, our dependencies and the fragmented market we still operate in are
increasingly a problem, particularly against a backdrop of volatile geopolitics.

The Clean Industrial Deal is a game-changer for Europe's economy. It is a business
plan to truly re-industrialise our European Union. It will drive competitiveness,
boost our strategic independence and accelerate climate action. Ideally, it brings
all those three elements closer together. I am confident that this is the way
forward."

                                                           111
This question would also be addressed to your Dutch national: to whom belongs
the topic of sustainability and circularity now? Is it a European matter or primarily
a national one? Imagine, I am an SME in the Netherlands, and I want to focus on
sustainability measures for my business. If so, do I first look at the authorities in NL
or just about the EU? Why?

"In the EU, we have the potential to become world champion on circularity. It is a
business and climate opportunity. The natural resources our continent has are
wind, water and sun. Therefore, in the light of the current geopolitical unrest in the
world, we need to become independent from foreign actors. And circularity can
help with this.

The European single market is one of the greatest tools that our companies can
benefit from, so I would encourage them to look across Europe for opportunities
and partners. At the same time, businesses need to start local and understand the
environmental impact and regulations which concern them at the local level, from
permitting and safety rules to waste management and the sustainability of their
premises. And then, we have a great track record of exporting our products and
services around the world, so why stop at the European border? The Clean
Industrial Deal aims to keep Europe as an attractive hub for traditional industries,
accelerating new clean technologies and circular business models that can
compete worldwide."

This interview is part of a book published on TU Delft's open platform. But expect
many students to get this text in touch. What is your message for (these) students?

"We need the next generation. This is the generation that will experience more
climate change than any other in human history. In the last few years, we have
seen the physical and economic harm of extreme weather events in Europe and
around the world. We need to build a society that can adapt and be resilient to
these changes. When I say that we need the students reading this message, I mean
that we need their creativity, their innovation, their skills, and their engagement.
Every generation faces its own unique challenges. The generation that will emerge
from our schools and universities in the next few years will have the challenge of
building a completely new industrial and economic model in Europe. They will
have a mission to decarbonise, to make better use of resources, and to make this
new business model both profitable and exportable. It's a tough ask, but they can
do it.

A significant proportion of the TU Delft students will choose a job in business or
science. You are developing the Clean Industrial Deal and the Industrial
Decarbonisation Accelerator Act. What you can tell about these developments -
from the perspective of students preparing for the labour market.

                                                           112
The future is Europe. We have seen that the United States has been a magnet for
entrepreneurs, researchers, investors and businesses. Part of that was about
finance and risk-taking, but it was also about political stability, a commitment to
science, and a desire to work openly with the rest of the world. Some of these
pillars are being called into question across the Atlantic, but not here in Europe.
That gives us an advantage. We welcome scientists with open arms. We are the
safe choice for many innovators and investors now. We need to double down on
innovation and on the Capital Market Union.
We are investing in innovative clean technologies, and the decarbonisation of
older heavy industries. Your students will find a world of opportunities in front of
them if they can develop the skills to thrive in this clean economy that we are
building."

                                                           113
If we ask you whether climate and green growth are a "hype" in international public
policy or a "stayer", you probably choose the latter. But can we afford this focus
on green growth, should we not focus on European manufacturing? And give that
the top priority?

"For too long, we've been one dimensional in how we approached the climate
question. We're now in a different world. And to go forward, we're going all in on
decarbonisation, using it as a strategic opportunity to cut emissions while growing
our GDP.

As we accelerate our climate efforts, it's essential that we bring European
businesses along with us. Given the uncertainties and challenges we are facing
globally, it is natural to feel like we could be standing at a crossroads. But for
Europe, the path ahead is clear. We will re-industrialise our economy and we will
do so in the European way. We will be investing in the technologies and energies
that will power a cleaner, more competitive and self-sufficient future."

The authors of the book where this interview appears are involved in a company
recycling hospital waste. Care is responsible for a huge amount of waste. Do you
see any reason to use certain sectors at European level, such as health care, to
contribute to climate action?

"We are entering a phase in the transition where everybody will have a role to play.
It is fair to say that in the first years of our climate action we have been tackling
some of the `low hanging fruit' and reducing emissions where it was `easier' to do
so - for example replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy in our power
systems, improving energy efficiency in products and industrial processes, or
starting the shift towards electric vehicles.

But to reach climate neutrality by 2050 every sector of our economy will need to
contribute, and healthcare is no exception. Waste is a critical area. We are doing
quite well in terms of the `end of life' part, with more and more awareness that we
need to separate waste for recycling and disposal. What we need to focus on more
is the upstream part - and designing products which are better able to be re-used,
repaired or recycled. For health and safety reasons there are of course a lot of
single use products in healthcare, but there is definitely scope for more innovation
and circularity."

                                                           114
Your mission, as formulated on the EU website, focuses on policy measures.
Citizens/voters/consumers do not appear in the contract. That cannot be the
intention? What can people do themselves?

"My Mission Letter, which is a sophisticated version of a to-do list if you will, is very
clear: citizens are at the heart of our work. It says that "we will respond to the real
and legitimate concerns and expectations that Europeans expressed at the last
elections. We will be closer to people and businesses where it really matters". We
are committed to be more present `on the ground' across all EU regions, giving
more visibility to EU projects, and engaging in a deeper and more regular dialogue
with citizens, in particular young people.

I have already held my first `Youth Dialogue' to discuss my policy priorities. There
is of course plenty of scope for people to adopt more sustainable practices in their
daily lives too, whether it is at home, at school or university, or in the workplace.
We all have a role to play, but we also need systemic change. We are all part of the
solution, but we need the framework, choices and tools to act."

What do you think of the fact that instruments such as CSRD reporting contain very
many regulations, and that this is not conducive to raising the level of business
enthusiasm for sustainability?

"This Commission is making it simpler to do business in Europe because
complexity and red tape are serious obstacles to innovation and progress. Our
goal is to help companies reduce their carbon footprint without putting them at a
competitive disadvantage. The Commission's recent proposals to simplify the
CSRD will reduce complexity of EU requirements for all businesses, notably small
and medium enterprises (SMEs) and small mid-caps (SMCs). They will focus our
regulatory framework on the largest companies which are likely to have a bigger
impact on the climate and the environment, while still enabling companies to
access sustainable finance for their clean transition.

Finally, a look in the future. If we create a new edition of our book in a few years,
what success of your policy would you like to have appointed? Of course, we hope
for an answer that will help our students to work.

It's essential for our industry to achieve decarbonization without sacrificing
economic growth. I hope for a cleaner and more prosperous Europe--a place
where we want to live and that we can proudly pass on to current and future
students who read this book."

        Visualizing the Circular Economy

Visualizing helps us to learn to understand complex theories and concepts. It
transforms information into visuals to give us an instant overview to understand
and remember particular theories and approaches. Tools such as infographics,
charts, diagrams, graphs and drawings may show relationships, inputs, outputs
and other variables which our brain finds easier to process in this way. Visual tools
may also be regarded as storytelling, since they guide us through the information -
like a basic roadmap that you can apply to different situations. As discussed
earlier, it is important not only to be able to think analytically but also to have the
necessary flexibility, especially in the case of complex developments such as the
circular economy. Innovation, new developments and trends, technology,
changing legislation and public opinions make this a complex environment. In this
chapter we discuss visualizations and models that you apply to various scenarios
and use for problem-solving. For example, we will discuss the Butterfly Diagram,15
in which the loops of the model can be interpreted as strategies: strategies that
can be applied in circular product design, vision and strategy formulation, policy
design and the design of services that help keep materials in use instead of taking
them to landfill or incinerating them.

5.1 A visual representation of the circular economy
Visualization of the circular economy might be helpful to guide our brains into
understanding and rationalize the theory with the help of visual tools.
A visual representation is therefore, to be found on the next page.

5.2 The linear economy

To understand and visualize the circular economy, we first need to discuss the
linear economy. The linear and circular economy models represent two
fundamentally different views on production and consumption. The global growth
of human population in combination with the rise of single-use products, also
called disposables, has led to a dramatic increase in production and consumption
of natural resources. In the period after the Second World War, the world faced a
growing global market with increased business opportunities. Businesses
flourished and saw their sales growing as market demand was increasing rapidly.
Manufacturers focused on mass production. Product designers engineered their
products in such a way that they could be manufactured in large numbers. Low-
income countries with low-cost labor were used to manufacture products at lower
costs and in greater volumes. The linear economy emerged, which be
characterized by a linear process: extracting raw natural resources, making
products, using them and disposing them after use (take, make, use, dispose).
This economy caused globalization and was characterized by significant
economic growth and growth of waste production. It also led to the era of trade
liberalization, technological advancements, the rise of multinational corporations
and global financial institutions, the emergence of new economic powers, the
expansion of natural resource extraction and interdependence of countries.

5.3 The circular economy

The circular economy is a completely opposite system. It aims to design out
waste, instead focusing on the continual use of resources and renewable energy.
This economy is based on the fundamental philosophy of designing circular
products, using and re-using them. The circular economy may be regarded as a
closed-loop system in which products, materials and resources are maintained in
the economy for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from them.
Products and materials are recovered and regenerated after use in order to bring
them back into circulation as new products.

Thus, it is based on three fundamental principles: reduce, reuse, recycle, known
as the three R's. These three powerful and well-known words go back to the 1970s.
They remain the key strategy in promoting sustainable living, waste reduction and
resource conservation, and remain highly relevant in the context of the circular
economy. This economy pursues a `zero-waste society'. On the next page, a photo
shows the mantra of the circular economy painted on a wall in Bali, Indonesia. The
circular economy is especially relevant in Indonesia, as the country is struggling
with massive waste shipments from the western world which are dumped locally.

                                                           122
123
Figure 4 shows a graphical representation of the linear versus the circular
economy. Depicted on the left is the linear economy, in which depreciation of
products and materials takes place as the column moves downwards. After
throwing them away, there is no value left. This is in contrast to the circular
economy, in which products and materials are used again and again to prevent
waste. Their value is retained and CO2 emissions are reduced, compared to the
linear economy.

Figure 4. Linear economy with waste disposal versus circular economy where
waste is prevented by keeping materials in circulation. Illustration by B. van
Straten.
In the circular economy, after consumption, the product is collected and returned
to the system through various strategies and options, such as biological
regeneration, repair, maintenance, reuse of materials, refurbishment,
remanufacturing or recycling.
The visual on the next page shows used surgical instruments which have been
repaired to `newly manufactured condition'. A large hospital usually has more than
100.000 instruments in circulation, which are used on a daily basis under harsh
conditions. Replacing an instrument after it becomes blunt, bent or broken means
high replacement costs. It also requires new surgical steel, made out of alloys
consisting of multiple metals, some of which are getting scarcer. Repair is a
circular strategy which lowers costs, reduces waste streams of broken
instruments and relieves pressure on the Earth's natural resources.

                                                           124
125
The image below shows surgical instruments which are disposable. This means
that they are made out of surgical steel and intended to be used only once, after
which they are disposed of and incinerated. Scarce raw materials are burned in
this way, while the quality of the steel would have allowed many uses. Some
hospitals are known to through away over 50.000 surgical steel instruments per
year after only one time of use. The costs of continuously buying single-use steel
instruments is enormous, as are the waste processing costs. The cost of the
greenhouse gas emissions and the effect on the well-being of those living near
incineration facilities cannot be calculated.

                                                           126
5.4 The flow of materials and resources
The circular economy can be visualized by illustrating the flow of materials and
resources through a system that prioritizes the reduce - reuse - recycle model over
the traditional linear economy model. Below, a flow chart illustrates the circular
economy.

5.5 The Ellen MacArthur Foundation
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation37 published its model for visualizing the circular
economy in 2019.25 This model of the circular economy system diagram, known as
the butterfly diagram and perhaps to be considered as a successor to Braungart &
McDonough's Cradle 2 Cradle model (Figure 4), as it illustrates the continuous
flow of materials in the circular economy.38,39 There are two main cycles: the
technical cycle and the biological cycle. In the technical cycle, products and
materials are kept in circulation through processes such as reuse, repair,
remanufacture and recycling. In the biological cycle, the nutrients from
biodegradable materials are returned to the Earth to regenerate nature.

5.6 The Butterfly Diagram
We have already discussed this diagram in detail in our previous book Creating a
Circular Healthcare,17 where we discussed the circular principles can be applied
to policy choices, strategy formation and product design choices. We will briefly
discuss this diagram in Figure 5 here.

Figure 4. Updated Butterfly Diagram for decontaminated medical devices. © Ellen
MacArthur Foundation.
The left side of the butterfly diagram shows the biological cycle of use to reuse.
This applies to materials and food we consume. Instead of disposing them to
landfill, we biodegrade them and return them to the earth.

5.7 The technical loops in the diagram

In healthcare, one extra step should take place: decontamination. With potentially
contaminated healthcare waste, decontamination is needed before we can safely
reprocess materials and components. For example, if we want to remove precious
metals, valuable parts or printed circuit boards from used robotic instruments or
cardiac catheters, we want to be sure that the instrument is clean after use in the
operating room before we touch it.

On the right side of the butterfly diagram as shown in Figure 6, the technical cycle
is shown, which applies to products and materials.

                     130
The diagram shifts from smaller to larger loops. The inner, smaller loops require
less energy to keep the materials in circulation, as compared to the loops to the
outside. Maintenance, repair and reuse consume less energy than refurbishing,
remanufacturing and recycling. These loops also represent cost savings for
consumers, as these products and materials are already in circulation. Reusing
them is cheaper than the investments needed for making them new. Although
recycling requires a lot of energy, it is still significantly less than extracting natural
resources to process them into raw materials and products.

                                                           131
5.8 The biological loops of the diagram
On the left side of the butterfly diagram, there is the biological cycle as shown in
Figure 7.

After consumption these products are returned to the Earth. Some examples of
this are:

                                                           132
Composting

The aim of composting is to minimize organic waste by means of biological
reprocessing, for products that can biodegrade and be returned to the Earth. The
Ellen MacArthur Foundation describes the process of composting as "Composting
is the microbial breakdown of organic matter in the presence of oxygen".40
Composting turns biodegradable materials into compost, after which it can be
used, e.g. as fertilizer.

In product design, incorporating composting and biological reuse means to design
products that can either be decomposed or reused in natural cycles at the end of
their product life. This approach is aligned with the left-hand side of the butterfly
diagram, representing the biological cycle (Figure 6).

The cascade loops of the Butterfly Diagram include strategies where food-like
waste is used to make other products. Orange peels, for instance, are used more
and more to make appliance cleaners, cleaning sprays and air fresheners. As
mentioned before, the carton boxes of the GO Jack instrument opener20 were
made from grass fibers and the plastics bags from sugar cane.

Biobased plastics is another popular application. These are plastics made out of
renewable raw materials and can be biodegradable. Nowadays, natural
biopolymers are used in plastics processing. Materials used include bio-based
Polyamide, commonly called nylon, a semi crystalline thermoplastic (PA) using
cellulosic fibers, potato starch, vegetable oils and other components.41 Product
designers, manufacturers and suppliers aiming for a sustainable strategy should
investigate the use of bio-based polymers and bio-based plastics in their products
and packaging.

In policy, policymakers can implement a range of measures that encourage the
collection, processing, regeneration and use of organic materials. Incentives to
stimulate biological reprocessing are grants, subsidies, loans, tax reductions,
notifications of preferred supplier preferences, the creation of special
infrastructure (collection programs of organic waste in separate bins) and support
for concepts such as regeneration, (local) composting programs, anaerobic
digestion, and other forms of organic waste recycling. Mandatory organic waste
separation or restrictions on the disposal of organic waste as landfill could also be
implemented. From the perspective of policymakers and procurement managers,
it should be mandated that government agencies purchase compost and products
derived from biological reprocessing. Furthermore, user awareness campaigns for
these principles can be set up to stimulate the circular economy.

                                                           134
5.9 Circular principles in policy formation
Reducing waste, costs, dependence on other countries and CO2 emissions make
these circular strategies extremely attractive for policy formulation and future
decision-making. In other words, the following components could be included in
policy formulation and strategies:

     Biological recycling
     Maintenance and repair of products
     Sharing and reuse
     Refurbishment and remanufacturing
     Recycling of materials.

                                                           135
136
However, this means that we must design products and processes so that they
can easily be maintained, repaired, shared, refurbished, remanufactured and
recycled.
This includes stimulating modular design so components can be replaced and
remanufactured, or designing products with fewer mixed materials or with
materials that can easily be separated for recycling. Circular design also means
that design is aimed at processing through multiple loops, for instance a
repairable product made from recyclable materials which can be shared by
multiple users, supplied in biodegradable packaging.
Visualizing these circular strategies can help to illustrate how we can use these in
decision-making and policies in order to realize environmental, social and
economic sustainability. In particular in the field of healthcare as this is sector is
energy intensive, high in resource management and generation large amounts of
waste. Applying circular strategies on board, management and department level
may help to reduce costs, decrease waste streams and lower the amount of CO2
emissions. A visual representation of key circular strategies is shown in Figure 8:

By integrating these circular design principles, the diagram provides a
comprehensive overview of how different strategies can work together to achieve
sustainability, create a zero-waste society and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Each layer can serve as a basis for the foundation of a new circular policy:

1. Energy efficiency

Define steps and policies which mean using less energy to perform the same
tasks.

2. Renewable energy

Define steps and policies which stimulate the generation of energy from natural
sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal power.

3. Green building

Design and construct buildings that are environmentally responsible and
resource-efficient. This includes using sustainable materials, incorporating
energy- and water-efficient systems, and optimizing indoor environmental quality.

4. Water conservation

Define strategies that use water resources more efficiently.

Examples of this include low-flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting and water
recycling.

5. Sustainable transport

Stimulate transportation methods that have a lower environmental impact, such
as public transit, cycling, electric vehicles and car-sharing programs.

6. Sustainable resource management

Stimulate the efficient use and management of resources to reduce waste and
negative environmental impacts, such as sustainable forestry, fishing and mining
practices.

7. Circular economy

Support an economic system aimed at eliminating waste by stimulating measures
that continually reuse resources which would otherwise be regarded as waste.
This includes stimulating maintenance, repair, reuse, refurbishment,
remanufacturing and recycling of products and materials. Recycling one kg of
(medical) plastic leads to about 3 kg of CO2 reduction.10 For stainless steel this is
2 kg of CO2 savings for every kg of steel that is recycled.

                                                           139
8. Waste management
Efficiently manage waste to reduce its impact on the environment. This includes
recycling programs, composting and waste-to-energy technology.
9. Sustainable agriculture
Stimulate farming practices that protect the environment, public health and
animal welfare. Examples are organic farming, crop rotation and integrated pest
management. This enhances soil health, reduces chemical use and supports
biodiversity.
10. Eco-friendly manufacturing
This means producing goods in a way that minimizes environmental impact by
using sustainable materials, reducing waste and improving energy efficiency.
Visualizing these sustainable strategies helps to understand how the various
approaches interact and creates a holistic overview of all aspects in the chain.
Each strategy contributes to reducing environmental impact, conserving
resources and promoting long-term ecological balance. By implementing these
strategies, businesses, governments and individuals can work towards a more
sustainable and resilient circular future.

Design strategies for policies, products and
processes in a zero-waste society

6.1 Life on our planet
Our Earth and its life are unique. The arrangement of atoms and molecules on
Earth allow life to exist. Atoms and molecules are organized in complex and
organized structures and systems to support life. The essential atoms for life
include carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and
sulfur (S). These atoms form the basis of organic molecules. For life to exist, we
need essential molecules such as water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is
used by plants in photosynthesis to produce organic molecules. Many more
molecules and structures make our existence possible. From the atomic level to
the level of entire complex organisms, these organized structures and systems are
fundamental to life on Earth. The precise and intricate organization of these
components underscores the complexity and wonder of biological systems.
Until now, life on Earth is the only known life in the universe. This uniqueness not
only inspires, it should make us realize that we need to be more careful with our
planet. And not use up natural resources so that the next generations will not have
any use for them. Using waste as a resource for new products can help with this.
Achieving a circular economy in which we no longer create waste is essential.
That's why we should want to come up with zero-waste strategies.
Zero-waste strategies are aimed to minimize or even eliminate waste streams. The
circular economy has been variously defined. The definition by Geissdoerfer et al.
(2017) is spot on: "An economic system in which waste is prevented, minimized or
even completely reused".47

47. M. Geissdoerfer, P. Savaget, N.M.P. Bocken, EJ. Hultink. The Circular Economy
- A new sustainability paradigm? Journal of Cleaner Production., 143 (2017), pp.
757-768. https://doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.048.

                                                           145
To achieve this, we need to start "rethinking" our policies, processes and product
designs by creating zero-waste strategies. These strategies emphasize reducing,
repairing, reusing, remanufacturing and recycling to achieve a circular economy
where waste is eliminated and resources are continuously reused.
6.2 Zero-waste strategies
Writing an effective strategy involves a structured approach that clearly outlines
goals, identifies the means to achieve them, and details the steps necessary for
implementation. It is written based on a vision - an inspiring, desired outlook for
the long term - answering the question "What do we want to achieve in the future?"
In this case, the vision is achieving zero waste in a specific production process. A
strategy should be formulated broadly, with long-term aims, and be aligned with
your mission to accomplish the vision defined. Formulate the strategy according
to the `SMART' principles:

     Specific: Clearly defined.
     Measurable: Quantifiable.
     Achievable: Realistic.
     Relevant: Aligned with the vision.
     Time-specific: With clear deadlines.
Creating a circular economy strategy means writing a plan to enable the transition
from a linear "make-use-dispose" model to a circular "(re)make-use-reuse"
economy. Aspects that could be included are:
    · Design for longevity by stimulating products that are durable, repairable and

        upgradable.
    · Promoting reuse and refurbishment.
    · Formulate measures that extend the life of products through reuse, repair

        and refurbishment.
    · Facilitate recycling and composting.
    · Utilize renewable resources.
    · Switch to biodegradable materials where possible.

                                                           146
6.3 The R-ladder

In the 1970s, the R-ladder, or R-strategy, emerged from the concept of waste
hierarchy, which aimed to organize waste management approaches by their
environmental impact and sustainability. This framework first became prominent
with the 3R model - reduce, reuse, recycle - which gained popularity through
environmental campaigns focused on reducing pollution and waste. Over time,
the model has expanded to encompass additional steps, creating versions with
new R's such as Recover, Refuse, Repair and Repurpose. This broader hierarchy is
now often referred to as the waste management hierarchy or circular economy
hierarchy, aligning with global sustainability efforts.

There are multiple R-ladders and R-frameworks promoting R-strategies. One
ladder describes ten strategies in hierarchical order: refuse, rethink, reduce,
reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, reover.11,12 The
concept is built on the idea of prioritizing actions that reduce environmental
impact, inspired by the principles of circular economy and sustainable
development.

The R-ladder with the levels of circularity, the 10 R's,13 is a commonly used
hierarchy, as shown in Figure 6, representing different strategies for sustainable
materials and waste management. The classic 10-R ladder shows a linear
progression in which the R-strategies are placed from top to bottom, suggesting
that some (such as Refuse or Reduce) are always superior to others (such as
Recycle or Recover). Recycling, for example is often considered less favorable
compared to strategies such as Refuse, Reduce and Reuse. Recycling is low on
the ladder because it still requires energy and raw materials to process materials,
while the higher steps focus on preventing waste production.

However, this can lead to an underestimation of the value of certain circular
strategies, depending on the context. There are arguments why all R-steps are
equally important and why recycling should be ranked higher. An example of this
is the increasing focus on closed-loop recycling, where materials are reused with
minimal loss of quality and material costs. This ensures that recycling is a crucial
link in the circular economy, especially when the demand for recycled materials is
high and technological innovations ensure more efficient recycling processes.

                                                           147
                       Figure 6. Hierarchical order of R-strategies.13
We believe that all processes that can be applied to prevent waste are equally
valuable. Therefore, we present a revised version - as shown in figure 2 - of the
classic R-ladder, the 10-R circularity disc.14 This visualization encourages a more
balanced approach to all stages, rather than focusing only on specific R-
strategies. A circular approach emphasizes that every R-strategy is important; the
effectiveness of a strategy depends on the specific situation.

                                                           148
If we consider recycling of materials from the operation room, one should consider
that the mass flow of material can become very large and when a dedicated
recycling plant is optimized for a mono stream like "blue wrap" the processing
speed can be lowered towards a single minute. Especially when the end product
(pellets) are used as a direct replacement for imported plastics, the impact of
recycling on the environment compared to other R strategies is much higher than
visualized. Regarding the R strategy "Energy recovery", we see something similar.
For example when we consider energy exchange from conditioned air and water
use within sterilization departments, we see that placement of re-circulation
ducts and heat exchangers that boost the energy recovery towards 60 percent 48
have a huge impact on energy loss and actual savings for a hospital that cannot be
reached easily with other strategies. Therefore, if actual mass/material flows are
considered per strategy, we opt for a more balanced visualization order of
strategies versus impact.

6.4 The circularity disc, the modified R-ladder

R-ladder with a circular and balanced approach to all R-stages.
http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.32538.45763
The objective of the 10-R circularity disc , as opposed to a linear ladder, is to make
all R-strategies inclusive without discrimination or prioritizing the one over the
other. In some cases, products or processes certain R-strategies might me more
or less valuable than others. And we increasingly see that a combination of
different R-strategies is much more powerful than selecting or prioritizing one
strategy over another. In the case of R-strategies in healthcare, we will discuss a
number of those that can be applied frequently:

                                                           151
Reduce
It is necessary to design strategies that minimize consumption of products, energy
and materials. These strategies will contribute to reducing waste streams. There
are various methods to do so.
In product design, defining a strategy that reduces waste involves incorporating
circular design principles of from the very beginning of the design process. These
strategies focus on designing products with fewer (different) materials, with
modular design - reducing complexity and increasing flexibility - and minimize the
use of parts, additives and adhesives. The aim to use recycled materials, as this
means less energy is required to make the product.
In packaging, it's necessary to reduce the amount of packaging where possible.
For example, it's possible to print on the product instead of using labels, and to
use QR codes instead of paper for instruction manuals. It's also recommended to
use biobased or recycled materials for packaging. For instance, for the GO Jack
instrument opener20 we used carton packaging made from grass fibers and
biobased plastic bags made from sugar cane.
In policy, integrating the Reduce principle implies creating regulations and
initiatives that minimize resource consumption, waste generation and
environmental impact. For instance, this can be done by introducing tax
incentives, grants or subsidies for initiatives, products or companies that minimize
waste or implement resource-efficient practices. Another important aspect for
policy-making is to stimulate awareness of sustainable consumption and to teach
consumers about the benefits of reducing consumption and choosing sustainable
products. For purchasing policies, it's a useful strategy to implement the Reduce
principle in tenders, so that projects are awarded according to a new standard,
namely to companies that work with biobased or circular materials in their
products and packaging. It is also necessary to choose suppliers that promote
sustainable design and manufacturing and collect their packaging and products
at end-of-life for recycling.

                                                           152
Reuse
In product design, the Reuse principle can be incorporated by designing products
to have long lifespans. Products designed according circular economy principles
can be easily repaired, refurbished or remanufactured. Strategies for these kinds
of products allow easy access to parts; they facilitate easy disassembly and have
a modular design, so that individual components can be replaced. The
components, moreover, are designed to be reused. These products are designed
to have high-quality parts and components, which guarantees a long-life span.
Strategies which focus on Reuse should also incorporate reusable packaging.
Reusable packaging is a key component of sustainable product design and
circular economy practices. Examples are refillable bottles, refilling options for
cleaning products such as shampoo and body wash, returning glass bottles and
coffee and tea cups, reusable shopping bags and reusable gowns.
In policy, authorities could use Reuse in their policy formulation to prescribe the
use of reusable packaging; for instance by placing taxes on single-use plastics, or
by offering incentives for re-usable packaging. In procurement, this strategy can
be effectively enforced by formulating so-called `knock-out' criteria in purchasing
processes for single-use products or packaging in tenders or purchasing policy.
This keeps suppliers and therefore product designers alert to increasingly focus
on sustainable solutions. In this way, an entire sector can be pushed in the right
direction.

Recycle

In product design, it is always good to choose recycled materials for any product
design that lends itself to this. In the design process, the fact that the product
should be recycled can be taken into account from the very beginning when
choosing materials and further design. But suppliers can even go one step further
by designing collection systems for their products, as well as comprehensive
recycling programs. This also immediately gives the supplier an advantage over
others, because many consumers will choose their product because of its
sustainability and their "take-back" programs. A fundamental aspect in eco-
design is to model products with a holistic view, meaning designing with the entire
life cycle in mind: from using recycled materials to design for disassembly,
collection and recycling, including eco-packaging.

In policy and procurement, strategies for recycling and the use of recycled
products can be stimulated by encouraging product designers and as well as
users. Various policy measures, incentives and educational initiatives can be
formulated to stimulate recycling, such as deposit-refund systems, tax incentives,
charges for non-recyclable waste volumes, minimum recycling targets, supplier
responsibility for taking back broken products for recycling, bans on certain
products and bans on designing products that will end up in landfill. Authorities
can further stimulate recycling by co-funding and facilitating this, e.g. via loans,
recycling facilities, collection bins, stimulating recycling technology, education
and awareness campaigns. By formulating a combination of these and others
measures in policy or tenders, a robust recycling strategy can be designed.

On the next page, a photo is shown of the GreenCycl FieldLab, where hospital
packaging and other waste is collected. The image shows polypropylene blue wrap
waste; blue wrap functions as sterilization paper for surgical instrument sets and
is disposed of after use. In the Netherlands alone, an estimated 1.3 million kg is
thrown away every year. GreenCycl melts this blue wrap into high-quality medical
grade polypropylene, which can be used to produce new medical products, such
as the GO Jack instrument opener.11 These instruments are distributed to the same
hospitals who handed in their polypropylene waste for recycling.

fertilizer in floriculture. Compost is rich in nutrients and organic matter, making it
an excellent soil amendment that can improve soil structure, enhance water
retention, and provide essential nutrients for plant growth. In a growing number of
places such as the Bollenstreek, compost made from organic waste is used, such
as vegetable, fruit and garden waste (GFT), is increasingly used. This compost is
often used in bulb cultivation and ornamental horticulture as a soil improver.
Composting organic waste and reusing it in agriculture and horticulture
contributes to a circular economy.

Zero-waste policies are aimed to reduce waste generation, promote the reuse of
materials, and ensure that any waste produced is recycled or composted. Sending
waste to landfills or incinerators is discouraged.
Creating effective policies, procurement strategies, and product or corporate
decisions is not easy when aiming to comply with circular economy principles by
realizing zero-waste as output.
Product designers should create products with modular parts that can be easily
repaired or upgraded instead of replaced. Furthermore, products should be
designed so they can be reused; a good example are refill systems, where
consumers can refill containers instead of buying new ones. Recycling should be
incorporated into product concepts, so that materials can be recycled back into
the same product. This means that products maintain their value and fewer raw
materials are needed. Packaging should be also redesigned to use less material.
Where possible, biological and composting principles should be used to create
compostable packaging, or packaging made from biodegradable materials that
decompose naturally.
By choosing products that are reusable, durable and made from recyclable or
biodegradable materials, consumers contribute to reducing waste and
promoting a more sustainable future. The positive and lasting impact of policies,
procurement and management decisions is significant. These decisions affect all
aspects of our lives and are needed to make the transfer to a circular economy.

Recycled materials: using waste as input for
new products

Earth has paid a high price for global economic growth. As economies grew since
the Second World War, governments and consumers seemed paralyzed to
counteract the negative effects of depleting the Earth's natural resources. Despite
decades of scientific evidence, it is remarkable how few projects were funded and
have actually worked to counteract the depletion. And still it seems that political
agendas do not focus on limiting ecological damage, despite the fact that the
quest for natural resources dominates geopolitical developments. The current
world order seems to be around the dependence of oil and gas reserves, rare
metals and precious materials. This dependence leads to geopolitical tensions
and conflicts and will only intensify as raw materials become scarcer. Creating a
vision to reduce this dependence on scarce resources by reusing materials should
be on the radar of every world leader. Territorial claims, trade wars and disputes
over valuable raw materials will be less necessary when we harvest them from our
own waste streams which could lead to a more stable world order. Instead of
focusing on other countries in order to secure these materials.

Utilizing recycled materials is a key component of the circular economy. By
integrating recycled materials into production processes, companies can
contribute to the circular economy, reduce their ecological footprint, and meet the
growing demand for sustainable products - meaning recycling also offers
commercial benefits.

7.1 The benefits of recycling

Using materials again and again is a fundamental element of the circular
economy. Using recycled materials in production and manufacturing offers
numerous environmental, economic and social benefits:

Environmental benefits

Recycling materials diverts waste from landfills, reducing the strain on these sites
and decreasing the amount of waste that contributes to soil and water pollution.

                                                           165
Conserves natural resources
Using recycled materials reduces the need for virgin resources, such as timber,
water, minerals and fossil fuels. This helps preserve natural ecosystems and
biodiversity.
Reduces greenhouse gas emissions
Manufacturing products from recycled materials typically requires less energy
than producing them from raw materials, leading to lower carbon emissions. For
example, recycling aluminum saves 95% of the energy needed to make new
aluminum from bauxite ore.
Preventing pollution
Recycling processes reduce the amount of air and water pollution associated with
extracting, refining and processing raw materials. This includes reducing toxic
emissions from mining activities and industrial processes.
Cost savings
Manufacturing with recycled materials can be more cost-effective than using
virgin materials, due to lower raw material costs and reduced energy
consumption.
Job creation
The recycling industry creates jobs in the collection, processing and
manufacturing sectors.
Market opportunities
Growing consumer demand for sustainable products drives innovation and
market opportunities in developing and selling goods made from recycled
materials.
Public health
Reducing waste and pollution through recycling can lead to improved public
health by minimizing exposure to harmful chemicals and pollutants.
Community engagement
Recycling programs can engage communities in environmental stewardship and
awareness, fostering a culture of sustainability and responsibility.

                                                           166
Education and awareness
The use of recycled materials promotes awareness of environmental issues and
encourages responsible consumer behavior and sustainable practices.
Supply chain security
Recycling provides an alternative source of raw materials, which can be more
reliable and less volatile than sourcing virgin materials, particularly during times
of resource scarcity or geopolitical instability.
Compliance and the Corporate Social Reporting Directive (CSRD)
The CSRD is European Union legislation, from January 2023, that necessitates EU
businesses to make known their environmental and social impacts, and how their
environmental, social and governance (ESG) actions affect their business.
Using recycled materials can help companies meet environmental regulations.
7.2 Mineral scarcity
One of the great challenges for future generations will be mineral scarcity. If we
continue to consume these minerals as we do now the next generations will face
the consequences. It is remarkable that this is so little emphasized in the political
agenda. Politicians, policymakers, companies and the public should and could
make more efforts to prevent this challenge for instance by stopping incineration
of valuable waste streams and stimulate recycling with incentives instead of
subsidizing virgin oil and virgin iron ore initiatives. In any case, we have to stop
depleting the Earth.
It is of the utmost importance that rare, strategic and critical materials do not end
up in landfill or the incinerator.
An important way to do so is to start using waste as raw material for new products.
Not only for the standard, easy forms of recycling such as glass, metal and paper,
but also for rare minerals such as cobalt, iridium, molybdenum and lithium. Many
of these rare earth minerals are infinitely recyclable - we only need to find a way to
get it done at the same costs as traditional mining.

                                                           167
7.3 Examples of recycled waste as input for new products
Some examples of how waste can be used to make new products include:

     Recycled PET plastic can be used in sound-absorbing panels.
     Recycled plastic from bottles, e.g. polyester waste, can be used in clothing.
     Recycled ocean plastic, e.g. polyester waste, can be used for making shoes,

        as is done by Adidas.
     Organic agricultural waste materials can be used to produce biodegradable

        plastics.
     Plant-based waste can be used to make plant-based plastics for Coca-Cola

        bottles.49
     Food waste can be used reprocessed into biogas for compost or fertilizer

        for agricultural purposes.
     Urban mining can yield precious metals, as in the case of the GreenCycl

        initiative to harvest iridium and platinum from cardiac catheters.
     Medical blue wrap waste can be used for polypropylene raw material to

        make the GO Jack instrument opener.20
     Sugarcane can be used to make plastic packaging and transport bags.20
     Fairphone utilizes recycled materials in the production of modular

        smartphones.
     Electronic waste can be used to make new electronics and phones.50
     Hemp hurd and mycelium can be used as input for protective packaging.51
     Computer waste plastics can be used for new computer cases, for example

        Dell's closed-loop recycling program.52
     Disposed Zamak laryngoscopic blades can be used for new turning

        wheels.53

These are just a few examples illustrating the potential of using waste as valuable
raw material to make new products. By adopting these practices, businesses and
industries can significantly reduce their environmental impact, conserve natural
resources, and make a difference by contributing to a more sustainable and
circular economy.

7.4 Using waste as input for new products in healthcare
At the GreenCycl Field Lab, we started to experiment with melting plastic and
metal waste in 2019. Now, we recycle different kinds of medical waste streams
into high quality raw materials. The following waste streams are relatively easy to
collect from hospitals and can be 100% recycled into raw materials of good
quality.
Plastics

     Implants and instrument packaging made from PET.
     Blue wrap, cups and liquid collectors made from polypropylene.
     Instrument handles and complex surgical instruments made from ABS.
     Bags, foils and packaging made from polyethylene.
Metal-based waste
     Instrument mesh baskets, furniture and OR equipment made from stainless

        steel 304.
     Disposable instruments made from stainless steel 304.
     Reusable medical instruments made from stainless steel 316.
     Equipment for the hospital central sterilization dpt. (CSSD), discarded

        cleaning equipment and autoclaves made from steel.
Figure 8 shows a visualization of the production line at GreenCycl where hospital
waste is recycled into high-grade raw material in an energy-efficient manner.

                                                           170

The above visualization shows some key aspects in implementing a circular
economy process in healthcare. It starts with changing the behavior - the mindset
of the users in the hospital towards sustainable solutions. Once the hospital is on
board with recycling waste, the waste streams must be collected, such as plastics
and steel instruments. After collection, these waste streams are ground in a
special grinding mill. The ground material can be used in various ways to make new
products. This drawing shows the process of 3D printing of new instruments. 3D
printing has the advantage that no molds need to be made, which saves costs. It
is a good method to make new products and in a sustainable way. Solar energy
should be used to generate energy for 3D printing. After the safety certification
process, the products can be reused in the hospital. Thus, the hospital is the
supplier of its own raw materials. An important aspect of the process is to use less
material for both the product and the packaging.

                                                           171
The key aspects:
     Stimulating change of behavior through education.
     Creating legislation and policies for collection, recycling and certification.
     Constructing infrastructure and technology.
     Using circular product principles and eco-design.
     Provide incentives such as grants, subsidies and tax reliefs.
     Share stories of success with communities and stimulate copy behavior.
     Apply a holistic approach to realize the Reduce - reuse - recycle principle.

blue wrapping paper, which would otherwise have been made out of oil. As shown
in figure 7, this is a type of urban mining, i.e., mining materials from urban areas.
Waste is collected from hospitals, cleaned, melted it into a solid material and
ground it into usable granules.

How to assess "green" products with LCAs: LCA methodology
and reliability risk factors

This chapter gives an introduction into Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology
and its applicability to the healthcare sector, as well as its possible contributions
to a circular economy in healthcare.
First, a general description of the general LCA methodology is provided, including
its inherent limitations. Special emphasis is placed on the surgical field by
identifying key risk factors that may contribute to inconsistent or even
contradictory results in LCAs of surgical instruments, thereby jeopardizing the
reliability of findings in this area. Additionally, best practices and strategies to
mitigate these risk factors are explored. Next, to further understand the issues
impacting the reliability of LCA findings in the surgical field and to investigate
potential solutions, stakeholders' perspectives and experiences regarding LCA
practices within this field will be examined through a survey targeting members of
the EAES.

8.1 Definition of Life Cycle Assessment
LCAs are one of several environmental management tools, including risk
assessments, environmental performance evaluations and environmental audits,
aimed at supporting environmental decision-making. Unlike these other methods,
which focus on specific aspects related to environmental management, such as
risk, performance or compliance, LCAs provide a comprehensive evaluation of the
environmental impacts associated with every stage of a product's life cycle, from
raw material extraction to disposal. This `cradle-to-grave' approach ensures that
all environmental burdens are considered and helps prevent the shifting of
impacts between different life cycle stages or impact categories. These burdens
can include a wide range of issues, including energy consumption and the
emission of hazardous pollutants.

                                                           181
The methodology of LCAs is systematically outlined by the ISO 14040 and 14044
standards and encompasses four main phases:
1) Goal and scope definition,
2) Life Cycle Inventory (LCI),
3) Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA),
4) Interpretation.
This framework assists practitioners through a structured and iterative evaluation
process, promoting consistency and transparency while encouraging continuous
review and refinement of the LCA process. Supplementary tools, such as the
International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD), offer further detailed
guidance aligned with the ISO 14040 and 1404444 standards to enhance the quality
of LCA practices. A visual representation of the general LCA methodology is
provided in Figure 10. Additionally, for a summary of the identified risk factors and
corresponding mitigation strategies, please refer to Table 1. The methodology and
key risk factors for each phase are further discussed in the following sections.

Figure 10: The general LCA methodology. The arrows represent the flow of data and
information. Specifically, the red arrows indicate the iterative refinement process
of the LCA, ensuring that the study aligns with the defined goal and scope while
maintaining methodological appropriateness and high data quality. In cases
where data limitations cannot be adequately resolved, adjustments to the initial
goal and scope definition may be required.

                                                           182
Phase 1: Goal and scope definition
The goal and scope definition phase of an LCA is essential for establishing the
framework of the study. The goal encompasses defining the study's applications,
rationale and target audience, while the scope involves specifying the product
under investigation and establishing the modelling methodologies, quality
standards, reporting requirements and review processes necessary to align the
LCA with its intended uses and audience. Early definition of these specifications
is vital for maintaining the credibility and reproducibility of results. As the LCA
progresses, initial scope definitions may require adjustments based on new data
or insights to ensure the LCA remains relevant and accurate. The iterative nature
of this process underscores the importance of documenting any changes for
transparency throughout the study.
Application
LCA applications are varied, encompassing product comparisons, improvements
in product design, the creation of environmental product declarations, and policy
development through impact assessments. Each application comes with specific
ISO 14040 and 14044:200654 requirements regarding data sets, reporting and
review, which can result in variations in methodological approaches. In the
surgical field, LCAs provide a structured framework for evaluating the
environmental impacts of various surgical instruments, from reusable
instruments that require energy-intensive cleaning processes to disposable
options that consume significant materials and generate substantial waste. In this
context, LCA applications include, for example, comparing the environmental
impacts of functionally identical surgical devices and evaluating a single surgical
device to analyze the differences in environmental impact among various design
options.

Rationale
Understanding the motivations for conducting the LCA and the specific decision-
making context helps to shape the LCA to meet its unique needs, ensuring that the
results are relevant to the identified target audience. In the surgical field, LCA
results assist instrument manufacturers in making eco-design decisions prior to
market entry, helping them secure eco-friendly certifications or distinguishing
their products. Additionally, LCA results can support healthcare institutions in
making informed choices about sustainable procurement practices. It's important
to note that not all LCAs are intended for decision support; some are purely
descriptive, focusing on documenting the environmental aspects of the product
being analyzed.
However, LCA practitioners themselves may have specific interests in the study
outcomes, which can result in biased decisions during the LCA process, ultimately
affecting the results and compromising reliability. Therefore, it is essential to
clearly document the reasons for undertaking the LCA, particularly within a
specific decision-making context, along with the entities commissioning the study
from the start. Additionally, since studies are often funded by stakeholders with
particular interests, transparency in identifying any co-financing parties is crucial
for maintaining the study's credibility.
For instance, while reusable surgical instruments typically provide environmental
advantages over disposables, a study by Leiden et al. found that a reusable lumbar
fusion instrument set was nearly seven times more climate-polluting than its
single-use counterpart. It was later revealed that the study was funded by the
manufacturer of the single-use set, raising concerns about the reliability of its
findings.

                                                           184
185
Target audience

The target audience, whether internal or external, technical or non-technical,
influences the level of detail and confidentiality required in the reporting and
should therefore be clearly specified from the start. LCAs involving comparative
statements for public disclosure must adhere to additional requirements outlined
in ISO 14040 and 14044:2006, due to the potential wider implications of their
findings.

Function, functional unit and reference flow

The function of a product refers to the specific services or performance it offers,
while the functional unit quantifies this function in detail, including aspects such
as quantity, quality and duration of use. This unit serves as a standard reference
against which impacts are evaluated, ensuring that LCA results are meaningful,
comparable and applicable to real-world decision-making. The reference flow
then defines the quantity of the product needed to fulfil the specified functional
unit.

Literature reviews reveal significant variations in functional units across LCAs
involving reusable surgical instruments, ranging from `one use', which distributes
the impacts of reusable instruments over their number of uses in their life cycle,
to functional units based on the overall lifespan of these instruments. Since
environmental impacts are evaluated based on the defined functional unit,
different functional units can lead to varying results among LCA studies examining
similar instruments. For instance, the study by Donahue et al. used a functional
unit of 20 uses to compare a reusable stainless steel vaginal speculum with an
assumed lifespan of 20 uses of 20 single-use acrylic specula.

In contrast, Rodriguez and Hicks employed a functional unit of 5,000 uses,
comparing 100 stainless steel reusable specula, each with an assumed lifespan
of 50 uses, against 5000 single-use acrylic specula. Although both studies
reported lower carbon footprints for reusable specula compared to the single-use
versions, Rodriguez and Hicks' study reported significantly higher climate change
impacts due to the larger functional unit used, compared to Donahue et al.'s
findings.

                                                           186
However, the different assumptions regarding the lifespan of the reusable
stainless steel vaginal speculum (50 uses in the study by Rodriguez and Hicks
compared to 20 uses in Donahue et al.) highlight the challenges of standardizing
functional units in LCAs involving reusable surgical instruments, which may lead
to varying LCA results. Although the functional unit is typically based on the overall
lifespan of the instruments under study, the actual lifespan of a specific reusable
instrument is often not fixed and can vary between facilities due to several factors.
These include the complexity of procedures (as instruments employed in more
invasive procedures may degrade more quickly), the frequency and quality of
maintenance (with poor maintenance leading to premature wear and damage),
and storage conditions (instruments should be stored in a dry, clean and well-
organized manner to avoid physical damage).
Scenario analyses from various studies illustrate how modifications to functional
units, based on different assumptions about an instrument's lifespan, can alter a
study's findings.
For example, in the baseline scenario by Boberg et al.55, a functional unit of 500
procedures was based on an assumed lifespan of 500 uses for a mixed trocar
system that includes both single-use and reusable components. In this case, no
significant differences were found for resource use and ecosystem impacts when
comparing the mixed trocar system to 500 single-use counterparts. However,
when the functional unit was adjusted to 750 procedures based on an assumed
lifespan of 750 uses for the mixed system, the 750 single-use systems displayed a
greater impact on both resource use and ecosystem health. Conversely, reducing
the mixed system's lifespan and functional unit to 250 procedures made the
single-use systems appear more favorable.

By conducting a break-even analysis, the study by Rodriguez and Hicks further
highlights how differences between the assumed lifespan of a reusable
instrument and its actual number of uses can lead to misleading conclusions if not
carefully considered. They found that the disposable speculum breaks even with
the reusable speculum around the 40th use regarding the ecotoxicity impact
category, which assesses harmful effects on the environment and organisms.
With a functional unit of 50 uses, based on an assumed lifespan of 50 uses for the
reusable speculum, their findings indicate that the reusable option is more
environmentally favorable for this specific impact category.
However, if the speculum were actually used only 20 times, as assumed in the
study by Donahue et al.,56 and the functional unit adjusted to 20 uses, the
disposable speculum would be preferred based on its ecotoxicity impact results.
Therefore, they conclude that, given this uncertainty, no instrument outperforms
the other in terms of ecotoxicity impact.

To accurately quantify the functional unit and ensure reliable assessments across
instruments that serve similar functions, a profound technical understanding of
the analyzed instrument, along with LCA expertise, is essential.
Functional units should reflect typical or average usage scenarios based on
standard practices that are well-supported and agreed upon by stakeholders
familiar with the practical application of the instrument. Moreover, performing a
break-even analysis is essential to address uncertainties related to an
instrument's actual lifespan, preventing incorrect conclusions from being drawn
due to potentially inaccurate assumptions. Additionally, providing detailed
descriptions, photographs and technical specifications can enhance clarity
regarding the product being studied.

Phase 2: Life Cycle Inventory

8.2 Life Cycle Inventory

During the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) phase of an LCA, the actual data collection
and modelling of the product system are performed in line with the goals and
specifications set in the scope phase. It not only provides the necessary data for
the subsequent LCIA phase but also provides insights for refining scope settings
based on new insights or data to better reflect actual conditions. The LCI phase
typically is the most resource-intensive part of an LCA.

Life Cycle Inventory modelling framework

The choice of Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) modelling framework, either attributional
or consequential, affects which processes are included in the assessment of the
product's life cycle, how they are integrated into the LCI model, and the types of
inventory data and additional information required. Attributional modelling
focuses on quantifying the environmental impacts directly linked to a product
system, covering all unit processes throughout its lifecycle. This framework is
particularly effective for documenting the product supply chain as it stands,
specifying the share of global environmental impacts associated with the product
without considering broader market or environmental changes resulting from
product-related decisions.

In contrast, consequential modelling examines how hypothetical product-related
decisions can lead to changes in market behavior and, consequently, alterations
in environmental flows. This dynamic approach makes consequential modelling
suitable for assessing the broader environmental impacts of new products or
policies.

System boundaries

Defining system boundaries is crucial for distinguishing the analyzed product
system from the broader technological sphere, as it clearly specifies which life
cycle stages and processes are necessary to achieve the system's functional unit.
In cradle-to-grave LCAs the entire life cycle is covered, from raw material
acquisition to disposal, whereas cradle-to-gate LCAs focus on the initial stages,
from raw material acquisition up to the point where the product is ready for
distribution, excluding its use and disposal.

By establishing precise system boundaries according to the chosen LCI modelling
framework, all significant environmental interactions that cross the boundary
between the system and the ecosphere are considered, allowing less relevant
processes to be excluded or simplified. For transparency, these boundaries
should be visually represented in a semi-schematic diagram to show included and

                                                           190
excluded life cycle stages and processes. However, accurately defining system
boundaries can be challenging, particularly for LCAs of surgical instruments, due
to the complexity of the instruments and their life cycles. These instruments,
particularly the complex ones, typically consist of various materials and
components and undergo specialized processes, such as component
manufacturing, assembly, reprocessing for reuse and waste treatment, each with
variables that vary by location or facility.
In comparative LCAs of surgical instruments, certain processes are often
excluded to simplify the analysis, especially when these processes are not directly
related to the product life cycles or are assumed to be comparable for both
products. This is particularly common for elements related to the use phase, such
as capital goods and hospital infrastructure.
However, although the impacts associated with the production and disposal of
capital goods used for instrument reprocessing, such as washing machines and
autoclaves, are typically excluded due to the assumption that these impacts are
not directly connected to the instrument's life cycle, their operational use is
generally included. While the long lifespan of these machines makes the
production and disposal impacts negligible for a single device, their operational
use can contribute significantly to the environmental footprint of a reusable
instrument.
Despite efforts to simplify the analysis by excluding less relevant processes, LCA
practitioners often face difficulties in capturing all relevant processes, as detailed
operational data is often unavailable. This forces them to make trade-offs: they
can either include additional elements and processes to expand the scope of the
assessment, which may risk compromising data quality, or exclude them to
preserve data quality, potentially limiting the comprehensiveness of the analysis.
Such inconsistencies in defining system boundaries can lead to significant
variations in reported environmental impacts and may result in inconsistent
findings.

                                                           191
This issue is particularly evident in studies where different decisions have been
made regarding the inclusion or exclusion of components or processes related to
instrument reprocessing, as can be seen in the studies by Donahue et al.56 and
Rodriguez and Hicks. After adjusting for functional units, Donahue et al. 56 reported
a global warming potential for a stainless-steel reusable vaginal speculum that
was more than double that reported by Rodriguez and Hicks. This variation was
primarily attributed to Donahue et al.'s56 inclusion of sterilization pouches, which
were excluded in the analysis by Rodriguez and Hicks.57
Furthermore, while many LCAs of surgical instruments aim to cover the full life
cycle of the instrument, determining its end-of-life fate can be challenging due to
limitations in data and time. As a result, simplified assumptions are often made
about the end-of-life phase, which in turn influence decisions about which
processes and elements are included or excluded from the system boundaries.
For instance, in LCAs that assume recycling, material recovery is typically factored
into the system boundaries, leading to reduced waste and decreased demand for
virgin materials.
This approach is often applied to metal instruments, such as stainless steel
scissors or specula, where recycling is feasible because these metals retain their
properties and reprocessing them poses minimal biological risks. In contrast, in
LCAs that assume landfilling as the end-of-life treatment, future material recovery
is not accounted for, as no materials are recovered. Since landfilling is generally
viewed as a less sustainable option, it is typically only applied to instruments
made from materials that cannot be recycled or incinerated, such as certain
composites or polymers.

57. Morris, M. I. R., & Hicks, A. (2022). Life cycle assessment of stainless-steel
reusable speculums versus disposable acrylic speculums in a university clinic
setting: a case study. Environmental Research Communications, 4(2), 025002.

                                                           192
Even in studies that assume similar end-of-life pathways, system boundaries can
still vary. This is particularly evident in LCA studies that consider the disposal of
instruments as waste followed by incineration.
For instance, single-use instruments made from plastics or composites, such as
plastic surgical scissors or laryngeal mask airways, which are often difficult to
recycle due to infection risks, are typically treated as waste and incinerated.
Similarly, complex devices like single-lung ventilation systems, composed of
multiple parts and materials, complicate the separation of reusable components,
leading to their classification as waste and subsequent incineration.
Some LCAs include energy recovery from the heat produced during incineration
within the system boundaries, subtracting this recovered energy from the device's
overall lifecycle energy consumption. However, other studies do not account for
this energy recovery, leading to variations in reported LCA outcomes.

                                                           193
Extending the lifespan of surgical instruments through repair or remanufacturing
processes has significant potential to reduce their environmental footprint, as
demonstrated in studies by Rizan et al.58 and Schulte et al. For example, Rizan et
al. showed that repairing a reusable stainless steel scissor is more
environmentally advantageous than producing a new one, while Schulte et al.
found that remanufacturing a disposable catheter offers greater environmental
benefits than manufacturing entirely new devices.
Despite these potential benefits, repair and remanufacturing remain
underexplored and are not yet widely adopted. The primary challenge lies in the
lack of detailed data needed to account for all related processes and impacts,
which complicates their inclusion in the system boundaries of LCAs for surgical
instruments. This issue is especially prominent for the repair or remanufacturing
of more complex instruments, which consist of various materials and
components, so that their repair or remanufacturing requires specialized
equipment and techniques, for which little data is available.

58. Rizan, C., Steinbach, I., Nicholson, R., Lillywhite, R., Reed, M., & Bhutta, M. F.
(2020). The carbon footprint of surgical operations: a systematic review. Annals of
surgery, 272(6), 986-995.

                                                           194
Additionally, determining which parts can be reused and estimating their potential
lifespan demands extensive research, often beyond the scope of standard LCA
assessments. Schulte et al. addressed this challenge by incorporating a circularity
metric into their LCA, accounting for the reuse of parts and materials over multiple
product cycles. While remanufacturing was found to be more advantageous when
multiple life cycles were considered, the overall environmental impacts were
higher compared to focusing on a single life cycle, underscoring how LCA results
can vary based on how end-of-life pathways are integrated into system
boundaries.
In some LCA studies, uncertainties about an instrument's actual end-of-life
pathway and material recovery rates have led to the decision to omit the end-of-
life phase altogether. However, while certain processes or entire phases might be
deliberately excluded due to data limitations, others might be unintentionally
overlooked, despite their potential to contribute significantly to the overall
environmental impact.
Given this, it is critical to carefully assess and justify which processes or elements
are excluded from the system boundaries, based on the study's goals and the data
available. With reprocessing activities playing a major role in the environmental
impacts of surgical instruments, particularly for these activities, system boundary
decisions should be made carefully.
Drawing insights from high-quality studies of similar products is suggested, and
any exclusions should be supported by quantitative reasoning rather than based
purely on the type of activity or component. To improve understanding and ensure
transparency and completeness, a detailed overview of all processes and aspects
excluded from the system boundaries, along with their potential environmental
contributions, is highly recommended.

                                                           195
8.3 Multifunctionality
To effectively capture the complexities of a product system, it is essential to
decide already during the scope definition how to manage the multifunctionality
of processes that yield multiple products or functions. The ISO 14044:2006
standard provides a hierarchy of approaches to effectively isolate the inventory
associated with the specific product or function of interest. Subdivision is the
preferred method when possible, as it breaks down multifunctional processes into
simpler, single-function processes, thereby eliminating the need for allocation
calculations.

                                                           196
System expansion and substitution tackle multifunctionality by extending the
system to incorporate additional functions or by replacing unnecessary functions
with alternatives, which allows for crediting of avoided burdens and adjusting life
cycle inputs and outputs accordingly. In contrast, allocation requires careful
calculations to quantify total functional output and distribute environmental
burdens among the various products or functions based on shared characteristics
such as mass, energy content or economic value.
The selection of these methods largely depends on the LCI modelling framework
adopted and the unique characteristics of the product system being analyzed.
While attributional modelling typically uses allocation, consequential modelling
aims to minimize allocation by utilizing system expansion and substitution
instead, when direct subdivision is not feasible.
In the life cycle of reusable surgical instruments, reprocessing practices are a key
example of multifunctional processes, as multiple instruments are often
reprocessed simultaneously in sterilization and washing machines.
In LCAs that involve reusable instruments and utilize attributional modelling,
allocation is typically based on the mass load of instruments in washing or
sterilization machines. However, as these mass loads can vary between facilities
and even between reprocessing cycles, accurately isolating the proportional
impact of each instrument per session can be quite challenging. Variations in
assumptions regarding loading efficiencies can result in different environmental
outcomes for reprocessing practices, influencing the findings of LCA studies
focused on reusable instruments.

                                                           197
For instance, Unger et al. found that their baseline scenario of reusing a dental bur
30 times results in lower environmental impacts across all considered categories
compared to using it once, assuming the machines are fully loaded. However, in
scenarios with suboptimal loading, the environmental benefits diminish, and
when assuming a worst-case scenario where machines are only one-third full,
reusing the bur 30 times can even lead to more adverse impacts than using it just
once.
Additionally, Sørensen and Grüttner59 observed that reusable bronchoscopes had
a higher climate change impact than single-use options in their baseline scenario,
where only one bronchoscope was cleaned per operation. However, if more than
two bronchoscopes were cleaned simultaneously, the climate change impact
significantly decreased, making reusable options more environmentally favorable.

59. Sørensen, B. L., & Grüttner, H. (2018). Comparative study on environmental
impacts of reusable and single-use bronchoscopes. American Journal of
Environmental Protection, 7(4), 55-62.

                                                           198
Variations in how reprocessing multifunctionality is managed have even resulted
in contradictory findings across different LCA studies in the surgical field. For
example, while Friedericy et al.60 found that using an aluminum rigid sterilization
container (RSC) for sterilizing instrument sets was more environmentally
beneficial than single-use blue wrap, Rizan et al. reached the opposite conclusion.
In their analysis, Rizan et al. assigned the environmental impacts of sterilization to
the instruments themselves rather than to the packaging systems. Therefore, they
only considered the washing of RSCs, which demands significant energy and water
consumption, whereas single-use blue wrap does not suffer such washing
impacts.

60. Friedericy, H. J., van Egmond, C. W., Vogtländer, J. G., van der Eijk, A. C., &
Jansen, F. W. (2021). Reducing the environmental impact of sterilization packaging
for surgical instruments in the operating room: a comparative life cycle
assessment of disposable versus reusable systems. Sustainability, 14(1), 430.

                                                           199
Considering these examples of how LCA findings can be affected by the
management of multifunctionality in reprocessing practices, it is crucial that the
approach aligns with the selected LCI modelling framework and the unique
characteristics of the instrument being studied.
In particular, for LCAs employing attributional modelling, allocations should
represent typical or average loading scenarios based on standard practices that
are recognized and agreed upon by stakeholders familiar with instrument
reprocessing. Ideally, a reference hospital should be selected as a basis for
gathering accurate data on reprocessing practices, with the chosen loading
scenarios then customized to match the conditions at this reference facility.
8.4 Types of data
It is advised to prepare a detailed overview of the types of data and information
required for the modelling of the life cycle inventory of the product system,
covering for example raw inventory data, use patterns and end-of-life data.
Attributional modelling uses historical data to represent the processes as they
currently are or are expected to be, preferring specific, directly measured data
where possible and only using extrapolated average data when needed.
Consequential modelling, on the other hand, should include marginal data related
to the production of inputs, particularly when the product under study only has a
relatively small impact on total production volume. Marginal data capture the
changes in environmental burdens relative to production adjustments as linear
approximations, meaning that the environmental impact per unit of production
increase remains approximately constant.

                                                           200
8.5 Quality and sources of data

The availability of high-quality data sets, defined by their accuracy, precision and
completeness, is crucial for obtaining reliable LCA results and should therefore
already be established during the goal and scope definition phase of the
assessment. While accuracy ensures that the data accurately reflects the true
characteristics of the system being analyzed in terms of technological,
geographical, and temporal representativeness, precision measures the
uncertainty within the collected or modelled data, and completeness evaluates
whether all relevant processes and environmental interventions are included in
the inventory. Identifying and selecting reliable data sources early on, such as
well-documented and externally verified databases, can improve data quality and
significantly simplify the review process.

Data collection

The data collection process involves gathering quantitative information on all
relevant inputs and outputs associated with the product's life cycle, based on the
system boundaries defined during the scope phase. This includes product flows,
waste flows and elementary flows, which are obtained through measurements,
interviews, literature reviews and database searches.

For processes specific to the product system, primary data, collected directly
from product producers or process operators, is preferred. When necessary, this
primary data can be supplemented with secondary data from sources like patents,
existing databases, literature or other projects. In instances where data is also
lacking from these sources, expert judgement may be applied. For processes not
specific to the product system, it is common to rely on secondary data from
databases and research groups.

One of the main challenges in conducting LCAs is the lack of primary data on the
specialized life cycle processes specific to the surgical instrument under study.
Hospitals and manufacturers often fail to track or report critical information
related to material flows, energy use and waste generation, which is essential for
assessing environmental impacts.

This primary data gap is further widened by the different priorities of stakeholders
who may possess this valuable data but vary in their willingness to engage in the
LCA process, influencing both the level of detail and type of data they provide. This
results not only in a lack of primary data, but the data that is provided is often
limited and inconsistent in quality.

                                                           201
For instance, suppliers of semi-finished products and raw materials, as well as
instrument manufacturers themselves, may be reluctant to share data due to
fears of competitive disadvantage. Additionally, instrument manufacturers often
lack comprehensive information about the composition and manufacturing
processes of standard `off-the-shelf' components, such as screws, fasteners,
electronic components and connectors, as these components are typically
sourced from external suppliers rather than produced in-house.
Furthermore, with the limited number of potential suppliers in the surgical
instrument market, it is crucial that good relationships between manufacturers
and suppliers are maintained, which can further restrict data availability.
On the healthcare provider side, preferences for specific instruments can result in
adjustments to usage data, either being overly optimistic or pessimistic depending
on their preferred options, or the manufacturers or suppliers may choose not to
disclose any usage data at all.
Therefore, the successful execution of LCAs for surgical instruments depends
significantly on the cooperation of stakeholders involved in the instrument's life
cycle. To improve the reliability of LCAs in the surgical field, practitioners must
actively encourage stakeholder participation by emphasizing the importance and
urgency of the study.
It is essential for practitioners to secure stakeholders' commitment to the process
and uphold any agreements made. In cases where variations in the level of detail
in primary data are observed, practitioners should consider utilizing secondary
data to maintain more consistent data quality.

                                                           202
To fill the gaps in primary data concerning the manufacturing phase of an
instrument, LCA practitioners often rely on secondary data from comprehensive
LCI databases that offer detailed information at the unit process level for various
materials and manufacturing processes.

The same approach applies to data collection for an instrument's end-of-life
phase, where simplified assumptions are often made, relying on secondary data
from databases, to fill in the gaps of primary data on its actual end-of-life pathway.
Thus, the data collection process is further constrained by a frequent lack of
specific and up-to-date secondary data needed to address the gaps in primary
data on an instrument's specialized life cycle processes.

Due to the frequent unavailability or difficulty in obtaining specific data, the
secondary data usually relies on averages. For instance, these databases offer
insights into common materials and manufacturing processes for standard
components, such as off-the-shelf items lacking primary data, or market
processes reflecting the average consumption mix of a material. While the use of
averages helps fill data gaps, it may limit the accuracy of representing the actual
conditions for the instruments under study, potentially compromising the quality
of the data. Furthermore, there are many different databases available, each
varying in content and reliability. Some are recognized for their
comprehensiveness and transparency, such as the ecoinvent database which
contains over 10,000 datasets, while others may provide incomplete or outdated
information. As a result, the choice of database can significantly affect data
quality, and using multiple databases may lead to data quality inconsistencies.

In contrast to the numerous comprehensive databases that provide information
on a wide range of materials and manufacturing processes as well as potential
end-of-life pathways, detailed databases specifically focusing on the usage
practices of surgical instruments are not readily available. As a result,
practitioners often have to rely on existing literature or prior studies to obtain
secondary data that fill the gaps in primary data concerning the use phase of an
instrument. However, usage practices can vary significantly across countries,
regions, or even individual hospitals, which affects the usability and transferability
of the information and data found in the literature.

                                                           203
As a result, secondary data on usage practices sourced from existing literature
may not accurately represent the actual conditions of the instruments being
examined. Inaccuracies in assumptions related to reprocessing variables, such as
reuse frequency and loading efficiencies, can lead to biased findings, as the
environmental impact of an instrument's use phase is heavily influenced by these
assumptions. Scenario analyses from various LCA studies have shown that by
extending the assumed lifespan of reusable instruments, thereby increasing their
reuse frequency, and by improving the assumed loading efficiencies, reusable
instruments can become more environmentally favorable than single-use
counterparts, even when the baseline scenario initially suggested otherwise.
As mentioned earlier, in order to produce reasonably reliable results in the
absence of primary data, it is essential that information on reprocessing
procedures drawn from literature or previous studies reflects typical or average
scenarios based on standard practices. Ideally, this data should be representative
of the specific facility conditions, with assumptions validated by experts familiar
with instrument reprocessing.
To ensure data quality, it is essential that secondary data for the manufacturing
and end-of-life phase is sourced from well-documented, externally verified
databases, and that it reasonably reflects actual conditions. Moreover, relying on
a single database can help practitioners maintain methodological and data quality
consistency.
Moreover, the environmental impact of reprocessing a surgical instrument is
greatly influenced by the assumed reprocessing technique. Lalman et al. note that
ethylene oxide (ETO) gas sterilization, a chemical method, consumes substantial
energy due to long sterilization cycles and the need for additional detoxification to
handle ETO residue toxicity. For conventional surgical instruments, this generally
makes it a much less environmentally favorable technique compared to
conventional steam sterilization, which uses heat.

                                                           204
However, as highlighted by Samenjo et al.,61 complex surgical instruments often
include heat-sensitive plastics, necessitating chemical sterilization methods over
steam sterilization to maintain their durability which can result in lower
environmental impacts per use of these instruments, as the total impact is
distributed over a greater number of uses. Nonetheless, Lalman et al.62 found that
reusing a heat-sensitive electrophysiological catheter five times with ETO had
much greater environmental impacts than using five catheters once.
Their scenario analysis, however, indicates that hydrogen peroxide sterilization,
another chemical technique, reduces the overall environmental impacts of
reusing the catheter by nearly 20 times compared to ETO, though it remains
slightly less favorable than single-use.
In contrast, Unger and Landis63 found that reusing seven conventional surgical
instruments with ETO gas sterilization reduced global warming impacts compared
to single-use, but significantly increased human health impacts.
These findings highlight that significant impact differences can be found
depending on the specific reprocessing technique used, and the actual impacts
vary per instrument based on their complexity. It is not a simple matter of one
reprocessing technique being universally recognized as the most environmentally
favorable for all instruments, highlighting the importance of establishing the true
scenario for each specific surgical instrument under study.

Studies by Hogan et al.64 and Kemble et al. furthermore illustrate how different
assumptions about energy sources for sterilization can result in conflicting
outcomes. Hogan et al. determined that the climate change impact of a reusable
flexible cystoscope was greater than its single-use counterpart, as they assumed
the use of Australian coal-based (high-carbon) energy. In contrast, Kemble et al.
concluded that a reusable flexible cystoscope was environmentally beneficial
when reprocessing involved lower power consumption.
Similarly, McGain et al.65 showed that reusable anesthetic equipment had climate
change impacts comparable to single-use alternatives when relying on coal-based
energy, while their scenario analysis indicated that switching to renewable or
natural gas-based electricity for reprocessing could significantly reduce impacts,
making reusable anesthetic equipment more environmentally favorable
compared to single-use options.
Additionally, scenario analyses should be conducted to assess how variations in
reprocessing and end-of-life assumptions influence outcomes, ensuring the
robustness of LCA findings and broader applicability in practical situations.

8.6 Problems with life cycle modelling
The life cycle model is constructed by connecting and appropriately scaling all
data sets to accurately represent the product system's functional unit. This
involves managing multifunctionality within the system to ensure precise
attribution of processes to their respective inputs and outputs. The final life cycle
model should aggregate the correctly scaled inventories of all processes within
the defined system boundary, including only the reference flow and elementary
flows such as emissions, energy consumption and material flows. It is advisable
to present the inventory results in a table that clearly outlines all inputs and
outputs of the product system, enhancing transparency and understanding of the
environmental impacts. To protect sensitive information, any confidential or
proprietary details should be aggregated.
In many cases, LCA software tools like SimaPro, which rely on databases such as
ecoinvent, are used to calculate a product's environmental footprint based on its
life cycle model. However, aligning inventoried data with predefined materials and
processes from these databases can be challenging, especially for LCAs of
complex surgical instruments that involve specialized components and materials
not commonly used in other industries.
These databases often offer predefined processes for modelling off-the-shelf
components, but these may not always be expressed in mass units, limiting their
applicability in LCA modelling. Additionally, the specific materials or processes
required may not always be available. When specific inventory data is unavailable,
practitioners should select alternative materials or predefined processes that best
approximate the required data, drawing from common practices for similar
applications in the literature. In cases where multiple suitable alternatives exist, it
is recommended to assess the environmental differences between potential
substitutes. Particularly regarding material selection, practitioners may face
challenges in selecting the most appropriate alternatives from an array of suitable
options, as databases often provide several variations of certain materials, each
with slight differences in treatment or condition.

                                                           207
For example, in a study by Samenjo et al., when modelling the manufacturing
phase of a reusable syringe extension device in SimaPro, the necessary materials
and processes were missing from the ecoinvent database. Therefore, the
researchers substituted granulated polypropylene (PP) for homopolymer PP,
wrought aluminum alloy for aluminum 6061 grade, and chose extrusion
techniques instead of injection molding.
While these substitutions might approximate the environmental impacts of the
original materials and processes, choosing alternatives that best match the
required data is not always straightforward and any inaccuracies can significantly
affect the reliability of LCA results.
If no significant variation in environmental impact is found, the choice may have
minimal influence on the final results. However, if large differences are identified,
decisions should be guided by industry standards or expert insights. Alternatively,
selecting the process with the highest environmental impact can help ensure
results are not underestimated.

8.7 Phase 3: Life Cycle Impact Assessment
The Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) phase of an LCA evaluates the
magnitude and significance of potential environmental impacts associated with
the product system by converting the documented elementary flows into
environmental impact indicators related to human health, natural resources and
the environment. This phase uses the LCIA method, the corresponding category
indicators, whether midpoint or endpoint, and any applicable LCA software
outlined in the scope phase. The outcomes of this phase provide the basis for the
subsequent interpretation phase.
However, due to challenges related to data availability, with information
frequently being outdated, of uncertain quality or not comparable, especially
when considering specific regions or impact categories, LCIA methodologies tend
to calculate environmental impacts as `potential impacts', without accounting for
local variations, time-specific factors or rare events. This generalization, coupled
with assumptions about linear relationships between pollutants and impacts and
the frequent use of worst-case scenarios, reduces their ability to accurately
capture real-world environmental interactions. This inherent limitation can affect
the reliability of LCA findings, so practitioners should be aware of it when
interpreting results.

                                                           209
Life Cycle Impact Assessment method

To capture a wide range of potential environmental impacts aligned with the
study's objectives, various life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodologies
have been developed, including Revised Continuous Improvement and
Progressive Embodiment (ReCiPe)66 and the Tool for the Reduction and
Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI). These
methodologies focus on various midpoint impact categories (midpoints represent
impacts at an intermediate stage in the cause-effect chain such as climate
change, CO2 emissions versus endpoints represent the damage to human health,
ecosystems, and resource availability), such as global warming potential, ozone
depletion and human toxicity.

Some also provide aggregated single-score endpoint indicators to evaluate
broader impacts on human health, ecosystems and natural resources.

When using LCA software like SimaPro, inventory data is automatically classified
into the impact categories defined by the selected LCIA method. Each contribution
is quantified through characterization; for instance, global warming potential is
typically measured in kg CO-equivalents at the midpoint level. At the endpoint
level, impacts reflect more specific damages, such as species loss or human
health effects measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Finally, the
quantified individual impacts in each category are ultimately aggregated to provide
an overall assessment of the product's environmental footprint.

Since the impact categories serve as outcome measures, the choice of LCIA
method is crucial in shaping results. Therefore, when selecting these methods, it
is essential to ensure they align with the study's objectives and address all
relevant environmental issues associated with the analyzed system. Any
exclusions of impact categories must be justified based on their relevance, while
additional identified impacts require appropriate LCIA methods to maintain
necessary standards. LCAs that model unique conditions or limit impact coverage
may restrict the usability and transferability of results, so such limitations should
be clearly identified from the start.

Normalization and weighting

Normalization and weighting are needed for the interpretation of LCA results.
Normalization helps to understand the magnitude of the impacts of the product
under study relative to a broader context by adjusting the impact assessment data
to a common scale or reference, such as national averages or per capita impacts.
Weighting enhances the decision-making process by assigning different levels of
importance to various environmental impact categories based on normative
values. To ensure consistency in the application of these measures, they should
be planned during the goal and scope definition phase. However, in studies
producing comparative assertions intended for public disclosure, weighting is
generally avoided to maintain neutrality and transparency in the findings.

Scenario and uncertainty analyses

Scenario analyses play a key role in verifying the robustness of comparative LCA
results by evaluating the results under varying conditions, including best-case,
most likely case and worst-case scenarios. This helps to determine whether the
observed differences between systems are substantial enough to support claims
of one system's superiority over another. These scenarios adjust for different data
and methodological assumptions, such as variations in functional unit properties,
inventory data values and allocation methods. Additionally, performing
uncertainty calculations can enhance the robustness analysis by assessing the
overall uncertainty of the conclusions due to natural variations in data values
under specific conditions. However, these calculations are only useful when they
have not already been used to develop the different scenarios in the scenario
analysis.

Despite the importance of such analyses in enhancing the reliability of LCA
findings, a systematic review on sustainability strategies for surgical instruments
showed that only 19 out of 27 LCA studies included scenario analyses, particularly
regarding reprocessing practices and end-of-life pathways, and only 8 out of 27
conducted uncertainty analyses. This underscores the need for greater emphasis
on incorporating these analyses in LCAs of surgical instruments to ensure more
reliable outcomes.

                                                           211
Reporting
The format and level of reporting should match the study's goals and the intended
audience, ranging from simplified standalone data sets to detailed public
comparative analyses. It's important to use standardized reporting formats
wherever possible and to keep confidential information separate. The chosen level
of reporting, whether for internal use, limited external distribution, or broad public
access, should reflect the impact of the findings, ensuring that the presented
information is clear and cannot be misinterpreted.
Critical review
Conducting a critical review by experts not involved in the LCA is crucial for
validating the study's quality and credibility. Given that different data and
methodological assumptions in LCA studies on surgical instruments may result
from LCA practitioners' specific interests in the study outcomes, the need for
external validation by independent experts is emphasized. This process
encourages practitioners to clarify their views and assumptions. The type of
review, whether being an internal independent review, an external review, or a
panel review should be established from the start to ensure that the LCA meets
review requirements, thereby optimizing the overall data collection,
documentation, and reporting process.

                                                           212
8.8 Phase 4: Interpretation
In the interpretation phase the LCIA results are evaluated against the goal and
scope, focusing on the quality of data and methodological choices and
assumptions, including completeness, accuracy and precision, as well as their
consistency. The interpretation guides iterative refinements of the LCI model until
alignment with the study's goal and scope definition is achieved, ensuring
methodological appropriateness and data quality. This thorough evaluation
process of the results aims to derive robust conclusions and recommendations
appropriate to the LCA's intended applications. Results should be presented
clearly to allow the audience to assess the robustness of conclusions and
understand any limitations.
Significant aspects identification
Effective interpretation of LCA results begins with identifying key aspects that
significantly influence the outcomes. This includes major life cycle stages,
processes and elementary flows, which are typically highlighted through
contribution analyses. These analyses break down the contributions of each
element, quantifying their impact and often representing the data visually in
formats like pie charts or stacked columns. Additionally, methodological choices
and assumptions that may substantially affect the results can be pinpointed
through the evaluation of scenario analysis outcomes.
Results evaluation
The results are then assessed for completeness, sensitivity and consistency in
relation to the data, methodological choices and assumptions, with particular
attention given to the significant aspects identified earlier. Completeness checks
determine whether all relevant processes and flows are included, while sensitivity
checks make sure the accuracy and precision of the results meet the study's
requirements, enhancing their robustness where possible. Consistency checks
ensure that all methodological choices, impact assessment steps and data
quality across processes align with the study's objectives.

                                                           213
Iterative approach

The iterative process is guided by the completeness, sensitivity and consistency
evaluations, aimed at refining the life cycle model to meet the quality and
consistency standards established during the goal and scope definition.
Enhancements may include incorporating more specific primary data, improving
the quality of data used in methodological decisions, and revising data for life
cycle stages or flows that were initially underestimated. If enhancing data quality
for certain contributors proves impractical, this should be documented, and those
contributors may be excluded. After making these adjustments, the results are
recalculated, and completeness, sensitivity and consistency evaluations are
repeated to inform further iterations. It is important to note that insights gained
from each iteration may require adjustments to the study's goal and scope
definition, especially if data limitations cannot be resolved.

For LCA practitioners, it's crucial to find a balance between making early
decisions, which tend to be more neutral but may suffer from data quality issues,
and postponing decisions, which enhances data quality but introduces the risk of
bias. Both practitioners and readers of the LCA report must be aware of potential
biases arising from the iterative nature of LCA methodology, which allows for
changes throughout the process, particularly if the findings do not meet initial
expectations. Documenting all changes to methodological decisions and their
impacts on results can be challenging, but the more clearly and transparently
adjustments are recorded, the more robust and reliable the LCA methodology
becomes.

Determining the optimal level of detailed data to accurately represent the product
system's functional unit is complex, especially for new technologies and complex
product systems like surgical instruments, which have not been as extensively
studied through LCAs as instruments in other sectors.

Therefore, the reliability of LCA results heavily depends on practitioners' skills and
experience in navigating this complexity and addressing data gaps while defining
and modelling the product system. This highlights the importance of having a
strong technical understanding of the surgical instrument in question, as well as
expertise in LCA methodologies. Adequate training in these areas can significantly
enhance the reliability of LCA's for surgical instruments.

                                                           214
Furthermore, this underscores the value of repeating LCA studies on surgical
instruments to gather insights that could facilitate the collection of the detailed
data necessary for accurate evaluations in this field. The initial LCA may utilize
average data for processes related to the product system, combined with expert
judgement, to identify key processes and elementary flows. Identifying major
contributors early on enables a more targeted approach in subsequent LCA
studies, which can result in obtaining more detailed data on the most relevant
aspects of the system.

                                                           215
Conclusions and recommendations
Once the study's goals and application requirements are met, the results are
analyzed across the entire system, integrating various scenarios and uncertainty
assessments. Conclusions and recommendations are formulated while carefully
considering any remaining data gaps, sensitivities and inconsistencies.

     Note: These risk factors include the inherent limitations of the LCA methodology that could compromise the reliability of findings
     in general, along with specific factors that may affect the reliability of conclusions drawn from LCAs of surgical instruments.
Life Cycle Assessment Design
The goal of Life Cycle Assessment Design (LCAD) is to accurately assess the
environmental footprint of a new technology while identifying potential related
design modifications to improve its environmental performance. This can be
accomplished through a detailed and robust comparative LCA, incorporating
insights from the initial research phase and following the adapted LCAD
methodology for eco-design. Figure 11 shows the modified `circular' LCAD
approach for eco-design alongside the typical `linear' LCA approach for eco-
design.

                                                           218
Figure 11: LCA design approaches for eco-design. Figure A shows the typical
`linear' approach, B the `circular' approach. In the typical LCA approach for eco-
design, the green checkmark indicates the design scenario with the lowest
environmental impact, marking it as the most environmentally friendly option.

                                                           219
In the adapted approach, by analyzing comparative impact results for the
product's current design relative to a functionally identical product across various
modelled life cycle aspect scenarios (illustrated in the bottom-right section of
subfigure B) and understanding how design decisions shape life cycle aspects, the
life cycle aspect with the potential for the largest environmental gains through
feasible modifications to the product's current design can be pinpointed.
This aspect, marked with a green check, will serve as the initial focus of redesign
efforts. While other life cycle aspects may also show variations in comparative
impact results across different scenarios, offering opportunities for environmental
improvements, these gains are either smaller or lack feasible design modifications
to realize them effectively, and therefore are not prioritized initially.
LCAD will support healthcare decision-makers in making environmentally
conscious procurement choices and guide the developers of new technology in
implementing environmentally responsible design improvements during its
ongoing development. Although future design updates are expected to be
informed by the insights from this LCA, post-implementation studies will be
necessary to confirm that these updates indeed align with the environmental
performance improvements indicated in the initial findings.
It is important to note that, before investing in an instrument with enhanced
environmental performance, hospitals also consider factors such as costs,
healthcare providers' preferences, the instrument's capacity for thorough
cleaning and sterilization to ensure patient safety.

                                                           220
8.9 LCA-based design iterations
Typically, LCAs for eco-design involve modelling various hypothetical design
scenarios, such as adjustments to materials or configurations, and comparing
their environmental impacts to identify the most eco-friendly option. In these
`linear' eco-design approaches, each design scenario is treated as an input to the
LCA, generating different impact results. The scenario with the lowest
environmental impact is then identified as the most sustainable option, thereby
guiding design choices. However, in some LCAs, where the environmental impacts
of a product in its current design are compared to those of a functionally identical
alternative, the focus could shift from creating hypothetical design scenarios to
evaluating the product's existing design for both comparative and eco-design
purposes.
This can be achieved by using scenario analyses to not only strengthen the
robustness of the comparative LCA results but also to identify opportunities for
substantial environmental improvements within the product's existing design. By
modelling various scenarios for different life cycle aspects of the product's current
design, it becomes possible to identify the life cycle aspect that shows the greatest
variation in comparative impact results relative to the functionally identical
product across the modelled scenarios, theoretically indicating where the largest
environmental gains could be achieved. Understanding how life cycle aspects are
shaped by design decisions enables targeted design recommendations to realize
these environmental enhancements.
However, recognizing that limited design flexibility may restrict the practical
realization of these potential gains identified in the scenario analysis, redesign
efforts will initially focus on the life cycle aspect with the potential to achieve the
most significant environmental improvements through feasible modifications to
the product's current design. When it is not feasible to analyze different scenarios
for every life cycle aspect, the scenario analyses can focus on aspects with known
uncertain assumptions .

Survey on stakeholder perspectives of LCA practices in the
surgical field

9.1 The reliability of LCA findings
To enhance understanding of the issues affecting the reliability of LCA findings in
the surgical field and to explore considerations for more reliable LCA practices, it
is essential to engage key stakeholders in this domain to evaluate the perceptions
of LCAs and their usage within this field. This was accomplished by developing and
distributing a survey among the approximately 3,500 active members of the
European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES), an organization that plays a
leading role in advancing innovation in endoscopic surgery to ensure safe and
sustainable surgery for all. Membership in the EAES is open to professionals
involved in any form of endoscopic surgery and minimally invasive techniques.
Methods
The survey was conducted from May 23rd to Aug 7th, 2024, using the online survey
tool Qualtrics, with a reminder sent on July 1st to encourage participation. The
survey consisted of 29 questions, divided into two sections. The first section
examined participants' views on sustainability in the use of surgical instruments
within their team and their familiarity with LCAs. The second section delved deeper
into their experiences and opinions regarding LCA practices, particularly
concerning their reliability in the surgical field.
Participants who identified as not familiar at all with LCA practices were
automatically directed to the end of the survey after section one, thus skipping the
second section. Others were free to skip the second section if they felt not very
familiar with LCAs. Participants could choose to skip any questions they preferred
not to answer and could withdraw from the survey at any time without providing a
reason. All procedures adhered to EAES's ethical guidelines. The consent
statement is available in Appendix B. The data was analyzed using frequency
distribution.

Results
A total of 47 out of approximately 3,500 active EAES members responded to the
survey, with 27 completing both sections 1 and 2. Since participants could skip
any questions they preferred not to answer, there were variations in the number of
responses per question. The results are summarized below and presented in
Figures 2 and 3 for questions from sections 1 and 2, respectively, with data
expressed as percentages of the total number of responses per question.

                                                           226
9.2 Survey section 1

Regarding the roles of the respondents, the largest group were surgeons (83%),
followed by surgical residents/trainees (11%). The rest (6%) identified as an
anesthesia assistant, OR nurse or technician (Figure 12A). About half of the
respondents indicated that sustainability concerning the use of surgical
instrumentation within their team is rarely or never discussed (combined 51%),
while 19% suggested that it is discussed daily (Figure 12B). When asked if they felt
there was sufficient awareness about the impact of using surgical instrumentation
within their team, most respondents disagreed (44%), with more than half of them
strongly disagreeing, while 25% agreed and the remaining respondents were
neutral (Figure 12C).

Regarding sources consulted for information on the environmental impact of using
surgical instrumentation, educational programs/workshops were the most
frequently used, specifically by 48% of respondents. This was followed by
academic or research articles/publications at 43%, and regulatory
publications/guidelines at 39%. 15% of respondents admitted to not actively
seeking information about the environmental impact of using surgical
instrumentation (Figure 12D).

The influence respondents have on decision-making regarding the use of surgical
instrumentation in their team varied. Most respondents (30%) contributed to
discussions without having the final say, while 15% reported being uninvolved in
decision-making. A minority (9%) indicated that they lead the decision-making
process (Figure 12E). When asked if they would consider the environmental
impact in their decision-making process if they had full decision freedom, the
majority agreed or strongly agreed (combined 80%), while 4% disagreed (Figure
12F).

Most respondents considered themselves slightly familiar with LCA's (37%),
followed by moderately familiar (24%) and not familiar at all (17%). The remaining
22% considered themselves highly or extremely familiar (Figure 12G). Moreover,
37% of respondents indicated that LCA's currently do not influence decision-
making about the choice of surgical instrumentation within their teams, while
another 37% stated that they do have an influence.

Meanwhile, 26% reported that they were uncertain (Figure 12H). One respondent
(2%) indicated not to consider attending training sessions or workshops focused
on conducting LCAs specific to surgical instrumentation or utilizing their findings
if they were available.

                                                           227
The rest indicated they would attend these training sessions/workshops or might
attend (50% and 48% respectively) (Fig. 8.2I). Most respondents would prefer
online webinars for these training sessions (35%), but in-person workshops,
interactive online courses, and hybrid training sessions were also favored (23%,
19%, and 16% respectively). 7% of respondents preferred recorded video tutorials
(Figure 12J).
Preferences for the frequency of these training sessions varied, with once a month
being favored by most respondents (29%). No one preferred weekly sessions
(Figure 12K).

9.3 Survey section 2

Among the respondents who completed both sections of the survey, a slight
majority (52%) indicated they have never used LCA findings to understand the
environmental impact of surgical instruments (Figure 13A). For those who sought
information on using LCA findings, the most frequently used sources were
academic or research articles/publications (48%), followed by regulatory
publications/guidelines (41%) and educational programs/workshops (37%). 15%
of respondents admitted to not consulting any sources for information on utilizing
LCA findings (Figure 13B).

When asked about their trust in LCA findings related to surgical instrumentation,
more than half of the respondents indicated moderate trust (52%). High trust and
complete trust were each indicated by 19% of the respondents, while the
remaining 11% expressed slight trust. No respondents reported having no trust at
all in LCA findings (Figure 13C).

When respondents were asked about the degree to which certain aspects
influence their trust in LCA findings, for each aspect most responses indicated a
`somewhat' influence, followed by `highly' and `extremely' (Figure 13D).
Specifically, all aspects received an average influence rating between 3 and 4,
reflecting a range of `somewhat" to `highly.' When asked for any additional aspects
that influence their trust in LCA findings, one respondent mentioned the number
of variables assessed in LCAs.

Additionally, one respondent (4%) indicated having personal experience
questioning the findings of an LCA related to surgical instrumentation, as they
were unsure of the methodology used in that specific LCA (Figure 13E). The vast
majority (92%) reported not using any tools/methods for evaluating the accuracy
and trustworthiness of LCA findings (Figure 13F). When asked if they considered
the existing tools and methods sufficient for this purpose, the majority were
neutral (52%), 32% agreed, and 16% disagreed (Figure 13G).

Among the respondents who completed both sections of the survey, the vast
majority (96%) indicated they have never been involved in conducting an LCA
related to surgical instrumentation, while one respondent reported involvement
(Figure 13H). For those who sought information on conducting LCAs, the most
frequently used sources were regulatory publications/guidelines (52%), followed
by academic or research articles/publications (43%) and educational
programs/workshops (39%). 26% of respondents admitted to not consulting any
sources for information on conducting LCAs (Figure 13I).

                                                           230
When asked if they felt there is sufficient access to the necessary
data/tools/methods/guidance to carefully conduct an LCA in the surgical
instrumentation sector, the majority were neutral (58%), followed by 25%
agreeing, while 17% disagreed (Figure 13J). Those who disagreed reported
challenges such as the presence of too many variables, difficulty finding unbiased
information, not knowing where to search for LCA information, and a general lack
of awareness about LCAs.

Regarding the degree to which certain aspects contribute to doubts about the
trustworthiness of LCA findings, for each aspect most responses indicated a
`somewhat' contribution, followed by `highly'. Specifically, the average
contribution rating for each aspect fell between 3 and 4, reflecting a range from
`somewhat' to `highly' (Figure 13K). When asked for additional aspects that
contribute to doubts about the trustworthiness of LCA findings, one respondent
mentioned that LCAs often leave out important variables, making the results
unreliable.

Similarly, when evaluating the degree to which certain aspects of surgical
instrumentation are inadequately addressed in current LCAs, for each aspect
most responses indicated `somewhat', followed by `highly', with all aspects
receiving an average rating between `somewhat' and `highly' (Figure 13L). When
asked for additional inadequately addressed aspects, one respondent mentioned
spare parts and transport to and from cleaning and sterilization.

When asked whether they believed that introducing training sessions or
workshops on conducting LCAs and utilizing their findings would enhance the
quality of LCAs within the surgical instrumentation sector, a majority agreed
(72%), with 16% strongly agreeing. 24% expressed neutrality, while one
respondent (4%) disagreed (Figure 13M).

Regarding the aspects on which respondents would like these training sessions or
workshops to provide guidance, more than half of the respondents selected
defining the product or process, establishing system boundaries and functional
units, and collecting data (56%, 60%, and 60% respectively). All other given
aspects were also indicated by at least a quarter of the respondents as areas
where they would like guidance (Figure 13N).

Discussion

The survey reveals several important insights into EAES members' perspectives on
sustainability and LCA practices related to surgical instrumentation, as well as
their application in this field.

Sustainability awareness

It's interesting to note that sustainability in the context of surgical instrumentation
is rarely or never discussed within surgical teams, with only a small percentage
reporting daily discussions on this topic within their teams. Despite the increasing
presence of green teams focused on developing environmentally conscious
practices within the OR, exploring strategies to minimize medical waste and
resource consumption, there is still a considerable gap in attention and dialogue
about the environmental impact of surgical instrumentation use in surgical teams.

This is supported by the finding that only a quarter of the respondents agreed there
is sufficient awareness about the environmental impact of surgical
instrumentation use, while nearly double that number disagreed, indicating that
many surgical team members themselves feel that there is inadequate awareness
and discussion on this issue.

9.4 Roles and influence of respondents

Most respondents indicated that they would consider the environmental impact
when selecting surgical instrumentation if they had any influence in the decision-
making process, highlighting a strong interest in sustainability among surgical
teams. Surgeons are often expected to play a central role in discussions about
surgical instrumentation within their teams. This positions them as key advocates
for raising awareness and driving sustainability practices in the OR.

Indeed, approximately one-third of respondents contribute to discussions on
instrumentation use but do not have the final say, while about a quarter reported
that their recommendations are strongly considered. Although these findings
suggest that not all surgeons lead the decision-making process, most are involved
in some capacity and could therefore take on a greater role in advancing
sustainability within their teams, especially since most of them feel there is
currently inadequate awareness and discussion around this issue.

Familiarity with LCAs

Familiarity with LCAs is generally low, with only a small fraction of respondents
considering themselves highly or extremely familiar. Within the teams of three-
quarters of the respondents, LCAs do not influence decision-making, or it is
unknown whether they do. This suggests a significant opportunity to enhance the

                                                           234
impact of LCAs in the OR through education and integration of LCAs into decision-
making processes regarding surgical instrumentation. Almost all respondents
expressed openness to attending training sessions or workshops on LCAs.
Trust in LCA findings
Of the respondents who are familiar with LCAs, a slight majority has never used
LCA findings to understand the environmental impact of surgical instruments.
While LCAs are generally recognized as valuable tools for informed environmental
decision-making, most respondents express only a moderate level of trust in LCA
findings related to surgical instrumentation, which may further explain the limited
use of LCAs in decision-making in this area. This suggests that there is room for
improvement to enhance trust in LCA results for surgical instrumentation,
potentially increasing their use in decision-making.
The majority of respondents do not use any tools or methods to evaluate the
accuracy and trustworthiness of LCA findings, indicating a need for increased
awareness of existing tools and methods, training on how to use them, or even the
development of new tools and methods if the existing ones are of limited value.
Very few respondents had any personal experience with conducting an LCA
related to surgical instrumentation. This unfamiliarity explains why most
respondents are not sure whether there is sufficient access to necessary data,
tools, methods and guidance to carefully conduct LCAs in the surgical
instrumentation sector.
9.5 LCA training and workshops
Most respondents who are familiar with LCAs believe that training sessions or
workshops on conducting LCAs and utilizing their findings would enhance the
quality of LCAs in the surgical instrumentation sector. Respondents expressed a
particular desire for guidance on defining the product, establishing system
boundaries and functional units, and collecting data.

                                                           235
Limitations
This survey has several limitations that may affect the reliability and
generalizability of the results. Firstly, only members of the surgical association
were invited to participate, which may not represent the broader population of
medical professionals involved in surgical instrumentation. Additionally, the
opening statement of the survey mentioned that it is a vital component of a
research study in the field of sustainability within the surgical instrumentation
sector, potentially attracting a group of active individuals who prioritize
sustainability, leading to a biassed view of the results.
This might explain why the overwhelming majority agreed that they would consider
the environmental impact in their decision-making process regarding the choice
of surgical instrumentation if they had full decision freedom. Conversely,
individuals who lack knowledge about LCAs might have been discouraged from
participating due to the survey's title or introduction, believing they were not
qualified, even though the first section was intended for all EAES members
regardless of their familiarity with LCAs. Those who still chose to participate
despite considering themselves slightly or moderately familiar with LCAs still had
the option to answer all questions in the second section, potentially leading to less
informed responses.
Furthermore, team dynamics could have influenced the results; if one person
encouraged others within their team to complete the survey, it could result in more
responses in the first section aligned with the views of this team. Therefore, if that
team is particularly focused on sustainability, more answers will be aligned with
this focus. Another limitation is that the survey design allowed participants to skip
questions they preferred not to answer, which could result in missing data,
particularly for questions requiring more time to complete. Lastly, the survey did
not account for differences in respondents' countries of origin or work, which
could have provided interesting correlations given that the focus on sustainability
in healthcare can vary significantly by country.

The role of technical universities in driving
sustainability in hospitals

10.1 The role of technical universities, integrating academic research

Introduction
Hospitals, as resource-intensive institutions, consume significant amounts of
energy, generate considerable waste, and rely on complex supply chains that can
strain environmental resources. To address these challenges, technical
universities play a pivotal role in fostering innovation, providing expertise and
developing practical solutions that promote sustainability in healthcare settings.
Through interdisciplinary research, partnerships with hospitals and training
programs, technical universities bring cutting-edge knowledge and processing
technologies to the forefront.
The case studies in this chapter, which are based on research and graduation
papers, show how a collaboration between TU Delft and numerous hospitals and
healthcare professionals resulted in the implementation of new waste recycle
strategies for more challenging plastic waste categories, such as multi-materials,
coated materials and mechanically advanced plastics. For this reason, this
chapter is divided according to the content of scientific publications. That is, each
section has a division into introduction, methods, results, discussion and
conclusion.
By integrating academic research with real-world applications, technical
universities not only empower hospitals to minimize their ecological footprint but
also improve efficiency, cost-effectiveness and patient care. In these
collaborations, technical universities and their field labs served as hubs of
innovation and education, ensuring that the healthcare industry evolves to meet
environmental standards while continuing to deliver high-quality care. This
partnership exemplifies how academia, hospitals and industry can unite to create
a healthier future for both people and the planet.

The interesting properties of ALP

Introduction

Autoclave laminated plastic (ALP) is an example of a material that is widely used
and discarded as waste. ALP is used for medical sterilization pouches or laminate
packaging and serves as a crucial barrier to maintain sterility and protect medical
instruments during transport and storage.67,68

These pouches are widely used in healthcare facilities and medical practices
where individual instruments are packaged, such as dental clinics, general
practices and hospitals. However, their disposal after use results in a substantial
accumulation of waste. A survey conducted at a medium-sized dental clinic with
five rooms revealed that approximately 400 laminate pouches were used monthly.
Extrapolating this to a working year of 10 months with two full-time dentists and
five treatment rooms translates to approximately 48,000 laminate pouches per
year. Considering there are 8,800 operational dentists in the Netherlands alone,
this equates to around 4.4 million pouches annually, just for dental practices.

However, in fact there is potential for recycling this type of packaging used in
medical settings, which could significantly reduce the plastic waste problem.69
Various studies have already shown that it is possible to recycle medical plastic
waste, such as blue polypropylene wrap20 and plastic medical syringes.70 The
same potential exists for the recycling of laminate packaging containing carbon
nanotubes. The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes, such as high tensile
strength, low weight, rapid electron transfer kinetics, high biocompatibility,
chemical inertness, assistance in protein immobilization and numerous
antibacterial and antifungal properties, make carbon nanotubes an ideal addition
to polypropylene packaging material for instruments.

Understanding the feasibility and effectiveness of mechanical recycling of
laminate materials could contribute to more sustainable waste management.
Prior to this case study, a literature review71 was conducted to explore potential
methods for recycling laminated autoclave materials.
The review indicated that mechanical recycling of ALP is the most suitable
recycling technique, since it offers advantages over chemical recycling, including
better performance in terms of CO2 emissions and cost-effectiveness.
Additionally, mechanical recycling is favored for its lower energy consumption and
ease of use. Ultimately, a mechanical recycling method involving melting,
shredding and injection or compression molding was selected.
This case study aims to illustrate the proposed (thermo-)mechanical recycling
method as illustrated in Figure 14. This approach combines thermal and
mechanical treatment processes for recycling laminated sterilization pouches.

Methods
This case study comprises eight steps to analyze the feasibility of mechanically
recycling ALP waste, with an investigation into its application in various products.
The steps undertaken to address this research questions are outlined in Figure 14.
These steps include collecting the ALP, performing X-ray diffraction analysis,
developing a melting process, shredding the ALP, setting up an injection molding
process, and analyzing the dogbones produced to determine the material
properties.

ALP collecting
A logistical process was established to collect ALP waste (Figure 15) from two
dental practices in the province of Zuid-Holland, The Netherlands, and the
Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at Ikazia Hospital, Rotterdam, The
Netherlands. Hospital staff were asked to collect used laminate packaging in
separate plastic waste bags. After a collection period of two weeks, the bags from
the hospital and clinics were transported to GreenCycl for inspection, and
subsequently sent to TU Delft for further research. This study used
uncontaminated medical sterilization pouches that had not come into contact
with patients. Consequently, this type of waste was classified as general waste.72

management during COVID-19 pandemic in India: challenges and possible
management strategies," Environmental Science and Pollution
Research, vol. 29, pp. 14830-14845, 10 2021.

X-ray diffraction analysis
The collected ALP underwent X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. A total of four XRD
studies were conducted on different types of pouches: one with green laminated
ALP, one with blue laminated ALP, and two with white laminated ALP. During the
separation process of the different types of white ALP, it was observed that there
were two distinct laminated sheets: one flexible and one rigid. Two separate XRD
studies were therefore performed on the white ALP samples.
Shredding and injection molding
Plastic tiles were produced from the granulate of the laminated ALP using a
process based on previously successful recycling methods applied in other
studies within the Sustainable Surgery & Translational Technology research line at
TU Delft.20,73 For granulating the ALP, a Moditec Goliath Plus Granulator was used
at the GreenCycl Field Lab.

The granulate pellets made from the recycled laminate packaging were collected
in a plastic bag and subsequently transported to Model Engineering (The Hague,
The Netherlands) for injection molding into new products. The injection molding
process was carried out using a BabyPlast Moditec injection molding machine to
produce dogbones for material property testing. The injection molding process
was performed at a temperature of 210 degrees Celsius.
Due to challenges encountered during the melting and injection molding process,
an alternative recycling method was developed for melting plastic under high
pressure. For this melting process, a custom-designed setup was used to test the
potential of high-pressure melting. The goal was to create tiles from the used
laminate packaging, measuring 94x94x10 mm. Approximately 90 grams of ALP
waste was required for this process. The setup included a spring mechanism that
applied continuous pressure to the ALP during the melting process. The
compression in millimeters could be inferred from the height of the indicator
connected to the top section of the setup. Figure 16 illustrates the injection and
pressure molding setups.

feather mechanism containing 90 grams of ALP pellets in the melting chamber.
After assembly and filling with ALP waste, the setup was placed in the oven.

According to Patil et al. (2021),74 the composition of the laminate, ALP has a glass
transition temperature of approximately 162-165 degrees Celsius. Observed
changes in the glass transition temperature were minimal, indicating that the
presence of carbon nanotubes has negligible impact on the thermal behavior of
polypropylene. Consequently, in this study, the influence of carbon nanotubes on
the glass transition temperature of polypropylene is considered insignificant.
Various melting processes were examined at temperatures ranging from 200 to 325
degrees Celsius, as these were also employed in the study by Van Straten et al.
(2021) for recycling polypropylene.20

Strength testing
For the strength tests, three strips were extracted from the block to create
dogbones conforming to the ASTM D638-V standard for tensile testing.75 Initially,
the block was divided into three equal parts. These parts were then processed
using a milling machine to ensure precise dimensions and achieve a uniform
height of 4 mm. After the milling process, the three pieces underwent further
refinement using a laser cutter to accurately shape them into the characteristic
dogbone configuration. This was accomplished with a laser cutting speed of 12
and a power setting of 95%.
Once the samples were shaped correctly, they were subjected to tensile testing
using a Zwick Z010 tensile testing machine and analyzed with the testXpert
software. The tests were conducted at a low tensile speed of 2 mm/min, and no
preloading was applied.

Impact testing
Finally, the tiles underwent a ballistic test by firing 9.22-inch lead bullets at close
range with an energy of 24 joules to examine their energy absorption potential
(Figure 17).

Results
The process of collecting ALP
The ALP from the dental centers was collected in three different colors: white,
green and blue, as shown in Figure 18. The ALP collected from Ikazia Hospital,
Rotterdam was exclusively blue. In total, approximately 1.8 kg of ALP was
collected, with varying weights for each type.
X-ray diffraction testing
Figures 5 A-D show the results of the XRD analysis for the green ALP, blue ALP, white
ALP with increased stiffness, and white flexible ALP. The peaks indicate the
intensity of the crystalline phases, mapped using the ICDD PDF4 database (TU
Delft, The Netherlands). The XRD graphs reveal that the green (Figure 18), blue
(Figure 18B) and stiff white ALP (Figure 5C) consist of polypropylene (C3H6) and
carbon nanotubes (C). The peaks in the XRD graphs closely match the peaks
observed in the data for -polypropylene (C3H6) and carbon nanotubes (C) from
the ICDD database, indicating the presence of these materials in the ALP waste
streams collected.
On the other hand, the XRD graph of the white flexible ALP (Figure 5D) showed
alignment with the peaks of high-density polyethylene (C2H4), suggesting that the
flexible white ALP consists of high-density polyethylene. The flexible white ALP was
subsequently excluded from the case study.

Shredding and injection molding testing
During the melting process, it became clear that ALP posed greater challenges
than materials such as blue instrument wrap.20 An alternative approach was
explored to bypass the melting process and convert the ALP directly into pellets.
Given the stiffness of ALP, it was hypothesized that shredding the material into
flakes could be a feasible solution. These flakes could then be used in an injection
molding machine, offering a potential method for further processing ALP waste.
Due to the low mass of individual ALP sheets, however, the shredder blades
struggled to effectively grip and shred them.
To address this issue, a solution was devised by compressing the ALP sheets into
a metal bowl, increasing their total mass. This larger mass facilitated the shredding
of the ALP sheets. The shredded material was then passed through the shredder
three times. The shredded material was subsequently used as feedstock in the
BabyPlast injection molding machine.
However, due to the small mass of the ALP flakes, the machine was unable to
process the supplied flakes effectively. An alternative approach was attempted,
where the flakes were manually placed into the plunger. The result of this manual
process can be seen in Figure 19. However, this resulted in an insufficient amount
of plastic to adequately fill the dogbone mold. This posed a significant challenge,
as it prevented the fabrication of dogbone samples using the injection molding
process. Consequently, this approach was not pursued further.

Pressure molding
During the melting process, the temperature and the compression of the spring
were monitored. Figure 19 illustrates the progression of the spring pressure, melt
oven temperature and time. After several experiments, it was found that the most
effective method was maintaining a constant temperature of 230 degrees Celsius
for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

                                                           252
Figure 19: The melting flakes are pressed into a tile under pressure of a spring. The
graph shows that the spring pressure decreases during the time that the setup is in
the oven. The chosen time in the oven determines the density and material
properties of the tile.
The ALP blocks that resulted from this process and showed the most potential
were the blocks made from stacked layers of ALP sheets and the blocks made from
flaked ALP sheets (Figure 20). Tiles made from 200 grams and 50 grams of flakes,
as well as those made from stacked layers (75 grams), were further investigated.

                                                           253

Strength testing
For the flakes, the average Young's modulus is 269 MPa, with a standard deviation
of 85 MPa. The average tensile stress is 2.9 MPa, with a standard deviation of 0.5
MPa. The stacked laminate samples exhibited a much higher Young's modulus of
410 MPa with a standard deviation of 40 MPa and an ultimate tensile stress, with
an average value of 3.6 MPa and a standard deviation of 0.3 MPa. Regarding
elongation at break, the average value is 25%, with a standard deviation of 6%.
These values provide valuable insights into the mechanical behavior of the
material after processing into new feedstock.
Initial impact test
The ballistic short-range test with nine different .22-inch lead bullets fired at a
velocity of 24 joules showed an indentation of 0.6 (SD 0.2) for the 50-gram stacked
tile, 1 (SD 2.3) for the 50-gram granulated tile, and less than 0.05 mm for the 75-
gram tile (Figure 21). No fractures or cracks were observed around the impact area.
The 50g granulated sample revealed that one bullet was lodged in a cavity in the
substrate.

Discussion
The goal of this case study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of
mechanical recycling as a possible solution for ALP recycling. The findings of the
high-pressure melt method with spring pressure demonstrated promising
potential for the mechanical recycling of ALP.
However, removing stickers from the collected ALP proved to be very time-
consuming. In future collections, it is crucial that no ink, stickers or paper residues
remain on the ALP. Any remaining ink can affect its appearance, introduce defects
and produce unwanted by-products.76
To avoid this, it is recommended not to write on ALP or to establish a process to
remove the ink. Labels and stickers applied to medical sterilization bags change
color after sterilization and are then affixed to the packaged instruments before
sterilization. While the use of labels and stickers is necessary, it is crucial to
explore whether they can be placed on the paper side of the bags or to establish
effective methods for proper separation of ALP during the collection process.
The peak intensity in XRD graphs is influenced by various factors, including crystal
structure, orientation, crystallite size and material amount. These variations can
lead to differences in peak intensities, even for the same crystallographic planes.77
The X-ray diffraction tests confirmed the presence of polypropylene and carbon
nanotubes in the ALP and showed no significant differences between samples of
different colors.
Therefore, all different laminate manufacturers use the same basic formula for
their products, which have similar recycling potential. Although the funnel of the
granulator, in which the ALP was converted to flakes, worked well, a small amount
of plastic residue remained after each trial, contaminating the subsequent runs.
Producing the plastic tiles proved to be a greater challenge than initially expected,
especially since the block kept sticking to the sealing box. The raised edges of the
container made tile removal even more complicated. By using a different mold
shape with angled side walls and a press that removes the product, this issue
could be reduced.

Multiple trials were conducted with the melting process to produce a solid block
of recycled plastic. The behavior of the ALP, which consists of polypropylene and
carbon nanotubes, differed from that of polypropylene wrapping paper, as
described by Van Straten (2021).20 In this study, it was observed that polypropylene
from wrapping paper melted at temperatures ranging from 200 to 300 degrees
Celsius.
However, when melting ALP, a temperature of 250°C was insufficient to achieve
melting, preventing the material from passing through the filter, while using a
temperature of 300°C resulted in the formation of charred plastic tiles, making
them unsuitable for recycling with the melt hopper. The charring of the ALP can be
attributed to thermal degradation processes in the polymer matrix. The presence
of carbon nanotubes in the ALP, known for their high thermal conductivity,70
appears to enhance the distribution that affects the thermal degradation process.
Unlike the experimental setup used by Van Straten (2021),20 the melt hopper
lacked a fully airtight seal, allowing air interaction with the ALP in the hopper, which
may have also contributed to the charring. In addition to reducing the melting
temperature and time, removing the filter as well as eliminating oxygen through the
use of alternative support gases could further improve the process.
Improper handling of shredded plastic fragments can lead to negative
environmental consequences, as shown by Suzuki et al. (2022),78 where
mechanical recycling without proper wastewater treatment resulted in the
emission of microplastics into the environment. During the process, it is crucial to
have sufficient material to ensure optimal flow and full mold cavity filling.
In this case, however, the bouncing motion in the funnel prevented the granulated
ALP material from being effectively processed in the injection molding machine.
This issue disrupted smooth material flow, hindering the injection molding process
and requiring additional cleaning. Optimizing the process and hopper granulation
components could minimize the risk of exposing the environment to residual
particles from cleaning activities.

High pressure injection molding
After several melting trials, it became clear that the spring-high-pressure melt
setup met all the required specifications. When disassembling the setup, it was
found that the ALP block could be easily inserted.
Moreover, the setup remained unchanged even after undergoing two melting trials,
demonstrating its reusability and robustness. The insertion of the ALP block using
spring pressure proved to be more effective than previous high-pressure melt
configurations and seems to have potential for scaling up to sheet or tile
production for construction, insulation or shock absorption. The impact of the
nanotubes on insulation or conductivity properties and their potential still needs
to be further studied.
The recycled ALP tiles exhibited a hard and non-porous outer surface. Interestingly,
the tile showed a more robust internal structure, as evidenced by its resistance to
manual breakage. This resistance was particularly remarkable because the 200g
tile could not be broken with bare hands.
By cutting the ALP block into three parts, it was found that the individual ALP flakes
remained distinguishable, and all flakes had completely melted. No flakes were
formed, contributing to an mass-to-strength ratio with potential. The low weight of
the material, smooth outer surface and light porosity where air is trapped may be
valuable for many applications in the transport industry.
Bikiaris et al. (2010)79 reported a Young's modulus of about 1250 MPa, an ultimate
tensile strength of about 31 MPa, and a fracture strain of about 150% for
polypropylene mixed with carbon nanotubes subjected to tensile tests after
injection molding. It is clear that the mechanical properties of the recycled ALP in
our study are significantly lower. For polypropylene with 0.5% carbon nanotubes,
these variations in mechanical properties are likely attributed to the incomplete
melting of ALP flakes during our specific recycling process. This is clearly visible in
Figures 6 and 7, where distinguishable flakes can be seen in the material.

This inherent heterogeneity in the material's structure could lead to varying
mechanical properties from one sample to another. Another possible explanation
is that the dogbone broke due to a small air bubble in the fracture line. Another
important aspect to highlight is that lasercutting the ALP resulted in the re-melting
of the edges of the dogbones, affecting the materials. It is important to investigate
whether testing larger samples and more precise curing techniques have an
impact on the test results.

Future work
It is worthwhile to further investigate the optimization of the fundamental
parameters for forming under high pressure with springs. The effects of various
parameters such as pressure, temperature and melting time could be studied in
terms of their impact on the mechanical properties and quality of the recycled ALP
material. Further study should focus on determining the optimal process
conditions for achieving the desired properties and product results. Further tests
should include various physical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties
using appropriate testing methods. This will enable a comparison between the
recycled ALP material, allowing for further exploration of its performance and
potential applications.

The role of technical universities in driving sustainability in hospitals
Technical universities play a critical role in advancing sustainability in healthcare
by bridging the gap between academic research and real-world application.
Hospitals increasingly face the dual challenge of reducing environmental impact
while maintaining high standards of care and safety. One powerful lever lies in
rethinking how materials--particularly plastics and polymers--are used,
processed, and reused within medical settings.

A compelling case in point is the investigation into recycled Autoclavable
Lightweight Polymers (ALP), particularly their reformation under high pressure
using spring-assisted processes. Technical universities can contribute by
rigorously exploring fundamental process parameters such as pressure,
temperature, and melting time, and their impact on mechanical properties and
material integrity. This type of applied research is essential for validating whether
recycled ALP can meet stringent clinical and regulatory requirements for medical
device applications.

                                                           259
The study on more complex modified plastics demonstrates promising potential
for the recycling of ALP with polypropylene and carbon nanotubes. The adaptive
high-pressure melt setup with spring pressure showed potential for creating
uniform, strong products with different properties depending on melting time,
temperature, pressure and fiber orientation. By melting under higher pressure, the
products become stronger and harder, making them suitable for construction
purposes. When scaled up, recycled ALP can be applied in acoustic panels due to
its low weight, smooth outer surface and light porosity.
These findings represent a meaningful step toward sustainability in the medical
recycling industry and provide a solid foundation for further research and
optimization of ALP recycling methods. Especially driven by current geopolitical
situation, urban mining of rare earth elements out of complex multi-materials will
be needed in the future to ensure that Europe becomes less dependent on other
continents.

10.2 Mechanical recycling of face masks
Introduction
GreenCycl, in collaboration with the research line Sustainable Surgery at TU Delft,
developed a sustainable method for recycling medical polypropylene. The
process involves melting plastic waste into blocks, which were then granulated
into small pellets.
Figure 22 shows how an isolated waste stream from hospitals is used for the
production of a new medical product. After determining the properties of the
material recovered from the melting process, it can also be assessed whether (and
how) different waste streams can be combined to achieve specific product
specifications. For example, a container could be designed with a compliant hinge
that needs to be very flexible, or a rigid coupling that requires a shape-retaining
connection with high stiffness.

Figure 22: Example of how isolated waste streams from hospitals are used in the
design of new instrument handles for surgical tools.

                                                           262
A `single-use' product that is widely used in healthcare are surgical masks of type
IIR and FFP2. These masks consist of, among other things, elastics, multiple layers
of woven and fiber-bonded polypropylene, and a metal nose strip. FFP2 masks are
often used in specific departments, including the ICU and nursing wards. During
the COVID crisis, both types of masks - new and used - were collected from Dutch
hospitals to investigate their reusability.32
This study shows that the masks can be sterilized by steam sterilization at 121°C,
ensuring that the COVID virus is deactivated. Since FFP2 masks became
sufficiently available again after the initial shortage during the pandemic, a wider
application of this study is to determine how these masks can be recycled into raw
materials for the production of new products. Both types of masks are primarily
made from polypropylene (PP). This article examines whether it is technically
feasible to recycle polypropylene surgical masks.
Methods
In the first phase of the research, a filtration system was developed to remove the
metal strips from the face masks. After the remaining polypropylene was melted
and granulated, the material properties were determined. Next, it was examined
whether the recycled material can be used as raw material by producing various
products via injection molding.
Functional requirements
To process the face masks on a large scale, a modular filtration system for the
melting furnace was designed. It is essential that the filter separates 99% of the
unwanted materials, such as nose bridge wires, in an efficient manner. The
polypropylene from the face masks must melt and easily pass through the filter.
Additionally, the filter must not clog and it must be reusable after cleaning. This
filter should be replaceable within 5 minutes and ready for reuse within 30 minutes
after cleaning. In total, 80% of the material must be recoverable. A test was
conducted to determine whether the prototype met these functional
requirements; during the test, 2000 face masks were melted at 270°C over 90
minutes.

                                                           263
Material properties

The material properties of the recycled material were tested with a tensile test. The
recycled granulate (R-PP) was mixed with virgin material (V-PP) in different ratios,
referred to as the R/V% PP ratio. The mixtures had the following proportions:
0R/100V% PP, 33R/67V% PP, 50R/50V% PP, and 67R/33V% PP. Six tensile bars of
each mixture were injection molded by the Babyplast 6/10P at an injection
temperature of 185°C. A tensile test was performed on the bars, in which the bars
were subjected to a controlled tensile force until they break. The data from the
tensile test were analyzed in Matlab R2020a. The material elongation [%], ultimate
tensile strength [MPa] and material deformation [%] were determined. The
properties of the mixtures were compared in a bar chart. Additionally, the
hardness of the material was tested by the Shore Durometer Type D, Sauter HBD
100-0.

Producing components

Products were made to determine whether new products can be produced from
the recycled material. Twenty labels are injection molded by the Babyplast 6/10P
at 185°C with a 50R/50V% PP mix ratio.

As a test, six of the labels were mounted in a stainless steel instrument net and
subjected to ten complete sterilization cycles within a week.

A standard disinfection and sterilization process was used for the tests. After one
week, the labels were examined for thermal deformations and visual damage
using a microscope at 100x magnification. Possible changes in chemical
composition were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence by comparing three labels
after the sterilization tests with three control labels.

Results

Filtration system

The filtration system is shown in Figure 23. The design consisted of two layers
stacked on top of each other (Figure 23A). In the middle of the layers, a hole pattern
was placed that allowed the polypropylene to flow through, while trapping the
metal strips. The pattern of the layers was aligned in opposite directions, so that
each opening of one layer was blocked by the other. The distance between the two
layers was 5 mm, ensuring that the nose strips could not move sideways, bend or
break through the filter. Additionally, both sides of the filter were bent at a 45°C
angle to distribute the heat from the melting machine over the filter. The sides had
no holes, ensuring more efficient heat conductivity (Figure 23B).

The experiments showed that the filter could be cleaned within 20 minutes and
installed within a minute, after which the face masks could be placed in the
melting furnace without further adjustments (Figure 23C). During the melting
process, the metal strips were captured in the filter, and the melted plastic was
collected in a container (Figure 23D). The test determined that several dozen nose
bridge strips passed through the filter; all collected strips formed a clump of wire
(Figure 23E). After the melting process, the filter could be removed from the
furnace and cleaned within one minute.

Material properties
To determine the material properties of the mix ratios, six tensile bars per mix were
tested. Figure 24A shows the tensile bars with a material ratio of 67R/33V%. The
results of the tensile test are shown in Figure 24B. The ultimate tensile strength
and material deformation for each mix are depicted in a bar chart. Deformation
decreases as the amount of recycled material in the mix increases, meaning the
mixture becomes more brittle.
The bar chart also shows that the tensile strength decreases as more R-PP is
added to the mixture. The values for the material properties of the mix ratios are
shown in Table 1. The table shows that the elongation () decreases as the ratio
shifts towards R-PP, while the strength (E) increases. Additionally, the hardness of
the material increases.

strength and material deformation for different mix ratios.

Injection-molded products
In total, ten identification labels were produced with a 50R/50V% PP mix ratio and
ten identification labels with a 75R/25V% mix ratio. These labels showed no visual
defects, inconsistencies or deformations after production. Three labels of each
type were mounted on a stainless steel instrument net (Figure 25) and subjected
to the full sterilization process seven times within a seven-day period. After
inspection, no damage, fractures or deformations were visible. After the
decontamination and sterilization cycles, two of the three R50/V50% labels were
torn, bent and/or broken. The R75/25V% labels showed no damage.

observed.

Discussion
The filtration efficiency of the filtration system is 98%, but the remaining metal
strips in the polypropylene mix can cause clogging in the granulator machine.
These granulator machines have a roller geometry with milling blades, which can
be damaged upon contact with solid metals. The granulator machine must be
restarted each time due to the activation of the safety system.
Additionally, the captured wire pieces, combined with the remaining
polypropylene, form a solid matrix. This requires significant effort to disassemble
and clean the filter, which is undesirable. To improve the workflow, it is
recommended to optimize the filter. The mechanical properties of the recycled
material deteriorate compared to the original raw material of the face masks.
Downcycling (when the material has a lower than its original quality after recycling)
is primarily caused by an increasing number of crosslinks between the long
polypropylene monomers after a processing cycle which brings the material into a
liquid state. The granulated material has a sand grain structure. After analysis, it
was found that the material can be processed into higher quality granulate.
Despite the reduced properties of the recycled material, it has been shown that
products can be made. A mix of virgin polypropylene and recycled raw material
provides sufficient strength. A ratio of up to 67% recycled material yielded
satisfactory results, but the injection molding of 100% recycled material was
found to be of insufficient quality.

                                                           269
The pellets stuck together, potentially clogging the injection molding machine
inlet. The validation XRDs for the various mix ratios showed a good fit with standard
polypropylene without identifying any other known materials. A comparison of the
validation XRD with the XRD of pure virgin PP mixed with it shows that the peak at
10 Theta originates from additives (C6H12), which are non-toxic for use in the food
industry.

The use tests with the labels on the stainless steel nets show that products up to
a mix ratio of 50R/50V% are functionally usable and can be used in material-
challenging environments, such as those found in a sterilization process. Further
long-term research is needed to definitively determine the influence of chemicals
and the continuous temperature changes on the aging process of the material.

While the results show that simple products can be produced from the recycled
material, upgrading the material could improve both the mechanical properties
and the mix ratio. After analysis at a granulate processing company, it was found
that the material could be processed into better quality granulate. It is
recommended to perform a toxicity test on the recycled material to determine
whether the additives transform into harmful chemical compounds after heating.

Furthermore, it is likely that any bacteria and viruses are removed from the masks
during the melting process, as the temperature in the melting furnace is around
270°C. The mechanical and thermal transformations the material undergoes
during recycling are sufficient for the safe production of new parts. Compared to
recycled material from blue wrap, it was found that polypropylene from face
masks seems to flow more during injection molding due to the presence of
additives. This may be caused by the water-repellent coating on the face masks.
Some face masks are equipped with an ionizing coating, which attracts the
smallest particles, under 0.1 microns. These additives may also contribute to the
sandy structure of the plastic blocks and granulate. However, after injection
molding, this structure becomes fully homogeneous again. The influence of this
abnormal behavior will need to be further investigated.

The material properties of the surgical polypropylene face mask as compared to
the recycling of blue wrap with similar mix ratios differ; the maximum tensile
strength and deformation of the recycled face masks decrease by 32% and 45%
across the board. The hardness is 3% lower than that of polypropylene from
recycled blue wrap. These differences may also be caused by the additives.

Future work
The results of this research can be used to make medical products more
sustainable. For example, components of wound drainage systems (such as from
the brand Medinorm) can be made from recycled material. A Life Cycle
Assessment from an internal study has shown that the ecological footprint of the
materials in the wound drainage system will decrease as a result; energy
consumption will be reduced by 21%, and the CO2 footprint will decrease by 19%.
In December 2021, a pilot project was started to test the recycling of surgical face
masks on a larger scale, conducted by GreenCycl and TU Delft in collaboration
with the dental and healthcare sectors.

The role of technical universities such as TU Delft
This example illustrates the pivotal role technical universities such as TU Delft and
FieldLabs such as GreenCycl as they can play in developing scalable, evidence-
based sustainability solutions for the medical field. By combining advanced
engineering, materials science, and design thinking, technical universities provide
the expertise and infrastructure needed to transform research findings into real-
world applications.

In the case of wound drainage systems, the transition to recycled materials not
only lowers environmental impact but also serves as a model for systemic change
within medical device manufacturing. Through rigorous testing, validation, and life
cycle analysis, the university helps ensure that performance, safety, and
compliance standards are maintained while achieving significant ecological
gains--such as the documented 21% reduction in energy use and 19% decrease
in CO emissions.

Moreover, the December 2021 pilot project involving the recycling of surgical face
masks reflects how technical universities act as catalysts for cross-sector
collaboration. In partnership with GreenCycl, healthcare providers, and the dental
sector, TU Delft demonstrated how research can lead to closed-loop solutions for
single-use medical products--one of the most challenging waste streams in
healthcare.

                                                           271
The university's contribution extends beyond material research. It includes:
     Developing circular design principles that influence how future medical
        products are conceived.
     Prototyping and testing new production methods for recycled healthcare
        plastics.
     Training students and professionals in sustainable engineering and
        regulatory practices.
     Engaging with policymakers to create enabling frameworks for circular
        medical devices.

By embedding sustainability into every layer of innovation, technical universities
ensure that ecological considerations become integral to healthcare design and
operations. Their independent and interdisciplinary position enables them to lead
the way in evidence-based transformation--from material science breakthroughs
to market-ready, low-footprint medical products.

10.3 Rare and precious earth component recovery

10.4 The potential of critical and strategic material recovery from cardiac
catheters

Modern medical devices, such as cardiac catheters, rely on rare, precious, and
critical materials--including platinum, palladium and iridium. However, once
used, these high-value components often end up as part of hospital surgical
waste, destined for incineration. This practice not only contributes to
environmental degradation but also represents a significant loss of finite and
geopolitically sensitive resources.

Recovering valuable materials from used cardiac catheters presents a unique
opportunity to align healthcare with the principles of the circular economy. By
harvesting and recycling critical raw materials from medical waste streams,
hospitals can reduce dependency on virgin extraction, cut down emissions
associated with mining and manufacturing, and contribute to resource resilience
in the healthcare sector.

Surgical waste streams are an overlooked but promising reservoir of critical and
strategic materials. With the right infrastructure, disinfection processes, and
recovery techniques, components from devices like catheters can be safely
reprocessed or recycled. This approach supports global efforts to secure critical
material supply chains, addresses rising concerns over trade restrictions and
supply bottlenecks, and opens the door to new circular business models in
healthcare.

Incorporating component recovery into hospital operations is not just an
environmental imperative--it's a strategic one. It reflects a forward-thinking
approach where sustainability, material efficiency, and innovation converge to
create a more resilient and responsible healthcare system.

Introduction
Cardiac catheters are used to perform heart surgeries. In contrast to open heart
surgery, where the heart is reached by making incisions in the sternum, a catheter
is introduced through a vein, usually in the upper leg or arm. The heart ventricles
or chambers are then reached by pushing the catheter through the vein. Figure 27
shows this path of a vein in the upper leg is used.

Figure 27: The basics of catheter intervention. Left: The schematic travel path of
the catheter. Right: the complexity of a catheter tip is defined by the type of sensing
and actuation present. Right, below: The general design of a cardiac catheter. The
grip (1) has a steering handle (2) and the electronic input (3). The flexible and
steerable sheath (4) has a tip (5) at the end, where the sensors are housed. For
ablation catheters, these include ring electrodes (6), position and pressure
sensors (7) and the tip electrode (8).

                                                           274
Since the surgical team cannot physically see what they are doing during a
catheterization surgery, as the medical devices are inserted into the patient,
sensors and monitoring devices are required to provide the medical team with
such data. Cardiac catheters can house positioning sensors, force sensors,
irrigation tubes, pulling wires and many other systems to perform the required
surgery. This, in combination with multiple types of materials being used, makes
these cardiac catheters very complex systems.
To make matters more complex, the catheters need to be inserted into a vein,
limiting their size dramatically. Due to the size and complexity of the catheter, they
come at a great financial cost. Especially the sensor components, made of rare
earth elements such as palladium, iridium and platinum,80 contribute to the high
costs of these devices. Most of these cardiac catheters are single use devices
(SUD), meaning that all catheters are seen as contagious waste after use and go
to landfill or are incinerated.81
This means that even the precious metals present in the catheters are not reused.
This shows the huge burden of cardiac catheters on both the environment and the
national health budget. As it is unlikely that mechanical processing results in
harvesting of the rare earth components in such a way that they can be reused, a
new "mechanic-chemical" (MeChemical) process is being sought that combines
mechanical and chemical reprocessing, such that metal components can be
harvested with minimal damage while plastic parts are dissolved for later
recycling.

Catheter types
Several catheter types are were investigated in this case study. The SMARTTOUCH
and QDOT MICRO catheter resemble the general catheter design in shape and
dimensions. As the SMARTTOUCH catheter is abundantly present in the catheters
collected by GreenCycl, it was decided to include this catheter in this study as
well. Three other catheter types that do not resemble the general design are the
PENTARAY and OPTRELL, as their distal end splits into multiple smaller branches.
Figure 13 shows how the catheters differ from each other.

Figure 28: Three different kinds of catheters with relevant rare earth materials of
different sizes (A-D) that can be found embedded in the plastics.

                                                           276
Methods
After looking at all possible material separation options, it was decided that the
study would include three phases: a cutting phase, a chemical phase and a sieving
phase. Since the main difference between the three phases lies in the chemical
phase, the concepts are named after the chemical treatment: i.e., the concept
with a cutting phase, an acid phase and sieving phase was named acid concept;
the concept with a cutting phase, a melting phase and sieving phase was named
pyrolysis concept; and the concept with a cutting phase, a warm benzene phase
and sieving phase was named benzene concept.

Mechanical tip separation
To make a chemical treatment of the electrodes as efficient as possible, all pieces
of catheter that do not contain electrodes were removed. This reduced the amount
of chemicals needed and thus increased the yield of the procedure. A cutting
device was designed. This device had to be compatible with all catheters from this
research, so the QDOT MICRO, OPTRELL, PENTARAY and OCTARAY catheters,
produced by Johnson & Johnson daughter company BioSense & Webster.

During the design of the cutting device, the following aspects were considered.
Firstly, the system should be able to automatically detect the type of catheter.
Furthermore, the device had to adjust the cutter spacing in order to cut only the
relevant parts from the catheter. Finally, the system had to ensure that the relevant
parts were separated from the remaining parts for more efficient harvesting and
recycling. Thus, more rare earth materials can be recovered through the chemical
treatment that follows. This optimalisation was needed because there is a limit to
the amount of plastics that can be dissolved with a fixed volume of chemicals
used.

Figure 29. Left: The system should be able to separate the parts of interest from
the remaining plastic waste before further processing is done with minimal impact
on the chemicals. Right: A technical electrode separation system built and used in
the study.

Chemical processing
In the second phase of the study, three fundamentally different methods were
investigated to break down the integrity of the plastic catheter materials in order
to free up the electrode rings made from rare earth materials. Acids, pyrolysis and
warm benzene solvents were used in three different setups, each with their
advantages and disadvantages.

Acids
Unlike non-polymeric materials, which dissolve instantaneously, polymer
dissolution involves additional processes such as solvent diffusion and chain
disentanglement. Non-polymeric materials typically dissolve through external
mass transfer, with dissolution rates influenced by the material's resistance to
this transfer. In contrast, polymer dissolution can be more complex, involving
multiple mechanisms. Internal material determination studies conducted at TU
Delft identified the polymers present in the catheter. Following this identification,
chemical data sheets for these polymers were analyzed.

                                                           278
While some of these data sheets were provided by the original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs), more general polymer information - such as that for nylon
12 (PA12) - had to be further investigated due to the high versatility amongst the
different nylons. Using these data sheets, various chemical agents capable of
dissolving multiple types of polymers were identified. However, due to health
hazards, certain agents are typically not available in most labs and deemed
unsuitable for experimentation.

Chromic acid, for example, was excluded for this reason. Ultimately, two viable
candidates were selected: 65% nitric acid and 96% sulfuric acid. These were
chosen due to their effectiveness in reacting with PEEK, a polymer containing
multiple benzene rings. PEEK can undergo aromatic substitutions such as
sulfonation and nitration, making these acids particularly suitable for dissolution
studies.

The final proposal setup (Figure 14, left) outlines the treatment process for the
electrodes. The ring electrodes were subjected to nitric acid treatment, while
sulfuric acid was used for the tip electrodes. The primary parameter evaluated in
this study was the choice of chemical agents. To further optimize the procedure,
additional factors such as temperature, pressure or the use of a catalyst could be
considered. However, no elevated temperatures were required in this setup,
minimizing energy consumption. The only equipment requiring power were the
fume hood and the sonic bath, ensuring a relatively low energy demand for the
process.

Pyrolysis
Pyrolysis is based on the principle that plastics decompose under high
temperatures, whereas metals do not. Metals consist of metal atoms arranged in
a matrix; when heated to their melting temperature, their intermolecular bonds
break, causing the metal to liquefy. In contrast, the plastics present in the catheter
are organic materials that undergo different thermal transformations. As
temperature increases, plastics transition through several key phases.
First, they reach the glass transition temperature (Tg), where the polymer chains
gain enough energy to move freely, making the material more flexible - often
referred to as the "rubber phase". As heating continues, the melting temperature
(Tm) is reached, where the material becomes a liquid due to the breaking of
intermolecular bonds.
Further heating leads to decomposition at the pyrolysis temperature (Tp), a
process known as thermal cracking. At this stage, the polymer chains break down
into smaller monomers. If the polymer structure is highly rigid, decomposition may
occur before melting, as intramolecular bonds break first.
During pyrolysis treatment, an organic feedstock is heated in an oxygen-free
container with the help of a propellant gas to expel any residual oxygen. The
applied heat then triggers thermal cracking, breaking down the organic material
into various monomer fragments. The resulting decomposition products can have
high caloric value, making pyrolysis a valuable process for energy recovery.
This decomposition process is influenced by numerous factors, including
operating temperature, duration, catalyst presence, feedstock composition and
pressure. Due to the complexity and randomness of polymer chain cracking, by-
products often form unpredictably. However, pyrolysis generally produces three
main output fractions: a volatile gas fraction, an oil fraction and a solid char
fraction.

                                                           280
The final proposal setup for the pyrolysis is shown in Figure 30, middle. Ionized
argon was used as a propellant gas and the container was heated at a controlled
rate of 8°C per minute until reaching 1000°C. Due to the container's size, only the
catheter tip could be evaluated. During the process, no direct capture of polymers
was possible, as the ionized propellant gas carrying the monomers was used to
obtain quadrupole mass spectroscopy (QMS - to measure the gaseous
decomposition products released during pyrolysis) and temperature,
thermogravimetric (TG data - it indicates at what temperature the materials starts
degrading). The detection of N ions suggests the presence of nitrogen, which is
logically linked to the Teflon present in the catheter.

Figure 30: The three different setups that were used in the experiments. Left: The
setup for nitric acid and sulfuric acid concepts, with a sonic bath in both cases (1)
and a beaker with nitric acid and ring electrodes (2) with a condenser on the beaker
(3) to close off the system. For the sulfuric acid, a beaker with sulfuric acid and tip
electrodes (4) was used without a lid (5). Middle: The theoretical setup for the
pyrolysis procedure, where the propellant gas (1) is pumped into an airtight
container and heated. This causes the polymers of the catheter to evaporate and
rise (2). These polymers and the propellant gas exit the container and are cooled
(3). The polymers are captured (4) and the propellant gas and other gases are
captured too (5). Right: The schematic setup for the warm benzene solvents,
where a three-neck round bottom flask (1), is heated externally (2), e.g. with a
heating mantle. The flask is stirred (3) with a stirring magnet and is filled with the
agent (4); both the catheter tip and ring electrode (5) are present in the flask. The
flask is sealed with a condenser that is constantly flushed with water (6), and a
thermocouple (7) is present to manually read and adjust the temperature of the
setup. The two open necks are sealed with lids (8).

                                                           281
Following pyrolysis, the electrodes were sonically rinsed for 30 minutes at 200 Hz
to remove any remaining residue. The cleaned parts were then collected using a
mechanical sieve. To further improve the process, an additional siphon system
was implemented to ensure the efficient transportation of cracked polymers away
from the electrodes.
Substitution reactions
Instead of using acids to dissolve the plastics in the catheter, alternative solvents
can be used. To identify suitable options, chemical resistance charts for the
relevant plastics were studied, with particular attention given to substitution
reactions involving benzene rings. Based on this research, two candidates were
selected: phenol and toluene. While chlorosulfonic acid was also considered due
to its ability to perform aromatic electrophilic substitution, it was ultimately
excluded due to the formation of hydrochloric acid by-products and other
unpredictable reactions.
The chemical compatibility charts indicated that PEEK is resistant to toluene,
whereas PA12 is vulnerable to it. PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) is a high-
performance plastic known for its excellent chemical resistance, strength, and
ability to withstand high temperatures--often used in medical implants and
devices. PA12 (Polyamide 12) is a type of nylon that is flexible, durable, and
resistant to moisture and chemicals--commonly used in tubing, catheters, and
3D-printed medical parts.
However, no documented reaction mechanism between PA12 and toluene could
be found in the literature. In contrast, more research is available on the use of
phenol as a solvent. Studies suggest that "exceptionally strong hydrogen bonding
occurs between phenolic hydroxyl groups and amide bonds", which, on a
macroscopic scale, leads to the structural decomposition of PA12.
Although no literature was found on the reaction between phenol and PEEK,
chemical compatibility charts strongly advise against their combination, even at
room temperature. Since the underlying mechanism for this recommendation
remains unclear, further investigation is needed. It is suspected that phenol's
ability to form hydrogen bonds may play a role in breaking the intermolecular
bonds of polymers, leading to material degradation.

                                                           282
The experimental setup used for this study is shown in Figure 30, right. The
experiments were conducted at ambient pressure; the selected temperatures
were kept below the boiling points of the solvents to prevent excessive
evaporation. For toluene, which has a boiling point of 111°C, a temperature of
90°C was used in all trials. For phenol, which has a boiling point of 182°C, an
experimental temperature of 160°C was chosen. The temperature was manually
monitored using a thermocouple placed in the flask.
The experiment examined four different exposure durations: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2
hours and 5 hours. Mass change was measured to evaluate the effect of the
procedure on the samples, with mass differences expressed as a percentage of
the sample's initial mass to account for variations in sample sizes. If the sheath
covering the electrode completely dissolved, the remaining catheter components
were carefully removed from the flask using pincers.

Results
Acids
Among the tested acids, sulfuric acid was the more effective in dissolving catheter
polymers. Figure 31, left, presents the mass fractions determined after treatment,
providing quantitative insight into the dissolution process. To evaluate whether the
acids affected the integrity of the electrodes, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
analysis was conducted. The surface areas of treated samples were compared to
those of untreated samples, with the assumption that the inert nature of the
electrode metals would result in minimal surface damage.
The SEM images of the ring electrode and catheter tip, in Figure 31, right, support
this assumption, revealing only minor alterations to the surface. Additionally,
since nitric acid failed to remove PEEK, it was concluded that sulfuric acid proved
to be the more effective choice for polymer dissolution.

Figure 31: The results from the acid treatment experiments. A: The mass fraction
of cold acids. The fraction is defined as the mass of the sample after the
experiment divided by the sample's mass before the experiment. A clear decrease
in mass can be observed, which is in line with the visual observations. B: A catheter

Pyrolysis
A single test of this concept was conducted, after which the catheter tip was
sonically rinsed and subjected to SEM analysis to assess potential damage to the
electrode. Charring of the electrode was evident, even to the naked eye, and was
further confirmed through both SEM and light microscopy. Since char is a known
by-product of pyrolysis when decomposing organic material, its formation during
this process is inevitable, even if minimized.
Therefore, charring of the electrodes is expected during pyrolysis treatment.
However, there is no indication that the char cannot be removed, though an
additional cleaning step would be necessary to achieve this.

Substitution reactions
The mass fractions of the samples, Figure 33A, indicate that PA12 dissolved in
phenol but not in toluene. However, PA12 did exhibit swelling in toluene, as
illustrated in Figures 33C and D. While neither phenol (F) nor toluene (G) dissolved
PEEK, phenol did cause visible damage to its structure, as seen in Figure 33C.

dissolving any of the polymers present, whereas phenol is. Since the PA12 in the

used in the 60 mins and 120 mins experiment. To assess if the electrode would be
dissolved, the ring electrode was present at the 300 mins experiment. B) The mass

Discussion

Regarding the mechanical separation of the tip and ring electrodes, it is believed
that securing the catheter and utilizing (multiple) movable cutting blades will be
advantageous, as this setup will prevent the catheter from jamming in the
machine, thus addressing the current design flaw. This shift would allow the
cutting device to operate more independently, reducing the need for constant
human supervision and intervention. Furthermore, if the process is scaled up at a
central location, exploring alternative methods to cut and recycle multiple
catheters simultaneously will be essential for improving efficiency and
productivity.

Chemical treatment of choice

The use of sulfuric acid to remove polymers from the catheters is the best method
of the ones assessed in this study, but the difference between the concepts in
terms of applicability is not very large. Therefore, the emphasis of the research
team on specific criteria can be decisive. If removal of the rare earth materials
from the PEEK by mechanical action would be possible instead of using sulfuric
acid, it could mean that the pyrolysis concept would be the preferred concept. This
requires a new combined "MeChemical" process that applies sheer force and
pressure on rare earth materials during the chemical treatment to split them from
the degrading tip plastics.

PEEK, a very resistant plastic, is designed to resist chemicals and was not much
affected by the used removal attempts. Therefore, an easy method that does not
involve dangerous chemicals or procedures was simply not possible. If less
intensive procedures for regaining the electrodes are desired, the design of the
catheter should be taken into account as well. It should be investigated if the PEEK
components can be replaced or integrated in a different way.

A new processing line

The chemical separation concepts based on the use of nitric acid and phenol were
able to remove only PA12, leaving PEEK structurally present. For catheters that do
not contain PEEK, these concepts could be scaled towards a larger processing
line. Therefore, distinguishing between catheters that do contain PEEK and those
that do not is worth investigating; in this case, a processing facility like GreenCycl
can develop two different processing lines for different catheter types. The
illustration in Figure 34, left, shows the steps that are needed to scale up, before
the valuable parts can be retrieved with minimal damage (Figure 34, right).

                                                           288
Figure 34. Left: Overview of the entire process in which catheter electrodes are
separated from the rest of the catheter (phase 1). The catheter handle materials
can definitely be repurposed, so no landfill is depicted. In phase 2, the PA12 and
PEEK in the catheter are chemically removed. The spent agents are then
regenerated, preventing the build-up of toxic waste. SPEEK can also be
repurposed; PEEK can be regenerated from SPEEK as well. However, this PEEK
does not contain mechanical characteristics comparable to virgin PEEK though.
Lastly, the metal parts of the catheter are separated through a sieving process. The
other metal parts can be repurposed, and the electrodes can be reprocessed and
used in new cardiac catheters. Right: The parts that can be easily removed from
the residue in step 3 and reused to build new catheters.
Process improvement
Charring during the process has a negative effect on the purity and quality of the
end products and chemicals. Unfortunately, charring always occurred during
pyrolysis in the experiments. There was no automated feedback loop from the
thermocouple that measured the agent's temperature and the heating element,
other than the researcher.
This meant that there were overshoots in the heating steps of the warm solvent
experiments. Through the use of controlled heating devices, these overshoots
could have been avoided, preventing the contamination of the experiments and
the forming of charr. Apart from tuning and control of the standard process
parameters, the addition of other methods should be investigated.

                                                           289
Conclusion
The projects discussed here, executed by the Sustainable Surgery & Translational
technology research line at TU Delft, demonstrated how the healthcare sector can
work together with academic researchers to foster the transition towards a more
sustainable and circular landscape. The presence of a LivingLab or FieldLab such
as the GreenCycl FieldLab facilitates his kind of collaboration, as it translates
knowledge to practice. In the FieldLab in this collaboration, it was demonstrated
that it is technically feasible to recycle surgical face masks and use them as raw
material for new plastic products.
It is essential to fully understand the material properties of the items to be recycled
and how these are influenced by the use of additives and coatings. These insights
can be used to optimize the processes to make granulate. In this way, both the
speed of the process and the properties of the material can be improved.

                                                           290
The study that aimed to win rare earth materials from very complex metamaterial
assemblies showed that the new MeChemical approach has the potential to win
back high-quality ring electrodes with minimum damage. This means that for every
ring that is reused, no ring needs to be manufactured, saving much more material
than that present in the ring alone. Further research is needed to show how all
these processes can be further scaled up towards national processing levels that
include all hospitals.
It became clear in these case studies that a technical university is a strong partner
in supporting developments at a very low Technology Readiness Level - a scale
from 1 to 9 that indicates how mature a technology is (TRL level). Other types of
funding are often out of reach in the idea phase, while a significant amount of
manpower, effort and funding is needed to translate clinical ideas into physical
processes and products, even if the economic and environmental potential is
clear. In all three projects, the step from rough idea to a definite result was taken,
allowing production and LCA specialists to start working on the business side of
these projects. In this way, new products can be developed, when the recycling
processes are implemented into a more comprehensive chain of manufacturing
and marketing.

Through interdisciplinary research combining materials science, mechanical
engineering, and biomedical design, universities like TU Delft can:

     Develop and optimize sustainable material processing techniques.
     Quantify environmental and mechanical performance using tools like Life

        Cycle Assessment (LCA) and finite element analysis.
     Collaborate with hospitals and industry to implement prototypes in clinical

        environments.
     Educate students and clinicians on sustainable innovation.

Moreover, research institutes within technical universities provide a neutral,
trusted environment for testing, validating, and scaling solutions - especially
crucial in healthcare, where risk mitigation and regulatory compliance are
paramount.

By focusing on material innovations, reuse, refurbishment, recycling, technical
universities help hospitals move from linear to circular models, reducing waste,
decreasing reliance on virgin materials, and lowering carbon footprints - without
compromising on safety or performance.

                        Reflection

The population of Earth has grown from one billion humans in 1800 to over 8 billion
in 2025. This is one of the major causes for the increase in greenhouse gases
emissions, many negative ecological impacts and the increase in waste streams
as a result of human activities.
This highlights the necessity to speed up the pace in introducing circular economy
principles to create a more sustainable world. This means we have to change our
behavior: we have to make choices that make the world more sustainable and
circular, and create a vision on which policies and decision-making are based.
Making decisions and policies that are based on facts is of utmost importance, as
is separating facts from emotions. We all have to find a balance within themselves
between being a dreamer and a practical decision-maker. And we have to keep our
back straight by not letting others tempt us to deviate from our path. Our actions
can convince others and so we can play a pioneering role. Try to become a source
of inspiration!
Policy makers can play an important role in increasing the speed of sustainability
changes, for example by creating exemptions, through accelerated procedures for
permits, by introducing emission taxes and stricter regulations. This will go faster
if there is working in a circular way becomes mandatory.
In this book, we described the fundamental principles of the circular economy and
how leadership, policies and decision-making can effectively stimulate those
principles, specifically in the healthcare sector.
The circular economy is built on three principles which are fundamental for a more
sustainable world:82

     Eliminating waste and pollution.
     Circulating products and materials as long as possible.
     Regenerating nature.

                                                           297
New circular economy policies based on the above principles will create new
sustainable solutions, create new jobs, new technology and ecological stability.
The leaders of tomorrow, whether they are dreamers or practical decision-makers,
can drive innovation and change with circular economy principles, inspiring
people to take action.

                                   Ellen McArthur Foundation.

The realization that small decisions can have a big impact and therefore lead to
collective consciousness is an important starting point. A circular vision, good
leadership - in other words, the ability to guide, inspire and influence others
towards achieving the common goal of realizing a circular economy - here you can
make a difference.

Educating the world

Educating the world requires global collaboration, investing in teachers, and an
educational infrastructure. By adopting a holistic approach, we can create a more
educated global population in order to reach sustainable development and create
a circular economy future.

Our aim is to speed up the process of creating a circular economy. The circular
principles and circular design, including aspects of decision-making, are part of
our elective Master course `Medical Device Prototyping' at TU Delft. However, to
spread knowledge of the circular economy and make a greater impact, our
research findings and the technologies we developed are available to the world.

We furthermore created a Learning Community `Sustainable Healthcare' in which
we bring together stakeholders from across the working field including the medical
industry hospitals, schools and universities:

We also developed an online learning platforms on edX, which offers free courses

on circular strategies to learners worldwide:  https://online-

GreenCycl FieldLab

Our GreenCycl FieldLab, Rijnzathe 2 De Meern - Utrecht (www.greencycl.org), is
open to visitors who want to learn more about experimental setups of waste-to-
product reprocessing lines. Furthermore, we encourage students, educators and
researchers to join our FieldLab for internships, projects, graduation, research and
experiments. We strongly believe in the universal principle of co-creation and
partnerships with the right stakeholders at the right TRL levels.

                         Epilogue

By Bart van Straten

I wrote this book from a personal vision. It is the follow-up to our previous book,
Creating a Circular Economy. The need for a circular economy became abundantly
clear while writing this book in 2024-25. Geopolitically, there is a shift taking place
in the world order. A race has emerged between countries for increasingly scarce
raw materials: the Middle East, rich in oil and gas; African countries with resource-
rich mines; the Ukraine, Canada minerals and oil; Greenland, rich in raw materials.
All these regions find themselves influenced or even controlled by other countries.
This is the basis for trade barriers and political tension. Therefore, more than ever,
we must ensure that we no longer regard waste as waste but as raw material. This
not only makes us independent of other countries, but we also reduce waste
streams and therefore greenhouse gas emissions. Burning medical waste leads to
unnecessary pollution and perpetuates the struggle for ever-scarcer resources.
We need a mind shift: new policies, people with courage and a fresh perspective
who will change the future of the next generations. We want to contribute to that
with this book.

By Bruno Bruins

If you, like me, grew up in Drenthe, the concept of noaberschap (`helping you
neighbors') is never far away: looking after others, paying attention to each other.
After my internship at the Ministry of the Environment, I realized that looking after
others does not only involves people, but also the physical environment: the air,
sea, forest, mountains, nature. Paying attention to each other and to nature - it
seems obvious. Or not? In 2024, Earth Overshoot Day fell on 1 August. That means
that in 7 months we had used everything that can be regenerated by Earth in one
year. Yet this was not big news in the media on 2 August. Have we become too
accustomed to gloomy messages about the environment and sustainability? Do
we lack a perspective for action? That is to say: do we place responsibility for the
respectful and sustainable handling of natural resources on others? On other
countries, on science, multinationals or the government? I say: let's all do our bit
to make the world more sustainable. That's why I enjoyed writing this book with
Bart and Tim. It makes you think, and - I hope - act.

By Tim Horeman
Although I have been working on the prevention of surgical disposables by using
sustainable design principles since 2015, the real intrinsic motivation to end the
linear healthcare economy came during the COVID pandemic. After developing a
reprocessing and testing method for FFP2 face masks when the market was
collapsed and surgical procedures were postponed due to safety risks, our team
received thousands of masks per day for reprocessing. When boxes and bags
stuffed with used Personal Protection Materials (PPM's) were sent to us from all
corners of the Netherlands, we realized that all this material that was filling our
reprocessing facilities was normally incinerated.
This opened my eyes to the urgent need to investigate responsible options to deal
with this waste stream in a sustainable way. This led to the new reprocessing and
testing methods and facilities for surgical blue wrap and other materials. As it is
incredibly important that the healthcare industry is well connected to scientific
activities that have the potential to change the way we think and work, I dedicate a
large part of my time to showing our lessons learned to the surgical community, in
order to support the creation of new hubs and initiatives all over the world.

                       Final notes

Our adventure started in 2018, when Bart van Straten handed the first instrument
made from recycled steel to Bruno Bruins, then minister for Healthcare, Welfare
and Sport. None of us expected what this would bring about. Due to the lack of
fundamental research, Bart started his PhD research at TU Delft the following year,
with Tim Horeman as supervisor. This not only resulted in new scientific insights,
but also to the foundation of the GreenCycl FieldLab, in which we carried out many
experiments and developed new technology to make new products from waste.
Our work should not stand alone; we call upon everyone to get involved, do
research, publish books, and come up with new technology that will allow us to
use our beautiful, unique Earth in a more sustainable way.

Learning Community Sustainable Healthcare
The Learning Community Sustainable Healthcare was co-founded by Linette
Bossen and Bart van Straten at TU Delft. Its mission: to find practical and
innovative solutions to urgent societal challenges in the healthcare sector --
particularly those related to sustainability and critical raw materials.
In this community, students from diverse disciplines and educational
backgrounds collaborate with hospitals and companies. Together, they work on:
Sustainable product development, Redesigning processes in healthcare systems,
Behavioral research related to health and sustainability, Harvesting valuable
materials from medical waste streams.
Through this interdisciplinary and hands-on approach, students not only expand
their technical and research skills with shared and connected learning as core
goals, but also contribute directly to a more sustainable, circular healthcare
system.
The Learning Community Sustainable Healthcare aims to make real-world impact,
together.
