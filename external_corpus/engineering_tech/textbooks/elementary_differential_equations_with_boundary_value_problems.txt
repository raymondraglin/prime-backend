                    Preface

Elementary Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems is written for students in science, en-
gineering, and mathematics who have completed calculus through partial differentiation. If your syllabus
includes Chapter 10 (Linear Systems of Differential Equations), your students should have some prepa-
ration in linear algebra.

   In writing this book I have been guided by the these principles:

      An elementary text should be written so the student can read it with comprehension without too
       much pain. I have tried to put myself in the student's place, and have chosen to err on the side of
       too much detail rather than not enough.

      An elementary text can't be better than its exercises. This text includes 2041 numbered exercises,
       many with several parts. They range in difficulty from routine to very challenging.

      An elementary text should be written in an informal but mathematically accurate way, illustrated
       by appropriate graphics. I have tried to formulate mathematical concepts succinctly in language
       that students can understand. I have minimized the number of explicitly stated theorems and def-
       initions, preferring to deal with concepts in a more conversational way, copiously illustrated by
       299 completely worked out examples. Where appropriate, concepts and results are depicted in 188
       figures.

   Although I believe that the computer is an immensely valuable tool for learning, doing, and writing
mathematics, the selection and treatment of topics in this text reflects my pedagogical orientation along
traditional lines. However, I have incorporated what I believe to be the best use of modern technology,
so you can select the level of technology that you want to include in your course. The text includes 414
exercises - identified by the symbols C and C/G - that call for graphics or computation and graphics.
There are also 79 laboratory exercises - identified by L - that require extensive use of technology. In
addition, several sections include informal advice on the use of technology. If you prefer not to emphasize
technology, simply ignore these exercises and the advice.

   There are two schools of thought on whether techniques and applications should be treated together or
separately. I have chosen to separate them; thus, Chapter 2 deals with techniques for solving first order
equations, and Chapter 4 deals with applications. Similarly, Chapter 5 deals with techniques for solving
second order equations, and Chapter 6 deals with applications. However, the exercise sets of the sections
dealing with techniques include some applied problems.

   Traditionally oriented elementary differential equations texts are occasionally criticized as being col-
lections of unrelated methods for solving miscellaneous problems. To some extent this is true; after all,
no single method applies to all situations. Nevertheless, I believe that one idea can go a long way toward
unifying some of the techniques for solving diverse problems: variation of parameters. I use variation of
parameters at the earliest opportunity in Section 2.1, to solve the nonhomogeneous linear equation, given
a nontrivial solution of the complementary equation. You may find this annoying, since most of us learned
that one should use integrating factors for this task, while perhaps mentioning the variation of parameters
option in an exercise. However, there's little difference between the two approaches, since an integrating
factor is nothing more than the reciprocal of a nontrivial solution of the complementary equation. The
advantage of using variation of parameters here is that it introduces the concept in its simplest form and

                                                             vii
viii Preface

focuses the student's attention on the idea of seeking a solution y of a differential equation by writing it
as y = uy1, where y1 is a known solution of related equation and u is a function to be determined. I use
this idea in nonstandard ways, as follows:

 In Section 2.4 to solve nonlinear first order equations, such as Bernoulli equations and nonlinear
  homogeneous equations.

 In Chapter 3 for numerical solution of semilinear first order equations.

 In Section 5.2 to avoid the necessity of introducing complex exponentials in solving a second or-
  der constant coefficient homogeneous equation with characteristic polynomials that have complex
  zeros.

 In Sections 5.4, 5.5, and 9.3 for the method of undetermined coefficients. (If the method of an-

  nihilators is your preferred approach to this problem, compare the labor involved in solving, for
  example, y + y + y = x4ex by the method of annihilators and the method used in Section 5.4.)

Introducing variation of parameters as early as possible (Section 2.1) prepares the student for the con-

cept when it appears again in more complex forms in Section 5.6, where reduction of order is used not

merely to find a second solution of the complementary equation, but also to find the general solution of the

nonhomogeneous equation, and in Sections 5.7, 9.4, and 10.7, that treat the usual variation of parameters

problem for second and higher order linear equations and for linear systems.

Chapter 11 develops the theory of Fourier series. Section 11.1 discusses the five main eigenvalue prob-

lems that arise in connection with the method of separation of variables for the heat and wave equations

and for Laplace's equation over a rectangular domain:

Problem 1:    y + y = 0, y(0) = 0, y(L) = 0

Problem 2:    y + y = 0, y (0) = 0, y (L) = 0

Problem 3:    y + y = 0, y(0) = 0, y (L) = 0

Problem 4:    y + y = 0, y (0) = 0, y(L) = 0

Problem 5:    y + y = 0, y(-L) = y(L), y (-L) = y (L)

   These problems are handled in a unified way for example, a single theorem shows that the eigenvalues
of all five problems are nonnegative.

   Section 11.2 presents the Fourier series expansion of functions defined on on [-L, L], interpreting it
as an expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of Problem 5.

   Section 11.3 presents the Fourier sine and cosine expansions of functions defined on [0, L], interpreting
them as expansions in terms of the eigenfunctions of Problems 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, Sec-
tion 11.2 includes what I call the mixed Fourier sine and cosine expansions, in terms of the eigenfunctions
of Problems 4 and 5, respectively. In all cases, the convergence properties of these series are deduced
from the convergence properties of the Fourier series discussed in Section 11.1.

   Chapter 12 consists of four sections devoted to the heat equation, the wave equation, and Laplace's
equation in rectangular and polar coordinates. For all three, I consider homogeneous boundary conditions
of the four types occurring in Problems 1-4. I present the method of separation of variables as a way of
choosing the appropriate form for the series expansion of the solution of the given problem, stating--
without belaboring the point--that the expansion may fall short of being an actual solution, and giving
an indication of conditions under which the formal solution is an actual solution. In particular, I found it
necessary to devote some detail to this question in connection with the wave equation in Section 12.2.

   In Sections 12.1 (The Heat Equation) and 12.2 (The Wave Equation) I devote considerable effort to
devising examples and numerous exercises where the functions defining the initial conditions satisfy
                                                                                                              Preface ix

the homogeneous boundary conditions. Similarly, in most of the examples and exercises Section 12.3
(Laplace's Equation), the functions defining the boundary conditions on a given side of the rectangular
domain satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions at the endpoints of the same type (Dirichlet or Neu-
mann) as the boundary conditions imposed on adjacent sides of the region. Therefore the formal solutions
obtained in many of the examples and exercises are actual solutions.

   Section 13.1 deals with two-point value problems for a second order ordinary differential equation.
Conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions are given, and the construction of Green's functions
is included.

   Section 13.2 presents the elementary aspects of Sturm-Liouville theory.
   You may also find the following to be of interest:

      Section 2.6 deals with integrating factors of the form  = p(x)q(y), in addition to those of the
       form  = p(x) and  = q(y) discussed in most texts.

      Section 4.4 makes phase plane analysis of nonlinear second order autonomous equations accessi-
       ble to students who have not taken linear algebra, since eigenvalues and eigenvectors do not enter
       into the treatment. Phase plane analysis of constant coefficient linear systems is included in Sec-
       tions 10.4-6.

      Section 4.5 presents an extensive discussion of applications of differential equations to curves.

      Section 6.4 studies motion under a central force, which may be useful to students interested in the
       mathematics of satellite orbits.

      Sections 7.5-7 present the method of Frobenius in more detail than in most texts. The approach
       is to systematize the computations in a way that avoids the necessity of substituting the unknown
       Frobenius series into each equation. This leads to efficiency in the computation of the coefficients
       of the Frobenius solution. It also clarifies the case where the roots of the indicial equation differ by
       an integer (Section 7.7).

      The free Student Solutions Manual contains solutions of most of the even-numbered exercises.

      The free Instructor's Solutions Manual is available by email to wtrench@trinity.edu, subject to
       verification of the requestor's faculty status.

   The following observations may be helpful as you choose your syllabus:

      Section 2.3 is the only specific prerequisite for Chapter 3. To accomodate institutions that offer a
       separate course in numerical analysis, Chapter 3 is not a prerequisite for any other section in the
       text.

      The sections in Chapter 4 are independent of each other, and are not prerequisites for any of the
       later chapters. This is also true of the sections in Chapter 6, except that Section 6.1 is a prerequisite
       for Section 6.2.

      Chapters 7, 8, and 9 can be covered in any order after the topics selected from Chapter 5. For
       example, you can proceed directly from Chapter 5 to Chapter 9.

      The second order Euler equation is discussed in Section 7.4, where it sets the stage for the method
       of Frobenius. As noted at the beginning of Section 7.4, if you want to include Euler equations in
       your syllabus while omitting the method of Frobenius, you can skip the introductory paragraphs
       in Section 7.4 and begin with Definition 7.4.2. You can then cover Section 7.4 immediately after
       Section 5.2.

      Chapters 11, 12, and 13 can be covered at any time after the completion of Chapter 5.

                                                                                   William F. Trench

                 Introduction

IN THIS CHAPTER we begin our study of differential equations.
SECTION 1.1 presents examples of applications that lead to differential equations.
SECTION 1.2 introduces basic concepts and definitions concerning differential equations.
SECTION 1.3 presents a geometric method for dealing with differential equations that has been known
for a very long time, but has become particularly useful and important with the proliferation of readily
available differential equations software.

2 Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1 APPLICATIONS LEADING TO DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

In order to apply mathematical methods to a physical or "real life" problem, we must formulate the prob-
lem in mathematical terms; that is, we must construct a mathematical model for the problem. Many
physical problems concern relationships between changing quantities. Since rates of change are repre-
sented mathematically by derivatives, mathematical models often involve equations relating an unknown
function and one or more of its derivatives. Such equations are differential equations. They are the subject
of this book.

   Much of calculus is devoted to learning mathematical techniques that are applied in later courses in
mathematics and the sciences; you wouldn't have time to learn much calculus if you insisted on seeing
a specific application of every topic covered in the course. Similarly, much of this book is devoted to
methods that can be applied in later courses. Only a relatively small part of the book is devoted to
the derivation of specific differential equations from mathematical models, or relating the differential
equations that we study to specific applications. In this section we mention a few such applications.

   The mathematical model for an applied problem is almost always simpler than the actual situation
being studied, since simplifying assumptions are usually required to obtain a mathematical problem that
can be solved. For example, in modeling the motion of a falling object, we might neglect air resistance
and the gravitational pull of celestial bodies other than Earth, or in modeling population growth we might
assume that the population grows continuously rather than in discrete steps.

   A good mathematical model has two important properties:

 It's sufficiently simple so that the mathematical problem can be solved.

 It represents the actual situation sufficiently well so that the solution to the mathematical problem
  predicts the outcome of the real problem to within a useful degree of accuracy. If results predicted
  by the model don't agree with physical observations, the underlying assumptions of the model must
  be revised until satisfactory agreement is obtained.

   We'll now give examples of mathematical models involving differential equations. We'll return to these
problems at the appropriate times, as we learn how to solve the various types of differential equations that
occur in the models.

   All the examples in this section deal with functions of time, which we denote by t. If y is a function of
t, y denotes the derivative of y with respect to t; thus,

                                                         y = dy .
                                                                dt

Population Growth and Decay

Although the number of members of a population (people in a given country, bacteria in a laboratory cul-
ture, wildflowers in a forest, etc.) at any given time t is necessarily an integer, models that use differential
equations to describe the growth and decay of populations usually rest on the simplifying assumption that
the number of members of the population can be regarded as a differentiable function P = P (t). In most
models it is assumed that the differential equation takes the form

                          P = a(P )P,               (1.1.1)

where a is a continuous function of P that represents the rate of change of population per unit time per
individual. In the Malthusian model, it is assumed that a(P ) is a constant, so (1.1.1) becomes

                          P = aP.                   (1.1.2)
                               Section 1.1 Applications Leading to Differential Equations 3

(When you see a name in blue italics, just click on it for information about the person.) This model

assumes that the numbers of births and deaths per unit time are both proportional to the population. The

constants of proportionality are the birth rate (births per unit time per individual) and the death rate

(deaths per unit time per individual); a is the birth rate minus the death rate. You learned in calculus that

if c is any constant then      P = ceat

                                                                              (1.1.3)

satisfies (1.1.2), so (1.1.2) has infinitely many solutions. To select the solution of the specific problem
that we're considering, we must know the population P0 at an initial time, say t = 0. Setting t = 0 in
(1.1.3) yields c = P (0) = P0, so the applicable solution is

                               P (t) = P0eat.

This implies that

                               lim P (t) =          if a > 0,
                                                   0 if a < 0;
                               t

that is, the population approaches infinity if the birth rate exceeds the death rate, or zero if the death rate
exceeds the birth rate.

   To see the limitations of the Malthusian model, suppose we're modeling the population of a country,
starting from a time t = 0 when the birth rate exceeds the death rate (so a > 0), and the country's
resources in terms of space, food supply, and other necessities of life can support the existing popula-
tion. Then the prediction P = P0eat may be reasonably accurate as long as it remains within limits
that the country's resources can support. However, the model must inevitably lose validity when the pre-
diction exceeds these limits. (If nothing else, eventually there won't be enough space for the predicted
population!)

   This flaw in the Malthusian model suggests the need for a model that accounts for limitations of space
and resources that tend to oppose the rate of population growth as the population increases. Perhaps the
most famous model of this kind is the Verhulst model, where (1.1.2) is replaced by

                               P = aP (1 - P ),                               (1.1.4)

where  is a positive constant. As long as P is small compared to 1/, the ratio P /P is approximately

equal to a. Therefore the growth is approximately exponential; however, as P increases, the ratio P /P

decreases as opposing factors become significant.

Equation (1.1.4) is the logistic equation. You will learn how to solve it in Section 1.2. (See Exer-

cise 2.2.28.) The solution is  P = P0 + (1 - P0)e-at P0 ,

where P0 = P (0) > 0. Therefore limt P (t) = 1/, independent of P0.
   Figure 1.1.1 shows typical graphs of P versus t for various values of P0.

Newton's Law of Cooling

According to Newton's law of cooling, the temperature of a body changes at a rate proportional to the
difference between the temperature of the body and the temperature of the surrounding medium. Thus, if
Tm is the temperature of the medium and T = T (t) is the temperature of the body at time t, then

                               T = -k(T - Tm),                                (1.1.5)

where k is a positive constant and the minus sign indicates; that the temperature of the body increases with
time if it's less than the temperature of the medium, or decreases if it's greater. We'll see in Section 4.2
that if Tm is constant then the solution of (1.1.5) is

                               T = Tm + (T0 - Tm)e-kt,                        (1.1.6)

                               Figure 1.1.1 Solutions of the logistic equation

where T0 is the temperature of the body when t = 0. Therefore limt T (t) = Tm, independent of T0.
(Common sense suggests this. Why?)

   Figure 1.1.2 shows typical graphs of T versus t for various values of T0.
   Assuming that the medium remains at constant temperature seems reasonable if we're considering a
cup of coffee cooling in a room, but not if we're cooling a huge cauldron of molten metal in the same
room. The difference between the two situations is that the heat lost by the coffee isn't likely to raise the
temperature of the room appreciably, but the heat lost by the cooling metal is. In this second situation we
must use a model that accounts for the heat exchanged between the object and the medium. Let T = T (t)
and Tm = Tm(t) be the temperatures of the object and the medium respectively, and let T0 and Tm0
be their initial values. Again, we assume that T and Tm are related by (1.1.5). We also assume that the
change in heat of the object as its temperature changes from T0 to T is a(T - T0) and the change in heat
of the medium as its temperature changes from Tm0 to Tm is am(Tm -Tm0), where a and am are positive
constants depending upon the masses and thermal properties of the object and medium respectively. If
we assume that the total heat of the in the object and the medium remains constant (that is, energy is
conserved), then

                                          a(T - T0) + am(Tm - Tm0) = 0.

Solving this for Tm and substituting the result into (1.1.6) yields the differential equation

                               T = -k  1+ a     T +k  Tm0 + a T0

for the temperature of the object. After learning to solve linear first order equations, you'll be able to
show (Exercise 4.2.17) that

    T = aT0 + amTm0 + am(T0 - Tm0 ) e-k(1+a/am)t.

Glucose Absorption by the Body

Glucose is absorbed by the body at a rate proportional to the amount of glucose present in the bloodstream.
Let  denote the (positive) constant of proportionality. Suppose there are G0 units of glucose in the
bloodstream when t = 0, and let G = G(t) be the number of units in the bloodstream at time t > 0.
Then, since the glucose being absorbed by the body is leaving the bloodstream, G satisfies the equation

                               G = -G.                                 (1.1.7)

From calculus you know that if c is any constant then                  (1.1.8)
                                                        G = ce-t

satisfies (1.1.7), so (1.1.7) has infinitely many solutions. Setting t = 0 in (1.1.8) and requiring that

G(0) = G0 yields c = G0, so  G(t) = G0e-t.

   Now let's complicate matters by injecting glucose intravenously at a constant rate of r units of glucose
per unit of time. Then the rate of change of the amount of glucose in the bloodstream per unit time is

                             G = -G + r,                               (1.1.9)

where the first term on the right is due to the absorption of the glucose by the body and the second term
is due to the injection. After you've studied Section 2.1, you'll be able to show (Exercise 2.1.43) that the
solution of (1.1.9) that satisfies G(0) = G0 is

                             G = r + G0 - r e-t.

Graphs of this function are similar to those in Figure 1.1.2. (Why?)

Spread of Epidemics

One model for the spread of epidemics assumes that the number of people infected changes at a rate
proportional to the product of the number of people already infected and the number of people who are
susceptible, but not yet infected. Therefore, if S denotes the total population of susceptible people and
I = I(t) denotes the number of infected people at time t, then S - I is the number of people who are
susceptible, but not yet infected. Thus,

                                                     I = rI(S - I),

where r is a positive constant. Assuming that I(0) = I0, the solution of this equation is

                                                               SI0
                                                I = I0 + (S - I0)e-rSt

(Exercise 2.2.29). Graphs of this function are similar to those in Figure 1.1.1. (Why?) Since limt I(t) =
S, this model predicts that all the susceptible people eventually become infected.

Newton's Second Law of Motion

   According to Newton's second law of motion, the instantaneous acceleration a of an object with con-
stant mass m is related to the force F acting on the object by the equation F = ma. For simplicity, let's
assume that m = 1 and the motion of the object is along a vertical line. Let y be the displacement of the
object from some reference point on Earth's surface, measured positive upward. In many applications,
there are three kinds of forces that may act on the object:
(a) A force such as gravity that depends only on the position y, which we write as -p(y), where

      p(y) > 0 if y  0.

(b) A force such as atmospheric resistance that depends on the position and velocity of the object, which
      we write as -q(y, y )y , where q is a nonnegative function and we've put y "outside" to indicate
      that the resistive force is always in the direction opposite to the velocity.

(c) A force f = f(t), exerted from an external source (such as a towline from a helicopter) that depends
      only on t.

   In this case, Newton's second law implies that

                                  y = -q(y, y )y - p(y) + f(t),

which is usually rewritten as

                                  y + q(y, y )y + p(y) = f(t).

Since the second (and no higher) order derivative of y occurs in this equation, we say that it is a second
order differential equation.

Interacting Species: Competition

Let P = P (t) and Q = Q(t) be the populations of two species at time t, and assume that each population
would grow exponentially if the other didn't exist; that is, in the absence of competition we would have

                                  P = aP and Q = bQ,                  (1.1.10)

where a and b are positive constants. One way to model the effect of competition is to assume that
the growth rate per individual of each population is reduced by an amount proportional to the other
population, so (1.1.10) is replaced by

                                  P = aP - Q
                                  Q = -P + bQ,
                                                                                       Section 1.2 Basic Concepts 7

where  and  are positive constants. (Since negative population doesn't make sense, this system works
only while P and Q are both positive.) Now suppose P (0) = P0 > 0 and Q(0) = Q0 > 0. It can
be shown (Exercise 10.4.42) that there's a positive constant  such that if (P0, Q0) is above the line L
through the origin with slope , then the species with population P becomes extinct in finite time, but if
(P0, Q0) is below L, the species with population Q becomes extinct in finite time. Figure 1.1.3 illustrates
this. The curves shown there are given parametrically by P = P (t), Q = Q(t), t > 0. The arrows
indicate direction along the curves with increasing t.

1.2 BASIC CONCEPTS

A differential equation is an equation that contains one or more derivatives of an unknown function.
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that it contains. A differential
equation is an ordinary differential equation if it involves an unknown function of only one variable, or a
partial differential equation if it involves partial derivatives of a function of more than one variable. For
now we'll consider only ordinary differential equations, and we'll just call them differential equations.

   Throughout this text, all variables and constants are real unless it's stated otherwise. We'll usually use
x for the independent variable unless the independent variable is time; then we'll use t.

   The simplest differential equations are first order equations of the form

                    dy = f(x) or, equivalently, y = f(x),
                    dx

where f is a known function of x. We already know from calculus how to find functions that satisfy this

kind of equation. For example, if

                                   y = x3,
8 Chapter 1 Introduction

then
                                                y = x3 dx = x4 + c,
                                                                     4

where c is an arbitrary constant. If n > 1 we can find functions y that satisfy equations of the form

                          y(n) = f(x)                                                                (1.2.1)

by repeated integration. Again, this is a calculus problem.
   Except for illustrative purposes in this section, there's no need to consider differential equations like

(1.2.1).We'll usually consider differential equations that can be written as

                          y(n) = f(x, y, y , . . . , y(n-1)),                                        (1.2.2)

where at least one of the functions y, y , . . . , y(n-1) actually appears on the right. Here are some exam-

ples:

                                   dy - x2 = 0    (first order),
                                   dx             (first order),
                                dy + 2xy2 = -2    (second order),
                               dx                 (third order),
                          d2y + 2 dy + y = 2x
                          dx2 dx
                                 xy + y2 = sin x

                          y(n) + xy + 3y = x      (n-th order).

Although none of these equations is written as in (1.2.2), all of them can be written in this form:

                            y = x2,
                            y = -2 - 2xy2,

                            y = 2x - 2y - y,
                           y = sin x - y2 ,

                                             x
                          y(n) = x - xy - 3y.

Solutions of Differential Equations

A solution of a differential equation is a function that satisfies the differential equation on some open
interval; thus, y is a solution of (1.2.2) if y is n times differentiable and

                          y(n)(x) = f(x, y(x), y (x), . . . , y(n-1)(x))

for all x in some open interval (a, b). In this case, we also say that y is a solution of (1.2.2) on (a, b).

Functions that satisfy a differential equation at isolated points are not interesting. For example, y = x2

satisfies

                          xy + x2 = 3x

if and only if x = 0 or x = 1, but it's not a solution of this differential equation because it does not satisfy
the equation on an open interval.

   The graph of a solution of a differential equation is a solution curve. More generally, a curve C is said
to be an integral curve of a differential equation if every function y = y(x) whose graph is a segment
of C is a solution of the differential equation. Thus, any solution curve of a differential equation is an
integral curve, but an integral curve need not be a solution curve.
                                                                             Section 1.2 Basic Concepts 9

Example 1.2.1 If a is any positive constant, the circle                             (1.2.3)
                                                       x2 + y2 = a2

is an integral curve of            y = -x.
                                            y
                                                                                    (1.2.4)

To see this, note that the only functions whose graphs are segments of (1.2.3) are

                                    y1 = a2 - x2 and y2 = - a2 - x2.

We leave it to you to verify that these functions both satisfy (1.2.4) on the open interval (-a, a). However,
(1.2.3) is not a solution curve of (1.2.4), since it's not the graph of a function.

Example 1.2.2 Verify that          y = x2 + 1                                       (1.2.5)
is a solution of                          3x                                        (1.2.6)
on (0, ) and on (-, 0).
                                   xy + y = x2

Solution Substituting (1.2.5) and        2x 1
                                   y= - 2

                                          3x

into (1.2.6) yields

                                                   2x 1              x2 + 1  = x2
                         xy (x) + y(x) = x - 2 +                     3x

                                                    3x

for all x = 0. Therefore y is a solution of (1.2.6) on (-, 0) and (0, ). However, y isn't a solution of
the differential equation on any open interval that contains x = 0, since y is not defined at x = 0.

   Figure 1.2.1 shows the graph of (1.2.5). The part of the graph of (1.2.5) on (0, ) is a solution curve
of (1.2.6), as is the part of the graph on (-, 0).

Example 1.2.3 Show that if c1 and c2 are constants then                             (1.2.7)
                                             y = (c1 + c2x)e-x + 2x - 4

is a solution of                   y + 2y + y = 2x                                  (1.2.8)
on (-, ).

Solution Differentiating (1.2.7) twice yields

                                         y = -(c1 + c2x)e-x + c2e-x + 2

and
                                            y = (c1 + c2x)e-x - 2c2e-x,

                                  +4 + 2x - 4 = 2x

for all values of x. Therefore y is a solution of (1.2.8) on (-, ).

                                           y(n) = e2x.                                        (1.2.9)

Solution Integrating (1.2.9) yields

                                     y(n-1) = e + k1, 2x
                                                  2

where k1 is a constant. If n  2, integrating again yields

                                              y(n-2) = e + k1x + k2. 2x

where k1, k2, . . . , kn are constants. This shows that every solution of (1.2.9) has the form (1.2.10) for
some choice of the constants k1, k2, . . . , kn. On the other hand, differentiating (1.2.10) n times shows
that if k1, k2, . . . , kn are arbitrary constants, then the function y in (1.2.10) satisfies (1.2.9).

   Since the constants k1, k2, . . . , kn in (1.2.10) are arbitrary, so are the constants

                                                 k1 , k2 ,    , kn.

Therefore Example 1.2.4 actually shows that all solutions of (1.2.9) can be written as

                                        y = 2n e + c1 + c2x +    + cnx 2x n-1,

where we renamed the arbitrary constants in (1.2.10) to obtain a simpler formula. As a general rule,
arbitrary constants appearing in solutions of differential equations should be simplified if possible. You'll
see examples of this throughout the text.

Initial Value Problems

In Example 1.2.4 we saw that the differential equation y(n) = e2x has an infinite family of solutions that
depend upon the n arbitrary constants c1, c2, . . . , cn. In the absence of additional conditions, there's no
reason to prefer one solution of a differential equation over another. However, we'll often be interested
in finding a solution of a differential equation that satisfies one or more specific conditions. The next
example illustrates this.

Example 1.2.5 Find a solution of    y = x3
such that y(1) = 2.

Solution At the beginning of this section we saw that the solutions of y = x3 are
                                                       y = x4 + c.
                                                              4

To determine a value of c such that y(1) = 2, we set x = 1 and y = 2 here to obtain

                                    2 = y(1) = 1 + c, so c = 7 .
                                    4                  4

Therefore the required solution is

                                    y = x4 + 7 .
                                             4

   Figure 1.2.2 shows the graph of this solution. Note that imposing the condition y(1) = 2 is equivalent
to requiring the graph of y to pass through the point (1, 2).

   We can rewrite the problem considered in Example 1.2.5 more briefly as

                                    y = x3, y(1) = 2.

We call this an initial value problem. The requirement y(1) = 2 is an initial condition. Initial value
problems can also be posed for higher order differential equations. For example,

y - 2y + 3y = ex, y(0) = 1, y (0) = 2                                                (1.2.11)
12 Chapter 1 Introduction

is an initial value problem for a second order differential equation where y and y are required to have
specified values at x = 0. In general, an initial value problem for an n-th order differential equation
requires y and its first n - 1 derivatives to have specified values at some point x0. These requirements are
the initial conditions.

                                                                                      y

   We'll denote an initial value problem for a differential equation by writing the initial conditions after
the equation, as in (1.2.11). For example, we would write an initial value problem for (1.2.2) as

y(n) = f(x, y, y , . . . , y(n-1)), y(x0) = k0, y (x0) = k1, . . . , y(n-1) = kn-1.        (1.2.12)

Consistent with our earlier definition of a solution of the differential equation in (1.2.12), we say that y is
a solution of the initial value problem (1.2.12) if y is n times differentiable and

                                    y(n)(x) = f(x, y(x), y (x), . . . , y(n-1)(x))

for all x in some open interval (a, b) that contains x0, and y satisfies the initial conditions in (1.2.12). The
largest open interval that contains x0 on which y is defined and satisfies the differential equation is the
interval of validity of y.

Example 1.2.6 In Example 1.2.5 we saw that

                                            y = x4 + 7                                     (1.2.13)
                                                     4

is a solution of the initial value problem

                                            y = x3, y(1) = 2.

Since the function in (1.2.13) is defined for all x, the interval of validity of this solution is (-, ).
                                                                Section 1.2 Basic Concepts 13

Example 1.2.7 In Example 1.2.2 we verified that

                            y = x2 + 1                          (1.2.14)
                                   3x
is a solution of
                            xy + y = x2

on (0, ) and on (-, 0). By evaluating (1.2.14) at x = 1, you can see that (1.2.14) is a solution of

the initial value problems  xy + y = x2, y(1) = 4
                                                          3
                                                                (1.2.15)

and                         xy + y = x2, y(-1) = - 2 .

                                                             3  (1.2.16)

The interval of validity of (1.2.14) as a solution of (1.2.15) is (0, ), since this is the largest interval that

contains x0 = 1 on which (1.2.14) is defined. Similarly, the interval of validity of (1.2.14) as a solution of

(1.2.16) is (-, 0), since this is the largest interval that contains x0 = -1 on which (1.2.14) is defined.

Free Fall Under Constant Gravity

The term initial value problem originated in problems of motion where the independent variable is t
(representing elapsed time), and the initial conditions are the position and velocity of an object at the
initial (starting) time of an experiment.

Example 1.2.8 An object falls under the influence of gravity near Earth's surface, where it can be as-
sumed that the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity is a constant g.
(a) Construct a mathematical model for the motion of the object in the form of an initial value problem

      for a second order differential equation, assuming that the altitude and velocity of the object at time
      t = 0 are known. Assume that gravity is the only force acting on the object.

(b) Solve the initial value problem derived in (a) to obtain the altitude as a function of time.

SOLUTION(a) Let y(t) be the altitude of the object at time t. Since the acceleration of the object has
constant magnitude g and is in the downward (negative) direction, y satisfies the second order equation

                            y = -g,

where the prime now indicates differentiation with respect to t. If y0 and v0 denote the altitude and
velocity when t = 0, then y is a solution of the initial value problem

                            y = -g, y(0) = y0, y (0) = v0.      (1.2.17)

SOLUTION(b) Integrating (1.2.17) twice yields

                                               y = -gt + c1,
                                                            gt2

                                               y = - + c1t + c2.
                                                             2

Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = y0 and y (0) = v0 in these two equations shows that c1 = v0 and
c2 = y0. Therefore the solution of the initial value problem (1.2.17) is

                                                         gt2
                                                 y = - + v0t + y0.

1.3 DIRECTION FIELDS FOR FIRST ORDER EQUATIONS

It's impossible to find explicit formulas for solutions of some differential equations. Even if there are
such formulas, they may be so complicated that they're useless. In this case we may resort to graphical
or numerical methods to get some idea of how the solutions of the given equation behave.

   In Section 2.3 we'll take up the question of existence of solutions of a first order equation

                           y = f(x, y).                                   (1.3.1)

In this section we'll simply assume that (1.3.1) has solutions and discuss a graphical method for ap-
proximating them. In Chapter 3 we discuss numerical methods for obtaining approximate solutions of
(1.3.1).

   Recall that a solution of (1.3.1) is a function y = y(x) such that

                           y (x) = f(x, y(x))

for all values of x in some interval, and an integral curve is either the graph of a solution or is made up
of segments that are graphs of solutions. Therefore, not being able to solve (1.3.1) is equivalent to not
knowing the equations of integral curves of (1.3.1). However, it's easy to calculate the slopes of these
curves. To be specific, the slope of an integral curve of (1.3.1) through a given point (x0, y0) is given by
the number f(x0, y0). This is the basis of the method of direction fields.

   If f is defined on a set R, we can construct a direction field for (1.3.1) in R by drawing a short line
segment through each point (x, y) in R with slope f(x, y). Of course, as a practical matter, we can't
actually draw line segments through every point in R; rather, we must select a finite set of points in R.
For example, suppose f is defined on the closed rectangular region

                           R : {a  x  b, c  y  d}.

Let
                                            a = x0 < x1 <    < xm = b

be equally spaced points in [a, b] and

                           c = y0 < y1 <    < yn = d

be equally spaced points in [c, d]. We say that the points

                           (xi, yj ), 0  i  m, 0  j  n,

form a rectangular grid (Figure 1.3.1). Through each point in the grid we draw a short line segment with
slope f(xi, yj). The result is an approximation to a direction field for (1.3.1) in R. If the grid points are
sufficiently numerous and close together, we can draw approximate integral curves of (1.3.1) by drawing
curves through points in the grid tangent to the line segments associated with the points in the grid.

                           Figure 1.3.1 A rectangular grid

   Unfortunately, approximating a direction field and graphing integral curves in this way is too tedious
to be done effectively by hand. However, there is software for doing this. As you'll see, the combina-
tion of direction fields and integral curves gives useful insights into the behavior of the solutions of the
differential equation even if we can't obtain exact solutions.

   We'll study numerical methods for solving a single first order equation (1.3.1) in Chapter 3. These
methods can be used to plot solution curves of (1.3.1) in a rectangular region R if f is continuous on R.

which are all of the form (1.3.1) with f continuous for all (x, y).

The methods of Chapter 3 won't work for the equation

                                       y = -x/y                                                  (1.3.2)

if R contains part of the x-axis, since f(x, y) = -x/y is undefined when y = 0. Similarly, they won't

work for the equation

                                       y=       x2                                               (1.3.3)

                                             1-x -y2  2

if R contains any part of the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1, because the right side of (1.3.3) is undefined if
x2 + y2 = 1. However, (1.3.2) and (1.3.3) can written as

                                       y = A(x, y)                                               (1.3.4)
                                             B(x, y)

where A and B are continuous on any rectangle R. Because of this, some differential equation software
is based on numerically solving pairs of equations of the form

                                 dx = B(x, y),     dy = A(x, y)                                  (1.3.5)
                                 dt                dt

where x and y are regarded as functions of a parameter t. If x = x(t) and y = y(t) satisfy these equations,
then

                                          y = dy = dy dx = A(x, y) ,
                                                 dx dt dt B(x, y)

so y = y(x) satisfies (1.3.4).
                                            Section 1.3 Direction Fields for First Order Equations 19

Eqns. (1.3.2) and (1.3.3) can be reformulated as in (1.3.4) with

         dx = -y,                               dy = x
         dt                                     dt

and  dx = 1 - x2 - y2, dy = x2,

     dt                                         dt

respectively. Even if f is continuous and otherwise "nice" throughout R, your software may require you

to reformulate the equation y = f(x, y) as

         dx = 1, dy = f(x, y),
         dt                                 dt

which is of the form (1.3.5) with A(x, y) = f(x, y) and B(x, y) = 1.
   Figure 1.3.5 shows a direction field and some integral curves for (1.3.2). As we saw in Example 1.2.1

and will verify again in Section 2.2, the integral curves of (1.3.2) are circles centered at the origin.

                                            y

                                                                  x

                                                                                                   y

   Figure 1.3.6 shows a direction field and some integral curves for (1.3.3). The integral curves near the
top and bottom are solution curves. However, the integral curves near the middle are more complicated.
For example, Figure 1.3.7 shows the integral curve through the origin. The vertices of the dashed rectangle
are on the circle x2 + y2 = 1 (a  .846, b  .533), where all integral curves of (1.3.3) have infinite
slope. There are three solution curves of (1.3.3) on the integral curve in the figure: the segment above the
level y = b is the graph of a solution on (-, a), the segment below the level y = -b is the graph of a
solution on (-a, ), and the segment between these two levels is the graph of a solution on (-a, a).

 USING TECHNOLOGY
20 Chapter 1 Introduction

   As you study from this book, you'll often be asked to use computer software and graphics. Exercises
with this intent are marked as C (computer or calculator required), C/G (computer and/or graphics
required), or L (laboratory work requiring software and/or graphics). Often you may not completely
understand how the software does what it does. This is similar to the situation most people are in when
they drive automobiles or watch television, and it doesn't decrease the value of using modern technology
as an aid to learning. Just be careful that you use the technology as a supplement to thought rather than a
substitute for it.

discussed in Section 1.2 in connection with Newton's law of cooling and absorption of glucose in

where a is a positive constant and b is an arbitrary constant. Thus, (A) is of the form (C) with
y = T , a = k, and b = kTm, and (B) is of the form (C) with y = G, a = , and b = r. We'll
encounter equations of the form (C) in many other applications in Chapter 2.

Choose a positive a and an arbitrary b. Construct a direction field and plot some integral curves
for (C) in a rectangular region of the form

       in terms of a and b.

discussed in Section 1.1 in connection with Verhulst's population model and the spread of an
epidemic, we can write both in the form

                           y = ay - by2,       (C)

where a and b are positive constants. Thus, (A) is of the form (C) with y = P , a = a, and b = a,
and (B) is of the form (C) with y = I, a = rS, and b = r. In Chapter 2 we'll encounter equations
of the form (C) in other applications..

(a) Choose positive numbers a and b. Construct a direction field and plot some integral curves
      for (C) in a rectangular region of the form

                           {0  t  T, 0  y  d}

      of the ty-plane. Vary T and d until you discover a common property of all solutions of (C)
      with y(0) > 0. Repeat this experiment with various choices of a and b until you can state
      this property precisely in terms of a and b.

(b) Choose positive numbers a and b. Construct a direction field and plot some integral curves
      for (C) in a rectangular region of the form

                           {0  t  T, c  y  0}

of the ty-plane. Vary a, b, T and c until you discover a common property of all solutions of
(C) with y(0) < 0.

You can verify your results later by doing Exercise 2.2.27.
                CHAPTER 2
           First Order Equations

IN THIS CHAPTER we study first order equations for which there are general methods of solution.
SECTION 2.1 deals with linear equations, the simplest kind of first order equations. In this section we
introduce the method of variation of parameters. The idea underlying this method will be a unifying
theme for our approach to solving many different kinds of differential equations throughout the book.
SECTION 2.2 deals with separable equations, the simplest nonlinear equations. In this section we intro-
duce the idea of implicit and constant solutions of differential equations, and we point out some differ-
ences between the properties of linear and nonlinear equations.
SECTION 2.3 discusses existence and uniqueness of solutions of nonlinear equations. Although it may
seem logical to place this section before Section 2.2, we presented Section 2.2 first so we could have
illustrative examples in Section 2.3.
SECTION 2.4 deals with nonlinear equations that are not separable, but can be transformed into separable
equations by a procedure similar to variation of parameters.
SECTION 2.5 covers exact differential equations, which are given this name because the method for
solving them uses the idea of an exact differential from calculus.
SECTION 2.6 deals with equations that are not exact, but can made exact by multiplying them by a
function known called integrating factor.

30 Chapter 2 First Order Equations
2.1 LINEAR FIRST ORDER EQUATIONS

A first order differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written as

y + p(x)y = f(x).                                                                          (2.1.1)

A first order differential equation that can't be written like this is nonlinear. We say that (2.1.1) is
homogeneous if f  0; otherwise it's nonhomogeneous. Since y  0 is obviously a solution of the
homgeneous equation

                                                     y + p(x)y = 0,

we call it the trivial solution. Any other solution is nontrivial.

Example 2.1.1 The first order equations

                                                 x2y + 3y = x2,

                                                xy - 8x2y = sin x,
                                             xy + (ln x)y = 0,

                                                           y = x2y - 2,

are not in the form (2.1.1), but they are linear, since they can be rewritten as

                                                         3
                                                  y + 2 y = 1,

                                                        x
                                                  y - 8xy = sin x ,

                                                                        x
                                                y + ln x y = 0,

                                                        x
                                                  y - x2y = -2.

Example 2.1.2 Here are some nonlinear first order equations:

xy + 3y2 = 2x                                         (because y is squared),
        yy = 3                                     (because of the product yy ),

 y + xey = 12                                             (because of ey).

General Solution of a Linear First Order Equation

To motivate a definition that we'll need, consider the simple linear first order equation

                                                                 1                         (2.1.2)
                                                         y = 2.

                                                                x
From calculus we know that y satisfies this equation if and only if

                                    y = - 1 + c,                                           (2.1.3)
                                            x

where c is an arbitrary constant. We call c a parameter and say that (2.1.3) defines a one-parameter
family of functions. For each real number c, the function defined by (2.1.3) is a solution of (2.1.2) on
                                     Section 2.1 Linear First Order Equations 31

(-, 0) and (0, ); moreover, every solution of (2.1.2) on either of these intervals is of the form (2.1.3)
for some choice of c. We say that (2.1.3) is the general solution of (2.1.2).

   We'll see that a similar situation occurs in connection with any first order linear equation

                                     y + p(x)y = f(x);                          (2.1.4)

that is, if p and f are continuous on some open interval (a, b) then there's a unique formula y = y(x, c)
analogous to (2.1.3) that involves x and a parameter c and has the these properties:

      For each fixed value of c, the resulting function of x is a solution of (2.1.4) on (a, b).

 If y is a solution of (2.1.4) on (a, b), then y can be obtained from the formula by choosing c
  appropriately.

We'll call y = y(x, c) the general solution of (2.1.4).
   When this has been established, it will follow that an equation of the form

                                     P0(x)y + P1(x)y = F (x)                    (2.1.5)

has a general solution on any open interval (a, b) on which P0, P1, and F are all continuous and P0 has
no zeros, since in this case we can rewrite (2.1.5) in the form (2.1.4) with p = P1/P0 and f = F/P0,
which are both continuous on (a, b).

   To avoid awkward wording in examples and exercises, we won't specify the interval (a, b) when we
ask for the general solution of a specific linear first order equation. Let's agree that this always means
that we want the general solution on every open interval on which p and f are continuous if the equation
is of the form (2.1.4), or on which P0, P1, and F are continuous and P0 has no zeros, if the equation is of
the form (2.1.5). We leave it to you to identify these intervals in specific examples and exercises.

   For completeness, we point out that if P0, P1, and F are all continuous on an open interval (a, b), but
P0 does have a zero in (a, b), then (2.1.5) may fail to have a general solution on (a, b) in the sense just
defined. Since this isn't a major point that needs to be developed in depth, we won't discuss it further;
however, see Exercise 44 for an example.

Homogeneous Linear First Order Equations

We begin with the problem of finding the general solution of a homogeneous linear first order equation.
The next example recalls a familiar result from calculus.

Example 2.1.3 Let a be a constant.
(a) Find the general solution of

                                     y - ay = 0.                                (2.1.6)

(b) Solve the initial value problem

                                     y - ay = 0, y(x0) = y0.

SOLUTION(a) You already know from calculus that if c is any constant, then y = ceax satisfies (2.1.6).
However, let's pretend you've forgotten this, and use this problem to illustrate a general method for
solving a homogeneous linear first order equation.

   We know that (2.1.6) has the trivial solution y  0. Now suppose y is a nontrivial solution of (2.1.6).
Then, since a differentiable function must be continuous, there must be some open interval I on which y
has no zeros. We rewrite (2.1.6) as

                                                           y =a

               Figure 2.1.1 Solutions of y - ay = 0, y(0) = 1

for x in I. Integrating this shows that
                                        ln |y| = ax + k, so |y| = ekeax,

where k is an arbitrary constant. Since eax can never equal zero, y has no zeros, so y is either always
positive or always negative. Therefore we can rewrite y as

                                          y = ceax                                               (2.1.7)

where                                     ek if y > 0,

                                     c=   -e if y < 0.k

This shows that every nontrivial solution of (2.1.6) is of the form y = ceax for some nonzero constant c.

Since setting c = 0 yields the trivial solution, all solutions of (2.1.6) are of the form (2.1.7). Conversely,
(2.1.7) is a solution of (2.1.6) for every choice of c, since differentiating (2.1.7) yields y = aceax = ay.

SOLUTION(b) Imposing the initial condition y(x0) = y0 yields y0 = ceax0, so c = y0e-ax0 and
                                            y = y0e-ax0 eax = y0ea(x-x0).

Figure 2.1.1 show the graphs of this function with x0 = 0, y0 = 1, and various values of a.

                                          xy + y = 0.                                            (2.1.8)

                                     xy + y = 0, y(1) = 3.                                       (2.1.9)

SOLUTION(a) We rewrite (2.1.8) as       y + 1 y = 0,
                                              x
                                                                                      (2.1.10)

where x is restricted to either (-, 0) or (0, ). If y is a nontrivial solution of (2.1.10), there must be

some open interval I on which y has no zeros. We can rewrite (2.1.10) as

                                        y = -1
                                        y                   x

for x in I. Integrating shows that

                 ln |y| = - ln |x| + k, so |y| = ek .
                                                           |x|

Since a function that satisfies the last equation can't change sign on either (-, 0) or (0, ), we can

rewrite this result more simply as      y= c
                                             x
                                                                                      (2.1.11)

where                                                ek if y > 0,

                                    c=  -e if y < 0. k

We've now shown that every solution of (2.1.10) is given by (2.1.11) for some choice of c. (Even though

we assumed that y was nontrivial to derive (2.1.11), we can get the trivial solution by setting c = 0 in

(2.1.11).) Conversely, any function of the form (2.1.11) is a solution of (2.1.10), since differentiating

(2.1.11) yields                                   c
                                        y = - 2,

                                                 x

and substituting this and (2.1.11) into (2.1.10) yields

Figure 2.1.2 shows the graphs of some solutions corresponding to various values of c

SOLUTION(b) Imposing the initial condition y(1) = 3 in (2.1.11) yields c = 3. Therefore the solution

of (2.1.9) is                           y = 3.

Figure 2.1.2 Solutions of xy + y = 0 on (0, ) and (-, 0)

Proof If y = ce-P(x), differentiating y and using (2.1.14) shows that

y = -P (x)ce-P (x) = -p(x)ce-P (x) = -p(x)y,

so y + p(x)y = 0; that is, y is a solution of (2.1.12), for any choice of c.
   Now we'll show that any solution of (2.1.12) can be written as y = ce-P(x) for some constant c. The

trivial solution can be written this way, with c = 0. Now suppose y is a nontrivial solution. Then there's

an open subinterval I of (a, b) on which y has no zeros. We can rewrite (2.1.12) as

                                                        y = -p(x)                                                                     (2.1.15)
                                                        y
for x in I. Integrating (2.1.15) and recalling (2.1.13) yields

                                          ln |y| = -P (x) + k,

where k is a constant. This implies that

                                          |y| = eke-P (x).

Since P is defined for all x in (a, b) and an exponential can never equal zero, we can take I = (a, b), so
y has zeros on (a, b) (a, b), so we can rewrite the last equation as y = ce-P(x), where

c=                                        ek if y > 0 on (a, b),

                                          -e if y < 0 on (a, b).k

REMARK: Rewriting a first order differential equation so that one side depends only on y and y and the
other depends only on x is called separation of variables. We did this in Examples 2.1.3 and 2.1.4, and
in rewriting (2.1.12) as (2.1.15).We'llapply this method to nonlinear equations in Section 2.2.
                                             Section 2.1 Linear First Order Equations 35

Linear Nonhomogeneous First Order Equations
We'll now solve the nonhomogeneous equation

                                        y + p(x)y = f(x).                     (2.1.16)

When considering this equation we call

                                        y + p(x)y = 0

the complementary equation.
   We'll find solutions of (2.1.16) in the form y = uy1, where y1 is a nontrivial solution of the com-

plementary equation and u is to be determined. This method of using a solution of the complementary
equation to obtain solutions of a nonhomogeneous equation is a special case of a method called variation
of parameters, which you'll encounter several times in this book. (Obviously, u can't be constant, since
if it were, the left side of (2.1.16) would be zero. Recognizing this, the early users of this method viewed
u as a "parameter" that varies; hence, the name "variation of parameters.")

   If
                                         y = uy1, then y = u y1 + uy1.

Substituting these expressions for y and y into (2.1.16) yields

                  u y1 + u(y1 + p(x)y1) = f(x),

which reduces to

                                        u y1 = f(x),                          (2.1.17)

since y1 is a solution of the complementary equation; that is,

                                                    y1 + p(x)y1 = 0.

In the proof of Theorem 2.2.1 we saw that y1 has no zeros on an interval where p is continuous. Therefore
we can divide (2.1.17) through by y1 to obtain

                                        u = f(x)/y1(x).

We can integrate this (introducing a constant of integration), and multiply the result by y1 to get the gen-
eral solution of (2.1.16). Before turning to the formal proof of this claim, let's consider some examples.

Example 2.1.5 Find the general solution of                                    (2.1.18)
                                                   y + 2y = x3e-2x.

   By applying (a) of Example 2.1.3 with a = -2, we see that y1 = e-2x is a solution of the com-
plementary equation y + 2y = 0. Therefore we seek solutions of (2.1.18) in the form y = ue-2x, so
that

y = u e-2x - 2ue-2x and y + 2y = u e-2x - 2ue-2x + 2ue-2x = u e-2x.           (2.1.19)

Therefore y is a solution of (2.1.18) if and only if                 u = x3.
                                  u e-2x = x3e-2x or, equivalently,

Therefore                               u = x4 + c,

                                         y + (cot x)y = x csc x.                                (2.1.20)
                                                                                                (2.1.21)
(b) Solve the initial value problem

                               y + (cot x)y = x csc x, y(/2) = 1.

SOLUTION(a) Here p(x) = cot x and f(x) = x csc x are both continuous except at the points x = r,

where r is an integer. Therefore we seek solutions of (2.1.20) on the intervals (r, (r + 1)). We need a

nontrival solution y1 of the complementary equation; thus, y1 must satisfy y1 + (cot x)y1 = 0, which we

rewrite as                           y1 = - cot x = - cos x .

                                     y1                    sin x                                (2.1.22)

Integrating this yields

                                     ln |y1| = - ln | sin x|,

where we take the constant of integration to be zero since we need only one function that satisfies (2.1.22).
Clearly y1 = 1/ sin x is a suitable choice. Therefore we seek solutions of (2.1.20) in the form

                                               y= u ,
                                                    sin x

so that                        y = u sin x - sin2 u cos xx

and                                                                                             (2.1.23)
                                  y + (cot x)y = u sin x - sin2 u cos xx + u cot x sin x        (2.1.24)
                                                      = u - 2 u cos x + 2 u cos x
                                                           sin x sin x sin x
                                                      = u.
                                                           sin x

Therefore y is a solution of (2.1.20) if and only if

                         u / sin x = x csc x = x/ sin x or, equivalently, u = x.

Integrating this yields

                            u = x2 + c, and y = u = x2 + c .                                    (2.1.25)
                            2                         sin x 2 sin x sin x

is the general solution of (2.1.20) on every interval (r, (r + 1)) (r =integer).

SOLUTION(b) Imposing the initial condition y(/2) = 1 in (2.1.25) yields

                               1 = 2 + c or c = 1 - 2 .
                               8                             8

Thus,                          y = x2 + (1 - 2/8)

                                  2 sin x             sin x

is a solution of (2.1.21). The interval of validity of this solution is (0, ); Figure 2.1.4 shows its graph.

38 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

REMARK: It wasn't necessary to do the computations (2.1.23) and (2.1.24) in Example 2.1.6, since we
showed in the discussion preceding Example 2.1.5 that if y = uy1 where y1 + p(x)y1 = 0, then y +
p(x)y = u y1. We did these computations so you would see this happen in this specific example. We
recommend that you include these "unnecesary" computations in doing exercises, until you're confident
that you really understand the method. After that, omit them.

   We summarize the method of variation of parameters for solving

                                     y + p(x)y = f(x)                    (2.1.26)
                                                                         (2.1.27)
as follows:

(a) Find a function y1 such that     y1 = -p(x).
                                     y1

For convenience, take the constant of integration to be zero.

(b) Write

                                     y = uy1

      to remind yourself of what you're doing.
(c) Write u y1 = f and solve for u ; thus, u = f/y1.
(d) Integrate u to obtain u, with an arbitrary constant of integration.
(e) Substitute u into (2.1.27) to obtain y.

To solve an equation written as

                                     P0(x)y + P1(x)y = F (x),

we recommend that you divide through by P0(x) to obtain an equation of the form (2.1.26) and then
follow this procedure.

Solutions in Integral Form

Sometimes the integrals that arise in solving a linear first order equation can't be evaluated in terms of
elementary functions. In this case the solution must be left in terms of an integral.

Example 2.1.7

(a) Find the general solution of             y - 2xy = 1.
(b) Solve the initial value problem  y - 2xy = 1, y(0) = y0.

                                                                         (2.1.28)

SOLUTION(a) To apply variation of parameters, we need a nontrivial solution y1 of the complementary
equation; thus, y1 - 2xy1 = 0, which we rewrite as

                                                         y1 = 2x.
                                                         y1
                                        Section 2.1 Linear First Order Equations 39

Integrating this and taking the constant of integration to be zero yields

                                           ln |y1| = x2, so |y1| = ex2 .
We choose y1 = ex2 and seek solutions of (2.1.28) in the form y = uex2 , where

                                             u ex2 = 1, so u = e-x2 .

Therefore

                      u = c + e-x2 dx,

but we can't simplify the integral on the right because there's no elementary function with derivative
equal to e-x2 . Therefore the best available form for the general solution of (2.1.28) is

                      y = uex2 = ex2 c + e-x2 dx .                                                                                   (2.1.29)

SOLUTION(b)  Since the initial condition in (2.1.28) is imposed at x0 = 0, it is convenient to rewrite
(2.1.29) as
                      c + e- x t2 dt ,          e- 0 t2 dt = 0.
             y = ex2                    since
                               0               0

Setting x = 0 and y = y0 here shows that c = y0. Therefore the solution of the initial value problem is

                      y = ex2 y0 + x e-t2 dt .                                                                                       (2.1.30)

                                                   0

For a given value of y0 and each fixed x, the integral on the right can be evaluated by numerical methods.
An alternate procedure is to apply the numerical integration procedures discussed in Chapter 3 directly to

the initial value problem (2.1.28). Figure 2.1.5 shows graphs of of (2.1.30) for several values of y0.

An Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
The method of variation of parameters leads to this theorem.

Theorem 2.1.2 Suppose p and f are continuous on an open interval (a, b), and let y1 be any nontrivial
solution of the complementary equation

                                    y + p(x)y = 0

on (a, b). Then:
(a) The general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation

                                    y + p(x)y = f(x)              (2.1.31)

on (a, b) is

                         y = y1(x) c + f(x)/y1(x) dx .            (2.1.32)

(b) If x0 is an arbitrary point in (a, b) and y0 is an arbitrary real number, then the initial value problem

                                    y + p(x)y = f(x), y(x0) = y0

has the unique solution  y = y1(x)    y0 x + f(t) dt
on (a, b).                          y1(x0) x0 y1(t)

Proof (a) To show that (2.1.32) is the general solution of (2.1.31) on (a, b), we must prove that:
    (i) If c is any constant, the function y in (2.1.32) is a solution of (2.1.31) on (a, b).

   (ii) If y is a solution of (2.1.31) on (a, b) then y is of the form (2.1.32) for some constant c.
   To prove (i), we first observe that any function of the form (2.1.32) is defined on (a, b), since p and f
are continuous on (a, b). Differentiating (2.1.32) yields

                         y = y1(x) c + f(x)/y1(x) dx + f(x).

Since y1 = -p(x)y1, this and (2.1.32) imply that

                             y = -p(x)y1(x) c + f(x)/y1(x) dx + f(x)

                                   = -p(x)y(x) + f(x),

which implies that y is a solution of (2.1.31).
   To prove (ii), suppose y is a solution of (2.1.31) on (a, b). From the proof of Theorem 2.1.1, we know

that y1 has no zeros on (a, b), so the function u = y/y1 is defined on (a, b). Moreover, since

                                          y = -py + f and y1 = -py1,

                         u = 2 y1y - y1y
                                         y1

                         = 2 y1(-py + f) - (-py1)y = f .
                                                  y1          y1

Integrating u = f/y1 yields

                             u = c + f(x)/y1(x) dx ,

which implies (2.1.32), since y = uy1.

(b) We've proved (a), where f(x)/y1(x) dx in (2.1.32) is an arbitrary antiderivative of f/y1. Now

it's convenient to choose the antiderivative that equals zero when x = x0, and write the general solution

of (2.1.31) as                                        x f(t)

                             y = y1(x) c +            x0 y1(t)  dt .

Since                                        x0 c + f(t) dt
                                                   x0 y1(t)
                     y(x0) = y1(x0)                                = cy1(x0),

we see that y(x0) = y0 if and only if c = y0/y1(x0).

43. Experiments indicate that glucose is absorbed by the body at a rate proportional to the amount of
       glucose present in the bloodstream. Let  denote the (positive) constant of proportionality. Now
       suppose glucose is injected into a patient's bloodstream at a constant rate of r units per unit of
       time. Let G = G(t) be the number of units in the patient's bloodstream at time t > 0. Then

                                       G = -G + r,

       where the first term on the right is due to the absorption of the glucose by the patient's body and
       the second term is due to the injection. Determine G for t > 0, given that G(0) = G0. Also, find

then y1 - y2 is a solution of the homogeneous equation

2.2 SEPARABLE EQUATIONS

A first order differential equation is separable if it can be written as

                                          h(y)y = g(x),                                    (2.2.1)

where the left side is a product of y and a function of y and the right side is a function of x. Rewriting

a separable differential equation in this form is called separation of variables. In Section 2.1 we used

separation of variables to solve homogeneous linear equations. In this section we'll apply this method to

nonlinear equations.

To see how to solve (2.2.1), let's first assume that y is a solution. Let G(x) and H(y) be antiderivatives

of g(x) and h(y); that is,

                                    H (y) = h(y) and G (x) = g(x).                         (2.2.2)

Then, from the chain rule,

                            d H(y(x)) = H (y(x))y (x) = h(y)y (x).
                            dx

Therefore (2.2.1) is equivalent to

                                      d H(y(x)) = d G(x).
                                      dx  dx

Integrating both sides of this equation and combining the constants of integration yields

                                      H(y(x)) = G(x) + c.                                  (2.2.3)

Although we derived this equation on the assumption that y is a solution of (2.2.1), we can now view it
differently: Any differentiable function y that satisfies (2.2.3) for some constant c is a solution of (2.2.1).
To see this, we differentiate both sides of (2.2.3), using the chain rule on the left, to obtain

                                      H (y(x))y (x) = G (x),

which is equivalent to

                                      h(y(x))y (x) = g(x)

because of (2.2.2).
   In conclusion, to solve (2.2.1) it suffices to find functions G = G(x) and H = H(y) that satisfy

(2.2.2). Then any differentiable function y = y(x) that satisfies (2.2.3) is a solution of (2.2.1).

Example 2.2.1 Solve the equation

                                          y = x(1 + y2).

Solution Separating variables yields          y = x.
Integrating yields                         1 + y2
Therefore                              tan-1 y = x2 + c

                                                      2
                                      y = tan x2 + c .

46 Chapter 2 First Order Equations              y = -x.                   (2.2.4)
Example 2.2.2                                             y               (2.2.5)
(a) Solve the equation                                                    (2.2.6)
                                         y = - x , y(1) = 1.
(b) Solve the initial value problem               y

(c) Solve the initial value problem     y = - x , y(1) = -2.
                                                 y

SOLUTION(a) Separating variables in (2.2.4) yields

                                        yy = -x.

Integrating yields

                        y2 = - x2 + c,  or, equivalently,  x2 + y2 = 2c.
                        2  2

The last equation shows that c must be positive if y is to be a solution of (2.2.4) on an open interval.
Therefore we let 2c = a2 (with a > 0) and rewrite the last equation as

                                        x2 + y2 = a2.                     (2.2.7)

This equation has two differentiable solutions for y in terms of x:

                           y = a2 - x2, -a < x < a,                       (2.2.8)

and

                           y = - a2 - x2, -a < x < a.                     (2.2.9)

The solution curves defined by (2.2.8) are semicircles above the x-axis and those defined by (2.2.9) are
semicircles below the x-axis (Figure 2.2.1).

SOLUTION(b) The solution of (2.2.5) is positive when x = 1; hence, it is of the form (2.2.8). Substituting
x = 1 and y = 1 into (2.2.7) to satisfy the initial condition yields a2 = 2; hence, the solution of (2.2.5) is

                                                                     
                           y = 2 - x2, - 2 < x < 2.

SOLUTION(c) The solution of (2.2.6) is negative when x = 1 and is therefore of the form (2.2.9).

Substituting x = 1 and y = -2 into (2.2.7) to satisfy the initial condition yields a2 = 5. Hence, the

solution of (2.2.6) is                                               

                           y = - 5 - x2, - 5 < x < 5.

Implicit Solutions of Separable Equations

In Examples 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 we were able to solve the equation H(y) = G(x) + c to obtain explicit
formulas for solutions of the given separable differential equations. As we'll see in the next example,
this isn't always possible. In this situation we must broaden our definition of a solution of a separable
equation. The next theorem provides the basis for this modification. We omit the proof, which requires a
result from advanced calculus called as the implicit function theorem.

Theorem 2.2.1 Suppose g = g(x) is continous on (a, b) and h = h(y) are continuous on (c, d). Let G

be an antiderivative of g on (a, b) and let H be an antiderivative of h on (c, d). Let x0 be an arbitrary
point in (a, b), let y0 be a point in (c, d) such that h(y0) = 0, and define

                              c = H(y0) - G(x0).                                 (2.2.10)

Then there's a function y = y(x) defined on some open interval (a1, b1), where a  a1 < x0 < b1  b,

such that y(x0) = y0 and

                              H(y) = G(x) + c                                    (2.2.11)

for a1 < x < b1. Therefore y is a solution of the initial value problem

                              h(y)y = g(x), y(x0) = x0.                          (2.2.12)

   It's convenient to say that (2.2.11) with c arbitrary is an implicit solution of h(y)y = g(x). Curves
defined by (2.2.11) are integral curves of h(y)y = g(x). If c satisfies (2.2.10), we'll say that (2.2.11) is
an implicit solution of the initial value problem (2.2.12). However, keep these points in mind:

      For some choices of c there may not be any differentiable functions y that satisfy (2.2.11).
48 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

      The function y in (2.2.11) (not (2.2.11) itself) is a solution of h(y)y = g(x).
Example 2.2.3

(a) Find implicit solutions of                             2x + 1                       (2.2.13)
(b) Find an implicit solution of                   y= 4 .                               (2.2.14)

                                                          5y + 1
                                                   2x + 1
                                            y = 4 , y(2) = 1.
                                                  5y + 1

SOLUTION(a) Separating variables yields
                                                 (5y4 + 1)y = 2x + 1.

Integrating yields the implicit solution

                                            y5 + y = x2 + x + c.                        (2.2.15)

of (2.2.13).

SOLUTION(b) Imposing the initial condition y(2) = 1 in (2.2.15) yields 1 + 1 = 4 + 2 + c, so c = -4.

Therefore
                                                  y5 + y = x2 + x - 4

is an implicit solution of the initial value problem (2.2.14). Although more than one differentiable func-
tion y = y(x) satisfies 2.2.13) near x = 1, it can be shown that there's only one such function that
satisfies the initial condition y(1) = 2.

   Figure 2.2.2 shows a direction field and some integral curves for (2.2.13).

Constant Solutions of Separable Equations

An equation of the form

                                            y = g(x)p(y)

is separable, since it can be rewritten as

                                             1 y = g(x).
                                            p(y)

However, the division by p(y) is not legitimate if p(y) = 0 for some values of y. The next two examples
show how to deal with this problem.

Example 2.2.4 Find all solutions of

                                            y = 2xy2.                                   (2.2.16)

Solution Here we must divide by p(y) = y2 to separate variables. This isn't legitimate if y is a solution
of (2.2.16) that equals zero for some value of x. One such solution can be found by inspection: y  0.

Now suppose y is a solution of (2.2.16) that isn't identically zero. Since y is continuous there must be an
interval on which y is never zero. Since division by y2 is legitimate for x in this interval, we can separate

variables in (2.2.16) to obtain
                                                          y = 2x.

                                                x +c

   We've now shown that if y is a solution of (2.2.16) that is not identically zero, then y must be of the
form (2.2.17). By substituting (2.2.17) into (2.2.16), you can verify that (2.2.17) is a solution of (2.2.16).
Thus, solutions of (2.2.16) are y  0 and the functions of the form (2.2.17). Note that the solution y  0
isn't of the form (2.2.17) for any value of c.

Solution Here we must divide by p(y) = 1 - y2 to separate variables. This isn't legitimate if y is a
solution of (2.2.18) that equals 1 for some value of x. Two such solutions can be found by inspection:
y  1 and y  -1. Now suppose y is a solution of (2.2.18) such that 1 - y2 isn't identically zero. Since
1 - y2 is continuous there must be an interval on which 1 - y2 is never zero. Since division by 1 - y2 is
legitimate for x in this interval, we can separate variables in (2.2.18) to obtain

                                                        2y = -x.

A partial fraction expansion on the left yields

                                    y-1 y+1

and integrating yields

                                    ln y - 1 = - x2 + k;
                                    y+1                  2

hence,

                                    y - 1 = eke-x2/2.
                                    y+1

Since y(x) = 1 for x on the interval under discussion, the quantity (y - 1)/(y + 1) can't change sign
in this interval. Therefore we can rewrite the last equation as

                                    y - 1 = ce-x2/2,
                                    y+1

where c = 켩k, depending upon the sign of (y - 1)/(y + 1) on the interval. Solving for y yields

                                                 1 + ce-x2/2
                                    y=                 -x2/2 .                       (2.2.19)
                                                 1 - ce

   We've now shown that if y is a solution of (2.2.18) that is not identically equal to 1, then y must be
as in (2.2.19). By substituting (2.2.19) into (2.2.18) you can verify that (2.2.19) is a solution of (2.2.18).
Thus, the solutions of (2.2.18) are y  1, y  -1 and the functions of the form (2.2.19). Note that the
                                                                               Section 2.2 Separable Equations 51

constant solution y  1 can be obtained from this formula by taking c = 0; however, the other constant
solution, y  -1, can't be obtained in this way.

Differences Between Linear and Nonlinear Equations
Theorem 2.1.2 states that if p and f are continuous on (a, b) then every solution of

                                              y + p(x)y = f(x)

on (a, b) can be obtained by choosing a value for the constant c in the general solution, and if x0 is any
point in (a, b) and y0 is arbitrary, then the initial value problem

                                    y + p(x)y = f(x), y(x0) = y0

has a solution on (a, b).

The not true for nonlinear equations. First, we saw in Examples 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 that a nonlinear

equation may have solutions that can't be obtained by choosing a specific value of a constant appearing

in a one-parameter family of solutions. Second, it is in general impossible to determine the interval

of validity of a solution to an initial value problem for a nonlinear equation by simply examining the

equation, since the interval of validity may depend on the initial condition. For instance, in Example 2.2.2

we saw that the solution of             dy = - x , y(x0) = y0
                                        dx y

is valid on (-a, a), where a =  x2   +  y02.

                                  0
52 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

Example 2.2.6 Solve the initial value problem
                                                y = 2xy2, y(0) = y0

and determine the interval of validity of the solution.

Solution First suppose y0 = 0. From Example 2.2.4, we know that y must be of the form

                                                 1                                     (2.2.20)
                                      y=- 2 .

                                              x +c

Imposing the initial condition shows that c = -1/y0. Substituting this into (2.2.20) and rearranging

terms yields the solution             y = 1 - y0x2 y0 .

This is also the solution if y0 = 0. If y0 < 0, the denominator isn't zero for any value of x, so the the
                                                                                           

solution is valid on (-, ). If y0 > 0, the solution is valid only on (-1/ y0, 1/ y0).

28. The population P = P (t) of a species satisfies the logistic equation

                                     P = aP (1 - P )

       and P (0) = P0 > 0. Find P for t > 0, and find limt P (t).

29. An epidemic spreads through a population at a rate proportional to the product of the number of
       people already infected and the number of people susceptible, but not yet infected. Therefore, if
       S denotes the total population of susceptible people and I = I(t) denotes the number of infected
       people at time t, then
                                                        I = rI(S - I),

       where r is a positive constant. Assuming that I(0) = I0, find I(t) for t > 0, and show that
       limt I(t) = S.

30. L The result of Exercise 29 is discouraging: if any susceptible member of the group is initially
       infected, then in the long run all susceptible members are infected! On a more hopeful note,
       suppose the disease spreads according to the model of Exercise 29, but there's a medication that
       cures the infected population at a rate proportional to the number of infected individuals. Now the
       equation for the number of infected individuals becomes

                                     I = rI(S - I) - qI                                                (A)

where q is a positive constant.

              in the (t, I)-plane, verify that if I is any solution of (A) such that I(0) > 0, then limt I(t) =
              S - q/r if q < rS and limt I(t) = 0 if q  rS.
       (b) To verify the experimental results of (a), use separation of variables to solve (A) with initial
              condition I(0) = I0 > 0, and find limt I(t). HINT: There are three cases to consider:
              (i) q < rS; (ii) q > rS; (iii) q = rS.

31. L Consider the differential equation

                                    y = ay - by2 - q,          (A)

where a, b are positive constants, and q is an arbitrary constant. Suppose y denotes a solution of

this equation that satisfies the initial condition y(0) = y0.

(a) Choose a and b positive and q < a2/4b. By plotting direction fields and solutions of (A) on

suitable rectangular grids

                                    R = {0  t  T, c  y  d}     (B)

      in the (t, y)-plane, discover that there are numbers y1 and y2 with y1 < y2 such that if
      y0 > y1 then limt y(t) = y2, and if y0 < y1 then y(t) = - for some finite value of t.
      (What happens if y0 = y1?)
(b) Choose a and b positive and q = a2/4b. By plotting direction fields and solutions of (A)
      on suitable rectangular grids of the form (B), discover that there's a number y1 such that if
      y0  y1 then limt y(t) = y1, while if y0 < y1 then y(t) = - for some finite value of
      t.
(c) Choose positive a, b and q > a2/4b. By plotting direction fields and solutions of (A) on
      suitable rectangular grids of the form (B), discover that no matter what y0 is, y(t) = - for
      some finite value of t.

(d) Verify your results experiments analytically. Start by separating variables in (A) to obtain

                                                                 y = 1.

              To decide what to do next you'll have to use the quadratic formula. This should lead you to
              see why there are three cases. Take it from there!
              Because of its role in the transition between these three cases, q0 = a2/4b is called a bifur-
              cation value of q. In general, if q is a parameter in any differential equation, q0 is said to be a
              bifurcation value of q if the nature of the solutions of the equation with q < q0 is qualitatively
              different from the nature of the solutions with q > q0.

32. L By plotting direction fields and solutions of

                                    y = qy - y3,

       convince yourself that q0 = 0 is a bifurcation value of q for this equation. Explain what makes
       you draw this conclusion.

33. Suppose a disease spreads according to the model of Exercise 29, but there's a medication that
       cures the infected population at a constant rate of q individuals per unit time, where q > 0. Then
       the equation for the number of infected individuals becomes

                                    I = rI(S - I) - q.

Assuming that I(0) = I0 > 0, use the results of Exercise 31 to describe what happens as t  .

2.3 EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTIONS OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS

Although there are methods for solving some nonlinear equations, it's impossible to find useful formulas
for the solutions of most. Whether we're looking for exact solutions or numerical approximations, it's
useful to know conditions that imply the existence and uniqueness of solutions of initial value problems
for nonlinear equations. In this section we state such a condition and illustrate it with examples.

56 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

Some terminology: an open rectangle R is a set of points (x, y) such that

                                    a < x < b and c < y < d

(Figure 2.3.1). We'll denote this set by R : {a < x < b, c < y < d}. "Open" means that the boundary
rectangle (indicated by the dashed lines in Figure 2.3.1) isn't included in R .

   The next theorem gives sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of initial value
problems for first order nonlinear differential equations. We omit the proof, which is beyond the scope of
this book.

Theorem 2.3.1

(a) If f is continuous on an open rectangle

                                    R : {a < x < b, c < y < d}

that contains (x0, y0) then the initial value problem

                                    y = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0                    (2.3.1)

      has at least one solution on some open subinterval of (a, b) that contains x0.

(b) If both f and fy are continuous on R then (2.3.1) has a unique solution on some open subinterval
      of (a, b) that contains x0.

It's important to understand exactly what Theorem 2.3.1 says.

 (a) is an existence theorem. It guarantees that a solution exists on some open interval that contains
  x0, but provides no information on how to find the solution, or to determine the open interval on
  which it exists. Moreover, (a) provides no information on the number of solutions that (2.3.1) may
  have. It leaves open the possibility that (2.3.1) may have two or more solutions that differ for values
  of x arbitrarily close to x0. We will see in Example 2.3.6 that this can happen.

 (b) is a uniqueness theorem. It guarantees that (2.3.1) has a unique solution on some open interval

       (a,b) that contains x0. However, if (a, b) = (-, ), (2.3.1) may have more than one solution on

       a larger interval that contains (a, b). For example, it may happen that b <  and all solutions have

       the same values on (a, b), but two solutions y1 and y2 are defined on some interval (a, b1) with

       b1 > b, and have different values for b < x < b1; thus, the graphs of the y1 and y2 "branch off" in

       different directions at x = b. (See Example 2.3.7 and Figure 2.3.3). In this case, continuity implies

       that y1(b) = y2(b) (call their common value y), and y1 and y2 are both solutions of the initial value

       problem

                                    y = f(x, y), y(b) = y                      (2.3.2)

       that differ on every open interval that contains b. Therefore f or fy must have a discontinuity at
       some point in each open rectangle that contains (b, y), since if this were not so, (2.3.2) would have
       a unique solution on some open interval that contains b. We leave it to you to give a similar analysis
       of the case where a > -.

Example 2.3.1 Consider the initial value problem

                           y=       x2 - y2       y(x0) = y0.                  (2.3.3)
                                        2 2,
                                    1+x +y

Since                      x2 - y2                             2y(1 + 2x2)

                f(x, y) =           2 2 and fy(x, y) = -        2          22
                           1+x +y                              (1 + x + y )
         Section 2.3 Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions of Nonlinear Equations 57

are continuous for all (x, y), Theorem 2.3.1 implies that if (x0, y0) is arbitrary, then (2.3.3) has a unique
solution on some open interval that contains x0.

Example 2.3.2 Consider the initial value problem

               x2 - y2                            y(x0) = y0.                (2.3.4)
         y = 2 2,

               x +y

Here     x2 - y2                                                   4x2y

         f(x, y) = 2 2 and fy(x, y) = - 2 2 2
         x +y                                                      (x + y )

are continuous everywhere except at (0, 0). If (x0, y0) = (0, 0), there's an open rectangle R that contains
(x0, y0) that does not contain (0, 0). Since f and fy are continuous on R, Theorem 2.3.1 implies that if
(x0, y0) = (0, 0) then (2.3.4) has a unique solution on some open interval that contains x0.

Example 2.3.3 Consider the initial value problem

         y = x + y , y(x0) = y0.                                             (2.3.5)
               x-y

Here     f(x, y) = x + y and fy(x, y) =                            2x

                                                                          2
         x-y                                                       (x - y)

are continuous everywhere except on the line y = x. If y0 = x0, there's an open rectangle R that contains
(x0, y0) that does not intersect the line y = x. Since f and fy are continuous on R, Theorem 2.3.1 implies
that if y0 = x0, (2.3.5) has a unique solution on some open interval that contains x0.

Example 2.3.4 In Example 2.2.4 we saw that the solutions of                  (2.3.6)
                                                         y = 2xy2

are
                                                                           1

                                             y  0 and y = - 2 ,
                                                                        x +c

where c is an arbitrary constant. In particular, this implies that no solution of (2.3.6) other than y  0 can
equal zero for any value of x. Show that Theorem 2.3.1(b) implies this.

Solution We'll obtain a contradiction by assuming that (2.3.6) has a solution y1 that equals zero for some

value of x, but isn't identically zero. If y1 has this property, there's a point x0 such that y1(x0) = 0, but

y1(x) = 0 for some value of x in every open interval that contains x0. This means that the initial value

problem

         y = 2xy2, y(x0) = 0                                                 (2.3.7)

has two solutions y  0 and y = y1 that differ for some value of x on every open interval that contains
x0. This contradicts Theorem 2.3.1(b), since in (2.3.6) the functions

         f(x, y) = 2xy2 and fy(x, y) = 4xy.

are both continuous for all (x, y), which implies that (2.3.7) has a unique solution on some open interval
that contains x0.
58 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

Example 2.3.5 Consider the initial value problem

                                    y = 10 xy2/5,     y(x0) = y0.                                    (2.3.8)
                                           3

(a) For what points (x0, y0) does Theorem 2.3.1(a) imply that (2.3.8) has a solution?

(b) For what points (x0, y0) does Theorem 2.3.1(b) imply that (2.3.8) has a unique solution on some
      open interval that contains x0?

SOLUTION(a) Since                   f(x, y) = 10 xy2/5
                                                 3

is continuous for all (x, y), Theorem 2.3.1 implies that (2.3.8) has a solution for every (x0, y0).

SOLUTION(b) Here                    fy (x, y) = 4 xy-3/5
                                                  3

is continuous for all (x, y) with y = 0. Therefore, if y0 = 0 there's an open rectangle on which both f
and fy are continuous, and Theorem 2.3.1 implies that (2.3.8) has a unique solution on some open interval
that contains x0.

   If y = 0 then fy (x, y) is undefined, and therefore discontinuous; hence, Theorem 2.3.1 does not apply
to (2.3.8) if y0 = 0.

Example 2.3.6 Example 2.3.5 leaves open the possibility that the initial value problem

                                    y = 10 xy2/5,     y(0) = 0                                       (2.3.9)
                                           3

has more than one solution on every open interval that contains x0 = 0. Show that this is true.

Solution By inspection, y  0 is a solution of the differential equation

                                       y = 10 xy2/5.                                                 (2.3.10)
                                              3

Since y  0 satisfies the initial condition y(0) = 0, it's a solution of (2.3.9).

Now suppose y is a solution of (2.3.10) that isn't identically zero. Separating variables in (2.3.10)

yields                                 y-2/5y = 10 x
                                                     3

on any open interval where y has no zeros. Integrating this and rewriting the arbitrary constant as 5c/3

yields                              5 y3/5 = 5 (x2 + c).

                                    3             3

Therefore

                                       y = (x2 + c)5/3.                                              (2.3.11)

Since we divided by y to separate variables in (2.3.10), our derivation of (2.3.11) is legitimate only on

open intervals where y has no zeros. However, (2.3.11) actually defines y for all x, and differentiating

(2.3.11) shows that  y = 10 x(x2 + c)2/3 = 10 xy2/5, - < x < .

                                                                                                                  x

Figure 2.3.2 Two solutions (y = 0 and y = x1/2) of (2.3.9) that differ on every interval containing
                                                       x0 = 0

Therefore (2.3.11) satisfies (2.3.10) on (-, ) even if c  0, so that y(  |c|) = y(-  |c|) = 0. In

particular, taking c = 0 in (2.3.11) yields  y = x10/3

as a second solution of (2.3.9). Both solutions are defined on (-, ), and they differ on every open

interval that contains x0 = 0 (see Figure 2.3.2.) In fact, there are four distinct solutions of (2.3.9) defined
on (-, ) that differ from each other on every open interval that contains x0 = 0. Can you identify
the other two?

Example 2.3.7 From Example 2.3.5, the initial value problem

y = 10 xy2/5,                                y(0) = -1                               (2.3.12)
       3

has a unique solution on some open interval that contains x0 = 0. Find a solution and determine the
largest open interval (a, b) on which it's unique.

Solution Let y be any solution of (2.3.12). Because of the initial condition y(0) = -1 and the continuity
of y, there's an open interval I that contains x0 = 0 on which y has no zeros, and is consequently of the
form (2.3.11). Setting x = 0 and y = -1 in (2.3.11) yields c = -1, so

                                             y = (x2 - 1)5/3                         (2.3.13)

for x in I. Therefore every solution of (2.3.12) differs from zero and is given by (2.3.13) on (-1, 1);
that is, (2.3.13) is the unique solution of (2.3.12) on (-1, 1). This is the largest open interval on which
(2.3.12) has a unique solution. To see this, note that (2.3.13) is a solution of (2.3.12) on (-, ). From
60 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

Exercise 2.2.15, there are infinitely many other solutions of (2.3.12) that differ from (2.3.13) on every
open interval larger than (-1, 1). One such solution is

largest open interval on which it's unique.

Solution Let y be any solution of (2.3.14). Because of the initial condition y(0) = 1 and the continuity
of y, there's an open interval I that contains x0 = 0 on which y has no zeros, and is consequently of the
form (2.3.11). Setting x = 0 and y = 1 in (2.3.11) yields c = 1, so

                                    y = (x2 + 1)5/3              (2.3.15)

that is, (2.3.15) is the unique solution of (2.3.14) on (-, ). Figure 2.3.4 shows the graph of this
solution.

and x0 is in (a, b), then y  y0 is a solution of

      on (a, b).

2.4 TRANSFORMATION OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS INTO SEPARABLE EQUATIONS
In Section 2.1 we found that the solutions of a linear nonhomogeneous equation

                                                   y + p(x)y = f(x)
                        Section 2.4 Transformation of Nonlinear Equations into Separable Equations 63

are of the form y = uy1, where y1 is a nontrivial solution of the complementary equation

                             y + p(x)y = 0                                                (2.4.1)

and u is a solution of

                             u y1(x) = f(x).

Note that this last equation is separable, since it can be rewritten as

                                                       u = f(x) .
                                                              y1(x)

In this section we'll consider nonlinear differential equations that are not separable to begin with, but can
be solved in a similar fashion by writing their solutions in the form y = uy1, where y1 is a suitably chosen
known function and u satisfies a separable equation. We'llsay in this case that we transformed the given
equation into a separable equation.

Bernoulli Equations

A Bernoulli equation is an equation of the form

                             y + p(x)y = f(x)yr ,                                         (2.4.2)

where r can be any real number other than 0 or 1. (Note that (2.4.2) is linear if and only if r = 0 or
r = 1.) We can transform (2.4.2) into a separable equation by variation of parameters: if y1 is a nontrivial
solution of (2.4.1), substituting y = uy1 into (2.4.2) yields

                                       u y1 + u(y1 + p(x)y1) = f(x)(uy1)r,

which is equivalent to the separable equation

                          u y1(x) = f(x) (y1(x))r ur or     ur u = f(x) (y1(x))r-1 ,
since y1 + p(x)y1 = 0.

Example 2.4.1 Solve the Bernoulli equation

                                               y - y = xy2.                               (2.4.3)

Solution Since y1 = ex is a solution of y - y = 0, we look for solutions of (2.4.3) in the form y = uex,

where
                                 u ex = xu2e2x or, equivalently, u = xu2ex.

Separating variables yields                    u2 u = xex,
and integrating yields
Hence,                       - 1 = (x - 1)ex + c.

Other Nonlinear Equations That Can be Transformed Into Separable Equations

We've seen that the nonlinear Bernoulli equation can be transformed into a separable equation by the

substitution y = uy1 if y1 is suitably chosen. Now let's discover a sufficient condition for a nonlinear

first order differential equation

                                                 y = f(x, y)                                   (2.4.4)

to be transformable into a separable equation in the same way. Substituting y = uy1 into (2.4.4) yields

                                       u y1(x) + uy1(x) = f(x, uy1(x)),

which is equivalent to

                                       u y1(x) = f(x, uy1(x)) - uy1(x).                        (2.4.5)

If
                                               f(x, uy1(x)) = q(u)y1(x)

for some function q, then (2.4.5) becomes

                                       u y1(x) = (q(u) - u)y1(x),                              (2.4.6)

which is separable. After checking for constant solutions u  u0 such that q(u0) = u0, we can separate

variables to obtain                            u = y1(x) .
                                           q(u) - u y1(x)

Homogeneous Nonlinear Equations

In the text we'll consider only the most widely studied class of equations for which the method of the
preceding paragraph works. Other types of equations appear in Exercises 44-51.

   The differential equation (2.4.4) is said to be homogeneous if x and y occur in f in such a way that
f(x, y) depends only on the ratio y/x; that is, (2.4.4) can be written as

                                      y = q(y/x),                         (2.4.7)

where q = q(u) is a function of a single variable. For example,

                               y = y + xe-y/x = y + e-y/x
                                         x     x

and                            y=  y2 + xy - x2 y 2 y
are of the form (2.4.7), with               =        + -1
                                   x  2        x                 x

                               q(u) = u + e-u and q(u) = u2 + u - 1,

respectively. The general method discussed above can be applied to (2.4.7) with y1 = x (and therefore
y1 = 1). Thus, substituting y = ux in (2.4.7) yields

                                   u x + u = q(u),

and separation of variables (after checking for constant solutions u  u0 such that q(u0) = u0) yields

                                       u = 1.
                                   q(u) - u x

   Before turning to examples, we point out something that you may've have already noticed: the defini-
tion of homogeneous equation given here isn't the same as the definition given in Section 2.1, where we
said that a linear equation of the form

                                                     y + p(x)y = 0

is homogeneous. We make no apology for this inconsistency, since we didn't create it historically, homo-
geneous has been used in these two inconsistent ways. The one having to do with linear equations is the
most important. This is the only section of the book where the meaning defined here will apply.

   Since y/x is in general undefined if x = 0, we'll consider solutions of nonhomogeneous equations
only on open intervals that do not contain the point x = 0.

Example 2.4.2 Solve

                                   y = y + xe-y/x .                       (2.4.8)
                                                x

Solution Substituting y = ux into (2.4.8) yields
                                       u x + u = ux + xe-ux/x = u + e-u.
                                                             x

Simplifying and separating variables yields
                                                        euu = 1 .
                                                                  x
66 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

Integrating yields eu = ln |x| + c. Therefore u = ln(ln |x| + c) and y = ux = x ln(ln |x| + c).

                                        x2y = y2 + xy - x2.                                                   (2.4.9)
                                                                                                             (2.4.10)
(b) Solve the initial value problem

                                     x2y = y2 + xy - x2, y(1) = 2.

SOLUTION(a) We first find solutions of (2.4.9) on open intervals that don't contain x = 0. We can

rewrite (2.4.9) as                          y2 + xy - x2

                                        y=              x  2

for x in any such interval. Substituting y = ux yields

                                     (ux)2 + x(ux) - x2 2
                       u x+u =                                   = u + u - 1,
                                            x    2

so

                                        u x = u2 - 1.                                                        (2.4.11)
                     Section 2.4 Transformation of Nonlinear Equations into Separable Equations 67

By inspection this equation has the constant solutions u  1 and u  -1. Therefore y = x and y = -x

are solutions of (2.4.9). If u is a solution of (2.4.11) that doesn't assume the values 1 on some interval,

separating variables yields

                                                   u = 1,
                                                 u2 - 1 x

or, after a partial fraction expansion,

Multiplying by 2 and integrating yields

                                              ln u - 1 = 2 ln |x| + k,
                                                  u+1

or
                                                      u - 1 = ekx2,
                                                      u+1

which holds if                                   u - 1 = cx2

where c is an arbitrary constant. Solving for u yields

Figure 2.4.3 A direction field and integral curves for           Figure 2.4.4 Solutions of x2y = y2 + xy - x2,

Therefore                                                 x(1 + cx2)

                                              y = ux =    1 - cx  2                (2.4.13)

is a solution of (2.4.10) for any choice of the constant c. Setting c = 0 in (2.4.13) yields the solution

y = x. However, the solution y = -x can't be obtained from (2.4.13). Thus, the solutions of (2.4.9) on

intervals that don't contain x = 0 are y = -x and functions of the form (2.4.13).
68 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

   The situation is more complicated if x = 0 is the open interval. First, note that y = -x satisfies (2.4.9)
on (-, ). If c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants, the function

                                           x(1 + c1x2) ,  a < x < 0,               (2.4.14)
                                             1 - c1x2     0  x < b,
                                 
                                           x(1 + c2x2) ,
                            y=               1 - c2x2

                                 
                                 

is a solution of (2.4.9) on (a, b), where

a=   1                      c1      if c1 > 0,  and b =        1  c2   if c2 > 0,
        -                           if c1  0,                     

     -                                                          if c2  0.

We leave it to you to verify this. To do so, note that if y is any function of the form (2.4.13) then y(0) = 0
and y (0) = 1.

   Figure 2.4.3 shows a direction field and some integral curves for (2.4.9).

SOLUTION(b) We could obtain c by imposing the initial condition y(1) = 2 in (2.4.13), and then solving
for c. However, it's easier to use (2.4.12). Since u = y/x, the initial condition y(1) = 2 implies that
u(1) = 2. Substituting this into (2.4.12) yields c = 1/3. Hence, the solution of (2.4.10) is

                                           y=   x(1 + x2/3)
                                                          2.
                                                1 - x /3

                                                       
The interval of validity of this solution is (- 3, 3). However, the largest interval on which (2.4.10)
has a unique solution is (0, 3). To see this, note from (2.4.14) that any function of the form

                                           x(1 + cx2) ,   a < x  0,                (2.4.15)
                                             1 - cx2                 
                                 
                                           x(1 + x2/3) ,  0  x < 3,
                            y=               1 - x2/3

                                 
                                 

is a solution of (2.4.10) on (a, 3), where a = -1/c if c > 0 or a = - if c  0. (Why doesn't this

contradict Theorem 2.3.1?)

   Figure 2.4.4 shows several solutions of the initial value problem (2.4.10). Note that these solutions
coincide on (0, 3).

In the last two examples we were able to solve the given equations explicitly. However, this isn't always

possible, as you'll see in the exercises.

 14. You may have noticed that the logistic equation

                                     P = aP (1 - P )

from Verhulst's model for population growth can be written in Bernoulli form as
                                              P - aP = -aP 2.

This isn't particularly interesting, since the logistic equation is separable, and therefore solvable

by the method studied in Section 2.2. So let's consider a more complicated model, where a is

a positive constant and  is a positive continuous function of t on [0, ). The equation for this

model is

                                     P - aP = -a(t)P 2,

a non-separable Bernoulli equation.

(a) Assuming that P (0) = P0 > 0, find P for t > 0. HINT: Express your result in terms of the
      integral t0 ( )ea d .

(b) Verify that your result reduces to the known results for the Malthusian model where  = 0,

      and the Verhulst model where  is a nonzero constant.

(c) Assuming that

                                                      t
                                     lim e-at ( )ea d = L

exists (finite or infinite), find limt P (t).

2.5 EXACT EQUATIONS

In this section it's convenient to write first order differential equations in the form

                                     M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0.                           (2.5.1)

This equation can be interpreted as

                                              M (x, y) + N (x, y) dy = 0,                     (2.5.2)
                                                                      dx

where x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable, or as

                                     M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) = 0,                              (2.5.3)
                                                dy

where y is the independent variable and x is the dependent variable. Since the solutions of (2.5.2) and
(2.5.3) will often have to be left in implicit, form we'll say that F (x, y) = c is an implicit solution of
(2.5.1) if every differentiable function y = y(x) that satisfies F (x, y) = c is a solution of (2.5.2) and
every differentiable function x = x(y) that satisfies F (x, y) = c is a solution of (2.5.3).

   Here are some examples:

Equation (2.5.1)                     Equation (2.5.2)                       Equation (2.5.3)

   3x2y2 dx + 2x3y dy = 0               3x2y2 + 2x3y dy = 0             3x2y2 dx + 2x3y = 0
  (x2 + y2) dx + 2xy dy = 0                                dx                    dy
3y sin x dx - 2xy cos x dy = 0
                                       (x2 + y2) + 2xy dy = 0          (x2 + y2) dx + 2xy = 0
                                                            dx                      dy

                                     3y sin x - 2xy cos x dy = 0     3y sin x dx - 2xy cos x = 0
                                                              dx               dy

Note that a separable equation can be written as (2.5.1) as

                                               M (x) dx + N (y) dy = 0.

   We'll develop a method for solving (2.5.1) under appropriate assumptions on M and N . This method
is an extension of the method of separation of variables (Exercise 41). Before stating it we consider an
example.
74 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

Example 2.5.1 Show that

                                    x4y3 + x2y5 + 2xy = c                                             (2.5.4)
                                                                                                      (2.5.5)
is an implicit solution of

(4x3y3 + 2xy5 + 2y) dx + (3x4y2 + 5x2y4 + 2x) dy = 0.

Solution Regarding y as a function of x and differentiating (2.5.4) implicitly with respect to x yields

                            (4x3y3 + 2xy5 + 2y) + (3x4y2 + 5x2y4 + 2x) dy = 0.
                                                                                        dx

Similarly, regarding x as a function of y and differentiating (2.5.4) implicitly with respect to y yields

                            (4x3y3 + 2xy5 + 2y) dx + (3x4y2 + 5x2y4 + 2x) = 0.
                                                       dy

Therefore (2.5.4) is an implicit solution of (2.5.5) in either of its two possible interpretations.
   You may think this example is pointless, since concocting a differential equation that has a given

implicit solution isn't particularly interesting. However, it illustrates the next important theorem, which
we'll prove by using implicit differentiation, as in Example 2.5.1.

Theorem 2.5.1 If F = F (x, y) has continuous partial derivatives Fx and Fy, then

                            F (x, y) = c (c=constant),                                                (2.5.6)

is an implicit solution of the differential equation

                            Fx(x, y) dx + Fy(x, y) dy = 0.                                            (2.5.7)

Proof Regarding y as a function of x and differentiating (2.5.6) implicitly with respect to x yields

                                    Fx(x, y) + Fy(x, y) dy = 0.
                                                             dx

On the other hand, regarding x as a function of y and differentiating (2.5.6) implicitly with respect to y

yields
                                             Fx(x, y) dx + Fy(x, y) = 0.
                                                         dy

Thus, (2.5.6) is an implicit solution of (2.5.7) in either of its two possible interpretations.       (2.5.8)
   We'll say that the equation
                                            M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0

is exact on an an open rectangle R if there's a function F = F (x, y) such Fx and Fy are continuous, and

                            Fx(x, y) = M (x, y) and Fy(x, y) = N (x, y)                               (2.5.9)

for all (x, y) in R. This usage of "exact" is related to its usage in calculus, where the expression

                                    Fx(x, y) dx + Fy(x, y) dy

(obtained by substituting (2.5.9) into the left side of (2.5.8)) is the exact differential of F .
   Example 2.5.1 shows that it's easy to solve (2.5.8) if it's exact and we know a function F that satisfies

(2.5.9). The important questions are:
                                                                       Section 2.5 Exact Equations 75

QUESTION 1. Given an equation (2.5.8), how can we determine whether it's exact?

QUESTION 2. If (2.5.8) is exact, how do we find a function F satisfying (2.5.9)?

To discover the answer to Question 1, assume that there's a function F that satisfies (2.5.9) on some

open rectangle R, and in addition that F has continuous mixed partial derivatives Fxy and Fyx. Then a

theorem from calculus implies that

                                     Fxy = Fyx.                                   (2.5.10)

If Fx = M and Fy = N , differentiating the first of these equations with respect to y and the second with

respect to x yields

                                     Fxy = My and Fyx = Nx.                       (2.5.11)

From (2.5.10) and (2.5.11), we conclude that a necessary condition for exactness is that My = Nx. This
motivates the next theorem, which we state without proof.

Theorem 2.5.2 [The Exactness Condition] Suppose M and N are continuous and have continuous par-
tial derivatives My and Nx on an open rectangle R. Then

                                     M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0

is exact on R if and only if         My(x, y) = Nx(x, y)                          (2.5.12)
for all (x, y) in R..

   To help you remember the exactness condition, observe that the coefficients of dx and dy are differ-
entiated in (2.5.12) with respect to the "opposite" variables; that is, the coefficient of dx is differentiated
with respect to y, while the coefficient of dy is differentiated with respect to x.

Example 2.5.2 Show that the equation
                                                 3x2y dx + 4x3 dy = 0

is not exact on any open rectangle.

Solution Here

                              M (x, y) = 3x2y and N (x, y) = 4x3

so
                                    My(x, y) = 3x2 and Nx(x, y) = 12x2.

Therefore My = Nx on the line x = 0, but not on any open rectangle, so there's no function F such that
Fx(x, y) = M (x, y) and Fy(x, y) = N (x, y) for all (x, y) on any open rectangle.

   The next example illustrates two possible methods for finding a function F that satisfies the condition

Fx = M and Fy = N if M dx + N dy = 0 is exact.

Example 2.5.3 Solve

                              (4x3y3 + 3x2) dx + (3x4y2 + 6y2) dy = 0.            (2.5.13)

Solution (Method 1) Here                               N (x, y) = 3x4y2 + 6y2,
                              M (x, y) = 4x3y3 + 3x2,
76 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

and
                                           My (x, y) = Nx(x, y) = 12x3y2

for all (x, y). Therefore Theorem 2.5.2 implies that there's a function F such that

                                Fx(x, y) = M (x, y) = 4x3y3 + 3x2                     (2.5.14)

and                                                                                   (2.5.15)
                                         Fy(x, y) = N (x, y) = 3x4y2 + 6y2            (2.5.16)

for all (x, y). To find F , we integrate (2.5.14) with respect to x to obtain

                                             F (x, y) = x4y3 + x3 + (y),

where (y) is the "constant" of integration. (Here  is "constant" in that it's independent of x, the variable
of integration.) If  is any differentiable function of y then F satisfies (2.5.14). To determine  so that F
also satisfies (2.5.15), assume that  is differentiable and differentiate F with respect to y. This yields

                                              Fy(x, y) = 3x4y2 +  (y).

Comparing this with (2.5.15) shows that

                                          (y) = 6y2.

We integrate this with respect to y and take the constant of integration to be zero because we're interested
only in finding some F that satisfies (2.5.14) and (2.5.15). This yields

                                         (y) = 2y3.

Substituting this into (2.5.16) yields

                                        F (x, y) = x4y3 + x3 + 2y3.                   (2.5.17)

Now Theorem 2.5.1 implies that

                                         x4y3 + x3 + 2y3 = c

is an implicit solution of (2.5.13). Solving this for y yields the explicit solution

                                                 c - x3 1/3
                                         y = 2 + x4 .

Solution (Method 2) Instead of first integrating (2.5.14) with respect to x, we could begin by integrating
(2.5.15) with respect to y to obtain

                                        F (x, y) = x4y3 + 2y3 + (x),                  (2.5.18)

where  is an arbitrary function of x. To determine , we assume that  is differentiable and differentiate

F with respect to x, which yields
                                              Fx(x, y) = 4x3y3 +  (x).

Comparing this with (2.5.14) shows that

                                          (x) = 3x2.

Integrating this and again taking the constant of integration to be zero yields

                                         (x) = x3.

Figure 2.5.1 A direction field and integral curves for (4x3y3 + 3x2) dx + (3x4y2 + 6y2) dy = 0

Substituting this into (2.5.18) yields (2.5.17).
   Figure 2.5.1 shows a direction field and some integral curves of (2.5.13),
   Here's a summary of the procedure used in Method 1 of this example. You should summarize procedure

used in Method 2.

                                    Procedure For Solving An Exact Equation

Step 1. Check that the equation

                                         M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0                    (2.5.19)
                                                                                          (2.5.20)
satisfies the exactness condition My = Nx. If not, don't go further with this procedure.

Step 2. Integrate                           F (x, y) = M (x, y)
      with respect to x to obtain               x

                                         F (x, y) = G(x, y) + (y),

where G is an antiderivative of M with respect to x, and  is an unknown function of y.

Step 3. Differentiate (2.5.20) with respect to y to obtain

                                         F (x, y) = G(x, y) +  (y).
                                         y        y

Step 4. Equate the right side of this equation to N and solve for  ; thus,

      G(x, y) +  (y) = N (x, y), so  (y) = N (x, y) - G(x, y) .
            y                                                                    y
78 Chapter 2 First Order Equations

Step 5. Integrate  with respect to y, taking the constant of integration to be zero, and substitute the
      result in (2.5.20) to obtain F (x, y).

Step 6. Set F (x, y) = c to obtain an implicit solution of (2.5.19). If possible, solve for y explicitly as a
      function of x.

   It's a common mistake to omit Step 6. However, it's important to include this step, since F isn't itself
a solution of (2.5.19).

   Many equations can be conveniently solved by either of the two methods used in Example 2.5.3. How-
ever, sometimes the integration required in one approach is more difficult than in the other. In such cases
we choose the approach that requires the easier integration.

Example 2.5.4 Solve the equation                                                   (2.5.21)
                                (yexy tan x + exy sec2 x) dx + xexy tan x dy = 0.

Solution We leave it to you to check that My = Nx on any open rectangle where tan x and sec x are
defined. Here we must find a function F such that

                                      Fx(x, y) = yexy tan x + exy sec2 x           (2.5.22)

and

                                      Fy(x, y) = xexy tan x.                       (2.5.23)

It's difficult to integrate (2.5.22) with respect to x, but easy to integrate (2.5.23) with respect to y. This

yields

                                      F (x, y) = exy tan x + (x).                  (2.5.24)

Differentiating this with respect to x yields

              Fx(x, y) = yexy tan x + exy sec2 x +  (x).

Comparing this with (2.5.22) shows that  (x) = 0. Hence,  is a constant, which we can take to be zero

in (2.5.24), and
                                                       exy tan x = c

is an implicit solution of (2.5.21).

Attempting to apply our procedure to an equation that isn't exact will lead to failure in Step 4, since

the function                                   N - G
                                                      y

won't be independent of x if My = Nx (Exercise 31), and therefore can't be the derivative of a function
of y alone. Here's an example that illustrates this.

Example 2.5.5 Verify that the equation                                             (2.5.25)
                                                3x2y2 dx + 6x3y dy = 0

is not exact, and show that the procedure for solving exact equations fails when applied to (2.5.25).

Solution Here

                  My(x, y) = 6x2y and Nx(x, y) = 18x2y,

so (2.5.25) isn't exact. Nevertheless, let's try to find a function F such that

                                     Fx(x, y) = 3x2y2                                     (2.5.26)
                                                                                          (2.5.27)
and
                                                    Fy(x, y) = 6x3y.

Integrating (2.5.26) with respect to x yields

                                                F (x, y) = x3y2 + (y),

and differentiating this with respect to y yields
                                               Fy(x, y) = 2x3y +  (y).

For this equation to be consistent with (2.5.27),
                                                 6x3y = 2x3y +  (y),

or
                                                       (y) = 4x3y.

This is a contradiction, since  must be independent of x. Therefore the procedure fails.

2.6 INTEGRATING FACTORS

In Section 2.5 we saw that if M , N , My and Nx are continuous and My = Nx on an open rectangle R

then

                               M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0                (2.6.1)

is exact on R. Sometimes an equation that isn't exact can be made exact by multiplying it by an appro-

priate function. For example,

                               (3x + 2y2) dx + 2xy dy = 0                   (2.6.2)

is not exact, since My(x, y) = 4y = Nx(x, y) = 2y in (2.6.2). However, multiplying (2.6.2) by x yields

                               (3x2 + 2xy2) dx + 2x2y dy = 0,               (2.6.3)

which is exact, since My(x, y) = Nx(x, y) = 4xy in (2.6.3). Solving (2.6.3) by the procedure given in
Section 2.5 yields the implicit solution

                                                     x3 + x2y2 = c.

   A function  = (x, y) is an integrating factor for (2.6.1) if

                               (x, y)M (x, y) dx + (x, y)N (x, y) dy = 0  (2.6.4)

is exact. If we know an integrating factor  for (2.6.1), we can solve the exact equation (2.6.4) by the
method of Section 2.5. It would be nice if we could say that (2.6.1) and (2.6.4) always have the same
solutions, but this isn't so. For example, a solution y = y(x) of (2.6.4) such that (x, y(x)) = 0 on
some interval a < x < b could fail to be a solution of (2.6.1) (Exercise 1), while (2.6.1) may have a
solution y = y(x) such that (x, y(x)) isn't even defined (Exercise 2). Similar comments apply if y is
the independent variable and x is the dependent variable in (2.6.1) and (2.6.4). However, if (x, y) is
defined and nonzero for all (x, y), (2.6.1) and (2.6.4) are equivalent; that is, they have the same solutions.

Finding Integrating Factors

By applying Theorem 2.5.2 (with M and N replaced by 킡 and 킢 ), we see that (2.6.4) is exact on an
open rectangle R if 킡 , 킢 , (킡 )y, and (킢 )x are continuous and

       (킡 ) =  (킢 ) or, equivalently,            탙M + 킡y = 탘N + 킢x
      y                 x

on R. It's better to rewrite the last equation as

                               (My - Nx) = 탘N - 탙M,                      (2.6.5)

which reduces to the known result for exact equations; that is, if My = Nx then (2.6.5) holds with  = 1,
so (2.6.1) is exact.

   You may think (2.6.5) is of little value, since it involves partial derivatives of the unknown integrating
factor , and we haven't studied methods for solving such equations. However, we'll now show that
(2.6.5) is useful if we restrict our search to integrating factors that are products of a function of x and a
84 Chapter 2 Integrating Factors

function of y; that is, (x, y) = P (x)Q(y). We're not saying that every equation M dx + N dy = 0
has an integrating factor of this form; rather, we're saying that some equations have such integrating
factors.We'llnow develop a way to determine whether a given equation has such an integrating factor,
and a method for finding the integrating factor in this case.

   If (x, y) = P (x)Q(y), then 탘(x, y) = P (x)Q(y) and 탙(x, y) = P (x)Q (y), so (2.6.5) becomes

                       P (x)Q(y)(My - Nx) = P (x)Q(y)N - P (x)Q (y)M,            (2.6.6)

or, after dividing through by P (x)Q(y),

                                  My - Nx = P (x) N - Q (y) M.                   (2.6.7)
                                                 P (x)     Q(y)

Now let                       p(x) = P (x) and q(y) = Q (y) ,

                                          P (x)                     Q(y)

so (2.6.7) becomes

                                  My - Nx = p(x)N - q(y)M.                       (2.6.8)

We obtained (2.6.8) by assuming that M dx+N dy = 0 has an integrating factor (x, y) = P (x)Q(y).

However, we can now view (2.6.7) differently: If there are functions p = p(x) and q = q(y) that satisfy

(2.6.8) and we define

                       P (x) = 켩 p(x) dx and Q(y) = 켩 q(y) dy ,                (2.6.9)

then reversing the steps that led from (2.6.6) to (2.6.8) shows that (x, y) = P (x)Q(y) is an integrating
factor for M dx + N dy = 0. In using this result, we take the constants of integration in (2.6.9) to be zero
and choose the signs conveniently so the integrating factor has the simplest form.

   There's no simple general method for ascertaining whether functions p = p(x) and q = q(y) satisfying
(2.6.8) exist. However, the next theorem gives simple sufficient conditions for the given equation to have
an integrating factor that depends on only one of the independent variables x and y, and for finding an
integrating factor in this case.

Theorem 2.6.1 Let M, N, My , and Nx be continuous on an open rectangle R. Then:
(a) If (My - Nx)/N is independent of y on R and we define

                                          p(x) = My - Nx
                                                        N

then                                                                             (2.6.10)
                                                (x) = 켩 p(x) dx                (2.6.11)

is an integrating factor for                                                     (2.6.12)

                                  M (x, y) dx + N (x, y) dy = 0

      on R.
(b) If (Nx - My)/M is independent of x on R and we define

                                          q(y) = Nx - My ,

then                                                       q(y) dy

is an integrating factor for (2.6.11) on R.
                                                                           Section 2.6 Exact Equations 85

Proof (a) If (My - Nx)/N is independent of y, then (2.6.8) holds with p = (My - Nx)/N and q  0.
Therefore

                        P (x) = 켩 p(x) dx and Q(y) = 켩 q(y) dy = 켩0 = 1,

so (2.6.10) is an integrating factor for (2.6.11) on R.
   (b) If (Nx - My )/M is independent of x then eqrefeq:2.6.8 holds with p  0 and q = (Nx - My )/M ,

and a similar argument shows that (2.6.12) is an integrating factor for (2.6.11) on R.
   The next two examples show how to apply Theorem 2.6.1.

Example 2.6.1 Find an integrating factor for the equation                                  (2.6.13)
                            (2xy3 - 2x3y3 - 4xy2 + 2x) dx + (3x2y2 + 4y) dy = 0

and solve the equation.

Solution In (2.6.13)

                         M = 2xy3 - 2x3y3 - 4xy2 + 2x, N = 3x2y2 + 4y,

and
                        My - Nx = (6xy2 - 6x3y2 - 8xy) - 6xy2 = -6x3y2 - 8xy,

so (2.6.13) isn't exact. However,

                                   My - Nx     6x3y2 + 8xy
                                               =- 2 2        = -2x
                                   N           3x y + 4y

is independent of y, so Theorem 2.6.1(a) applies with p(x) = -2x. Since

                                   p(x) dx = - 2x dx = -x2,

(x) = e-x2 is an integrating factor. Multiplying (2.6.13) by  yields the exact equation

e-x2 (2xy3 - 2x3y3 - 4xy2 + 2x) dx + e-x2 (3x2y2 + 4y) dy = 0.                             (2.6.14)

To solve this equation, we must find a function F such that

                         Fx(x, y) = e-x2 (2xy3 - 2x3y3 - 4xy2 + 2x)                        (2.6.15)

and                                                                                        (2.6.16)
                                            Fy(x, y) = e-x2 (3x2y2 + 4y).

Integrating (2.6.16) with respect to y yields

                                   F (x, y) = e-x2 (x2y3 + 2y2) + (x).                     (2.6.17)

Differentiating this with respect to x yields

                         Fx(x, y) = e-x2 (2xy3 - 2x3y3 - 4xy2) +  (x).

Comparing this with (2.6.15) shows that  (x) = 2xe-x2; therefore, we can let (x) = -e-x2 in
(2.6.17) and conclude that

                                             e-x2 y2(x2y + 2) - 1 = c

is an implicit solution of (2.6.14). It is also an implicit solution of (2.6.13).

                                       2xy3 dx + (3x2y2 + x2y3 + 1) dy = 0

and solve the equation.

Solution In (2.6.18),

                             M = 2xy3, N = 3x2y2 + x2y3 + 1,

and
                                  My - Nx = 6xy2 - (6xy2 + 2xy3) = -2xy3,

so (2.6.18) isn't exact. Moreover,

                                  My - Nx                                                             2xy3
                                  N = - 3x2y2 + x2y2 + 1

is not independent of y, so Theorem 2.6.1(a) does not apply. However, Theorem 2.6.1(b) does apply,

since                             Nx - My 2xy3
                                               = 3 =1

is independent of x, so we can take q(y) = 1. Since

                                                                                                 Section 2.6 Exact Equations 87

(y) = ey is an integrating factor. Multiplying (2.6.18) by  yields the exact equation

        2xy3ey dx + (3x2y2 + x2y3 + 1)ey dy = 0.                                                          (2.6.19)

To solve this equation, we must find a function F such that

            Fx(x, y) = 2xy3ey                                                                             (2.6.20)

and                                                                                                       (2.6.21)
                                         Fy(x, y) = (3x2y2 + x2y3 + 1)ey.

Integrating (2.6.20) with respect to x yields

            F (x, y) = x2y3ey + (y).                                                                      (2.6.22)

Differentiating this with respect to y yields

            Fy = (3x2y2 + x2y3)ey +  (y),

and comparing this with (2.6.21) shows that  (y) = ey. Therefore we set (y) = ey in (2.6.22) and
conclude that

Figure 2.6.2 A direction field and integral curves for 2xy3ey dx + (3x2y2 + x2y3 + 1)ey dy = 0

   Theorem 2.6.1 does not apply in the next example, but the more general argument that led to Theo-
rem 2.6.1 provides an integrating factor.
88 Chapter 2 Integrating Factors                                                              (2.6.23)

Example 2.6.3 Find an integrating factor for
                                       (3xy + 6y2) dx + (2x2 + 9xy) dy = 0

and solve the equation.

Solution In (2.6.23)

                             M = 3xy + 6y2, N = 2x2 + 9xy,

and
                                My - Nx = (3x + 12y) - (4x + 9y) = -x + 3y.

Therefore             My - Nx M = 3xy + 6y2 -x + 3y and Nx - My N = 2x2 x - 3y + 9xy ,

so Theorem 2.6.1 does not apply. Following the more general argument that led to Theorem 2.6.1, we
look for functions p = p(x) and q = q(y) such that

                             My - Nx = p(x)N - q(y)M ;

that is,

                             -x + 3y = p(x)(2x2 + 9xy) - q(y)(3xy + 6y2).

Since the left side contains only first degree terms in x and y, we rewrite this equation as

                             xp(x)(2x + 9y) - yq(y)(3x + 6y) = -x + 3y.

This will be an identity if

                             xp(x) = A and yq(y) = B,                                         (2.6.24)

where A and B are constants such that

                             -x + 3y = A(2x + 9y) - B(3x + 6y),

or, equivalently,

                             -x + 3y = (2A - 3B)x + (9A - 6B)y.

Equating the coefficients of x and y on both sides shows that the last equation holds for all (x, y) if

                                       2A - 3B = -1
                                       9A - 6B = 3,

which has the solution A = 1, B = 1. Therefore (2.6.24) implies that

                             p(x) = 1 and q(y) = 1 .
                                       x             y

Since

                             p(x) dx = ln |x| and q(y) dy = ln |y|,

we can let P (x) = x and Q(y) = y; hence, (x, y) = xy is an integrating factor. Multiplying (2.6.23)
by  yields the exact equation

                                  (3x2y2 + 6xy3) dx + (2x3y + 9x2y2) dy = 0.

Figure 2.6.3 A direction field and integral curves for (3xy + 6y2) dx + (2x2 + 9xy) dy = 0

We leave it to you to use the method of Section 2.5 to show that this equation has the implicit solution

                                        x3y2 + 3x2y3 = c.                                                             (2.6.25)

This is also an implicit solution of (2.6.23). Since x  0 and y  0 satisfy (2.6.25), you should check to
see that x  0 and y  0 are also solutions of (2.6.23). (Why is it necesary to check this?)

   Figure 2.6.3 shows a direction field and integral curves for (2.6.23).
   See Exercise 28 for a general discussion of equations like (2.6.23).

Example 2.6.4 The separable equation                                                                                  (2.6.26)
                                               - y dx + (x + x6) dy = 0

can be converted to the exact equation

                                        -   dx dy
                                                  6+ =0                                                               (2.6.27)
                                            x+x y

by multiplying through by the integrating factor

                                        (x, y) =                                              1
                                                                                                   6.
                                                   y(x + x )

However, to solve (2.6.27) by the method of Section 2.5 we would have to evaluate the nasty integral

                                                    dx .
                                                  x + x6

Instead, we solve (2.6.26) explicitly for y by finding an integrating factor of the form (x, y) = xayb.

          Figure 2.6.4 A direction field and integral curves for -y dx + (x + x6) dy = 0

Solution In (2.6.26)

                                        M = -y, N = x + x6,

and
                                    My - Nx = -1 - (1 + 6x5) = -2 - 6x5.

We look for functions p = p(x) and q = q(y) such that

                                  My - Nx = p(x)N - q(y)M ;

that is,

                            - 2 - 6x5 = p(x)(x + x6) + q(y)y.                                                                             (2.6.28)

The right side will contain the term -6x5 if p(x) = -6/x. Then (2.6.28) becomes

                                  -2 - 6x5 = -6 - 6x5 + q(y)y,

so q(y) = 4/y. Since

and
                                          q(y) dy = 4 dy = 4 ln |y| = ln y4,
                                                           y

we can take P (x) = x-6 and Q(y) = y4, which yields the integrating factor (x, y) = x-6y4. Multi-
plying (2.6.26) by  yields the exact equation

We leave it to you to use the method of the Section 2.5 to show that this equation has the implicit solution

Solving for y yields          y 5 + y5 = k.

                        y = k1/5x(1 + x5)-1/5,

which we rewrite as

                        y = cx(1 + x5)-1/5

by renaming the arbitrary constant. This is also a solution of (2.6.26).

where y1 is any nontrivial solution of the complementary equation y + p(x)y = 0. In this exercise

                                                ((x)y) = (x)f(x).

    Then integrate both sides of this equation and solve for y to show that the general solution of

    (A) is

                    y = 1 c+   f(x)(x) dx .
                         (x)

    Why is this form of the general solution equivalent to (B)?

3.1 EULER'S METHOD

If an initial value problem

                                y = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0                                      (3.1.1)

can't be solved analytically, it's necessary to resort to numerical methods to obtain useful approximations
to a solution of (3.1.1). We'll consider such methods in this chapter.

   We're interested in computing approximate values of the solution of (3.1.1) at equally spaced points
x0, x1, . . . , xn = b in an interval [x0, b]. Thus,

                                xi = x0 + ih, i = 0, 1, . . . , n,

where                                     h = b - x0 .
                                                   n

We'll denote the approximate values of the solution at these points by y0, y1, . . . , yn; thus, yi is an
approximation to y(xi). We'll call

                                                     ei = y(xi) - yi

the error at the ith step. Because of the initial condition y(x0) = y0, we'll always have e0 = 0. However,
in general ei = 0 if i > 0.

   We encounter two sources of error in applying a numerical method to solve an initial value problem:

 The formulas defining the method are based on some sort of approximation. Errors due to the
  inaccuracy of the approximation are called truncation errors.

 Computers do arithmetic with a fixed number of digits, and therefore make errors in evaluating
  the formulas defining the numerical methods. Errors due to the computer's inability to do exact
  arithmetic are called roundoff errors.

   Since a careful analysis of roundoff error is beyond the scope of this book, we'll consider only trunca-
tion errors.

Euler's Method

The simplest numerical method for solving (3.1.1) is Euler's method. This method is so crude that it is

seldom used in practice; however, its simplicity makes it useful for illustrative purposes.

Euler's method is based on the assumption that the tangent line to the integral curve of (3.1.1) at

(xi, y(xi)) approximates the integral curve over the interval [xi, xi+1]. Since the slope of the integral

curve of (3.1.1) at (xi, y(xi)) is y (xi) = f(xi, y(xi)), the equation of the tangent line to the integral

curve at (xi, y(xi)) is

                             y = y(xi) + f(xi, y(xi))(x - xi).                               (3.1.2)

Setting x = xi+1 = xi + h in (3.1.2) yields

                                yi+1 = y(xi) + hf(xi, y(xi))                                 (3.1.3)

as an approximation to y(xi+1). Since y(x0) = y0 is known, we can use (3.1.3) with i = 0 to compute

                                          y1 = y0 + hf(x0, y0).

However, setting i = 1 in (3.1.3) yields

                                y2 = y(x1) + hf(x1, y(x1)),
                                                                         Section 3.1 Euler's Method 97

which isn't useful, since we don't know y(x1). Therefore we replace y(x1) by its approximate value y1
and redefine

                                                 y2 = y1 + hf(x1, y1).

Having computed y2, we can compute

                                y3 = y2 + hf(x2, y2).

In general, Euler's method starts with the known value y(x0) = y0 and computes y1, y2, . . . , yn succes-
sively by with the formula

                                yi+1 = yi + hf(xi, yi), 0  i  n - 1.                   (3.1.4)

The next example illustrates the computational procedure indicated in Euler's method.

Example 3.1.1 Use Euler's method with h = 0.1 to find approximate values for the solution of the initial

value problem

                                y + 2y = x3e-2x, y(0) = 1                              (3.1.5)

at x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.

Solution We rewrite (3.1.5) as

                                y = -2y + x3e-2x, y(0) = 1,

which is of the form (3.1.1), with
                                  f(x, y) = -2y + x3e-2x, x0 = 0, and y0 = 1.

Euler's method yields

y1 = y0 + hf(x0, y0)
     = 1 + (.1)f(0, 1) = 1 + (.1)(-2) = .8,

y2 = y1 + hf(x1, y1)
     = .8 + (.1)f(.1, .8) = .8 + (.1) -2(.8) + (.1)3e-.2 = .640081873,

               y3 = y2 + hf(x2, y2)
                     = .640081873 + (.1) -2(.640081873) + (.2)3e-.4 = .512601754.

   We've written the details of these computations to ensure that you understand the procedure. However,
in the rest of the examples as well as the exercises in this chapter, we'll assume that you can use a
programmable calculator or a computer to carry out the necessary computations.

Examples Illustrating The Error in Euler's Method

Example 3.1.2 Use Euler's method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to find approxi-
mate values of the solution of the initial value problem

                                y + 2y = x3e-2x, y(0) = 1

at x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1.0. Compare these approximate values with the values of the exact solution

                                                   y = e (x -2x 4 + 4),                (3.1.6)

which can be obtained by the method of Section 2.1. (Verify.)

proximate values of the solution at these points obtained by Euler's method with step sizes h = 0.1,

umn corresponding to h = .05 are actually the results of 20 steps with Euler's method. We haven't listed
the estimates of the solution obtained for x = 0.05, 0.15, . . . , since there's nothing to compare them with
in the column corresponding to h = 0.1. Similarly, the approximate values in the column corresponding
to h = 0.025 are actually the results of 40 steps with Euler's method.

You can see from Table 3.1.1 that decreasing the step size improves the accuracy of Euler's method.

For example,

                                
                                 .0293 with h = 0.1,

                 yexact(1) - yapprox (1)  .0144 with h = 0.05,

                                 .0071 with h = 0.025.

Based on this scanty evidence, you might guess that the error in approximating the exact solution at a fixed
value of x by Euler's method is roughly halved when the step size is halved. You can find more evidence
to support this conjecture by examining Table 3.1.2, which lists the approximate values of yexact - yapprox at
x = 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.0.

Example 3.1.3 Tables 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 show analogous results for the nonlinear initial value problem

                          y = -2y2 + xy + x2, y(0) = 1,                (3.1.7)

except in this case we can't solve (3.1.7) exactly. The results in the "Exact" column were obtained by
using a more accurate numerical method known as the Runge-Kutta method with a small step size. They
are exact to eight decimal places.

   Since we think it's important in evaluating the accuracy of the numerical methods that we'll be studying
in this chapter, we often include a column listing values of the exact solution of the initial value problem,
even if the directions in the example or exercise don't specifically call for it. If quotation marks are
included in the heading, the values were obtained by applying the Runge-Kutta method in a way that's
explained in Section 3.3. If quotation marks are not included, the values were obtained from a known
formula for the solution. In either case, the values are exact to eight places to the right of the decimal
point.

Truncation Error in Euler's Method

Consistent with the results indicated in Tables 3.1.1-3.1.4, we'll now show that under reasonable as-
sumptions on f there's a constant K such that the error in approximating the solution of the initial value
problem

                                              y = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0,
at a given point b > x0 by Euler's method with step size h = (b - x0)/n satisfies the inequality

                                                   |y(b) - yn|  Kh,
100 Chapter 3 Numerical Methods

where K is a constant independent of n.
   There are two sources of error (not counting roundoff) in Euler's method:

1. The error committed in approximating the integral curve by the tangent line (3.1.2) over the interval
    [xi, xi+1].

2. The error committed in replacing y(xi) by yi in (3.1.2) and using (3.1.4) rather than (3.1.2) to
    compute yi+1.

   Euler's method assumes that yi+1 defined in (3.1.2) is an approximation to y(xi+1). We call the error
in this approximation the local truncation error at the ith step, and denote it by Ti; thus,

                    Ti = y(xi+1) - y(xi) - hf(xi, y(xi)).                       (3.1.8)

We'll now use Taylor's theorem to estimate Ti, assuming for simplicity that f, fx, and fy are continuous
and bounded for all (x, y). Then y exists and is bounded on [x0, b]. To see this, we differentiate

                                        y (x) = f(x, y(x))

to obtain

                    y (x) = fx(x, y(x)) + fy(x, y(x))y (x)
                              = fx(x, y(x)) + fy(x, y(x))f(x, y(x)).

Since we assumed that f, fx and fy are bounded, there's a constant M such that

                    |fx(x, y(x)) + fy(x, y(x))f(x, y(x))|  M, x0 < x < b,

which implies that

                                 |y (x)|  M,            x0 < x < b.             (3.1.9)

Since xi+1 = xi + h, Taylor's theorem implies that

                                                         h2
                    y(xi+1) = y(xi) + hy (xi) + y (x~i),

                                                          2

where x~i is some number between xi and xi+1. Since y (xi) = f(xi, y(xi)) this can be written as

                                                                h2
                    y(xi+1) = y(xi) + hf(xi, y(xi)) + y (x~i),

                                                                 2

or, equivalently,

                                                                h2
                    y(xi+1) - y(xi) - hf(xi, y(xi)) = y (x~i).

                                                                 2

Comparing this with (3.1.8) shows that

                                               h2
                                        Ti = y (x~i).

                                                2

Recalling (3.1.9), we can establish the bound

                                 |Ti|          M h2  ,  1  i  n.                (3.1.10)

                                               2

Although it may be difficult to determine the constant M , what is important is that there's an M such that
(3.1.10) holds. We say that the local truncation error of Euler's method is of order h2, which we write as
O(h2).
                                                                              Section 3.1 Euler's Method 101

   Note that the magnitude of the local truncation error in Euler's method is determined by the second
derivative y of the solution of the initial value problem. Therefore the local truncation error will be
larger where |y | is large, or smaller where |y | is small.

   Since the local truncation error for Euler's method is O(h2), it's reasonable to expect that halving h
reduces the local truncation error by a factor of 4. This is true, but halving the step size also requires twice

as many steps to approximate the solution at a given point. To analyze the overall effect of truncation
error in Euler's method, it's useful to derive an equation relating the errors

                                  ei+1 = y(xi+1) - yi+1 and ei = y(xi) - yi.

To this end, recall that

                                      y(xi+1) = y(xi) + hf(xi, y(xi)) + Ti                  (3.1.11)
                                                                                            (3.1.12)
and
                                                yi+1 = yi + hf(xi, yi).

Subtracting (3.1.12) from (3.1.11) yields

                                  ei+1 = ei + h [f(xi, y(xi)) - f(xi, yi)] + Ti.            (3.1.13)

The last term on the right is the local truncation error at the ith step. The other terms reflect the way errors
made at previous steps affect ei+1. Since |Ti|  M h2/2, we see from (3.1.13) that

                             |ei+1|  |ei| + h|f(xi, y(xi)) - f(xi, yi)| +       M h2  .     (3.1.14)

                                                                                2

Since we assumed that fy is continuous and bounded, the mean value theorem implies that

                f(xi, y(xi)) - f(xi, yi) = fy(xi, yi)(y(xi) - yi) = fy (xi, yi)ei,

where  y    is  between  yi  and  y(xi ).  Therefore

         i

                                           |f(xi, y(xi)) - f(xi, yi)|  R|ei|

for some constant R. From this and (3.1.14),

                             |ei+1|  (1 + Rh)|ei| +      M h2  ,   0  i  n - 1.             (3.1.15)

                                                         2

For convenience, let C = 1 + Rh. Since e0 = y(x0) - y0 = 0, applying (3.1.15) repeatedly yields

                                      M h2
                         |e1|

                                  ..

Recalling the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we see that

                             1 + C +    + Cn-1 = 1 - Cn = (1 + Rh)n - 1
                                                         1-C                Rh
102 Chapter 3 Numerical Methods

(since C = 1 + Rh). From this and (3.1.16),

                                   |y(b) - yn| = |en|   (1 + Rh)n - 1 M h  .              (3.1.17)

                                                        R         2

Since Taylor's theorem implies that

                                             1 + Rh < eRh

(verify),

               (1 + Rh)n < enRh = eR(b-x0) (since nh = b - x0).

This and (3.1.17) imply that

                                     |y(b) - yn|  Kh,                                     (3.1.18)

with                                 K = M eR(b-x0) - 1 .
                                                     2R

Because of (3.1.18) we say that the global truncation error of Euler's method is of order h, which we
write as O(h).

Semilinear Equations and Variation of Parameters

An equation that can be written in the form

                                     y + p(x)y = h(x, y)                                  (3.1.19)

with p  0 is said to be semilinear. (Of course, (3.1.19) is linear if h is independent of y.) One way to
apply Euler's method to an initial value problem

                                   y + p(x)y = h(x, y), y(x0) = y0                        (3.1.20)

for (3.1.19) is to think of it as

                                     y = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0,

where

                                     f(x, y) = -p(x)y + h(x, y).

However, we can also start by applying variation of parameters to (3.1.20), as in Sections 2.1 and 2.4;

thus, we write the solution of (3.1.20) as y = uy1, where y1 is a nontrivial solution of the complementary

equation y + p(x)y = 0. Then y = uy1 is a solution of (3.1.20) if and only if u is a solution of the initial

value problem

               u = h(x, uy1(x))/y1(x), u(x0) = y(x0)/y1(x0).                              (3.1.21)

We can apply Euler's method to obtain approximate values u0, u1, . . . , un of this initial value problem,
and then take

                                                      yi = uiy1(xi)

as approximate values of the solution of (3.1.20). We'll call this procedure the Euler semilinear method.
   The next two examples show that the Euler and Euler semilinear methods may yield drastically different

results.

                                     y - 2xy = 1, y(0) = 3                                (3.1.22)

sizes h = 0.2, h = 0.1, and h = 0.05 to find approximate values of the solution of (3.1.22) at x = 0, 0.2,
0.4, 0.6, . . . , 2.0 by (a) Euler's method; (b) the Euler semilinear method.

SOLUTION(a) Rewriting (3.1.22) as

                                   y = 1 + 2xy, y(0) = 3                        (3.1.24)

and applying Euler's method with f(x, y) = 1 + 2xy yields the results shown in Table 3.1.5. Because of
the large differences between the estimates obtained for the three values of h, it would be clear that these
results are useless even if the "exact" values were not included in the table.

   It's easy to see why Euler's method yields such poor results. Recall that the constant M in (3.1.10) -
which plays an important role in determining the local truncation error in Euler's method - must be an
upper bound for the values of the second derivative y of the solution of the initial value problem (3.1.22)
on (0, 2). The problem is that y assumes very large values on this interval. To see this, we differentiate
(3.1.24) to obtain

              y (x) = 2y(x) + 2xy (x) = 2y(x) + 2x(1 + 2xy(x)) = 2(1 + 2x2)y(x) + 2x,

where the second equality follows again from (3.1.24). Since (3.1.23) implies that y(x) > 3ex2 if x > 0,

                                       y (x) > 6(1 + 2x2)ex2 + 2x, x > 0.

For example, letting x = 2 shows that y (2) > 2952.

SOLUTION(b) Since y1 = ex2 is a solution of the complementary equation y - 2xy = 0, we can apply
the Euler semilinear method to (3.1.22), with

                                     y = uex2 and u = e-x2 , u(0) = 3.

The results listed in Table 3.1.6 are clearly better than those obtained by Euler's method.

   We can't give a general procedure for determining in advance whether Euler's method or the semilinear
Euler method will produce better results for a given semilinear initial value problem (3.1.19). As a rule of
thumb, the Euler semilinear method will yield better results than Euler's method if |u | is small on [x0, b],
while Euler's method yields better results if |u | is large on [x0, b]. In many cases the results obtained by
the two methods don't differ appreciably. However, we propose the an intuitive way to decide which is
the better method: Try both methods with multiple step sizes, as we did in Example 3.1.4, and accept the
results obtained by the method for which the approximations change less as the step size decreases.

Example 3.1.5 Applying Euler's method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to the initial

value problem                              x
                                              2 , y(1) = 7
                                 y - 2y =  1+y                                          (3.1.25)

on [1, 2] yields the results in Table 3.1.7. Applying the Euler semilinear method with

                  y = ue2x and   u=        xe-2x       u(1) = 7e-2
                                               2 4x ,
                                           1+u e

yields the results in Table 3.1.8. Since the latter are clearly less dependent on step size than the former,
we conclude that the Euler semilinear method is better than Euler's method for (3.1.25). This conclusion
is supported by comparing the approximate results obtained by the two methods with the "exact" values
of the solution.

Example 3.1.6 Applying Euler's method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to the initial

value problem

                              y + 3x2y = 1 + y2, y(2) = 2                               (3.1.26)

on [2, 3] yields the results in Table 3.1.9. Applying the Euler semilinear method with

                     y = ue-x3 and u = ex3 (1 + u2e-2x3 ), u(2) = 2e8

yields the results in Table 3.1.10. Noting the close agreement among the three columns of Table 3.1.9
(at least for larger values of x) and the lack of any such agreement among the columns of Table 3.1.10,
we conclude that Euler's method is better than the Euler semilinear method for (3.1.26). Comparing the
results with the exact values supports this conclusion.

   In the next two sections we'll study other numerical methods for solving initial value problems, called
the improved Euler method, the midpoint method, Heun's method and the Runge-Kutta method. If the
initial value problem is semilinear as in (3.1.19), we also have the option of using variation of parameters
and then applying the given numerical method to the initial value problem (3.1.21) for u. By analogy
with the terminology used here, we'll call the resulting procedure the improved Euler semilinear method,
the midpoint semilinear method, Heun's semilinear method or the Runge-Kutta semilinear method, as the
case may be.

You may want to save the results of these exercises, sincewe'll revisit in the next two sections. In Exer-
cises 1-5 use Euler's method to find approximate values of the solution of the given initial value problem

23. NUMERICAL QUADRATURE. The fundamental theorem of calculus says that if f is continuous
       on a closed interval [a, b] then it has an antiderivative F such that F (x) = f(x) on [a, b] and

                                               b

                                                  f(x) dx = F (b) - F (a).                            (A)

                                            a

This solves the problem of evaluating a definite integral if the integrand f has an antiderivative that
can be found and evaluated easily. However, if f doesn't have this property, (A) doesn't provide
                          Section 3.2 The Improved Euler Method and Related Methods 109

a useful way to evaluate the definite integral. In this case we must resort to approximate methods.

There's a class of such methods called numerical quadrature, where the approximation takes the

form                                  b       n

                                         f(x) dx  cif(xi),            (B)

where a = x0 < x1 <    < xn = b are suitably chosen points and c0, c1, . . . , cn are suitably
chosen constants. We call (B) a quadrature formula.

3.2 THE IMPROVED EULER METHOD AND RELATED METHODS

In Section 3.1 we saw that the global truncation error of Euler's method is O(h), which would seem to

imply that we can achieve arbitrarily accurate results with Euler's method by simply choosing the step size

sufficiently small. However, this isn't a good idea, for two reasons. First, after a certain point decreasing

the step size will increase roundoff errors to the point where the accuracy will deteriorate rather than

improve. The second and more important reason is that in most applications of numerical methods to an

initial value problem

                          y = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0,                    (3.2.1)

the expensive part of the computation is the evaluation of f. Therefore we want methods that give good
results for a given number of such evaluations. This is what motivates us to look for numerical methods

better than Euler's.
   To clarify this point, suppose we want to approximate the value of e by applying Euler's method to the

initial value problem
                                   y = y, y(0) = 1, (with solution y = ex)

on [0, 1], with h = 1/12, 1/24, and 1/48, respectively. Since each step in Euler's method requires
one evaluation of f, the number of evaluations of f in each of these attempts is n = 12, 24, and 48,
respectively. In each case we accept yn as an approximation to e. The second column of Table 3.2.1
shows the results. The first column of the table indicates the number of evaluations of f required to
obtain the approximation, and the last column contains the value of e rounded to ten significant figures.

   In this section we'll study the improved Euler method, which requires two evaluations of f at each
step. We've used this method with h = 1/6, 1/12, and 1/24. The required number of evaluations of f
110 Chapter 3 Numerical Methods

were 12, 24, and 48, as in the three applications of Euler's method; however, you can see from the third
column of Table 3.2.1 that the approximation to e obtained by the improved Euler method with only 12
evaluations of f is better than the approximation obtained by Euler's method with 48 evaluations.

   In Section 3.1 we'll study the Runge-Kutta method, which requires four evaluations of f at each step.
We've used this method with h = 1/3, 1/6, and 1/12. The required number of evaluations of f were
again 12, 24, and 48, as in the three applications of Euler's method and the improved Euler method;
however, you can see from the fourth column of Table 3.2.1 that the approximation to e obtained by
the Runge-Kutta method with only 12 evaluations of f is better than the approximation obtained by the
improved Euler method with 48 evaluations.

The Improved Euler Method

The improved Euler method for solving the initial value problem (3.2.1) is based on approximating the
integral curve of (3.2.1) at (xi, y(xi)) by the line through (xi, y(xi)) with slope

                                      mi = f(xi, y(xi)) + f(xi+1, y(xi+1)) ;
                                                                  2

that is, mi is the average of the slopes of the tangents to the integral curve at the endpoints of [xi, xi+1].
The equation of the approximating line is therefore

                             y = y(xi) + f(xi, y(xi)) + f(xi+1, y(xi+1)) (x - xi).          (3.2.2)
                                                                2

Setting x = xi+1 = xi + h in (3.2.2) yields

   yi+1 = y(xi) + h (f(xi, y(xi)) + f(xi+1, y(xi+1)))                                       (3.2.3)
                       2

as an approximation to y(xi+1). As in our derivation of Euler's method, we replace y(xi) (unknown if
i > 0) by its approximate value yi; then (3.2.3) becomes

                                  yi+1 = yi + h (f(xi, yi) + f(xi+1, y(xi+1)) .
                                                   2

However, this still won't work, because we don't know y(xi+1), which appears on the right. We overcome
this by replacing y(xi+1) by yi + hf(xi, yi), the value that the Euler method would assign to yi+1.
Thus, the improved Euler method starts with the known value y(x0) = y0 and computes y1, y2, . . . , yn
successively with the formula

                             yi+1 = yi + h (f(xi, yi) + f(xi+1, yi + hf(xi, yi))) .         (3.2.4)
                                              2

The computation indicated here can be conveniently organized as follows: given yi, compute

                            k1i = f(xi, yi),
                            k2i = f (xi + h, yi + hk1i) ,
                           yi+1 = yi + h (k1i + k2i).

                                               2
                                  Section 3.2 The Improved Euler Method and Related Methods 111

   The improved Euler method requires two evaluations of f(x, y) per step, while Euler's method requires
only one. However, we'll see at the end of this section that if f satisfies appropriate assumptions, the local
truncation error with the improved Euler method is O(h3), rather than O(h2) as with Euler's method.
Therefore the global truncation error with the improved Euler method is O(h2); however, we won't prove
this.

   We note that the magnitude of the local truncation error in the improved Euler method and other
methods discussed in this section is determined by the third derivative y of the solution of the initial
value problem. Therefore the local truncation error will be larger where |y | is large, or smaller where
|y | is small.

   The next example, which deals with the initial value problem considered in Example 3.1.1, illustrates

the computational procedure indicated in the improved Euler method.

Example 3.2.1 Use the improved Euler method with h = 0.1 to find approximate values of the solution

of the initial value problem

                                  y + 2y = x3e-2x, y(0) = 1                   (3.2.5)

at x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.

Solution As in Example 3.1.1, we rewrite (3.2.5) as          y(0) = 1,
                                          y = -2y + x3e-2x,

which is of the form (3.2.1), with
                                 f(x, y) = -2y + x3e-2x, x0 = 0, and y0 = 1.

The improved Euler method yields

      k10 = f(x0, y0) = f(0, 1) = -2,
      k20 = f(x1, y0 + hk10) = f(.1, 1 + (.1)(-2))

             = f(.1, .8) = -2(.8) + (.1)3e-.2 = -1.599181269,
       y1 = y0 + h (k10 + k20),

                         2
             = 1 + (.05)(-2 - 1.599181269) = .820040937,

      k11 = f(x1, y1) = f(.1, .820040937) = -2(.820040937) + (.1)3e-.2 = -1.639263142,
      k21 = f(x2, y1 + hk11) = f(.2, .820040937 + .1(-1.639263142)),

             = f(.2, .656114622) = -2(.656114622) + (.2)3e-.4 = -1.306866684,
       y2 = y1 + h (k11 + k21),

                         2
             = .820040937 + (.05)(-1.639263142 - 1.306866684) = .672734445,

      k12 = f(x2, y2) = f(.2, .672734445) = -2(.672734445) + (.2)3e-.4 = -1.340106330,
      k22 = f(x3, y2 + hk12) = f(.3, .672734445 + .1(-1.340106330)),

             = f(.3, .538723812) = -2(.538723812) + (.3)3e-.6 = -1.062629710,
       y3 = y2 + h (k12 + k22)

                         2
             = .672734445 + (.05)(-1.340106330 - 1.062629710) = .552597643.

A Family of Methods with O(h3) Local Truncation Error

We'll now derive a class of methods with O(h3) local truncation error for solving (3.2.1). For simplicity,
we assume that f, fx, fy, fxx, fyy, and fxy are continuous and bounded for all (x, y). This implies that
if y is the solution of (3.2.1 then y and y are bounded (Exercise 31).

   We begin by approximating the integral curve of (3.2.1) at (xi, y(xi)) by the line through (xi, y(xi))
with slope

                                            mi = y (xi) + y (xi + h),

where , , and  are constants that we'll soon specify; however, we insist at the outset that 0 <   1,
so that

                                                 xi < xi + h  xi+1.

The equation of the approximating line is

               y = y(xi) + mi(x - xi)                                             (3.2.7)
                   = y(xi) + [y (xi) + y (xi + h)] (x - xi).

Setting x = xi+1 = xi + h in (3.2.7) yields

               y^i+1 = y(xi) + h [y (xi) + y (xi + h)]

as an approximation to y(xi+1).
   To determine , , and  so that the error

               Ei = y(xi+1) - y^i+1                                               (3.2.8)
                     = y(xi+1) - y(xi) - h [y (xi) + y (xi + h)]

in this approximation is O(h3), we begin by recalling from Taylor's theorem that

                                                    h2               h3
               y(xi+1) = y(xi) + hy (xi) + y (xi) + y (x^i),
                                                    2                6

where x^i is in (xi, xi+1). Since y is bounded this implies that

                                y(x h2 i+1) - y(xi) - hy (xi) - y (xi) = O(h3).
                                                                      2

Comparing this with (3.2.8) shows that Ei = O(h3) if

               y (xi) + y (xi + h) = y (xi) + h y (xi) + O(h2).                   (3.2.9)
                                                           2

However, applying Taylor's theorem to y shows that

               y (xi + h) = y (xi) + hy (xi) +                    (h)2  y (xi),

                                                                  2

where xi is in (xi, xi + h). Since y is bounded, this implies that

               y (xi + h) = y (xi) + hy (xi) + O(h2).

Substituting this into (3.2.9) and noting that the sum of two O(h2) terms is again O(h2) shows that

Ei = O(h3) if  ( + )y (xi) + hy (xi) = y (xi) + h y (xi),
                                                                2

which is true if                         +  = 1 and  = 1 .
                                                                       2
                                                                                               (3.2.10)
Since y = f(x, y), we can now conclude from (3.2.8) that                                       (3.2.11)

                  y(xi+1) = y(xi) + h [f(xi, yi) + f(xi + h, y(xi + h))] + O(h3)

if , , and  satisfy (3.2.10). However, this formula would not be useful even if we knew y(xi) exactly
(as we would for i = 0), since we still wouldn't know y(xi + h) exactly. To overcome this difficulty, we
again use Taylor's theorem to write

                                                                         h2
                               y(xi + h) = y(xi) + hy (xi) + y (x~i),

                                                                          2

where x~i is in (xi, xi + h). Since y (xi) = f(xi, y(xi)) and y is bounded, this implies that

                  |y(xi + h) - y(xi) - hf(xi, y(xi))|  Kh2                                     (3.2.12)

for some constant K. Since fy is bounded, the mean value theorem implies that

                               |f(xi + h, u) - f(xi + h, v)|  M |u - v|

for some constant M . Letting

                  u = y(xi + h) and v = y(xi) + hf(xi, y(xi))

and recalling (3.2.12) shows that
                  f(xi + h, y(xi + h)) = f(xi + h, y(xi) + hf(xi, y(xi))) + O(h2).

Substituting this into (3.2.11) yields

                  y(xi+1) = y(xi) + h [f(xi, y(xi))+
                                    f(xi + h, y(xi) + hf(xi, y(xi)))] + O(h3).

This implies that the formula

                  yi+1 = yi + h [f(xi, yi) + f(xi + h, yi + hf(xi, yi))]

has O(h3) local truncation error if , , and  satisfy (3.2.10). Substituting  = 1 -  and  = 1/2 here

yields

                  yi+1 = yi + h (1 - )f(xi, yi) + f xi + h , yi + h f(xi, yi) .                (3.2.13)
                                                          2                  2

The computation indicated here can be conveniently organized as follows: given yi, compute

                               k1i = f(xi, yi),

                               k2i = f xi + h , yi + h k1i ,
                                           2              2

                               yi+1 = yi + h[(1 - )k1i + k2i].

   Consistent with our requirement that 0 <  < 1, we require that   1/2. Letting  = 1/2 in (3.2.13)
yields the improved Euler method (3.2.4). Letting  = 3/4 yields Heun's method,

                  yi+1 = yi + h 1 f(xi, yi) + 3 f xi + 2 h, yi + 2 hf(xi, yi) ,

                           yi+1 = yi + hk2i.

Examples involving the midpoint method and Heun's method are given in Exercises 23-30.

                                          3.2 Exercises

Most of the following numerical exercises involve initial value problems considered in the exercises in
Section 3.1. You'll find it instructive to compare the results that you obtain here with the corresponding
results that you obtained in Section 3.1.

   In Exercises 1-5 use the improved Euler method to find approximate values of the solution of the given
initial value problem at the points xi = x0 + ih, where x0 is the point where the initial condition is
imposed and i = 1, 2, 3.

1. C y = 2x2 + 3y2 - 2, y(2) = 1; h = 0.05

2. C y = y + x2 + y2, y(0) = 1; h = 0.1

3. C y + 3y = x2 - 3xy + y2, y(0) = 2; h = 0.05

4. C y =  1+x  2 , y(2) = 3; h = 0.1

          1-y

5. C y + x2y = sin xy, y(1) = ; h = 0.2

6. C Use the improved Euler method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to find

     at x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1.0. Compare these approximate values with the values of the exact
     solution y = e4x + e-3x, which can be obtained by the method of Section 2.1. Present your results
     in a table like Table 3.2.2.

3.3 THE RUNGE-KUTTA METHOD

In general, if k is any positive integer and f satisfies appropriate assumptions, there are numerical methods
with local truncation error O(hk+1) for solving an initial value problem

                            y = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0.                              (3.3.1)

Moreover, it can be shown that a method with local truncation error O(hk+1) has global truncation error
O(hk). In Sections 3.1 and 3.2 we studied numerical methods where k = 1 and k = 2. We'll skip

methods for which k = 3 and proceed to the Runge-Kutta method, the most widely used method, for
which k = 4. The magnitude of the local truncation error is determined by the fifth derivative y(5) of
the solution of the initial value problem. Therefore the local truncation error will be larger where |y(5)|
is large, or smaller where |y(5)| is small. The Runge-Kutta method computes approximate values y1, y2,

. . . , yn of the solution of (3.3.1) at x0, x0 + h, . . . , x0 + nh as follows: Given yi, compute

   k1i = f(xi, yi),

   k2i = f xi + h , yi + h k1i ,
                            2                    2

   k3i = f xi + h , yi + h k2i ,
                            2                    2

   k4i = f(xi + h, yi + hk3i),

and
                                      yi+1 = yi + h (k1i + 2k2i + 2k3i + k4i).
                                                      6

   The next example, which deals with the initial value problem considered in Examples 3.1.1 and 3.2.1,
illustrates the computational procedure indicated in the Runge-Kutta method.
120 Chapter 3 Numerical Methods

Example 3.3.1 Use the Runge-Kutta method with h = 0.1 to find approximate values for the solution of

the initial value problem

                           y + 2y = x3e-2x, y(0) = 1,                          (3.3.2)

at x = 0.1, 0.2.

Solution Again we rewrite (3.3.2) as
                                          y = -2y + x3e-2x, y(0) = 1,

which is of the form (3.3.1), with
                                  f(x, y) = -2y + x3e-2x, x0 = 0, and y0 = 1.

   The Runge-Kutta method yields

k10 = f(x0, y0) = f(0, 1) = -2,
k20 = f(x0 + h/2, y0 + hk10/2) = f(.05, 1 + (.05)(-2))

       = 1 + .1 (-2 + 2(-1.799886895) + 2(-1.819898206) - 1.635201628) = .818753803,

       = f(.15, .736919359) = -2(.736919359) + (.15)3e-.3 = -1.471338457,

       = f(.2, .669966453) = -2(.669966453) + (.2)3e-.4 = -1.334570346,

       = .670592417.

   The Runge-Kutta method is sufficiently accurate for most applications.

Example 3.3.2 Table 3.3.1 shows results of using the Runge-Kutta method with step sizes h = 0.1 and
h = 0.05 to find approximate values of the solution of the initial value problem

                                            y + 2y = x3e-2x, y(0) = 1

at x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1.0. For comparison, it also shows the corresponding approximate values
obtained with the improved Euler method in Example 3.2.2, and the values of the exact solution

                                                   y = e (x -2x 4 + 4).

The results obtained by the Runge-Kutta method are clearly better than those obtained by the improved
Euler method in fact; the results obtained by the Runge-Kutta method with h = 0.1 are better than those
obtained by the improved Euler method with h = 0.05.

The Case Where x0 Isn't The Left Endpoint
So far in this chapter we've considered numerical methods for solving an initial value problem

                                 y = f(x, y), y(x0) = y0                                        (3.3.3)

on an interval [x0, b], for which x0 is the left endpoint. We haven't discussed numerical methods for
solving (3.3.3) on an interval [a, x0], for which x0 is the right endpoint. To be specific, how can we
obtain approximate values y-1, y-2, . . . , y-n of the solution of (3.3.3) at x0 - h, . . . , x0 - nh, where
h = (x0 - a)/n? Here's the answer to this question:

   Consider the initial value problem

            z = -f(-x, z), z(-x0) = y0,                                                         (3.3.4)

on the interval [-x0, -a], for which -x0 is the left endpoint. Use a numerical method to obtain approxi-
mate values z1, z2, . . . , zn of the solution of (3.3.4) at -x0 + h, -x0 + 2h, . . . , -x0 + nh = -a. Then
                                                             Section 3.3 The Runge-Kutta Method 123

y-1 = z1, y-2 = z2, . . . , y-n = zn are approximate values of the solution of (3.3.3) at x0 - h, x0 - 2h,
. . . , x0 - nh = a.

   The justification for this answer is sketched in Exercise 23. Note how easy it is to make the change the
given problem (3.3.3) to the modified problem (3.3.4): first replace f by -f and then replace x, x0, and
y by -x, -x0, and z, respectively.

Example 3.3.5 Use the Runge-Kutta method with step size h = 0.1 to find approximate values of the

solution of

                                 (y - 1)2y = 2x + 3, y(1) = 4                (3.3.5)

at x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.

Solution We first rewrite (3.3.5) in the form (3.3.3) as

                                 y=  2x + 3   2 , y(1) = 4.                  (3.3.6)

                                     (y - 1)

Since the initial condition y(1) = 4 is imposed at the right endpoint of the interval [0, 1], we apply the
Runge-Kutta method to the initial value problem

                                 z=  2x - 3 2 , z(-1) = 4                    (3.3.7)

                                     (z - 1)

on the interval [-1, 0]. (You should verify that (3.3.7) is related to (3.3.6) as (3.3.4) is related to (3.3.3).)

Table 3.3.5 shows the results. Reversing the order of the rows in Table 3.3.5 and changing the signs of

the values of x yields the first two columns of Table 3.3.6. The last column of Table 3.3.6 shows the exact

values of y, which are given by

                                 y = 1 + (3x2 + 9x + 15)1/3.

(Since the differential equation in (3.3.6) is separable, this formula can be obtained by the method of
Section 2.2.)

   We leave it to you to develop a procedure for handling the numerical solution of (3.3.3) on an interval
[a, b] such that a < x0 < b (Exercises 26 and 27).

                                 3.3 Exercises

Most of the following numerical exercises involve initial value problems considered in the exercises in
Sections 3.2. You'll find it instructive to compare the results that you obtain here with the corresponding
results that you obtained in those sections.
In Exercises 1-5 use the Runge-Kutta method to find approximate values of the solution of the given initial
value problem at the points xi = x0 + ih, where x0 is the point where the initial condition is imposed

                                       y=  y2 + xy - x2        ,  y(1) = 2

at x = 1.0, 1.05, 1.10, 1.15 . . . , 1.5. Compare these approximate values with the values of the

exact solution                                 x(1 + x2/3)

                                           y=                  2,

which was obtained in Example 2.2.3. Present your results in a table like Table 3.3.1.

9. C In Example 2.2.3 it was shown that

                                           y5 + y = x2 + x - 4

is an implicit solution of the initial value problem

mate values of the solution of (A) at x = 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, . . . , 3.0. Present your results in tabular

form. To check the error in these approximate values, construct another table of values of the

residual
                                       R(x, y) = y5 + y - x2 - x + 4

       for each value of (x, y) appearing in the first table.
10. C You can see from Example 2.5.1 that

                                       x4y3 + x2y5 + 2xy = 4

is an implicit solution of the initial value problem

                                       4x3y3 + 2xy5 + 2y          , y(1) = 1.           (A)
                y =- 4 2
                                                     24
                                       3x y + 5x y + 2x

Use the Runge-Kutta method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to find approxi-

mate values of the solution of (A) at x = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, . . . , 2.0. Present your results in tabular

form. To check the error in these approximate values, construct another table of values of the

residual

                R(x, y) = x4y3 + x2y5 + 2xy - 4

for each value of (x, y) appearing in the first table.

12. C Use the Runge-Kutta method with step sizes h = 0.1, h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to find
       approximate values of the solution of the initial value problem

                           y + (y + 1)(y - 1)(y - 2) = 0, y(1) = 0 (Exercise 2.2.14),
                                            x+1

13. C Use the Runge-Kutta method and the Runge-Kutta semilinear method with step sizes h = 0.1,

       h = 0.05, and h = 0.025 to find approximate values of the solution of the initial value problem

                                  y + 3y = e-3x(1 - 4x + 3x2 - 4x3), y(0) = -3

       at x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 1.0. Compare these approximate values with the values of the exact
       solution y = -e-3x(3 - x + 2x2 - x3 + x4), which can be obtained by the method of Section 2.1.
       Do you notice anything special about the results? Explain.

The linear initial value problems in Exercises 14-19 can't be solved exactly in terms of known elementary
functions. In each exercise use the Runge-Kutta and the Runge-Kutta semilinear methods with the indi-
cated step sizes to find approximate values of the solution of the given initial value problem at 11 equally
spaced points (including the endpoints) in the interval.

Applications of First Order Equations

IN THIS CHAPTER we consider applications of first order differential equations.
SECTION 4.1 begins with a discussion of exponential growth and decay, which you have probably al-
ready seen in calculus. We consider applications to radioactive decay, carbon dating, and compound
interest. We also consider more complicated problems where the rate of change of a quantity is in part
proportional to the magnitude of the quantity, but is also influenced by other other factors for example, a
radioactive susbstance is manufactured at a certain rate, but decays at a rate proportional to its mass, or a
saver makes regular deposits in a savings account that draws compound interest.
SECTION 4.2 deals with applications of Newton's law of cooling and with mixing problems.
SECTION 4.3 discusses applications to elementary mechanics involving Newton's second law of mo-
tion. The problems considered include motion under the influence of gravity in a resistive medium, and
determining the initial velocity required to launch a satellite.
SECTION 4.4 deals with methods for dealing with a type of second order equation that often arises in
applications of Newton's second law of motion, by reformulating it as first order equation with a different
independent variable. Although the method doesn't usually lead to an explicit solution of the given
equation, it does provide valuable insights into the behavior of the solutions.
SECTION 4.5 deals with applications of differential equations to curves.

4.1 GROWTH AND DECAY

Since the applications in this section deal with functions of time, we'll denote the independent variable
by t. If Q is a function of t, Q will denote the derivative of Q with respect to t; thus,

                                                         Q = dQ .
                                                                 dt

Exponential Growth and Decay

One of the most common mathematical models for a physical process is the exponential model, where
it's assumed that the rate of change of a quantity Q is proportional to Q; thus

                                               Q = aQ,                                              (4.1.1)

where a is the constant of proportionality.
   From Example 3, the general solution of (4.1.1) is

                                                         Q = ceat

and the solution of the initial value problem

                              Q = aQ, Q(t0) = Q0

is

                              Q = Q0ea(t-t0).                                                       (4.1.2)

Since the solutions of Q = aQ are exponential functions, we say that a quantity Q that satisfies this
equation grows exponentially if a > 0, or decays exponentially if a < 0 (Figure 4.1.1).

Radioactive Decay

Experimental evidence shows that radioactive material decays at a rate proportional to the mass of the
material present. According to this model the mass Q(t) of a radioactive material present at time t
satisfies (4.1.1), where a is a negative constant whose value for any given material must be determined
by experimental observation. For simplicity, we'll replace the negative constant a by -k, where k is a
positive number that we'll call the decay constant of the material. Thus, (4.1.1) becomes

                                               Q = -kQ.

If the mass of the material present at t = t0 is Q0, the mass present at time t is the solution of

                              Q = -kQ, Q(t0) = Q0.

From (4.1.2) with a = -k, the solution of this initial value problem is

                              Q = Q0e-k(t-t0).                                                      (4.1.3)

    The half-life  of a radioactive material is defined to be the time required for half of its mass to decay;

that is, if Q(t0) = Q0, then  Q( + t0) = Q0 .

From (4.1.3) with t =  + t0, (4.1.4) is equivalent to

                                               Q0e-k = Q0 ,

so

Taking logarithms yields             -k = ln 1 = - ln 2,
                                                  2

so the half-life is                   = 1 ln 2.

(Figure 4.1.2). The half-life is independent of t0 and Q0, since it's determined by the properties of

material, not by the amount of the material present at any particular time.

Example 4.1.1 A radioactive substance has a half-life of 1620 years.
(a) If its mass is now 4 g (grams), how much will be left 810 years from now?

(b) Find the time t1 when 1.5 g of the substance remain.

SOLUTION(a) From (4.1.3) with t0 = 0 and Q0 = 4,                                                                       (4.1.6)
                                                        Q = 4e-kt,                                                     (4.1.7)

where we determine k from (4.1.5), with  = 1620 years:

Substituting this in (4.1.6) yields   k = ln 2 = ln 2 .
                                              1620

                                     Q = 4e-(t ln 2)/1620.

                          Figure 4.1.2 Half-life of a radioactive substance

Therefore the mass left after 810 years will be

                            Q(810)  = 4e-(810 ln 2)/1620 = 4e-(ln 2)/2
                                        

                                    = 2 2 g.

SOLUTION(b) Setting t = t1 in (4.1.7) and requiring that Q(t1) = 1.5 yields

                                                  3 = 4e(-t1 ln 2)/1620.
                                                  2
Dividing by 4 and taking logarithms yields

                                    ln 3 = - t1 ln 2 .
                                                 8  1620

Since ln 3/8 = - ln 8/3,

                                   t1 = 1620 ln 8/3  2292.4 years.
                                                 ln 2

Interest Compounded Continuously

Suppose we deposit an amount of money Q0 in an interest-bearing account and make no further deposits

or withdrawals for t years, during which the account bears interest at a constant annual rate r. To calculate

the value of the account at the end of t years, we need one more piece of information: how the interest

is added to the account, or--as the bankers say--how it is compounded. If the interest is compounded

annually, the value of the account is multiplied by 1 + r at the end of each year. This means that after t

years the value of the account is

                                    Q(t) = Q0(1 + r)t.
                                                    Section 4.1 Growth and Decay 133

If interest is compounded semiannually, the value of the account is multiplied by (1 + r/2) every 6
months. Since this occurs twice annually, the value of the account after t years is

                                                Q(t) = Q0 1 + r 2t .
                                                                      2

In general, if interest is compounded n times per year, the value of the account is multiplied n times per
year by (1 + r/n); therefore, the value of the account after t years is

                   Q(t) = Q0 1 + r nt .                                             (4.1.8)
                                        n

Thus, increasing the frequency of compounding increases the value of the account after a fixed period
of time. Table 4.1.7 shows the effect of increasing the number of compoundings over t = 5 years on an
initial deposit of Q0 = 100 (dollars), at an annual interest rate of 6%.

   You can see from Table 4.1.7 that the value of the account after 5 years is an increasing function of
n. Now suppose the maximum allowable rate of interest on savings accounts is restricted by law, but
the time intervals between successive compoundings isn't ; then competing banks can attract savers by
compounding often. The ultimate step in this direction is to compound continuously, by which we mean
that n   in (4.1.8). Since we know from calculus that

                   lim 1 + r n = er,
                   n                n

this yields

             Q(t)  = lim Q0  1+  r nt  = Q0 lim 1 +                  r nt

                       n         n                  n                n

                   = Q0ert.

Observe that Q = Q0ert is the solution of the initial value problem

                   Q = rQ, Q(0) = Q0;

that is, with continuous compounding the value of the account grows exponentially.

                                                                    2
the value of the account after t years is

                                               Q(t) = 150e.055t

dollars. (Note that it's necessary to write the interest rate as a decimal; thus, r = .055.) Therefore, after
t = 10 years the value of the account is

                                             Q(10) = 150e.55  $259.99.

Example 4.1.3 We wish to accumulate $10,000 in 10 years by making a single deposit in a savings
account bearing 5 12 % annual interest compounded continuously. How much must we deposit in the
account?

Solution The value of the account at time t is                                                           (4.1.9)
                                                    Q(t) = Q0e.055t.                                    (4.1.10)

Since we want Q(10) to be $10,000, the initial deposit Q0 must satisfy the equation
                                                    10000 = Q0e.55,

obtained by setting t = 10 and Q(10) = 10000 in (4.1.9). Solving (4.1.10) for Q0 yields
                                            Q0 = 10000e-.55  $5769.50.

Mixed Growth and Decay

Example 4.1.4 A radioactive substance with decay constant k is produced at a constant rate of a units of
mass per unit time.
(a) Assuming that Q(0) = Q0, find the mass Q(t) of the substance present at time t.

(b) Find limt Q(t).

SOLUTION(a) Here

                         Q = rate of increase of Q - rate of decrease of Q.

The rate of increase is the constant a. Since Q is radioactive with decay constant k, the rate of decrease
is kQ. Therefore

                                                      Q = a - kQ.

This is a linear first order differential equation. Rewriting it and imposing the initial condition shows that
Q is the solution of the initial value problem

                                        Q + kQ = a, Q(0) = Q0.                                          (4.1.11)

Since e-kt is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of (4.1.11) are of the form Q =
ue-kt, where u e-kt = a, so u = aekt. Hence,

                                                      u = a ekt + c

                Q

           a/k

                                                                                  t

                Figure 4.1.3 Q(t) approaches the steady state value a as t  
                                                                               k

Q = ue-kt = and a + ce-kt.
                                                                 k

Since Q(0) = Q0, setting t = 0 here yields

                Q0 = a + c or  c = Q0 - a .
                        k                   k

Therefore       Q = a + Q0 - a e-kt.

                k              k                                                     (4.1.12)

SOLUTION(b) Since k > 0, limt e-kt = 0, so from (4.1.12)

                lim Q(t) = a .
                t              k

This limit depends only on a and k, and not on Q0. We say that a/k is the steady state value of Q. From
(4.1.12) we also see that Q approaches its steady state value from above if Q0 > a/k, or from below if
Q0 < a/k. If Q0 = a/k, then Q remains constant (Figure 4.1.3).

Carbon Dating

The fact that Q approaches a steady state value in the situation discussed in Example 4 underlies the
method of carbon dating, devised by the American chemist and Nobel Prize Winner W.S. Libby.

   Carbon 12 is stable, but carbon-14, which is produced by cosmic bombardment of nitrogen in the upper
atmosphere, is radioactive with a half-life of about 5570 years. Libby assumed that the quantity of carbon-
12 in the atmosphere has been constant throughout time, and that the quantity of radioactive carbon-14
136 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations

achieved its steady state value long ago as a result of its creation and decomposition over millions of
years. These assumptions led Libby to conclude that the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 has been nearly
constant for a long time. This constant, which we denote by R, has been determined experimentally.

   Living cells absorb both carbon-12 and carbon-14 in the proportion in which they are present in the
environment. Therefore the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in a living cell is always R. However, when
the cell dies it ceases to absorb carbon, and the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 decreases exponentially
as the radioactive carbon-14 decays. This is the basis for the method of carbon dating, as illustrated in
the next example.

Example 4.1.5 An archaeologist investigating the site of an ancient village finds a burial ground where
the amount of carbon-14 present in individual remains is between 42 and 44% of the amount present in
live individuals. Estimate the age of the village and the length of time for which it survived.

Solution Let Q = Q(t) be the quantity of carbon-14 in an individual set of remains t years after death,
and let Q0 be the quantity that would be present in live individuals. Since carbon-14 decays exponentially
with half-life 5570 years, its decay constant is

                   k = ln 2 .
                         5570

Therefore

                   Q = Q0e-t(ln 2)/5570

if we choose our time scale so that t0 = 0 is the time of death. If we know the present value of Q we can
solve this equation for t, the number of years since death occurred. This yields

                   t = -5570 ln Q/Q0 .
                                   ln 2

It is given that Q = .42Q0 in the remains of individuals who died first. Therefore these deaths occurred

about              t1 = -5570 ln .42  6971
                                   ln 2

years ago. For the most recent deaths, Q = .44Q0; hence, these deaths occurred about

                                               t2 = -5570 ln .44  6597
                                                               ln 2

years ago. Therefore it's reasonable to conclude that the village was founded about 7000 years ago, and
lasted for about 400 years.

A Savings Program

Example 4.1.6 A person opens a savings account with an initial deposit of $1000 and subsequently
deposits $50 per week. Find the value Q(t) of the account at time t > 0, assuming that the bank pays 6%
interest compounded continuously.

Solution Observe that Q isn't continuous, since there are 52 discrete deposits per year of $50 each.
To construct a mathematical model for this problem in the form of a differential equation, we make
the simplifying assumption that the deposits are made continuously at a rate of $2600 per year. This
is essential, since solutions of differential equations are continuous functions. With this assumption, Q
increases continuously at the rate

                                                   Q = 2600 + .06Q
                                                                   Section 4.1 Growth and Decay 137

and therefore Q satisfies the differential equation

                                            Q - .06Q = 2600.                           (4.1.13)

(Of course, we must recognize that the solution of this equation is an approximation to the true value of

Q at any given time. We'll discuss this further below.) Since e.06t is a solution of the complementary

equation, the solutions of (4.1.13) are of the form Q = ue.06t, where u e.06t = 2600. Hence, u =

2600e-.06t,                                 u = - 2600 e-.06t + c
                                                     .06

and                           Q = ue.06t = - 2600 + ce.06t.

                                                     .06                               (4.1.14)

Setting t = 0 and Q = 1000 here yields

                                            c = 1000 + 2600,
                                                            .06

and substituting this into (4.1.14) yields

                        Q = 1000e.06t + 2600 (e.06t - 1),                              (4.1.15)
                                               .06

where the first term is the value due to the initial deposit and the second is due to the subsequent weekly
deposits.

   Mathematical models must be tested for validity by comparing predictions based on them with the
actual outcome of experiments. Example 6 is unusual in that we can compute the exact value of the
account at any specified time and compare it with the approximate value predicted by (4.1.15) (See
Exercise 21.). The follwing table gives a comparison for a ten year period. Each exact answer corresponds
to the time of the year-end deposit, and each year is assumed to have exactly 52 weeks.

       (d) It can be shown that the exact value of M is given by

                                              M = rP0 1 - (1 + r/12)-12N -1 .

              $50, 000, r = 7 21 %, N = 20 (ii) P0 = $150, 000, r = 9.0%, N = 30.

4.2 COOLING AND MIXING

Newton's Law of Cooling

Newton's law of cooling states that if an object with temperature T (t) at time t is in a medium with

temperature Tm(t), the rate of change of T at time t is proportional to T (t) - Tm(t); thus, T satisfies a

differential equation of the form

                                   T = -k(T - Tm).  (4.2.1)

Here k > 0, since the temperature of the object must decrease if T > Tm, or increase if T < Tm. We'll
call k the temperature decay constant of the medium.

   For simplicity, in this section we'll assume that the medium is maintained at a constant temperature Tm.
This is another example of building a simple mathematical model for a physical phenomenon. Like most
mathematical models it has its limitations. For example, it's reasonable to assume that the temperature of
a room remains approximately constant if the cooling object is a cup of coffee, but perhaps not if it's a
huge cauldron of molten metal. (For more on this see Exercise 17.)

   To solve (4.2.1), we rewrite it as
                                                    T + kT = kTm.

Since e-kt is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of this equation are of the form
T = ue-kt, where u e-kt = kTm, so u = kTmekt. Hence,

                                   u = Tmekt + c,
                                                                      Section 4.2 Cooling and Mixing 141

so                                                                             (4.2.2)
                                              T = ue-kt = Tm + ce-kt.

If T (0) = T0, setting t = 0 here yields c = T0 - Tm, so

                                              T = Tm + (T0 - Tm)e-kt.

Note that T - Tm decays exponentially, with decay constant k.

Example 4.2.1 A ceramic insulator is baked at 400C and cooled in a room in which the temperature is
25C. After 4 minutes the temperature of the insulator is 200C. What is its temperature after 8 minutes?

Solution Here T0 = 400 and Tm = 25, so (4.2.2) becomes                         (4.2.3)
                                                   T = 25 + 375e-kt.

We determine k from the stated condition that T (4) = 200; that is,
                                                  200 = 25 + 375e-4k;

hence,                                 e-4k = 175 = 7 .
                                                 375 15

Taking logarithms and solving for k yields

                                       k = - 1 ln 7 = 1 ln 15.
                                               4 15 4 7

Substituting this into (4.2.3) yields

                                       T = 25 + 375e- 4t ln 175

(Figure 4.2.1). Therefore the temperature of the insulator after 8 minutes is

        T (8)                          = 25 + 375e-2 ln 175
                                       = 25 + 375 7  107 2 C.

                                                        15

Example 4.2.2 An object with temperature 72F is placed outside, where the temperature is -20F. At
11:05 the temperature of the object is 60F and at 11:07 its temperature is 50F. At what time was the

object placed outside?

Solution Let T (t) be the temperature of the object at time t. For convenience, we choose the origin
t0 = 0 of the time scale to be 11:05 so that T0 = 60. We must determine the time  when T ( ) = 72.
Substituting T0 = 60 and Tm = -20 into (4.2.2) yields

                                            T = -20 + 60 - (-20) e-kt

or

                                       T = -20 + 80e-kt.                       (4.2.4)

                           Figure 4.2.1 T = 25 + 375e-(t/4) ln 15/7

We obtain k from the stated condition that the temperature of the object is 50F at 11:07. Since 11:07 is
t = 2 on our time scale, we can determine k by substituting T = 50 and t = 2 into (4.2.4) to obtain

                                                  50 = -20 + 80e-2k

(Figure 4.2.2); hence,                      e-2k = 70 = 7 .
                                                      80 8

                                       T = -20 + 80e- 2t ln 87 ,

and the condition T ( ) = 72 implies that

                                       72 = -20 + 80e- 2 ln 78 ;

Therefore the object was placed outside about 2 minutes and 5 seconds before 11:05; that is, at 11:02:55.

Mixing Problems

In the next two examples a saltwater solution with a given concentration (weight of salt per unit volume
of solution) is added at a specified rate to a tank that initially contains saltwater with a different concentra-
tion. The problem is to determine the quantity of salt in the tank as a function of time. This is an example
of a mixing problem. To construct a tractable mathematical model for mixing problems we assume in
our examples (and most exercises) that the mixture is stirred instantly so that the salt is always uniformly
distributed throughout the mixture. Exercises 22 and 23 deal with situations where this isn't so, but the
distribution of salt becomes approximately uniform as t  .

Example 4.2.3 A tank initially contains 40 pounds of salt dissolved in 600 gallons of water. Starting at
t0 = 0, water that contains 1/2 pound of salt per gallon is poured into the tank at the rate of 4 gal/min and
the mixture is drained from the tank at the same rate (Figure 4.2.3).
(a) Find a differential equation for the quantity Q(t) of salt in the tank at time t > 0, and solve the

      equation to determine Q(t).

(b) Find limt Q(t).

SOLUTION(a) To find a differential equation for Q, we must use the given information to derive an

expression for Q . But Q is the rate of change of the quantity of salt in the tank changes with respect to

time; thus, if rate in denotes the rate at which salt enters the tank and rate out denotes the rate by which

it leaves, then

                                     Q = rate in - rate out.                                  (4.2.5)
144 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations

                                                               4 gal/min; .5 lb/gal

                                               4 gal/min

The rate in is               1 lb/gal  (4 gal/min) = 2 lb/min.
                             2

Determining the rate out requires a little more thought. We're removing 4 gallons of the mixture per
minute, and there are always 600 gallons in the tank; that is, we're removing 1/150 of the mixture per
minute. Since the salt is evenly distributed in the mixture, we are also removing 1/150 of the salt per
minute. Therefore, if there are Q(t) pounds of salt in the tank at time t, the rate out at any time t is
Q(t)/150. Alternatively, we can arrive at this conclusion by arguing that

                rate out = (concentration)  (rate of flow out)
                            = (lb/gal)  (gal/min)

                             = Q(t)  4 = Q(t) .
                             600               150

We can now write (4.2.5) as                    Q =2- Q .
                                                           150

This first order equation can be rewritten as

                                               Q + Q = 2.
                                                      150

Since e-t/150 is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of this equation are of the form
Q = ue-t/150, where u e-t/150 = 2, so u = 2et/150. Hence,

                             u = 300et/150 + c,

                Figure 4.2.4 Q = 300 - 260e-t/150

so                                                                                                                                                (4.2.6)

(Figure 4.2.4). Since Q(0) = 40, c = -260; therefore,

                                                Q = 300 - 260e-t/150.

SOLUTION(b) From (4.2.6), we see that that limt Q(t) = 300 for any value of Q(0). This is intu-
itively reasonable, since the incoming solution contains 1/2 pound of salt per gallon and there are always
600 gallons of water in the tank.

Example 4.2.4 A 500-liter tank initially contains 10 g of salt dissolved in 200 liters of water. Starting
at t0 = 0, water that contains 1/4 g of salt per liter is poured into the tank at the rate of 4 liters/min and
the mixture is drained from the tank at the rate of 2 liters/min (Figure 4.2.5). Find a differential equation
for the quantity Q(t) of salt in the tank at time t prior to the time when the tank overflows and find the
concentration K(t) (g/liter ) of salt in the tank at any such time.

Solution We first determine the amount W (t) of solution in the tank at any time t prior to overflow.
Since W (0) = 200 and we're adding 4 liters/min while removing only 2 liters/min, there's a net gain of
2 liters/min in the tank; therefore,

                                                    W (t) = 2t + 200.

Since W (150) = 500 liters (capacity of the tank), this formula is valid for 0  t  150.

Now let Q(t) be the number of grams of salt in the tank at time t, where 0  t  150. As in

Example 4.2.3,

                Q = rate in - rate out.                                                                                                           (4.2.7)

                                                                              2t+200 liters

To determine the rate out, we observe that since the mixture is being removed from the tank at the constant

rate of 2 liters/min and there are 2t + 200 liters in the tank at time t, the fraction of the mixture being

removed per minute at time t is      2 = 1.
                                 2t + 200 t + 100

We're removing this same fraction of the salt per minute. Therefore, since there are Q(t) grams of salt in

the tank at time t,              rate out = Q(t) .
                                              t + 100

Alternatively, we can arrive at this conclusion by arguing that

                rate out = (concentration)  (rate of flow out) = (g/liter)  (liters/min)

                     = Q(t)  2 = Q(t) .

Substituting (4.2.8) and (4.2.9) into (4.2.7) yields

                     Q = 1 - Q , so Q + 1 Q = 1.                                                                  (4.2.10)
                                 t + 100                         t + 100

By separation of variables, 1/(t + 100) is a solution of the complementary equation, so the solutions of
(4.2.10) are of the form

                     Q = u , where           u = 1, so                                              u = t + 100.
                           t + 100        t + 100
                                                                Section 4.2 Cooling and Mixing 147

Hence,                        u = (t + 100)2 + c.
                                         2
                                                                                            (4.2.11)

Since Q(0) = 10 and u = (t + 100)Q, (4.2.11) implies that

                              (100)(10) = (100)2 + c,
                                                  2

so
                                           c = 100(10) - (100)2 = -4000
                                                                 2

and therefore                 u = (t + 100)2 - 4000.
                                         2

Hence,                   Q = u = t + 100 - 4000 .

Now let K(t) be the concentration of salt at time t. Then

                              K(t) = 1 -     2000

        the quantity Q(t) of salt in the tank at time t > 0.

  9. A tank initially contains a solution of 10 pounds of salt in 60 gallons of water. Water with 1/2

 11. A 200 gallon tank initially contains 100 gallons of water with 20 pounds of salt. A salt solution

        drained out at 2 gal/min. Find the quantity of salt in the tank as it's about to overflow.

 12. Suppose water is added to a tank at 10 gal/min, but leaks out at the rate of 1/5 gal/min for each

 13. A chemical reaction in a laboratory with volume V (in ft3) produces q1 ft3/min of a noxious gas as

        fans at the other end exhaust the mixture of gas and air from the laboratory at the same rate.
Section 4.2 Cooling and Mixing 149

       Assuming that the gas is always uniformly distributed in the room and its initial concentration c0
       is at a safe level, find the smallest value of q2 required to maintain safe conditions in the laboratory
       for all time.

14. A 1200-gallon tank initially contains 40 pounds of salt dissolved in 600 gallons of water. Starting
       at t0 = 0, water that contains 1/2 pound of salt per gallon is added to the tank at the rate of 6
       gal/min and the resulting mixture is drained from the tank at 4 gal/min. Find the quantity Q(t) of
       salt in the tank at any time t > 0 prior to overflow.

15. Tank T1 initially contain 50 gallons of pure water. Starting at t0 = 0, water that contains 1 pound
       of salt per gallon is poured into T1 at the rate of 2 gal/min. The mixture is drained from T1 at the
       same rate into a second tank T2, which initially contains 50 gallons of pure water. Also starting at
       t0 = 0, a mixture from another source that contains 2 pounds of salt per gallon is poured into T2
       at the rate of 2 gal/min. The mixture is drained from T2 at the rate of 4 gal/min.

        (a) Find a differential equation for the quantity Q(t) of salt in tank T2 at time t > 0.
       (b) Solve the equation derived in (a) to determine Q(t).

        (c) Find limt Q(t).

16. Suppose an object with initial temperature T0 is placed in a sealed container, which is in turn placed
       in a medium with temperature Tm. Let the initial temperature of the container be S0. Assume that
       the temperature of the object does not affect the temperature of the container, which in turn does
       not affect the temperature of the medium. (These assumptions are reasonable, for example, if the
       object is a cup of coffee, the container is a house, and the medium is the atmosphere.)

        (a) Assuming that the container and the medium have distinct temperature decay constants k and
              km respectively, use Newton's law of cooling to find the temperatures S(t) and T (t) of the
              container and object at time t.

       (b) Assuming that the container and the medium have the same temperature decay constant k,
              use Newton's law of cooling to find the temperatures S(t) and T (t) of the container and
              object at time t.

        (c) Find lim .tS(t) and limt T (t) .

17. In our previous examples and exercises concerning Newton's law of cooling we assumed that the
       temperature of the medium remains constant. This model is adequate if the heat lost or gained by
       the object is insignificant compared to the heat required to cause an appreciable change in the tem-
       perature of the medium. If this isn't so, we must use a model that accounts for the heat exchanged
       between the object and the medium. Let T = T (t) and Tm = Tm(t) be the temperatures of the
       object and the medium, respectively, and let T0 and Tm0 be their initial values. Again, we assume
       that T and Tm are related by Newton's law of cooling,

T = -k(T - Tm).                (A)

We also assume that the change in heat of the object as its temperature changes from T0 to T is
a(T - T0) and that the change in heat of the medium as its temperature changes from Tm0 to Tm
is am(Tm - Tm0), where a and am are positive constants depending upon the masses and thermal
properties of the object and medium, respectively. If we assume that the total heat of the system

consisting of the object and the medium remains constant (that is, energy is conserved), then

a(T - T0) + am(Tm - Tm0) = 0.  (B)

(a) Equation (A) involves two unknown functions T and Tm. Use (A) and (B) to derive a differ-
     ential equation involving only T .

(b) Find T (t) and Tm(t) for t > 0.
(c) Find limt T (t) and limt Tm(t).

18. Control mechanisms allow fluid to flow into a tank at a rate proportional to the volume V of fluid
       in the tank, and to flow out at a rate proportional to V 2. Suppose V (0) = V0 and the constants of

       proportionality are a and b, respectively. Find V (t) for t > 0 and find limt V (t).

19. Identical tanks T1 and T2 initially contain W gallons each of pure water. Starting at t0 = 0, a
       salt solution with constant concentration c is pumped into T1 at r gal/min and drained from T1
       into T2 at the same rate. The resulting mixture in T2 is also drained at the same rate. Find the
       concentrations c1(t) and c2(t) in tanks T1 and T2 for t > 0.

20. An infinite sequence of identical tanks T1, T2, . . . , Tn, . . . , initially contain W gallons each of
       pure water. They are hooked together so that fluid drains from Tn into Tn+1 (n = 1, 2,    ). A salt
       solution is circulated through the tanks so that it enters and leaves each tank at the constant rate of

       r gal/min. The solution has a concentration of c pounds of salt per gallon when it enters T1.

(a) Find the concentration cn(t) in tank Tn for t > 0.
(b) Find limt cn(t) for each n.

21. Tanks T1 and T2 have capacities W1 and W2 liters, respectively. Initially they are both full of dye
       solutions with concentrations c1 and c2 grams per liter. Starting at t0 = 0, the solution from T1 is
       pumped into T2 at a rate of r liters per minute, and the solution from T2 is pumped into T1 at the
       same rate.

(a) Find the concentrations c1(t) and c2(t) of the dye in T1 and T2 for t > 0.
(b) Find limt c1(t) and limt c2(t).

22. L Consider the mixing problem of Example 4.2.3, but without the assumption that the mixture

is stirred instantly so that the salt is always uniformly distributed throughout the mixture. Assume

instead that the distribution approaches uniformity as t  . In this case the differential equation

for Q is of the form

                      Q + a(t) Q = 2
                             150

where limt a(t) = 1.

(a) Assuming that Q(0) = Q0, can you guess the value of limt Q(t)?.

23. L Consider the mixing problem of Example 4.2.4 in a tank with infinite capacity, but without
       the assumption that the mixture is stirred instantly so that the salt is always uniformly distributed

       this case the differential equation for Q is of the form

                                                      Q + a(t) Q = 1

4.3 ELEMENTARY MECHANICS

Newton's Second Law of Motion

In this section we consider an object with constant mass m moving along a line under a force F . Let
y = y(t) be the displacement of the object from a reference point on the line at time t, and let v = v(t)
and a = a(t) be the velocity and acceleration of the object at time t. Thus, v = y and a = v = y ,
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to t. Newton's second law of motion asserts that the
force F and the acceleration a are related by the equation

                          F = ma.                                            (4.3.1)

Units

In applications there are three main sets of units in use for length, mass, force, and time: the cgs, mks, and
British systems. All three use the second as the unit of time. Table 1 shows the other units. Consistent
with (4.3.1), the unit of force in each system is defined to be the force required to impart an acceleration
of (one unit of length)/s2 to one unit of mass.

            cgs         Length         Force                       Mass

          British                   newton (N)                kilogram (kg)
                      meter (m)     pound (lb)                   slug (sl)
                       foot (ft)

                          Table 1.

   If we assume that Earth is a perfect sphere with constant mass density, Newton's law of gravitation
(discussed later in this section) asserts that the force exerted on an object by Earth's gravitational field
is proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the
center of Earth. However, if the object remains sufficiently close to Earth's surface, we may assume that
the gravitational force is constant and equal to its value at the surface. The magnitude of this force is
mg, where g is called the acceleration due to gravity. (To be completely accurate, g should be called
the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity at Earth's surface.) This quantity has been determined
experimentally. Approximate values of g are

                   g = 980 cm/s2           (cgs)
                   g = 9.8 m/s2            (mks)
                                           (British).
                   g = 32 ft/s2

In general, the force F in (4.3.1) may depend upon t, y, and y . Since a = y , (4.3.1) can be written in

the form

                          my = F (t, y, y ),                                 (4.3.2)

which is a second order equation. We'll consider this equation with restrictions on F later; however, since
Chapter 2 dealt only with first order equations, we consider here only problems in which (4.3.2) can be
recast as a first order equation. This is possible if F does not depend on y, so (4.3.2) is of the form

                          my = F (t, y ).

Letting v = y and v = y yields a first order equation for v:

                          mv = F (t, v).                                     (4.3.3)
152 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations

Solving this equation yields v as a function of t. If we know y(t0) for some time t0, we can integrate v to
obtain y as a function of t.

   Equations of the form (4.3.3) occur in problems involving motion through a resisting medium.

Motion Through a Resisting Medium Under Constant Gravitational Force

Now we consider an object moving vertically in some medium. We assume that the only forces acting on
the object are gravity and resistance from the medium. We also assume that the motion takes place close
to Earth's surface and take the upward direction to be positive, so the gravitational force can be assumed
to have the constant value -mg. We'll see that, under reasonable assumptions on the resisting force, the
velocity approaches a limit as t  . We call this limit the terminal velocity.

Example 4.3.1 An object with mass m moves under constant gravitational force through a medium that
exerts a resistance with magnitude proportional to the speed of the object. (Recall that the speed of an
object is |v|, the absolute value of its velocity v.) Find the velocity of the object as a function of t, and
find the terminal velocity. Assume that the initial velocity is v0.

Solution The total force acting on the object is

                                         F = -mg + F1,          (4.3.4)

where -mg is the force due to gravity and F1 is the resisting force of the medium, which has magnitude
k|v|, where k is a positive constant. If the object is moving downward (v  0), the resisting force is
upward (Figure 4.3.1(a)), so

                                             F1 = k|v| = k(-v) = -kv.

On the other hand, if the object is moving upward (v  0), the resisting force is downward (Fig-
ure 4.3.1(b)), so

                                                  F1 = -k|v| = -kv.

Thus, (4.3.4) can be written as

                                         F = -mg - kv,          (4.3.5)

regardless of the sign of the velocity.
   From Newton's second law of motion,

                                         F = ma = mv ,

so (4.3.5) yields

                                         mv = -mg - kv,

or                                       v + k v = -g.

                                                  m             (4.3.6)

Since e-kt/m is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of (4.3.6) are of the form v =
ue-kt/m, where u e-kt/m = -g, so u = -gekt/m. Hence,

so                                       u = - mg ekt/m + c,    (4.3.7)
Since v(0) = v0,                                   k

                                 v = ue-kt/m = - mg + ce-kt/m.

Example 4.3.2 A 960-lb object is given an initial upward velocity of 60 ft/s near the surface of Earth.
The atmosphere resists the motion with a force of 3 lb for each ft/s of speed. Assuming that the only other
force acting on the object is constant gravity, find its velocity v as a function of t, and find its terminal
velocity.

Solution Since mg = 960 and g = 32, m = 960/32 = 30. The atmospheric resistance is -3v lb if v is
expressed in feet per second. Therefore

                                     30v = -960 - 3v,

which we rewrite as                  v + 1 v = -32.

Since e-t/10 is a solution of the complementary equation, the solutions of this equation are of the form
v = ue-t/10, where u e-t/10 = -32, so u = -32et/10. Hence,

                                                   u = -320et/10 + c,

so

                          v = ue-t/10 = -320 + ce-t/10.                                             (4.3.8)

The initial velocity is 60 ft/s in the upward (positive) direction; hence, v0 = 60. Substituting t = 0 and
v = 60 in (4.3.8) yields

                                                     60 = -320 + c,

so c = 380, and (4.3.8) becomes v = -320 + 380e-t/10 ft/s

The terminal velocity is

                          lim v(t) = -320 ft/s.

Example 4.3.3 A 10 kg mass is given an initial velocity v0  0 near Earth's surface. The only forces
acting on it are gravity and atmospheric resistance proportional to the square of the speed. Assuming that
the resistance is 8 N if the speed is 2 m/s, find the velocity of the object as a function of t, and find the
terminal velocity.

Solution Since the object is falling, the resistance is in the upward (positive) direction. Hence,  (4.3.9)
                                                  mv = -mg + kv2,
                                                                  Section 4.3 Elementary Mechanics 155

where k is a constant. Since the magnitude of the resistance is 8 N when v = 2 m/s,

                                               k(22) = 8,

so k = 2 N-s2/m2. Since m = 10 and g = 9.8, (4.3.9) becomes                          (4.3.10)
                                          10v = -98 + 2v2 = 2(v2 - 49).

If v0 = -7, then v  -7 for all t  0. If v0 = -7, we separate variables to obtain     (4.3.11)
                                                         1 v = 1,

                                                     v2 - 49 5
which is convenient for the required partial fraction expansion

                             1 = 1 =1 1 - 1 .                                        (4.3.12)
                         v2 - 49 (v - 7)(v + 7) 14 v - 7 v + 7

Substituting (4.3.12) into (4.3.11) yields

                         1 1 - 1 v = 1,
                         14 v - 7 v + 7                              5

so                                          1 - 1 v = 14 .

                                           v-7 v+7                5

Integrating this yields

                         ln |v - 7| - ln |v + 7| = 14t/5 + k.

Therefore                                   v - 7 = eke14t/5.
                                            v+7

Since Theorem 2.3.1 implies that (v - 7)/(v + 7) can't change sign (why?), we can rewrite the last

equation as                                 v - 7 = ce14t/5,
                                            v+7
                                                                                     (4.3.13)

which is an implicit solution of (4.3.10). Solving this for v yields

                                                    c + e-14t/5
                                            v = -7      -14t/5 .                     (4.3.14)
                                                    c-e

Since v(0) = v0, it (4.3.13) implies that   c = v0 - 7 .
                                                 v0 + 7

Substituting this into (4.3.14) and simplifying yields

                                              v0(1 + e-14t/5) - 7(1 - e-14t/5)
                                     v = -7 v0(1 - e-14t/5) - 7(1 + e-14t/5 .
Since v0  0, v is defined and negative for all t > 0. The terminal velocity is

                                            lim v(t) = -7 m/s,

                                            t

independent of v0. More generally, it can be shown (Exercise 11) that if v is any solution of (4.3.9) such

that v0  0 then

Example 4.3.4 A 10-kg mass is launched vertically upward from Earth's surface with an initial velocity
of v0 m/s. The only forces acting on the mass are gravity and atmospheric resistance proportional to the
square of the speed. Assuming that the atmospheric resistance is 8 N if the speed is 2 m/s, find the time
T required for the mass to reach maximum altitude.

Solution The mass will climb while v > 0 and reach its maximum altitude when v = 0. Therefore v > 0
for 0  t < T and v(T ) = 0. Although the mass of the object and our assumptions concerning the forces
acting on it are the same as those in Example 3, (4.3.10) does not apply here, since the resisting force is
negative if v > 0; therefore, we replace (4.3.10) by

                                     10v = -98 - 2v2.                                                                                     (4.3.15)

Separating variables yields                 5 v = -1,
                                        v2 + 49

and integrating this yields          5 tan-1 v = -t + c.

(Recall that tan-1 u is the number  such that -/2 <  < /2 and tan  = u.) Since v(0) = v0,

                                        c = 5 tan-1 v0 ,

Using the identity

                                tan(A - B) = tan A - tan B
                                                   1 + tan A tan B

with A = tan-1(v0/7) and B = 7t/5, and noting that tan(tan-1 ) = , we can simplify (4.3.17) to

                                v = 7 v0 - 7 tan(7t/5) .
                                       7 + v0 tan(7t/5)

Since v(T ) = 0 and tan-1(0) = 0, (4.3.16) implies that

                                -T + 5 tan-1 v0 = 0.

Escape Velocity

Suppose a space vehicle is launched vertically and its fuel is exhausted when the vehicle reaches an
altitude h above Earth, where h is sufficiently large so that resistance due to Earth's atmosphere can be
neglected. Let t = 0 be the time when burnout occurs. Assuming that the gravitational forces of all other
celestial bodies can be neglected, the motion of the vehicle for t > 0 is that of an object with constant
mass m under the influence of Earth's gravitational force, which we now assume to vary inversely with
the square of the distance from Earth's center; thus, if we take the upward direction to be positive then
gravitational force on the vehicle at an altitude y above Earth is

                                     F =-  K                                               (4.3.18)
                                                2,
                                           (y + R)

where R is Earth's radius (Figure 4.3.5).
   Since F = -mg when y = 0, setting y = 0 in (4.3.18) yields

                                                                    K
                                                      -mg = - 2 ;

                                                                   R
therefore K = mgR2 and (4.3.18) can be written more specifically as

                                     F =-  mgR2                               2.           (4.3.19)

From Newton's second law of motion,           d2y

so (4.3.19) implies that

                              d2y              =-   gR2    2.                            (4.3.20)

                              dt2                   (y + R)

We'll show that there's a number ve, called the escape velocity, with these properties:

1. If v0  ve then v(t) > 0 for all t > 0, and the vehicle continues to climb for all t > 0; that is,
   it "escapes" Earth. (Is it really so obvious that limt y(t) =  in this case? For a proof, see
   Exercise 20.)

2. If v0 < ve then v(t) decreases to zero and becomes negative. Therefore the vehicle attains a
   maximum altitude ym and falls back to Earth.

   Since (4.3.20) is second order, we can't solve it by methods discussed so far. However, we're concerned
with v rather than y, and v is easier to find. Since v = y the chain rule implies that

                          d2y = dv = dv dy = v dv .
                          dt2 dt dy dt dy

Substituting this into (4.3.20) yields the first order separable equation

                              v =-                           2.                          (4.3.21)
                              dy (y + R)

When t = 0, the velocity is v0 and the altitude is h. Therefore we can obtain v as a function of y by
solving the initial value problem

                          dv                   gR2
                          v =-                      2,  v(h) = v0.
                          dy (y + R)

Integrating (4.3.21) with respect to y yields

                              v2 = gR2 + c.                                              (4.3.22)
                              2 y+R

Since v(h) = v0,                   c = v02 - gR2 ,
so (4.3.22) becomes                      2 h+R

                          v2 = gR2 + v02 - gR2 .                                         (4.3.23)
                          2 y+R 2 h+R

If
                                                            2gR2 1/2

                                                  v0  h + R ,

the parenthetical expression in (4.3.23) is nonnegative, so v(y) > 0 for y > h. This proves that there's an
escape velocity ve. We'll now prove that

                              ve =                  2gR2 1/2
                                                    h+R

by showing that the vehicle falls back to Earth if

                              v0 <                  2gR2 1/2                             (4.3.24)
                                                    h+R .
160 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations

If (4.3.24) holds then the parenthetical expression in (4.3.23) is negative and the vehicle will attain a
maximum altitude ym > h that satisfies the equation

0 = gR2 + v02 - gR2 .
ym + R  2 h+R

The velocity will be zero at the maximum altitude, and the object will then fall to Earth under the influence
of gravity.

                                                                 k

4.4 AUTONOMOUS SECOND ORDER EQUATIONS

A second order differential equation that can be written as

                             y = F (y, y )                                                (4.4.1)

where F is independent of t, is said to be autonomous. An autonomous second order equation can be
converted into a first order equation relating v = y and y. If we let v = y , (4.4.1) becomes

                             v = F (y, v).                                                (4.4.2)

Since                        v = dv = dv dy = v dv ,
                                    dt dy dt dy
                                                                                          (4.4.3)

(4.4.2) can be rewritten as  v dv = F (y, v).
                              dy
                                                                                          (4.4.4)

The integral curves of (4.4.4) can be plotted in the (y, v) plane, which is called the Poincar phase plane
of (4.4.1). If y is a solution of (4.4.1) then y = y(t), v = y (t) is a parametric equation for an integral
                                                Section 4.4 Autonomous Second Order Equations 163

curve of (4.4.4). We'll call these integral curves trajectories of (4.4.1), and we'll call (4.4.4) the phase
plane equivalent of (4.4.1).

   In this section we'll consider autonomous equations that can be written as

                          y + q(y, y )y + p(y) = 0.                              (4.4.5)

Equations of this form often arise in applications of Newton's second law of motion. For example,
suppose y is the displacement of a moving object with mass m. It's reasonable to think of two types
of time-independent forces acting on the object. One type - such as gravity - depends only on position.
We could write such a force as -mp(y). The second type - such as atmospheric resistance or friction -
may depend on position and velocity. (Forces that depend on velocity are called damping forces.) We
write this force as -mq(y, y )y , where q(y, y ) is usually a positive function and we've put the factor y
outside to make it explicit that the force is in the direction opposing the motion. In this case Newton's,
second law of motion leads to (4.4.5).

   The phase plane equivalent of (4.4.5) is

                          v dv + q(y, v)v + p(y) = 0.                            (4.4.6)
                           dy

Some statements that we'll be making about the properties of (4.4.5) and (4.4.6) are intuitively reasonable,
but difficult to prove. Therefore our presentation in this section will be informal: we'll just say things
without proof, all of which are true if we assume that p = p(y) is continuously differentiable for all y and
q = q(y, v) is continuously differentiable for all (y, v). We begin with the following statements:

 Statement 1. If y0 and v0 are arbitrary real numbers then (4.4.5) has a unique solution on (-, )
  such that y(0) = y0 and y (0) = v0.

 Statement 2.) If y = y(t) is a solution of (4.4.5) and  is any constant then y1 = y(t -  ) is also a
  solution of (4.4.5), and y and y1 have the same trajectory.

 Statement 3. If two solutions y and y1 of (4.4.5) have the same trajectory then y1(t) = y(t -  )
  for some constant  .

 Statement 4. Distinct trajectories of (4.4.5) can't intersect; that is, if two trajectories of (4.4.5)
  intersect, they are identical.

 Statement 5. If the trajectory of a solution of (4.4.5) is a closed curve then (y(t), v(t)) traverses
  the trajectory in a finite time T , and the solution is periodic with period T ; that is, y(t + T ) = y(t)
  for all t in (-, ).

   If y is a constant such that p(y) = 0 then y  y is a constant solution of (4.4.5). We say that y is an
equilibrium of (4.4.5) and (y, 0) is a critical point of the phase plane equivalent equation (4.4.6). We say
that the equilibrium and the critical point are stable if, for any given > 0 no matter how small, there's a
 > 0, sufficiently small, such that if

                          (y0                   -  y)2  +  v2   <  

                                                             0

then the solution of the initial value problem

                          y + q(y, y )y + p(y) = 0, y(0) = y0,       y (0) = v0

satisfies the inequality

                          (y(t) - y)2 + (v(t))2 <
164 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations
for all t > 0. Figure 4.4.1 illustrates the geometrical interpretation of this definition in the Poincar phase
plane: if (y0, v0) is in the smaller shaded circle (with radius ), then (y(t), v(t)) must be in in the larger
circle (with radius ) for all t > 0.

                                                                                                                     y

                                                                               y

Figure 4.4.1 Stability: if (y0, v0) is in the smaller circle then (y(t), v(t)) is in the larger circle for all
                                                         t>0

   If an equilibrium and the associated critical point are not stable, we say they are unstable. To see if
you really understand what stable means, try to give a direct definition of unstable (Exercise 22). We'll
illustrate both definitions in the following examples.

The Undamped Case

We'll begin with the case where q  0, so (4.4.5) reduces to

                         y + p(y) = 0.     (4.4.7)

We say that this equation - as well as any physical situation that it may model - is undamped. The phase
plane equivalent of (4.4.7) is the separable equation

                         v dv + p(y) = 0.
                          dy

Integrating this yields

                         v2 + P (y) = c,   (4.4.8)
                         2

where c is a constant of integration and P (y) = p(y) dy is an antiderivative of p.
   If (4.4.7) is the equation of motion of an object of mass m, then mv2/2 is the kinetic energy and

mP (y) is the potential energy of the object; thus, (4.4.8) says that the total energy of the object remains
                                                         Section 4.4 Autonomous Second Order Equations 165

constant, or is conserved. In particular, if a trajectory passes through a given point (y0, v0) then
                                                    c = v02 + P (y0).
                                                           2

Example 4.4.1 [The Undamped Spring - Mass System] Consider an object with mass m suspended from
a spring and moving vertically. Let y be the displacement of the object from the position it occupies when
suspended at rest from the spring (Figure 4.4.2).

                            y

                               (a)                (b)                   (c)

                            Figure 4.4.2 (a) y > 0 (b) y = 0 (c) y < 0

   Assume that if the length of the spring is changed by an amount L (positive or negative), then the
spring exerts an opposing force with magnitude k|L|, where k is a positive constant. In Section 6.1 it
will be shown that if the mass of the spring is negligible compared to m and no other forces act on the
object then Newton's second law of motion implies that

                                    my = -ky,                                (4.4.9)

which can be written in the form (4.4.7) with p(y) = ky/m. This equation can be solved easily by a
method that we'll study in Section 5.2, but that method isn't available here. Instead, we'll consider the
phase plane equivalent of (4.4.9).

   From (4.4.3), we can rewrite (4.4.9) as the separable equation

                                    mv dv = -ky.
                                        dy

Integrating this yields

                                        mv2 + ky2 =                                                                                      (4.4.10)

( = 2c). This defines an ellipse in the Poincar phase plane (Figure 4.4.3).

   We can identify  by setting t = 0 in (4.4.10); thus,  = mv02 + ky02, where y0 = y(0) and v0 = v(0).
To determine the maximum and minimum values of y we set v = 0 in (4.4.10); thus,

                             ymax = R and ymin = -R, with R =  .                                                                         (4.4.11)

Equation (4.4.9) has exactly one equilibrium, y = 0, and it's stable. You can see intuitively why this is
so: if the object is displaced in either direction from equilibrium, the spring tries to bring it back.

   In this case we can find y explicitly as a function of t. (Don't expect this to happen in more complicated
problems!) If v > 0 on an interval I, (4.4.10) implies that

                               dy = v =         - ky2
                               dt                 m

on I. This is equivalent to

                             k dy = 0, where 0 = k .

Since                        
                               k dy = sin-1

(see (4.4.11)), (4.4.12) implies that that there's a constant  such that

                                                 sin-1 y = 0t +

or
                                                   y = R sin(0t + )

for all t in I. Although we obtained this function by assuming that v > 0, you can easily verify that y
satisfies (4.4.9) for all values of t. Thus, the displacement varies periodically between -R and R, with
period T = 2/0 (Figure 4.4.4). (If you've taken a course in elementary mechanics you may recognize
this as simple harmonic motion.)

Example 4.4.2 [The Undamped Pendulum] Now we consider the motion of a pendulum with mass m,
attached to the end of a weightless rod with length L that rotates on a frictionless axle (Figure 4.4.5). We
assume that there's no air resistance.

   Let y be the angle measured from the rest position (vertically downward) of the pendulum, as shown in
Figure 4.4.5. Newton's second law of motion says that the product of m and the tangential acceleration
equals the tangential component of the gravitational force; therefore, from Figure 4.4.5,

mLy = -mg sin y,

or g
y = - L sin y.                    (4.4.13)

   Since sin n = 0 if n is any integer, (4.4.13) has infinitely many equilibria yn = n. If n is even, the
mass is directly below the axle (Figure 4.4.6 (a)) and gravity opposes any deviation from the equilibrium.

However, if n is odd, the mass is directly above the axle (Figure 4.4.6 (b)) and gravity increases any

deviation from the equilibrium. Therefore we conclude on physical grounds that y2m = 2m is stable
and y2m+1 = (2m + 1) is unstable.

   The phase plane equivalent of (4.4.13) is

                            v dv = - g sin y,
                             dy L

where v = y is the angular velocity of the pendulum. Integrating this yields

                            v2 = g cos y + c.                                    (4.4.14)

If v = v0 when y = 0, then        c = v02 - g ,
so (4.4.14) becomes                     2L
which is equivalent to
where                       v2 = v02 - g (1 - cos y) = v02 - 2g sin2 y ,

The curves defined by (4.4.15) are the trajectories of (4.4.13). They are periodic with period 2 in y,

which isn't surprising, since if y = y(t) is a solution of (4.4.13) then so is yn = y(t) + 2n for any

integer n. Figure 4.4.7 shows trajectories over the interval [-, ]. From (4.4.15), you can see that if

|v0| > vc then v is nonzero for all t, which means that the object whirls in the same direction forever, as in

Figure 4.4.8. The trajectories associated with this whirling motion are above the upper dashed curve and

below the lower dashed curve in Figure 4.4.7. You can also see from (4.4.15) that if 0 < |v0| < vc,then

v = 0 when y = 콃max, where  ymax = 2 sin-1(|v0|/vc).

In this case the pendulum oscillates periodically between -ymax and ymax, as shown in Figure 4.4.9. The
trajectories associated with this kind of motion are the ovals between the dashed curves in Figure 4.4.7.
It can be shown (see Exercise 21 for a partial proof) that the period of the oscillation is

                                             /2       d .               (4.4.16)

                                           0               0

Although this integral can't be evaluated in terms of familiar elementary functions, you can see that it's

finite if |v0| < vc.
   The dashed curves in Figure 4.4.7 contain four trajectories. The critical points (, 0) and (-, 0) are

the trajectories of the unstable equilibrium solutions y = . The upper dashed curve connecting (but
not including) them is obtained from initial conditions of the form y(t0) = 0, v(t0) = vc. If y is any
solution with this trajectory then

                             lim y(t) =  and lim y(t) = -.
t                                                     t-

The lower dashed curve connecting (but not including) them is obtained from initial conditions of the
form y(t0) = 0, v(t0) = -vc. If y is any solution with this trajectory then

                             lim y(t) = - and lim y(t) = .
t                                                     t-

Consistent with this, the integral (4.4.16) diverges to  if v0 = 콀c. (Exercise 21) .
   Since the dashed curves separate trajectories of whirling solutions from trajectories of oscillating solu-

tions, each of these curves is called a separatrix.
   In general, if (4.4.7) has both stable and unstable equilibria then the separatrices are the curves given

by (4.4.8) that pass through unstable critical points. Thus, if (y, 0) is an unstable critical point, then

                                                  v2 + P (y) = P (y)    (4.4.17)
                                                   2
defines a separatrix passing through (y, 0).

Stability and Instability Conditions for y + p(y) = 0
It can be shown (Exercise 23) that an equilibrium y of an undamped equation

    y + p(y) = 0                                                                                                                                            (4.4.18)

is stable if there's an open interval (a, b) containing y such that

p(y) < 0 if a < y < y and p(y) > 0 if y < y < b.                                                                                                            (4.4.19)

If we regard p(y) as a force acting on a unit mass, (4.4.19) means that the force resists all sufficiently
small displacements from y.

   We've already seen examples illustrating this principle. The equation (4.4.9) for the undamped spring-
mass system is of the form (4.4.18) with p(y) = ky/m, which has only the stable equilibrium y = 0. In
this case (4.4.19) holds with a = - and b = . The equation (4.4.13) for the undamped pendulum is
of the form (4.4.18) with p(y) = (g/L) sin y. We've seen that y = 2m is a stable equilibrium if m is an
integer. In this case

                                   p(y) = sin y < 0 if (2m - 1) < y < 2m

and
                                        p(y) > 0 if 2m < y < (2m + 1).
                                           Section 4.4 Autonomous Second Order Equations 171

It can also be shown (Exercise 24) that y is unstable if there's a b > y such that

                                p(y) < 0 if y < y < b                                             (4.4.20)

or an a < y such that

                                p(y) > 0 if a < y < y.                                            (4.4.21)

If we regard p(y) as a force acting on a unit mass, (4.4.20) means that the force tends to increase all
sufficiently small positive displacements from y, while (4.4.21) means that the force tends to increase the
magnitude of all sufficiently small negative displacements from y.

   The undamped pendulum also illustrates this principle. We've seen that y = (2m + 1) is an unstable
equilibrium if m is an integer. In this case

                            sin y < 0 if (2m + 1) < y < (2m + 2),

so (4.4.20) holds with b = (2m + 2), and

                                sin y > 0 if 2m < y < (2m + 1),

so (4.4.21) holds with a = 2m.

Example 4.4.3 The equation

                                y + y(y - 1) = 0                                                  (4.4.22)

is of the form (4.4.18) with p(y) = y(y - 1). Therefore y = 0 and y = 1 are the equilibria of (4.4.22).
Since

                            y(y - 1) > 0   if y < 0 or y > 1,
                                       <0  if 0 < y < 1,

y = 0 is unstable and y = 1 is stable.
   The phase plane equivalent of (4.4.22) is the separable equation

                                v dv + y(y - 1) = 0.
                                 dy

Integrating yields

                                v2 + y3 - y2 = C,
                                232

which we rewrite as             v2 + 1 y2(2y - 3) = c

after renaming the constant of integration. These are the trajectories of (4.4.22). If y is any solution of

(4.4.22), the point (y(t), v(t)) moves along the trajectory of y in the direction of increasing y in the upper

half plane (v = y > 0), or in the direction of decreasing y in the lower half plane (v = y < 0).

Figure 4.4.10 shows typical trajectories. The dashed curve through the critical point (0, 0), obtained by

setting c = 0 in (4.4.23), separates the y-v plane into regions that contain different kinds of trajectories;

again, we call this curve a separatrix. Trajectories in the region bounded by the closed loop (b) are closed

curves, so solutions associated with them are periodic. Solutions associated with other trajectories are not

periodic. If y is any such solution with trajectory not on the separatrix, then

   The separatrix contains four trajectories of (4.4.22). One is the point (0, 0), the trajectory of the equi-
librium y = 0. Since distinct trajectories can't intersect, the segments of the separatrix marked (a), (b),
and (c) - which don't include (0, 0) - are distinct trajectories, none of which can be traversed in finite
time. Solutions with these trajectories have the following asymptotic behavior:

The Damped Case

The phase plane equivalent of the damped autonomous equation

                             y + q(y, y )y + p(y) = 0                                         (4.4.24)

is
                                              v dv + q(y, v)v + p(y) = 0.
                                               dy

This equation isn't separable, so we can't solve it for v in terms of y, as we did in the undamped case,
and conservation of energy doesn't hold. (For example, energy expended in overcoming friction is lost.)
However, we can study the qualitative behavior of its solutions by rewriting it as

                             dv = -q(y, v) - p(y)                                             (4.4.25)
                             dy                                                v
                                       Section 4.4 Autonomous Second Order Equations 173

and considering the direction fields for this equation. In the following examples we'll also be showing
computer generated trajectories of this equation, obtained by numerical methods. The exercises call for
similar computations. The methods discussed in Chapter 3 are not suitable for this task, since p(y)/v in
(4.4.25) is undefined on the y axis of the Poincar phase plane. Therefore we're forced to apply numerical
methods briefly discussed in Section 10.1 to the system

                                   y =v
                                   v = -q(y, v)v - p(y),

which is equivalent to (4.4.24) in the sense defined in Section 10.1. Fortunately, most differential equation
software packages enable you to do this painlessly.

   In the text we'll confine ourselves to the case where q is constant, so (4.4.24) and (4.4.25) reduce to

                                   y + cy + p(y) = 0      (4.4.26)

and                                dv = -c - p(y) .

                                   dy  v

(We'll consider more general equations in the exercises.) The constant c is called the damping constant.
In situations where (4.4.26) is the equation of motion of an object, c is positive; however, there are
situations where c may be negative.

The Damped Spring-Mass System

Earlier we considered the spring - mass system under the assumption that the only forces acting on the

object were gravity and the spring's resistance to changes in its length. Now we'll assume that some

mechanism (for example, friction in the spring or atmospheric resistance) opposes the motion of the

object with a force proportional to its velocity. In Section 6.1 it will be shown that in this case Newton's

second law of motion implies that

                                   my + cy + ky = 0,      (4.4.27)

where c > 0 is the damping constant. Again, this equation can be solved easily by a method that
we'll study in Section 5.2, but that method isn't available here. Instead, we'll consider its phase plane
equivalent, which can be written in the form (4.4.25) as

                                   dv = - c - ky .        (4.4.28)
                                   dy m mv

(A minor note: the c in (4.4.26) actually corresponds to c/m in this equation.) Figure 4.4.11 shows a
typical direction field for an equation of this form. Recalling that motion along a trajectory must be in the
direction of increasing y in the upper half plane (v > 0) and in the direction of decreasing y in the lower
half plane (v < 0), you can infer that all trajectories approach the origin in clockwise fashion. To confirm
this, Figure 4.4.12 shows the same direction field with some trajectories filled in. All the trajectories
shown there correspond to solutions of the initial value problem

       my + cy + ky = 0, y(0) = y0, y (0) = v0,

where

       mv02 + ky02 =  (a positive constant);

thus, if there were no damping (c = 0), all the solutions would have the same dashed elliptic trajectory,
shown in Figure 4.4.14.

zeros in this case.) Figure 4.4.14 shows a direction field and some integral curves for (4.4.28) in this case.

Example 4.4.4 (The Damped Pendulum) Now we return to the pendulum. If we assume that some
mechanism (for example, friction in the axle or atmospheric resistance) opposes the motion of the pen-
dulum with a force proportional to its angular velocity, Newton's second law of motion implies that

                                    mLy = -cy - mg sin y,                                        (4.4.29)

c/mL in this equation.) To plot a direction field for (4.4.29) we write its phase plane equivalent as
                                                dv = - c - g sin y.

Figure 4.4.15 shows trajectories of four solutions of (4.4.29), all satisfying y(0) = 0. For each m = 0, 1,
2, 3, imparting the initial velocity v(0) = vm causes the pendulum to make m complete revolutions and
then settle into decaying oscillation about the stable equilibrium y = 2m.

of the parameter a. Find the equilibria of the equation and classify them as stable or unstable. Explain
why the phase plane plots corresponding to positive and negative values of a differ so markedly. Can you

electrical circuit whose resistive properties depend upon the current. The damping term
-(1 - y2)y works to reduce |y| if |y| < 1 or to increase |y| if |y| > 1. It can be shown that
van der Pol's equation has exactly one closed trajectory, which is called a limit cycle. Trajectories

4.5 APPLICATIONS TO CURVES

One-Parameter Families of Curves

We begin with two examples of families of curves generated by varying a parameter over a set of real
numbers.

Example 4.5.1 For each value of the parameter c, the equation                           (4.5.1)
                                                       y - cx2 = 0

defines a curve in the xy-plane. If c = 0, the curve is a parabola through the origin, opening upward if
c > 0 or downward if c < 0. If c = 0, the curve is the x axis (Figure 4.5.1).

                                  y

                                                                                     x

                             Figure 4.5.1 A family of curves defined by y - cx2 = 0     (4.5.2)

Example 4.5.2 For each value of the parameter c the equation
                                                         y = x+c

defines a line with slope 1(Figure 4.5.2).

Definition 4.5.1 An equation that can be written in the form

                                  H(x, y, c) = 0                                        (4.5.3)

is said to define a one-parameter family of curves if, for each value of c in in some nonempty set of real
numbers, the set of points (x, y) that satisfy (4.5.3) forms a curve in the xy-plane.

                                                                                                                                                                                x
                                                                                      y

                                                                                                                                     x

Figure 4.5.2 A family of lines defined by y = x + c                                                                                     Figure 4.5.3 A family of circles defined by
                                                                                                                                                       x2 + y2 - c2 = 0

   Equations (4.5.1) and (4.5.2) define one-parameter families of curves. (Although (4.5.2) isn't in the
form (4.5.3), it can be written in this form as y - x - c = 0.)

Example 4.5.3 If c > 0, the graph of the equation

                            x2 + y2 - c = 0                                                                                             (4.5.4)

is a circle with center at (0, 0) and radius c. If c = 0, the graph is the single point (0, 0). (We don't
regard a single point as a curve.) If c < 0, the equation has no graph. Hence, (4.5.4) defines a one-
parameter family of curves for positive values of c. This family consists of all circles centered at (0, 0)
(Figure 4.5.3).

Example 4.5.4 The equation

                            x2 + y2 + c2 = 0

does not define a one-parameter family of curves, since no (x, y) satisfies the equation if c = 0, and only
the single point (0, 0) satisfies it if c = 0.

   Recall from Section 1.2 that the graph of a solution of a differential equation is called an integral curve
of the equation. Solving a first order differential equation usually produces a one-parameter family of
integral curves of the equation. Here we are interested in the converse problem: given a one-parameter
family of curves, is there a first order differential equation for which every member of the family is an
integral curve. This suggests the next definition.

Definition 4.5.2 If every curve in a one-parameter family defined by the equation

                            H(x, y, c) = 0                                                                                              (4.5.5)

is an integral curve of the first order differential equation

                            F (x, y, y ) = 0,                                                                                           (4.5.6)

then (4.5.6) is said to be a differential equation for the family.
                                                                                    Section 4.5 Applications to Curves 181

   To find a differential equation for a one-parameter family we differentiate its defining equation (4.5.5)
implicitly with respect to x, to obtain

                                             Hx(x, y, c) + Hy(x, y, c)y = 0.                                                   (4.5.7)

If this equation doesn't, then it's a differential equation for the family. If it does contain c, it may be
possible to obtain a differential equation for the family by eliminating c between (4.5.5) and (4.5.7).

Example 4.5.5 Find a differential equation for the family of curves defined by

                                                                 y = cx2.                                                      (4.5.8)

Solution Differentiating (4.5.8) with respect to x yields

                                                         y = 2cx.

Therefore c = y /2x, and substituting this into (4.5.8) yields

                                                          y = xy
                                                                 2

as a differential equation for the family of curves defined by (4.5.8). The graph of any function of the
form y = cx2 is an integral curve of this equation.

   The next example shows that members of a given family of curves may be obtained by joining integral
curves for more than one differential equation.

Example 4.5.6
(a) Try to find a differential equation for the family of lines tangent to the parabola y = x2.
(b) Find two tangent lines to the parabola y = x2 that pass through (2, 3), and find the points of

      tangency.

SOLUTION(a) The equation of the line through a given point (x0, y0) with slope m is

                                                    y = y0 + m(x - x0).                                                        (4.5.9)

If  (x0,  y0)  is  on  the  parabola,  then  y0  =  x2   and  the   slope  of  the  tangent  line  through  (x0,  x20)  is  m  =  2x0;

                                                      0

hence, (4.5.9) becomes

                                                    y  =      2  +  2x0(x  -   x0),

                                                            x0

or, equivalently,

                                                         y = -x20 + 2x0x.                                                   (4.5.10)

Here x0 plays the role of the constant c in Definition 4.5.1; that is, varying x0 over (-, ) produces
the family of tangent lines to the parabola y = x2.

    Differentiating (4.5.10) with respect to x yields y = 2x0.. We can express x0 in terms of x and y by

rewriting (4.5.10) as

                                                         2  -    2x0x  +  y  =  0

                                                       x0

and using the quadratic formula to obtain

                                                       x0 = x  x2 - y.                                                     (4.5.11)
182 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations

We must choose the plus sign in (4.5.11) if x < x0 and the minus sign if x > x0; thus,

                                  x0 = x + x2 - y if x < x0

and                                                    x2 - y  if x > x0.
                                          x0 = x -

Since y = 2x0, this implies that

                             y = 2 x + x2 - y , if x < x0                                   (4.5.12)

and

                           y = 2 x - x2 - y , if x > x0.                                    (4.5.13)

Neither (4.5.12) nor (4.5.13) is a differential equation for the family of tangent lines to the parabola
y = x2. However, if each tangent line is regarded as consisting of two tangent half lines joined at the

point of tangency, (4.5.12) is a differential equation for the family of tangent half lines on which x is less

than the abscissa of the point of tangency (Figure 4.5.4(a)), while (4.5.13) is a differential equation for

the family of tangent half lines on which x is greater than this abscissa (Figure 4.5.4(b)). The parabola
y = x2 is also an integral curve of both (4.5.12) and (4.5.13).

                        y                                                           y

                        (a)                                                         (b)

SOLUTION(b) From (4.5.10) the point (x, y) = (2, 3) is on the tangent line through (x0, x20) if and only

if

                                          3  =           2  +  4x0,

                                                    -x0

which is equivalent to

                               2  -  4x0  +  3      =  (x0  -  3)(x0  -  1)  =  0.

Letting x0 = 3 in (4.5.10) shows that (2, 3) is on the line
                                                      y = -9 + 6x,

which is tangent to the parabola at (x0, x20) = (3, 9), as shown in Figure 4.5.5
   Letting x0 = 1 in (4.5.10) shows that (2, 3) is on the line
                                                      y = -1 + 2x,

which is tangent to the parabola at (x0, x20) = (1, 1), as shown in Figure 4.5.5.

Geometric Problems
We now consider some geometric problems that can be solved by means of differential equations.

Example 4.5.7 Find curves y = y(x) such that every point (x0, y(x0)) on the curve is the midpoint of the
line segment with endpoints on the coordinate axes and tangent to the curve at (x0, y(x0)) (Figure 4.5.6).

Solution The equation of the line tangent to the curve at P = (x0, y(x0) is                        (4.5.14)
                                             y = y(x0) + y (x0)(x - x0).                           (4.5.15)

If we denote the x and y intercepts of the tangent line by xI and yI (Figure 4.5.6), then
                                             0 = y(x0) + y (x0)(xI - x0)

and
                                                yI = y(x0) - y (x0)x0.
184 Chapter 4 Applications of First Order Equations

From Figure 4.5.6, P is the midpoint of the line segment connecting (xI , 0) and (0, yI) if and only if
xI = 2x0 and yI = 2y(x0). Substituting the first of these conditions into (4.5.14) or the second into
(4.5.15) yields

                                                 y(x0) + y (x0)x0 = 0.

Since x0 is arbitrary we drop the subscript and conclude that y = y(x) satisfies

                                                             y + xy = 0,

which can be rewritten as

                                                             (xy) = 0.

Integrating yields xy = c, or                                y = c.
                                                                  x

If c = 0 this curve is the line y = 0, which does not satisfy the geometric requirements imposed by the
problem; thus, c = 0, and the solutions define a family of hyperbolas (Figure 4.5.7).

Example 4.5.8 Find curves y = y(x) such that the tangent line to the curve at any point (x0, y(x0))
                                 2
intersects  the  x-axis  at  (x  0  ,  0  ).  Figure  4.5.8  illustrates  the  situation  in  the  case  where  the  curve  is  in  the

first quadrant and 0 < x < 1.

Solution The equation of the line tangent to the curve at (x0, y(x0)) is
                                             y = y(x0) + y (x0)(x - x0).

Since (x20, 0) is on the tangent line,
                                            0 = y(x0) + y (x0)(x20 - x0).

Since x0 is arbitrary we drop the subscript and conclude that y = y(x) satisfies
                                                  y + y (x2 - x) = 0.

If c = 0, the graph of this function is the x-axis. If c = 0, it's a hyperbola with vertical asymptote x = 1
and horizontal asymptote y = c. Figure 4.5.9 shows the graphs for c = 0.

Orthogonal Trajectories

Two curves C1 and C2 are said to be orthogonal at a point of intersection (x0, y0) if they have perpen-
dicular tangents at (x0, y0). (Figure 4.5.10). A curve is said to be an orthogonal trajectory of a given
family of curves if it's orthogonal to every curve in the family. For example, every line through the origin

is an orthogonal trajectory of the family of circles centered at the origin. Conversely, any such circle is
an orthogonal trajectory of the family of lines through the origin (Figure 4.5.11).

   Orthogonal trajectories occur in many physical applications. For example, if u = u(x, y) is the tem-
perature at a point (x, y), the curves defined by

                                  u(x, y) = c                                                          (4.5.16)

are called isothermal curves. The orthogonal trajectories of this family are called heat-flow lines, because

at any given point the direction of maximum heat flow is perpendicular to the isothermal through the

point. If u represents the potential energy of an object moving under a force that depends upon (x, y), the

curves (4.5.16) are called equipotentials, and the orthogonal trajectories are called lines of force.

From analytic geometry we know that two nonvertical lines L1 and L2 with slopes m1 and m2, re-

spectively, are perpendicular if and only if m2 = -1/m1; therefore, the integral curves of the differential

                   m1 = f(x0, y0) and

   This suggests a method for finding orthogonal trajectories of a family of integral curves of a first order
equation.

                   Finding Orthogonal Trajectories

   Step 1. Find a differential equation      y = f(x, y)
for the given family.                       y =- 1

   Step 2. Solve the differential equation           f(x, y)

to find the orthogonal trajectories.

Example 4.5.9 Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of circles                                                                                                                  (4.5.17)
                                                x2 + y2 = c2 (c > 0).

Solution To find a differential equation for the family of circles we differentiate (4.5.17) implicitly with
respect to x to obtain

                                                     2x + 2yy = 0,
                                                                       Section 4.5 Applications to Curves 187

or x
                                                         y = -y.

Therefore the integral curves of  y =y
                                        x

are orthogonal trajectories of the given family. We leave it to you to verify that the general solution of
this equation is

                                                          y = kx,

where k is an arbitrary constant. This is the equation of a nonvertical line through (0, 0). The y axis is
also an orthogonal trajectory of the given family. Therefore every line through the origin is an orthogonal
trajectory of the given family (4.5.17) (Figure 4.5.11). This is consistent with the theorem of plane
geometry which states that a diameter of a circle and a tangent line to the circle at the end of the diameter
are perpendicular.

Example 4.5.10 Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of hyperbolas

                                  xy = c (c = 0)                                        (4.5.18)

(Figure 4.5.7).

Solution Differentiating (4.5.18) implicitly with respect to x yields

                                  y + xy = 0,

or y
                                                         y = -x;

thus, the integral curves of      y =x
                                        y

are orthogonal trajectories of the given family. Separating variables yields

                                  yy=x

and integrating yields

                                  y2 - x2 = k,

which is the equation of a hyperbola if k = 0, or of the lines y = x and y = -x if k = 0 (Figure 4.5.12).

Example 4.5.11 Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of circles defined by     (4.5.19)
                                            (x - c)2 + y2 = c2 (c = 0).

These circles are centered on the x-axis and tangent to the y-axis (Figure 4.5.13(a)).

Solution Multiplying out the left side of (4.5.19) yields                               (4.5.20)
                                                   x2 - 2cx + y2 = 0,

and differentiating this implicitly with respect to x yields

                2(x - c) + 2yy = 0.                                                                                    (4.5.21)

From (4.5.20),       c = x2 + y2 ,
so                           2x

                x - c = x - x2 + y2 = x2 - y2 .

Substituting this into (4.5.21) and solving for y yields

                     y = y2 - x2 .                                                                                     (4.5.22)
                              2xy

The curves defined by (4.5.19) are integral curves of (4.5.22), and the integral curves of

                              2xy
                     y= 2 2

                           x -y

are orthogonal trajectories of the family (4.5.19). This is a homogeneous nonlinear equation, which we
studied in Section 2.4. Substituting y = ux yields

                ux+u= 2   2x(ux)                          2=  2u   2,

                     x - (ux) 1 - u

so                   2u                                       u(u2 + 1)

                ux=  1-u  2 -u=                               1-u  2,

Separating variables yields

                                        1 - u2 u = 1 ,
                                      u(u2 + 1) x

or, equivalently,

                                      1 2u                     u = 1.

                                      u u +1                      x

Therefore

                                  ln |u| - ln(u2 + 1) = ln |x| + k.

By substituting u = y/x, we see that

                          ln |y| - ln |x| - ln(x2 + y2) + ln(x2) = ln |x| + k,

which, since ln(x2) = 2 ln |x|, is equivalent to
                                               ln |y| - ln(x2 + y2) = k,

or
                                                   |y| = ek(x2 + y2).

To see what these curves are we rewrite this equation as

                                                x2 + |y|2 - e-k|y| = 0

and complete the square to obtain
                                          x2 + (|y| - e-k/2)2 = (e-k/2)2.

This can be rewritten as

                                      x2 + (y - h)2 = h2,

where                                       e-k
                                           2
                                                               if y  0,
                                                            k  if y  0.

                                       h = - e-
                                                    2

Thus, the orthogonal trajectories are circles centered on the y axis and tangent to the x axis (Fig-

ure 4.5.13(b)). The circles for which h > 0 are above the x-axis, while those for which h < 0 are

below.

    Linear Second Order Equations

IN THIS CHAPTER we study a particularly important class of second order equations. Because of
their many applications in science and engineering, second order differential equation have historically
been the most thoroughly studied class of differential equations. Research on the theory of second order
differential equations continues to the present day. This chapter is devoted to second order equations that
can be written in the form

                                       P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F (x).
Such equations are said to be linear. As in the case of first order linear equations, (A) is said to be
homogeneous if F  0, or nonhomogeneous if F  0.
SECTION 5.1 is devoted to the theory of homogeneous linear equations.
SECTION 5.2 deals with homogeneous equations of the special form

                                                  ay + by + cy = 0,
where a, b, and c are constant (a = 0). When you've completed this section you'll know everything there
is to know about solving such equations.
SECTION 5.3 presents the theory of nonhomogeneous linear equations.
SECTIONS 5.4 AND 5.5 present the method of undetermined coefficients, which can be used to solve
nonhomogeneous equations of the form

                                                ay + by + cy = F (x),
where a, b, and c are constants and F has a special form that is still sufficiently general to occur in many
applications. In this section we make extensive use of the idea of variation of parameters introduced in
Chapter 2.
SECTION 5.6 deals with reduction of order, a technique based on the idea of variation of parameters,
which enables us to find the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear second order equation provided
that we know one nontrivial (not identically zero) solution of the associated homogeneous equation.
SECTION 5.6 deals with the method traditionally called variation of parameters, which enables us to
find the general solution of a nonhomogeneous linear second order equation provided that we know two
nontrivial solutions (with nonconstant ratio) of the associated homogeneous equation.

5.1 HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR EQUATIONS

A second order differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written as

                                  y + p(x)y + q(x)y = f(x).                        (5.1.1)

We call the function f on the right a forcing function, since in physical applications it's often related to
a force acting on some system modeled by the differential equation. We say that (5.1.1) is homogeneous
if f  0 or nonhomogeneous if f  0. Since these definitions are like the corresponding definitions in
Section 2.1 for the linear first order equation

                                  y + p(x)y = f(x),                                (5.1.2)

it's natural to expect similarities between methods of solving (5.1.1) and (5.1.2). However, solving (5.1.1)
is more difficult than solving (5.1.2). For example, while Theorem 2.1.1 gives a formula for the general
solution of (5.1.2) in the case where f  0 and Theorem 2.1.2 gives a formula for the case where f  0,
there are no formulas for the general solution of (5.1.1) in either case. Therefore we must be content to
solve linear second order equations of special forms.

   In Section 2.1 we considered the homogeneous equation y +p(x)y = 0 first, and then used a nontrivial
solution of this equation to find the general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation y + p(x)y = f(x).
Although the progression from the homogeneous to the nonhomogeneous case isn't that simple for the
linear second order equation, it's still necessary to solve the homogeneous equation

                                  y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0                            (5.1.3)

in order to solve the nonhomogeneous equation (5.1.1). This section is devoted to (5.1.3).
   The next theorem gives sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of initial value

problems for (5.1.3). We omit the proof.

Theorem 5.1.1 Suppose p and q are continuous on an open interval (a, b), let x0 be any point in (a, b),
and let k0 and k1 be arbitrary real numbers. Then the initial value problem

y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0, y(x0) = k0, y (x0) = k1

has a unique solution on (a, b).

   Since y  0 is obviously a solution of (5.1.3) we call it the trivial solution. Any other solution is
nontrivial. Under the assumptions of Theorem 5.1.1, the only solution of the initial value problem

y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0, y(x0) = 0, y (x0) = 0

on (a, b) is the trivial solution (Exercise 24).
   The next three examples illustrate concepts that we'll develop later in this section. You shouldn't be

concerned with how to find the given solutions of the equations in these examples. This will be explained
in later sections.

Example 5.1.1 The coefficients of y and y in

                                              y -y =0                              (5.1.4)

are the constant functions p  0 and q  -1, which are continuous on (-, ). Therefore Theo-
rem 5.1.1 implies that every initial value problem for (5.1.4) has a unique solution on (-, ).
                Section 5.1 Homogeneous Linear Equations 195

(a) Verify that y1 = ex and y2 = e-x are solutions of (5.1.4) on (-, ).
(b) Verify that if c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants, y = c1ex+c2e-x is a solution of (5.1.4) on (-, ).
(c) Solve the initial value problem

                y - y = 0, y(0) = 1, y (0) = 3.                                 (5.1.5)

SOLUTION(a) If y1 = ex then y1 = ex and y1 = ex = y1, so y1 -y1 = 0. If y2 = e-x, then y2 = -e-x
and y2 = e-x = y2, so y2 - y2 = 0.

SOLUTION(b) If   y = c1ex + c2e-x                                               (5.1.6)
then            y = c1ex - c2e-x                                                (5.1.7)
and             y = c1ex + c2e-x,
so

                                 y - y = (c1ex + c2e-x) - (c1ex + c2e-x)
                                             = c1(ex - ex) + c2(e-x - e-x) = 0

for all x. Therefore y = c1ex + c2e-x is a solution of (5.1.4) on (-, ).

SOLUTION(c) We can solve (5.1.5) by choosing c1 and c2 in (5.1.6) so that y(0) = 1 and y (0) = 3.
Setting x = 0 in (5.1.6) and (5.1.7) shows that this is equivalent to

                                                     c1 + c2 = 1
                                                     c1 - c2 = 3.

Solving these equations yields c1 = 2 and c2 = -1. Therefore y = 2ex - e-x is the unique solution of
(5.1.5) on (-, ).

Example 5.1.2 Let  be a positive constant. The coefficients of y and y in       (5.1.8)
                                                      y + 2y = 0

are the constant functions p  0 and q  2, which are continuous on (-, ). Therefore Theo-
rem 5.1.1 implies that every initial value problem for (5.1.8) has a unique solution on (-, ).
(a) Verify that y1 = cos x and y2 = sin x are solutions of (5.1.8) on (-, ).

(b) Verify that if c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants then y = c1 cos x + c2 sin x is a solution of (5.1.8)
      on (-, ).

(c) Solve the initial value problem

                y + 2y = 0, y(0) = 1, y (0) = 3.                                (5.1.9)

SOLUTION(a) If y1 = cos x then y1 = - sin x and y1 = -2 cos x = -2y1, so y1 + 2y1 = 0.
If y2 = sin x then, y2 =  cos x and y2 = -2 sin x = -2y2, so y2 + 2y2 = 0.
196 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

SOLUTION(b) If                   y = c1 cos x + c2 sin x                         (5.1.10)
then                         y = (-c1 sin x + c2 cos x)                          (5.1.11)
and                         y = -2(c1 cos x + c2 sin x),
so

y + 2y = -2(c1 cos x + c2 sin x) + 2(c1 cos x + c2 sin x)
              = c12(- cos x + cos x) + c22(- sin x + sin x) = 0

for all x. Therefore y = c1 cos x + c2 sin x is a solution of (5.1.8) on (-, ).

SOLUTION(c) To solve (5.1.9), we must choosing c1 and c2 in (5.1.10) so that y(0) = 1 and y (0) = 3.
Setting x = 0 in (5.1.10) and (5.1.11) shows that c1 = 1 and c2 = 3/. Therefore

                                                y = cos x + 3 sin x
                                                                   

is the unique solution of (5.1.9) on (-, ).
   Theorem 5.1.1 implies that if k0 and k1 are arbitrary real numbers then the initial value problem

                P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0, y(x0) = k0, y (x0) = k1            (5.1.12)

has a unique solution on an interval (a, b) that contains x0, provided that P0, P1, and P2 are continuous
and P0 has no zeros on (a, b). To see this, we rewrite the differential equation in (5.1.12) as

                                     y + P1(x) y + P2(x) y = 0
                                            P0(x) P0(x)

and apply Theorem 5.1.1 with p = P1/P0 and q = P2/P0.

Example 5.1.3 The equation

                                     x2y + xy - 4y = 0                           (5.1.13)

has the form of the differential equation in (5.1.12), with P0(x) = x2, P1(x) = x, and P2(x) = -4,
which are are all continuous on (-, ). However, since P (0) = 0 we must consider solutions of

(5.1.13) on (-, 0) and (0, ). Since P0 has no zeros on these intervals, Theorem 5.1.1 implies that the
initial value problem

                               x2y + xy - 4y = 0, y(x0) = k0, y (x0) = k1

has a unique solution on (0, ) if x0 > 0, or on (-, 0) if x0 < 0.
(a) Verify that y1 = x2 is a solution of (5.1.13) on (-, ) and y2 = 1/x2 is a solution of (5.1.13)

      on (-, 0) and (0, ).

(b) Verify that if c1 and c2 are any constants then y = c1x2 +c2/x2 is a solution of (5.1.13) on (-, 0)
      and (0, ).

(c) Solve the initial value problem

                            x2y + xy - 4y = 0, y(1) = 2, y (1) = 0.              (5.1.14)
                                                      Section 5.1 Homogeneous Linear Equations 197

(d) Solve the initial value problem                   y(-1) = 2,  y (-1) = 0.  (5.1.15)
                                  x2y + xy - 4y = 0,

SOLUTION(a) If y1 = x2 then y1 = 2x and y1 = 2, so
                                  x2y1 + xy1 - 4y1 = x2(2) + x(2x) - 4x2 = 0

for x in (-, ). If y2 = 1/x2, then y2 = -2/x3 and y2 = 6/x4, so
                              x2y2 + xy2 - 4y2 = x x4 2 6 - x x3 2 - x2 4 = 0

for x in (-, 0) or (0, ).

SOLUTION(b) If              y = c1x2 + x2 c2                                   (5.1.16)
then                       y = 2c1x - x3 2c2                                   (5.1.17)
and                        y = 2c1 + x4 6c2 ,
so

x2y + xy - 4y = x2 2c1 + x4 6c2 + x 2c1x - x3 2c2 - 4 c1x2 + x2 c2

                           = c1(2x2 + 2x2 - 4x2) + c2 x2 6 - x2 2 - x2 4

                           = c1  0 + c2  0 = 0

for x in (-, 0) or (0, ).

SOLUTION(c) To solve (5.1.14), we choose c1 and c2 in (5.1.16) so that y(1) = 2 and y (1) = 0. Setting
x = 1 in (5.1.16) and (5.1.17) shows that this is equivalent to

                                                     c1 + c2 = 2
                                                   2c1 - 2c2 = 0.

Solving these equations yields c1 = 1 and c2 = 1. Therefore y = x2 + 1/x2 is the unique solution of
(5.1.14) on (0, ).

SOLUTION(d) We can solve (5.1.15) by choosing c1 and c2 in (5.1.16) so that y(-1) = 2 and y (-1) =
0. Setting x = -1 in (5.1.16) and (5.1.17) shows that this is equivalent to

                                                      c1 + c2 = 2
                                                  -2c1 + 2c2 = 0.

Solving these equations yields c1 = 1 and c2 = 1. Therefore y = x2 + 1/x2 is the unique solution of
(5.1.15) on (-, 0).

   Although the formulas for the solutions of (5.1.14) and (5.1.15) are both y = x2 + 1/x2, you should
not conclude that these two initial value problems have the same solution. Remember that a solution of
an initial value problem is defined on an interval that contains the initial point; therefore, the solution
of (5.1.14) is y = x2 + 1/x2 on the interval (0, ), which contains the initial point x0 = 1, while the
solution of (5.1.15) is y = x2 + 1/x2 on the interval (-, 0), which contains the initial point x0 = -1.

The General Solution of a Homogeneous Linear Second Order Equation

If y1 and y2 are defined on an interval (a, b) and c1 and c2 are constants, then

                                        y = c1y1 + c2y2

is a linear combination of y1 and y2. For example, y = 2 cos x + 7 sin x is a linear combination of
y1 = cos x and y2 = sin x, with c1 = 2 and c2 = 7.

   The next theorem states a fact that we've already verified in Examples 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3.

Theorem 5.1.2 If y1 and y2 are solutions of the homogeneous equation

                                        y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0                                (5.1.18)

on (a, b), then any linear combination

                                        y = c1y1 + c2y2                                      (5.1.19)

of y1 and y2 is also a solution of (5.1.18) on (a, b).

Proof If                    y = c1y1 + c2y2
then       y = c1y1 + c2y2 and y = c1y1 + c2y2 .
Therefore

y + p(x)y + q(x)y = (c1y1 + c2y2 ) + p(x)(c1y1 + c2y2) + q(x)(c1y1 + c2y2)

           = c1 (y1 + p(x)y1 + q(x)y1) + c2 (y2 + p(x)y2 + q(x)y2)

           = c1  0 + c2  0 = 0,

since y1 and y2 are solutions of (5.1.18).
   We say that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.18) on (a, b) if every solution of (5.1.18)

on (a, b) can be written as a linear combination of y1 and y2 as in (5.1.19). In this case we say that
(5.1.19) is general solution of (5.1.18) on (a, b).

Linear Independence

We need a way to determine whether a given set {y1, y2} of solutions of (5.1.18) is a fundamental set.
The next definition will enable us to state necessary and sufficient conditions for this.

   We say that two functions y1 and y2 defined on an interval (a, b) are linearly independent on (a, b) if
neither is a constant multiple of the other on (a, b). (In particular, this means that neither can be the trivial
solution of (5.1.18), since, for example, if y1  0 we could write y1 = 0y2.) We'll also say that the set
{y1, y2} is linearly independent on (a, b).

Theorem 5.1.3 Suppose p and q are continuous on (a, b). Then a set {y1, y2} of solutions of

                                        y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0                                (5.1.20)

on (a, b) is a fundamental set if and only if {y1, y2} is linearly independent on (a, b).
                                  Section 5.1 Homogeneous Linear Equations 199

   We'll present the proof of Theorem 5.1.3 in steps worth regarding as theorems in their own right.
However, let's first interpret Theorem 5.1.3 in terms of Examples 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3.

Example 5.1.4

(a) Since ex/e-x = e2x is nonconstant, Theorem 5.1.3 implies that y = c1ex + c2e-x is the general
      solution of y - y = 0 on (-, ).

(b) Since cos x/ sin x = cot x is nonconstant, Theorem 5.1.3 implies that y = c1 cos x +
      c2 sin x is the general solution of y + 2y = 0 on (-, ).

(c) Since x2/x-2 = x4 is nonconstant, Theorem 5.1.3 implies that y = c1x2 + c2/x2 is the general
      solution of x2y + xy - 4y = 0 on (-, 0) and (0, ).

The Wronskian and Abel's Formula

To motivate a result that we need in order to prove Theorem 5.1.3, let's see what is required to prove that

{y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.20) on (a, b). Let x0 be an arbitrary point in (a, b), and

suppose y is an arbitrary solution of (5.1.20) on (a, b). Then y is the unique solution of the initial value

problem

         y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0, y(x0) = k0, y (x0) = k1;                                 (5.1.21)

that is, k0 and k1 are the numbers obtained by evaluating y and y at x0. Moreover, k0 and k1 can be

any real numbers, since Theorem 5.1.1 implies that (5.1.21) has a solution no matter how k0 and k1 are

chosen. Therefore {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.20) on (a, b) if and only if it's possible

to write the solution of an arbitrary initial value problem (5.1.21) as y = c1y1 + c2y2. This is equivalent

to requiring that the system

                                  c1y1(x0) + c2y2(x0) = k0                               (5.1.22)
                                  c1y1(x0) + c2y2(x0) = k1

has a solution (c1, c2) for every choice of (k0, k1). Let's try to solve (5.1.22).
   Multiplying the first equation in (5.1.22) by y2(x0) and the second by y2(x0) yields

         c1y1(x0)y2(x0) + c2y2(x0)y2(x0) = y2(x0)k0
         c1y1(x0)y2(x0) + c2y2(x0)y2(x0) = y2(x0)k1,

and subtracting the second equation here from the first yields

                          (y1(x0)y2(x0) - y1(x0)y2(x0)) c1 = y2(x0)k0 - y2(x0)k1.        (5.1.23)
Multiplying the first equation in (5.1.22) by y1(x0) and the second by y1(x0) yields

                                c1y1(x0)y1(x0) + c2y2(x0)y1(x0) = y1(x0)k0
                                c1y1(x0)y1(x0) + c2y2(x0)y1(x0) = y1(x0)k1,

and subtracting the first equation here from the second yields

         (y1(x0)y2(x0) - y1(x0)y2(x0)) c2 = y1(x0)k1 - y1(x0)k0.                         (5.1.24)

If
                                         y1(x0)y2(x0) - y1(x0)y2(x0) = 0,

it's impossible to satisfy (5.1.23) and (5.1.24) (and therefore (5.1.22)) unless k0 and k1 happen to satisfy

                                  y1(x0)k1 - y1(x0)k0 = 0
                                  y2(x0)k0 - y2(x0)k1 = 0.
200 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

On the other hand, if

                                     y1(x0)y2(x0) - y1(x0)y2(x0) = 0                   (5.1.25)

we can divide (5.1.23) and (5.1.24) through by the quantity on the left to obtain

                       c1 =            y2(x0)k0 - y2(x0)k1

                                       y1(x0)y2(x0) - y1(x0)y2(x0)                     (5.1.26)

                       c2 =            y1(x0)k1 - y1(x0)k0 ,
                                       y1(x0)y2(x0) - y1(x0)y2(x0)

no matter how k0 and k1 are chosen. This motivates us to consider conditions on y1 and y2 that imply
(5.1.25).

Theorem 5.1.4 Suppose p and q are continuous on (a, b), let y1 and y2 be solutions of

                                       y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0                           (5.1.27)

on (a, b), and define                  W = y1y2 - y1y2.                                (5.1.28)
Let x0 be any point in (a, b). Then                                                    (5.1.29)

                                       - x p(t) dt  , a < x < b.
                       W (x) = W (x0)e x0

Therefore either W has no zeros in (a, b) or W  0 on (a, b).

Proof Differentiating (5.1.28) yields

                               W = y1y2 + y1y2 - y1y2 - y1 y2 = y1y2 - y1 y2.          (5.1.30)
Since y1 and y2 both satisfy (5.1.27),

                                   y1 = -py1 - qy1 and y2 = -py2 - qy2.
Substituting these into (5.1.30) yields

                                   W = -y1 py2 + qy2 + y2 py1 + qy1
                                          = -p(y1y2 - y2y1) - q(y1y2 - y2y1)
                                          = -p(y1y2 - y2y1) = -pW.

Therefore W + p(x)W = 0; that is, W is the solution of the initial value problem

                       y + p(x)y = 0, y(x0) = W (x0).

We leave it to you to verify by separation of variables that this implies (5.1.29). If W (x0) = 0, (5.1.29)
implies that W has no zeros in (a, b), since an exponential is never zero. On the other hand, if W (x0) = 0,
(5.1.29) implies that W (x) = 0 for all x in (a, b).

   The function W defined in (5.1.28) is the Wronskian of {y1, y2}. Formula (5.1.29) is Abel's formula.
   The Wronskian of {y1, y2} is usually written as the determinant

                                       W=    y1 y2  .

                                             y1 y2
                                      Section 5.1 Homogeneous Linear Equations 201

The expressions in (5.1.26) for c1 and c2 can be written in terms of determinants as

             c1 = 1  k0 y2(x0)        and c2 = 1                         y1(x0) k0
                                                                                          .
             W (x0) k1 y2(x0)                  W (x0) y1(x0) k1

If you've taken linear algebra you may recognize this as Cramer's rule.

Example 5.1.5 Verify Abel's formula for the following differential equations and the corresponding so-
lutions, from Examples 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3:
(a) y - y = 0; y1 = ex, y2 = e-x

(b) y + 2y = 0; y1 = cos x, y2 = sin x

(c) x2y + xy - 4y = 0; y1 = x2, y2 = 1/x2

SOLUTION(a)  Since p  0, we can verify Abel's formula by showing that W is constant, which is true,
since
                          ex    e-x = ex(-e-x) - exe-x = -2
for all x.   W (x) =
                          ex -e-x

SOLUTION(b) Again, since p  0, we can verify Abel's formula by showing that W is constant, which
is true, since

             W (x) =            cos x sin x
                              - sin x  cos x

                          = cos x( cos x) - (- sin x) sin x
                          = (cos2 x + sin2 x) = 

for all x.

SOLUTION(c) Computing the Wronskian of y1 = x2 and y2 = 1/x2 directly yields

                      x2  1/x2  = x2 - 3 2 - 2x 2 1 = - 4 .                                  (5.1.31)
             W=
                     2x -2/x3               x                         x                   x

To verify Abel's formula we rewrite the differential equation as

                                   1        4
                              y + y - 2y = 0
                                xx

to see that p(x) = 1/x. If x0 and x are either both in (-, 0) or both in (0, ) then

                          x x p(t) dt = dt = ln x ,
                                      x0 t                        x0
                          x0

so Abel's formula becomes
                                    W (x) = W (x0)e- ln(x/x0) = W (x0) x0
                                                                                       x
                                              = - 4 x0 from (5.1.31)
                                                         x0 x
                                              = -4,
                                                      x
202 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

which is consistent with (5.1.31).
   The next theorem will enable us to complete the proof of Theorem 5.1.3.

Theorem 5.1.5 Suppose p and q are continuous on an open interval (a, b), let y1 and y2 be solutions of

                      y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0                                 (5.1.32)

on (a, b), and let W = y1y2 - y1y2. Then y1 and y2 are linearly independent on (a, b) if and only if W
has no zeros on (a, b).

Proof We first show that if W (x0) = 0 for some x0 in (a, b), then y1 and y2 are linearly dependent on

(a, b). Let I be a subinterval of (a, b) on which y1 has no zeros. (If there's no such subinterval, y1  0 on

(a, b), so y1 and y2 are linearly independent, and we're finished with this part of the proof.) Then y2/y1

is defined on I, and

                      y2 = 2 y1y2 - y1y2 = 2 W .                            (5.1.33)
                      y1                     y1  y1

However, if W (x0) = 0, Theorem 5.1.4 implies that W  0 on (a, b). Therefore (5.1.33) implies that
(y2/y1)  0, so y2/y1 = c (constant) on I. This shows that y2(x) = cy1(x) for all x in I. However, we
want to show that y2 = cy1(x) for all x in (a, b). Let Y = y2 - cy1. Then Y is a solution of (5.1.32)
on (a, b) such that Y  0 on I, and therefore Y  0 on I. Consequently, if x0 is chosen arbitrarily in I
then Y is a solution of the initial value problem

                      y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0, y(x0) = 0, y (x0) = 0,

which implies that Y  0 on (a, b), by the paragraph following Theorem 5.1.1. (See also Exercise 24).
Hence, y2 - cy1  0 on (a, b), which implies that y1 and y2 are not linearly independent on (a, b).

   Now suppose W has no zeros on (a, b). Then y1 can't be identically zero on (a, b) (why not?), and
therefore there is a subinterval I of (a, b) on which y1 has no zeros. Since (5.1.33) implies that y2/y1 is
nonconstant on I, y2 isn't a constant multiple of y1 on (a, b). A similar argument shows that y1 isn't a
constant multiple of y2 on (a, b), since

                      y1 = 2 y1y2 - y1y2 = - 2 W
                      y2                     y2  y2

on any subinterval of (a, b) where y2 has no zeros.
   We can now complete the proof of Theorem 5.1.3. From Theorem 5.1.5, two solutions y1 and y2 of

(5.1.32) are linearly independent on (a, b) if and only if W has no zeros on (a, b). From Theorem 5.1.4

and the motivating comments preceding it, {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.32) if and
only if W has no zeros on (a, b). Therefore {y1, y2} is a fundamental set for (5.1.32) on (a, b) if and only
if {y1, y2} is linearly independent on (a, b).

   The next theorem summarizes the relationships among the concepts discussed in this section.

Theorem 5.1.6 Suppose p and q are continuous on an open interval (a, b) and let y1 and y2 be solutions

of

                      y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0                                 (5.1.34)

on (a, b). Then the following statements are equivalent; that is, they are either all true or all false.
(a) The general solution of (5.1.34) on (a, b) is y = c1y1 + c2y2.

(b) {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.1.34) on (a, b).

(c) {y1, y2} is linearly independent on (a, b).

(d) The Wronskian of {y1, y2} is nonzero at some point in (a, b).
(e) The Wronskian of {y1, y2} is nonzero at all points in (a, b).

  We can apply this theorem to an equation written as

P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0

on an interval (a, b) where P0, P1, and P2 are continuous and P0 has no zeros.

Theorem 5.1.7 Suppose c is in (a, b) and  and  are real numbers, not both zero. Under the assump-
tions of Theorem 5.1.7, suppose y1 and y2 are solutions of (5.1.34) such that

y1(c) + y1(c) = 0 and y2(c) + y2(c) = 0.                                        (5.1.35)

Then {y1, y2} isn't linearly independent on (a, b).

Proof Since  and  are not both zero, (5.1.35) implies that

                                  y1(c) y1(c) = 0, so  y1(c) y2(c) = 0
                                  y2(c) y2(c)          y1(c) y2(c)

5.2 CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS EQUATIONS

If a, b, and c are real constants and a = 0, then

                          ay + by + cy = F (x)

is said to be a constant coefficient equation. In this section we consider the homogeneous constant coef-

ficient equation

                          ay + by + cy = 0.                                                (5.2.1)

As we'll see, all solutions of (5.2.1) are defined on (-, ). This being the case, we'll omit references

to the interval on which solutions are defined, or on which a given set of solutions is a fundamental set,

etc., since the interval will always be (-, ).
   The key to solving (5.2.1) is that if y = erx where r is a constant then the left side of (5.2.1) is a

multiple of erx; thus, if y = erx then y = rerx and y = r2erx, so

                  ay + by + cy = ar2erx + brerx + cerx = (ar2 + br + c)erx.                (5.2.2)

The quadratic polynomial

                          p(r) = ar2 + br + c

is the characteristic polynomial of (5.2.1), and p(r) = 0 is the characteristic equation. From (5.2.2) we
can see that y = erx is a solution of (5.2.1) if and only if p(r) = 0.

The roots of the characteristic equation are given by the quadratic formula

                                                                                           (5.2.3)
                          r = -b  b2 - 4ac .

                                        2a

We consider three cases:
                                               Section 5.2 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations 211

 CASE 1. b2 - 4ac > 0, so the characteristic equation has two distinct real roots.
 CASE 2. b2 - 4ac = 0, so the characteristic equation has a repeated real root.
 CASE 3. b2 - 4ac < 0, so the characteristic equation has complex roots.
In each case we'll start with an example.
Case 1: Distinct Real Roots

Example 5.2.1

(a) Find the general solution of

                                     y + 6y + 5y = 0.                                     (5.2.4)
                                                                                          (5.2.5)
(b) Solve the initial value problem

                                y + 6y + 5y = 0, y(0) = 3, y (0) = -1.

SOLUTION(a) The characteristic polynomial of (5.2.4) is

                                p(r) = r2 + 6r + 5 = (r + 1)(r + 5).

Since p(-1) = p(-5) = 0, y1 = e-x and y2 = e-5x are solutions of (5.2.4). Since y2/y1 = e-4x is
nonconstant, 5.1.6 implies that the general solution of (5.2.4) is

                                     y = c1e-x + c2e-5x.                                  (5.2.6)

SOLUTION(b) We must determine c1 and c2 in (5.2.6) so that y satisfies the initial conditions in (5.2.5).

Differentiating (5.2.6) yields

                                     y = -c1e-x - 5c2e-5x.                                (5.2.7)

Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 3, y (0) = -1 in (5.2.6) and (5.2.7) yields

                                       c1 + c2 = 3
                                     -c1 - 5c2 = -1.

The solution of this system is c1 = 7/2, c2 = -1/2. Therefore the solution of (5.2.5) is

                                     y = 7 e-x - 1 e-5x.
                                     2  2

Figure 5.2.1 is a graph of this solution.
   If the characteristic equation has arbitrary distinct real roots r1 and r2, then y1 = er1x and y2 = er2x

are solutions of ay + by + cy = 0. Since y2/y1 = e(r2-r1)x is nonconstant, Theorem 5.1.6 implies that
{y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of ay + by + cy = 0.

Case 2: A Repeated Real Root

Example 5.2.2

(a) Find the general solution of

                                     y + 6y + 9y = 0.                             (5.2.8)
                                                                                  (5.2.9)
(b) Solve the initial value problem

                              y + 6y + 9y = 0, y(0) = 3, y (0) = -1.

SOLUTION(a) The characteristic polynomial of (5.2.8) is

                                           p(r) = r2 + 6r + 9 = (r + 3)2,

so the characteristic equation has the repeated real root r1 = -3. Therefore y1 = e-3x is a solution
of (5.2.8). Since the characteristic equation has no other roots, (5.2.8) has no other solutions of the
form erx. We look for solutions of the form y = uy1 = ue-3x, where u is a function that we'll now
determine. (This should remind you of the method of variation of parameters used in Section 2.1 to
solve the nonhomogeneous equation y + p(x)y = f(x), given a solution y1 of the complementary
equation y + p(x)y = 0. It's also a special case of a method called reduction of order that we'll study
in Section 5.6. For other ways to obtain a second solution of (5.2.8) that's not a multiple of e-3x, see
Exercises 5.1.9, 5.1.12, and 33.
                                           Section 5.2 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations 213

If y = ue-3x, then                            y = u e-3x - 6u e-3x + 9ue-3x,
                  y = u e-3x - 3ue-3x and

so

                   y + 6y + 9y = e-3x [(u - 6u + 9u) + 6(u - 3u) + 9u]
                                       = e-3x [u - (6 - 6)u + (9 - 18 + 9)u] = u e-3x.

Therefore y = ue-3x is a solution of (5.2.8) if and only if u = 0, which is equivalent to u = c1 + c2x,
where c1 and c2 are constants. Therefore any function of the form

                                           y = e-3x(c1 + c2x)                             (5.2.10)

is a solution of (5.2.8). Letting c1 = 1 and c2 = 0 yields the solution y1 = e-3x that we already knew.
Letting c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 yields the second solution y2 = xe-3x. Since y2/y1 = x is nonconstant, 5.1.6
implies that {y1, y2} is fundamental set of solutions of (5.2.8), and (5.2.10) is the general solution.

SOLUTION(b) Differentiating (5.2.10) yields

      y = -3e-3x(c1 + c2x) + c2e-3x.                                                      (5.2.11)

Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 3, y (0) = -1 in (5.2.10) and (5.2.11) yields c1 = 3 and -3c1 +
c2 = -1, so c2 = 8. Therefore the solution of (5.2.9) is

                                                   y = e-3x(3 + 8x).

214 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

   If the characteristic equation of ay + by + cy = 0 has an arbitrary repeated root r1, the characteristic

polynomial must be
                                      p(r) = a(r - r1)2 = a(r2 - 2r1r + r12).

Therefore

                               ar2 + br + c = ar2 - (2ar1)r + ar12,

which implies that b = -2ar1 and c = ar12. Therefore ay + by + cy = 0 can be written as a(y -
2r1y + r12y) = 0. Since a = 0 this equation has the same solutions as

                                       y - 2r1y + r12y = 0.                                         (5.2.12)

   Since p(r1) = 0, t y1 = er1x is a solution of ay + by + cy = 0, and therefore of (5.2.12). Proceeding
as in Example 5.2.2, we look for other solutions of (5.2.12) of the form y = uer1x; then

               y = u er1x + ruer1x and       y     = u er1x + 2r1u er1x + r2uer1x,

                                                                                                 1

so

           y - 2r1y + r12y  =     erx  (u  + 2r1u  +    2  u)  -  2r1  (u  + r1u) + r12u

                                                      r1

                            = er1x u + (2r1 - 2r1)u + (r12 - 2r12 + r12)u = u er1x.

Therefore y = uer1x is a solution of (5.2.12) if and only if u = 0, which is equivalent to u = c1 + c2x,
where c1 and c2 are constants. Hence, any function of the form

                                       y = er1x(c1 + c2x)                                           (5.2.13)

is a solution of (5.2.12). Letting c1 = 1 and c2 = 0 here yields the solution y1 = er1x that we already
knew. Letting c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 yields the second solution y2 = xer1x. Since y2/y1 = x is noncon-
stant, 5.1.6 implies that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.2.12), and (5.2.13) is the general
solution.

Case 3: Complex Conjugate Roots

Example 5.2.3

(a) Find the general solution of

                                           y + 4y + 13y = 0.                                        (5.2.14)
                                                                                                    (5.2.15)
(b) Solve the initial value problem

                            y + 4y + 13y = 0, y(0) = 2, y (0) = -3.

SOLUTION(a) The characteristic polynomial of (5.2.14) is

                            p(r) = r2 + 4r + 13 = r2 + 4r + 4 + 9 = (r + 2)2 + 9.

The roots of the characteristic equation are r1 = -2 + 3i and r2 = -2 - 3i. By analogy with Case 1, it's
reasonable to expect that e(-2+3i)x and e(-2-3i)x are solutions of (5.2.14). This is true (see Exercise 34);
however, there are difficulties here, since you are probably not familiar with exponential functions with
complex arguments, and even if you are, it's inconvenient to work with them, since they are complex-
valued. We'll take a simpler approach, which we motivate as follows: the exponential notation suggests
that

                             e(-2+3i)x = e-2xe3ix and e(-2-3i)x = e-2xe-3ix,
                                           Section 5.2 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations 215

so even though we haven't defined e3ix and e-3ix, it's reasonable to expect that every linear combination
of e(-2+3i)x and e(-2-3i)x can be written as y = ue-2x, where u depends upon x. To determine u, we
note that if y = ue-2x then

                     y = u e-2x - 2ue-2x and y = u e-2x - 4u e-2x + 4ue-2x,

so

             y + 4y + 13y = e-2x [(u - 4u + 4u) + 4(u - 2u) + 13u]
                                   = e-2x [u - (4 - 4)u + (4 - 8 + 13)u] = e-2x(u + 9u).

Therefore y = ue-2x is a solution of (5.2.14) if and only if

                                               u + 9u = 0.

From Example 5.1.2, the general solution of this equation is

                                    u = c1 cos 3x + c2 sin 3x.

Therefore any function of the form

                                    y = e-2x(c1 cos 3x + c2 sin 3x)                       (5.2.16)

is a solution of (5.2.14). Letting c1 = 1 and c2 = 0 yields the solution y1 = e-2x cos 3x. Letting c1 = 0
and c2 = 1 yields the second solution y2 = e-2x sin 3x. Since y2/y1 = tan 3x is nonconstant, 5.1.6
implies that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.2.14), and (5.2.16) is the general solution.

SOLUTION(b) Imposing the condition y(0) = 2 in (5.2.16) shows that c1 = 2. Differentiating (5.2.16)
yields

                    y = -2e-2x(c1 cos 3x + c2 sin 3x) + 3e-2x(-c1 sin 3x + c2 cos 3x),

and imposing the initial condition y (0) = -3 here yields -3 = -2c1 + 3c2 = -4 + 3c2, so c2 = 1/3.
Therefore the solution of (5.2.15) is

                                    y = e-2x(2 cos 3x + 1 sin 3x).
                                                              3

Figure 5.2.3 is a graph of this function.

   Now suppose the characteristic equation of ay + by + cy = 0 has arbitrary complex roots; thus,
b2 - 4ac < 0 and, from (5.2.3), the roots are

                                                                  
                           -b + i 4ac - b2                    -b - i 4ac - b2
                     r1 =                          ,  r2 =                     ,
                                           2a                     2a

which we rewrite as

                                    r1 =  + i, r2 =  - i,                                 (5.2.17)

with                                                  

                                     = - b ,  = 4ac - b2 .

Don't memorize these formulas. Just remember that r1 and r2 are of the form (5.2.17), where  is an
arbitrary real number and  is positive;  and  are the real and imaginary parts, respectively, of r1.
Similarly,  and - are the real and imaginary parts of r2. We say that r1 and r2 are complex conjugates,

which means that they have the same real part and their imaginary parts have the same absolute values,

but opposite signs.
   As in Example 5.2.3, it's reasonable to to expect that the solutions of ay + by + cy = 0 are linear

combinations of e(+i)x and e(-i)x. Again, the exponential notation suggests that

             e(+i)x = exeix and e(-i)x = exe-ix,

so even though we haven't defined eix and e-ix, it's reasonable to expect that every linear combination

of e(+i)x and e(-i)x can be written as y = uex, where u depends upon x. To determine u we first

observe that since r1 =  + i and r2 =  - i are the roots of the characteristic equation, p must be of

the form     p(r) = a(r - r1)(r - r2)

             = a(r -  - i)(r -  + i)

             = a (r - )2 + 2

             = a(r2 - 2r + 2 + 2).

Therefore ay + by + cy = 0 can be written as

             a y - 2y + (2 + 2)y = 0.

Since a = 0 this equation has the same solutions as                        (5.2.18)
                                            y - 2y + (2 + 2)y = 0.

To determine u we note that if y = uex then   y = u ex + 2u ex + 2uex.
                        y = u ex + uex and
                                    Section 5.2 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations 217

Substituting these expressions into (5.2.18) and dropping the common factor ex yields
                             (u + 2u + 2u) - 2(u + u) + (2 + 2)u = 0,

which simplifies to

                                    u + 2u = 0.

From Example 5.1.2, the general solution of this equation is

                                    u = c1 cos x + c2 sin x.

Therefore any function of the form

                                    y = ex(c1 cos x + c2 sin x)                              (5.2.19)

is a solution of (5.2.18). Letting c1 = 1 and c2 = 0 here yields the solution y1 = ex cos x. Letting
c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 yields a second solution y2 = ex sin x. Since y2/y1 = tan x is nonconstant,
so Theorem 5.1.6 implies that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.2.18), and (5.2.19) is the
general solution.

Summary

The next theorem summarizes the results of this section.

Theorem 5.2.1 Let p(r) = ar2 + br + c be the characteristic polynomial of

                                    ay + by + cy = 0.                                        (5.2.20)

Then:
(a) If p(r) = 0 has distinct real roots r1 and r2, then the general solution of (5.2.20) is

                                                     y = c1er1x + c2er2x.

(b) If p(r) = 0 has a repeated root r1, then the general solution of (5.2.20) is
                                                     y = er1x(c1 + c2x).

(c) If p(r) = 0 has complex conjugate roots r1 =  + i and r2 =  - i (where  > 0), then the
     general solution of (5.2.20) is

                                              y = ex(c1 cos x + c2 sin x).

                           ay + by + cy = 0.                                                  (A)

Let z(x) = y(x - x0), where x0 is an arbitrary real number. Show that

where the initial conditions are imposed at x0 = 0. However, if the initial value problem is

                       ay + by + cy = 0, y(x0) = k0, y (x0) = k1,                             (B)

where x0 = 0, then determining the constants in

y = c1er1x + c2er2x, y = er1x(c1 + c2x), or y = ex(c1 cos x + c2 sin x)

(whichever is applicable) is more complicated. Use (b) to restate Theorem 5.2.1 in a form
more convenient for solving (B).

34. In calculus you learned that eu, cos u, and sin u can be represented by the infinite series

                     eu  = un = 1 + u + u2 + u3 +    + un +    (A)
                            n=0 n! 1! 2! 3! n!

      cos u = (-1)n u2n = 1 - u2 + u4 +    + (-1)n u2n +    , (B)
                     n=0 (2n)!               2! 4!                     (2n)!

and   sin u = (-1)n u2n+1 = u - u3 + u5 +    + (-1)n u2n+1 +    (C)

     n=0 (2n + 1)!                           3! 5!                     (2n + 1)!

for all real values of u. Even though you have previously considered (A) only for real values of u,
we can set u = i, where  is real, to obtain

                                ei  = (i)n . (D)
                                       n=0 n!

Given the proper background in the theory of infinite series with complex terms, it can be shown
that the series in (D) converges for all real .

(a) Recalling that i2 = -1, write enough terms of the sequence {in} to convince yourself that
      the sequence is repetitive:

                     1, i, -1, -i, 1, i, -1, -i, 1, i, -1, -i, 1, i, -1, -i,    .

     Use this to group the terms in (D) as

                     ei =       1 - 2 + 4 +    + i  - 3 + 5 +   
                                24                             3! 5!

                      = (-1)n 2n  + i (-1)n 2n+1 .
                          n=0 (2n)! n=0 (2n + 1)!

     By comparing this result with (B) and (C), conclude that

                                ei = cos  + i sin .                                              (E)

     This is Euler's identity.

(b) Starting from

                     ei1 ei2 = (cos 1 + i sin 1)(cos 2 + i sin 2),

     collect the real part (the terms not multiplied by i) and the imaginary part (the terms multi-
     plied by i) on the right, and use the trigonometric identities

                     cos(1 + 2) = cos 1 cos 2 - sin 1 sin 2
                     sin(1 + 2) = sin 1 cos 2 + cos 1 sin 2

     to verify that

                                ei(1+2) = ei1 ei2 ,

     as you would expect from the use of the exponential notation ei.

(c) If  and  are real numbers, define

                                  e+i = eei = e(cos  + i sin ).                                 (F)

Show that if z1 = 1 + i1 and z2 = 2 + i2 then
                                             ez1+z2 = ez1 ez2 .

(d) Let a, b, and c be real numbers, with a = 0. Let z = u + iv where u and v are real-valued
      functions of x. Then we say that z is a solution of

                                       ay + by + cy = 0                                         (G)

if u and v are both solutions of (G). Use Theorem 5.2.1(c) to verify that if the characteristic
equation of (G) has complex conjugate roots   i then z1 = e(+i)x and z2 = e(-i)x

are both solutions of (G).

5.3 NONHOMOGENEOUS LINEAR EQUATIONS

We'll now consider the nonhomogeneous linear second order equation

                                  y + p(x)y + q(x)y = f(x),                                     (5.3.1)

where the forcing function f isn't identically zero. The next theorem, an extension of Theorem 5.1.1,
gives sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of initial value problems for (5.3.1).
We omit the proof, which is beyond the scope of this book.

Theorem 5.3.1 Suppose p, , q and f are continuous on an open interval (a, b), let x0 be any point in
(a, b), and let k0 and k1 be arbitrary real numbers. Then the initial value problem

y + p(x)y + q(x)y = f(x), y(x0) = k0, y (x0) = k1

has a unique solution on (a, b).

   To find the general solution of (5.3.1) on an interval (a, b) where p, q, and f are continuous, it's
necessary to find the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation

                                  y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0                                         (5.3.2)

on (a, b). We call (5.3.2) the complementary equation for (5.3.1).
   The next theorem shows how to find the general solution of (5.3.1) if we know one solution yp of

(5.3.1) and a fundamental set of solutions of (5.3.2). We call yp a particular solution of (5.3.1); it can be
any solution that we can find, one way or another.

Theorem 5.3.2 Suppose p, q, and f are continuous on (a, b). Let yp be a particular solution of

                                  y + p(x)y + q(x)y = f(x)                                      (5.3.3)

on (a, b), and let {y1, y2} be a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation

                                  y + p(x)y + q(x)y = 0                                         (5.3.4)

on (a, b). Then y is a solution of (5.3.3) on (a, b) if and only if

                                  y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2,                                         (5.3.5)

where c1 and c2 are constants.
222 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

Proof We first show that y in (5.3.5) is a solution of (5.3.3) for any choice of the constants c1 and c2.
Differentiating (5.3.5) twice yields

                     y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2 and y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2 ,

so

    y + p(x)y + q(x)y = (yp + c1y1 + c2y2 ) + p(x)(yp + c1y1 + c2y2)
                                       +q(x)(yp + c1y1 + c2y2)

                                = (yp + p(x)yp + q(x)yp) + c1(y1 + p(x)y1 + q(x)y1)
                                       +c2(y2 + p(x)y2 + q(x)y2)

                                = f + c1  0 + c2  0 = f,

since yp satisfies (5.3.3) and y1 and y2 satisfy (5.3.4).
   Now we'll show that every solution of (5.3.3) has the form (5.3.5) for some choice of the constants c1

and c2. Suppose y is a solution of (5.3.3). We'll show that y - yp is a solution of (5.3.4), and therefore of
the form y - yp = c1y1 + c2y2, which implies (5.3.5). To see this, we compute

    (y - yp) + p(x)(y - yp) + q(x)(y - yp) = (y - yp ) + p(x)(y - yp)
                                                                 +q(x)(y - yp)

                                                           = (y + p(x)y + q(x)y)

                                                                 -(yp + p(x)yp + q(x)yp)
                                                           = f(x) - f(x) = 0,

since y and yp both satisfy (5.3.3).

    We say that (5.3.5) is the general solution of (5.3.3) on (a, b).

    If P0, P1, and F are continuous and P0 has no zeros on (a, b), then Theorem 5.3.2 implies that the

general solution of

                     P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F (x)                                     (5.3.6)

on (a, b) is y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2, where yp is a particular solution of (5.3.6) on (a, b) and {y1, y2} is a
fundamental set of solutions of

                                      P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0

on (a, b). To see this, we rewrite (5.3.6) as

                                         y + P1(x) y + P2(x) y = F (x)
                                                 P0(x) P0(x) P0(x)

and apply Theorem 5.3.2 with p = P1/P0, q = P2/P0, and f = F/P0.
   To avoid awkward wording in examples and exercises, we won't specify the interval (a, b) when we ask

for the general solution of a specific linear second order equation, or for a fundamental set of solutions of
a homogeneous linear second order equation. Let's agree that this always means that we want the general
solution (or a fundamental set of solutions, as the case may be) on every open interval on which p, q, and
f are continuous if the equation is of the form (5.3.3), or on which P0, P1, P2, and F are continuous and
P0 has no zeros, if the equation is of the form (5.3.6). We leave it to you to identify these intervals in
specific examples and exercises.

   For completeness, we point out that if P0, P1, P2, and F are all continuous on an open interval (a, b),
but P0 does have a zero in (a, b), then (5.3.6) may fail to have a general solution on (a, b) in the sense
just defined. Exercises 42-44 illustrate this point for a homogeneous equation.

   In this section we to limit ourselves to applications of Theorem 5.3.2 where we can guess at the form
of the particular solution.

Example 5.3.1

(a) Find the general solution of

                                     y + y = 1.                                  (5.3.7)
                                                                                 (5.3.8)
(b) Solve the initial value problem

                                  y + y = 1, y(0) = 2, y (0) = 7.

SOLUTION(a) We can apply Theorem 5.3.2 with (a, b) = (-, ), since the functions p  0, q  1,

and f  1 in (5.3.7) are continuous on (-, ). By inspection we see that yp  1 is a particular solution
of (5.3.7). Since y1 = cos x and y2 = sin x form a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary
equation y + y = 0, the general solution of (5.3.7) is

                                     y = 1 + c1 cos x + c2 sin x.                (5.3.9)

SOLUTION(b) Imposing the initial condition y(0) = 2 in (5.3.9) yields 2 = 1 + c1, so c1 = 1. Differen-
tiating (5.3.9) yields

                                               y = -c1 sin x + c2 cos x.
Imposing the initial condition y (0) = 7 here yields c2 = 7, so the solution of (5.3.8) is

                                                y = 1 + cos x + 7 sin x.

Figure 5.3.1 is a graph of this function.

Example 5.3.2

(a) Find the general solution of

                                     y - 2y + y = -3 - x + x2.                   (5.3.10)
                                                                                 (5.3.11)
(b) Solve the initial value problem                      y(0) = -2,  y (0) = 1.
                              y - 2y + y = -3 - x + x2,

SOLUTION(a) The characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation

                                                    y - 2y + y = 0

is r2 - 2r + 1 = (r - 1)2, so y1 = ex and y2 = xex form a fundamental set of solutions of the
complementary equation. To guess a form for a particular solution of (5.3.10), we note that substituting a
second degree polynomial yp = A + Bx + Cx2 into the left side of (5.3.10) will produce another second
degree polynomial with coefficients that depend upon A, B, and C. The trick is to choose A, B, and C
so the polynomials on the two sides of (5.3.10) have the same coefficients; thus, if

                       yp = A + Bx + Cx2 then yp = B + 2Cx and yp = 2C,

so

               yp - 2yp + yp = 2C - 2(B + 2Cx) + (A + Bx + Cx2)
                                   = (2C - 2B + A) + (-4C + B)x + Cx2 = -3 - x + x2.

                         Figure 5.3.1 y = 1 + cos x + 7 sin x

Equating coefficients of like powers of x on the two sides of the last equality yields

                                                     C= 1
                                             B - 4C = -1
                                      A - 2B + 2C = -3,

so C = 1, B = -1 + 4C = 3, and A = -3 - 2C + 2B = 1. Therefore yp = 1 + 3x + x2 is a particular
solution of (5.3.10) and Theorem 5.3.2 implies that

                                      y = 1 + 3x + x2 + ex(c1 + c2x)                        (5.3.12)

is the general solution of (5.3.10).

SOLUTION(b) Imposing the initial condition y(0) = -2 in (5.3.12) yields -2 = 1 + c1, so c1 = -3.
Differentiating (5.3.12) yields

                         y = 3 + 2x + ex(c1 + c2x) + c2ex,

and imposing the initial condition y (0) = 1 here yields 1 = 3 + c1 + c2, so c2 = 1. Therefore the
solution of (5.3.11) is

                                            y = 1 + 3x + x2 - ex(3 - x).

Figure 5.3.2 is a graph of this solution.

Solution In Example 5.1.3, we verified that y1 = x2 and y2 = 1/x2 form a fundamental set of solutions
of the complementary equation

                                                  x2y + xy - 4y = 0

on (-, 0) and (0, ). To find a particular solution of (5.3.13), we note that if yp = Ax4, where A is a
constant then both sides of (5.3.13) will be constant multiples of x4 and we may be able to choose A so
the two sides are equal. This is true in this example, since if yp = Ax4 then

   x2yp + xyp - 4yp = x2(12Ax2) + x(4Ax3) - 4Ax4 = 12Ax4 = 2x4

if A = 1/6; therefore, yp = x4/6 is a particular solution of (5.3.13) on (-, ). Theorem 5.3.2 implies
that the general solution of (5.3.13) on (-, 0) and (0, ) is

                                               x4       2 c2

The Principle of Superposition

The next theorem enables us to break a nonhomogeous equation into simpler parts, find a particular
solution for each part, and then combine their solutions to obtain a particular solution of the original
problem.

Theorem 5.3.3 [The Principle of Superposition] Suppose yp1 is a particular solution of

            y + p(x)y + q(x)y = f1(x)

on (a, b) and yp2 is a particular solution of

            y + p(x)y + q(x)y = f2(x)
226 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

on (a, b). Then                             yp = yp1 + yp2
is a particular solution of   y + p(x)y + q(x)y = f1(x) + f2(x)
on (a, b).

Proof If yp = yp1 + yp2 then

yp + p(x)yp + q(x)yp = (yp1 + yp2 ) + p(x)(yp1 + yp2 ) + q(x)(yp1 + yp2 )
                              = yp1 + p(x)yp1 + q(x)yp1 + yp2 + p(x)yp2 + q(x)yp2
                              = f1(x) + f2(x).

It's easy to generalize Theorem 5.3.3 to the equation

                                          y + p(x)y + q(x)y = f(x)                 (5.3.14)

where                                     f = f1 + f2 +    + fk;
thus, if ypi is a particular solution of

                                          y + p(x)y + q(x)y = fi(x)

on (a, b) for i = 1, 2, . . . , k, then yp1 + yp2 +    + ypk is a particular solution of (5.3.14) on (a, b).
Moreover, by a proof similar to the proof of Theorem 5.3.3 we can formulate the principle of superposition

in terms of a linear equation written in the form

                              P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F (x)

(Exercise 39); that is, if yp1 is a particular solution of

                              P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F1(x)

on (a, b) and yp2 is a particular solution of

                              P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F2(x)

on (a, b), then yp1 + yp2 is a solution of

                             P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F1(x) + F2(x)

on (a, b).

Example 5.3.4 The function yp1 = x4/15 is a particular solution of                 (5.3.15)
                                               x2y + 4xy + 2y = 2x4

on (-, ) and yp2 = x2/3 is a particular solution of                                (5.3.16)
                                               x2y + 4xy + 2y = 4x2

on (-, ). Use the principle of superposition to find a particular solution of      (5.3.17)
                                           x2y + 4xy + 2y = 2x4 + 4x2

on (-, ).
                                       Section 5.3 Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations 227

Solution The right side F (x) = 2x4 + 4x2 in (5.3.17) is the sum of the right sides

                                   F1(x) = 2x4 and F2(x) = 4x2.

in (5.3.15) and (5.3.16). Therefore the principle of superposition implies that

                                                              x4 x2

       on (a, b), then yp = yp1 + yp2 is a solution of

       on (a, b) for every choice of the constants c1, c2. Show that y1 and y2 are solutions of the comple-

5.4 THE METHOD OF UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS I

In this section we consider the constant coefficient equation

ay + by + cy = exG(x),                                                                         (5.4.1)

where  is a constant and G is a polynomial.
   From Theorem 5.3.2, the general solution of (5.4.1) is y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2, where yp is a particular

solution of (5.4.1) and {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation

ay + by + cy = 0.

In Section 5.2 we showed how to find {y1, y2}. In this section we'll show how to find yp. The procedure
that we'll use is called the method of undetermined coefficients.

   Our first example is similar to Exercises 16-21.
230 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations I

Example 5.4.1 Find a particular solution of                           (5.4.2)
                                                y - 7y + 12y = 4e2x.

Then find the general solution.

Solution Substituting yp = Ae2x for y in (5.4.2) will produce a constant multiple of Ae2x on the left side
of (5.4.2), so it may be possible to choose A so that yp is a solution of (5.4.2). Let's try it; if yp = Ae2x
then

                      yp - 7yp + 12yp = 4Ae2x - 14Ae2x + 12Ae2x = 2Ae2x = 4e2x

if A = 2. Therefore yp = 2e2x is a particular solution of (5.4.2). To find the general solution, we note
that the characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation

                                 y - 7y + 12y = 0                     (5.4.3)

is p(r) = r2 - 7r + 12 = (r - 3)(r - 4), so {e3x, e4x} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.4.3).
Therefore the general solution of (5.4.2) is

                                              y = 2e2x + c1e3x + c2e4x.

Example 5.4.2 Find a particular solution of                           (5.4.4)
                                                y - 7y + 12y = 5e4x.

Then find the general solution.

Solution Fresh from our success in finding a particular solution of (5.4.2) -- where we chose yp = Ae2x
because the right side of (5.4.2) is a constant multiple of e2x -- it may seem reasonable to try yp = Ae4x
as a particular solution of (5.4.4). However, this won't work, since we saw in Example 5.4.1 that e4x is
a solution of the complementary equation (5.4.3), so substituting yp = Ae4x into the left side of (5.4.4)
produces zero on the left, no matter how we chooseA. To discover a suitable form for yp, we use the same

approach that we used in Section 5.2 to find a second solution of

                                 ay + by + cy = 0

in the case where the characteristic equation has a repeated real root: we look for solutions of (5.4.4) in
the form y = ue4x, where u is a function to be determined. Substituting

y = ue4x, y = u e4x + 4ue4x, and y = u e4x + 8u e4x + 16ue4x          (5.4.5)

into (5.4.4) and canceling the common factor e4x yields

(u + 8u + 16u) - 7(u + 4u) + 12u = 5,

or
                                                       u + u = 5.

By inspection we see that up = 5x is a particular solution of this equation, so yp = 5xe4x is a particular
solution of (5.4.4). Therefore

                                              y = 5xe4x + c1e3x + c2e4x

is the general solution.
Section 5.4 The Method of Undetermined Coefficients 231

Example 5.4.3 Find a particular solution of                                 (5.4.6)
                                                y - 8y + 16y = 2e4x.

Solution Since the characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation

y - 8y + 16y = 0                                                            (5.4.7)

is p(r) = r2 - 8r + 16 = (r - 4)2, both y1 = e4x and y2 = xe4x are solutions of (5.4.7). Therefore
(5.4.6) does not have a solution of the form yp = Ae4x or yp = Axe4x. As in Example 5.4.2, we look
for solutions of (5.4.6) in the form y = ue4x, where u is a function to be determined. Substituting from
(5.4.5) into (5.4.6) and canceling the common factor e4x yields

(u + 8u + 16u) - 8(u + 4u) + 16u = 2,

or
                                                          u = 2.

Integrating twice and taking the constants of integration to be zero shows that up = x2 is a particular
solution of this equation, so yp = x2e4x is a particular solution of (5.4.4). Therefore

                                                y = e4x(x2 + c1 + c2x)

is the general solution.
   The preceding examples illustrate the following facts concerning the form of a particular solution yp

of a constant coefficent equation
                                                ay + by + cy = kex,

where k is a nonzero constant:

(a) If ex isn't a solution of the complementary equation

ay + by + cy = 0,                                                           (5.4.8)

      then yp = Aex, where A is a constant. (See Example 5.4.1).
(b) If ex is a solution of (5.4.8) but xex is not, then yp = Axex, where A is a constant. (See

      Example 5.4.2.)
(c) If both ex and xex are solutions of (5.4.8), then yp = Ax2ex, where A is a constant. (See

      Example 5.4.3.)
See Exercise 30 for the proofs of these facts.

   In all three cases you can just substitute the appropriate form for yp and its derivatives directly into

                                               ayp + byp + cyp = kex,

and solve for the constant A, as we did in Example 5.4.1. (See Exercises 31-33.) However, if the equation
is

                                             ay + by + cy = kexG(x),

where G is a polynomial of degree greater than zero, we recommend that you use the substitution y =
uex as we did in Examples 5.4.2 and 5.4.3. The equation for u will turn out to be

au + p ()u + p()u = G(x),                                                   (5.4.9)
232 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations I

where p(r) = ar2 + br + c is the characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation and p (r) =
2ar + b (Exercise 30); however, you shouldn't memorize this since it's easy to derive the equation for
u in any particular case. Note, however, that if ex is a solution of the complementary equation then
p() = 0, so (5.4.9) reduces to

                                                au + p ()u = G(x),

while if both ex and xex are solutions of the complementary equation then p(r) = a(r - )2 and
p (r) = 2a(r - ), so p() = p () = 0 and (5.4.9) reduces to

                                           au = G(x).

Example 5.4.4 Find a particular solution of                                              (5.4.10)
                                        y - 3y + 2y = e3x(-1 + 2x + x2).

Solution Substituting         y = u e3x + 3ue3x,  and y = u e3x + 6u e3x + 9ue3x
                   y = ue3x,

into (5.4.10) and canceling e3x yields
                             (u + 6u + 9u) - 3(u + 3u) + 2u = -1 + 2x + x2,

or

                              u + 3u + 2u = -1 + 2x + x2.                                (5.4.11)

As in Example 2, in order to guess a form for a particular solution of (5.4.11), we note that substituting a
second degree polynomial up = A + Bx + Cx2 for u in the left side of (5.4.11) produces another second
degree polynomial with coefficients that depend upon A, B, and C; thus,

           if up = A + Bx + Cx2 then up = B + 2Cx and up = 2C.

If up is to satisfy (5.4.11), we must have

            up + 3up + 2up = 2C + 3(B + 2Cx) + 2(A + Bx + Cx2)
                                   = (2C + 3B + 2A) + (6C + 2B)x + 2Cx2 = -1 + 2x + x2.

Equating coefficients of like powers of x on the two sides of the last equality yields

                                                          2C = 1
                                                  2B + 6C = 2
                                           2A + 3B + 2C = -1.

Solving these equations for C, B, and A (in that order) yields C = 1/2, B = -1/2, A = -1/4.

Therefore                                  up = - 1 (1 + 2x - 2x2)
                                                    4

is a particular solution of (5.4.11), and

                                         yp = upe3x = - e (1 + 2x - 2x 3x 2)
                                                               4

is a particular solution of (5.4.10).
                                          Section 5.4 The Method of Undetermined Coefficients 233

Example 5.4.5 Find a particular solution of                                          (5.4.12)
                                       y - 4y + 3y = e3x(6 + 8x + 12x2).

Solution Substituting         y = u e3x + 3ue3x,  and y = u e3x + 6u e3x + 9ue3x
                   y = ue3x,

into (5.4.12) and canceling e3x yields
                             (u + 6u + 9u) - 4(u + 3u) + 3u = 6 + 8x + 12x2,

or

                                       u + 2u = 6 + 8x + 12x2.                       (5.4.13)

There's no u term in this equation, since e3x is a solution of the complementary equation for (5.4.12).
(See Exercise 30.) Therefore (5.4.13) does not have a particular solution of the form up = A + Bx + Cx2

that we used successfully in Example 5.4.4, since with this choice of up,

                                            up + 2up = 2C + (B + 2Cx)

can't contain the last term (12x2) on the right side of (5.4.13). Instead, let's try up = Ax + Bx2 + Cx3
on the grounds that

                                up = A + 2Bx + 3Cx2 and up = 2B + 6Cx
together contain all the powers of x that appear on the right side of (5.4.13).

   Substituting these expressions in place of u and u in (5.4.13) yields

     (2B + 6Cx) + 2(A + 2Bx + 3Cx2) = (2B + 2A) + (6C + 4B)x + 6Cx2 = 6 + 8x + 12x2.

Comparing coefficients of like powers of x on the two sides of the last equality shows that up satisfies

(5.4.13) if

                                                  6C = 12

                                             4B + 6C = 8

                                       2A + 2B    = 6.

Solving these equations successively yields C = 2, B = -1, and A = 4. Therefore

                                          up = x(4 - x + 2x2)

is a particular solution of (5.4.13), and
                                          yp = upe3x = xe3x(4 - x + 2x2)

is a particular solution of (5.4.12).

                              4y + 4y + y = e-x/2(-8 + 48x + 144x2).                 (5.4.14)

Solution Substituting

    y = ue-x/2, y = u e-x/2 - 1 ue-x/2, and y = u e-x/2 - u e-x/2 + 1 ue-x/2

234 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations I

into (5.4.14) and canceling e-x/2 yields

           4 u - u + u + 4 u - u + u = 4u = -8 + 48x + 144x2,
                             4            2

or

                                       u = -2 + 12x + 36x2,                     (5.4.15)

which does not contain u or u because e-x/2 and xe-x/2 are both solutions of the complementary
equation. (See Exercise 30.) To obtain a particular solution of (5.4.15) we integrate twice, taking the
constants of integration to be zero; thus,

           up = -2x + 6x2 + 12x3 and up = -x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 = x2(-1 + 2x + 3x2).

Therefore

                             yp = upe-x/2 = x2e-x/2(-1 + 2x + 3x2)

is a particular solution of (5.4.14).

Summary

The preceding examples illustrate the following facts concerning particular solutions of a constant coef-

ficent equation of the form

                                       ay + by + cy = exG(x),

where G is a polynomial (see Exercise 30):
(a) If ex isn't a solution of the complementary equation

                                          ay + by + cy = 0,                     (5.4.16)

      then yp = exQ(x), where Q is a polynomial of the same degree as G. (See Example 5.4.4).
(b) If ex is a solution of (5.4.16) but xex is not, then yp = xexQ(x), where Q is a polynomial of

      the same degree as G. (See Example 5.4.5.)
(c) If both ex and xex are solutions of (5.4.16), then yp = x2exQ(x), where Q is a polynomial of

      the same degree as G. (See Example 5.4.6.)
  In all three cases, you can just substitute the appropriate form for yp and its derivatives directly into

                                            ayp + byp + cyp = exG(x),

and solve for the coefficients of the polynomial Q. However, if you try this you will see that the compu-
tations are more tedious than those that you encounter by making the substitution y = uex and finding
a particular solution of the resulting equation for u. (See Exercises 34-36.) In Case (a) the equation for u
will be of the form

                                           au + p ()u + p()u = G(x),

with a particular solution of the form up = Q(x), a polynomial of the same degree as G, whose coeffi-
cients can be found by the method used in Example 5.4.4. In Case (b) the equation for u will be of the
form

                                                 au + p ()u = G(x)

(no u term on the left), with a particular solution of the form up = xQ(x), where Q is a polynomial of
the same degree as G whose coefficents can be found by the method used in Example 5.4.5. In Case (c)
the equation for u will be of the form

                                                       au = G(x)
                               Section 5.4 The Method of Undetermined Coefficients 235

with a particular solution of the form up = x2Q(x) that can be obtained by integrating G(x)/a twice and
taking the constants of integration to be zero, as in Example 5.4.6.

Using the Principle of Superposition

The next example shows how to combine the method of undetermined coefficients and Theorem 5.3.3,
the principle of superposition.

Example 5.4.7 Find a particular solution of                                    (5.4.17)
                                           y - 7y + 12y = 4e2x + 5e4x.

Solution In Example 5.4.1 we found that yp1 = 2e2x is a particular solution of
                                                y - 7y + 12y = 4e2x,

and in Example 5.4.2 we found that yp2 = 5xe4x is a particular solution of
                                                y - 7y + 12y = 5e4x.

Therefore the principle of superposition implies that yp = 2e2x+5xe4x is a particular solution of (5.4.17).

5.5 THE METHOD OF UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS II

In this section we consider the constant coefficient equation                      (5.5.1)
                               ay + by + cy = ex (P (x) cos x + Q(x) sin x)

where  and  are real numbers,  = 0, and P and Q are polynomials. We want to find a particular
solution of (5.5.1). As in Section 5.4, the procedure that we will use is called the method of undetermined
coefficients.

Forcing Functions Without Exponential Factors

We begin with the case where  = 0 in (5.5.1); thus, we we want to find a particular solution of

                           ay + by + cy = P (x) cos x + Q(x) sin x,                (5.5.2)

where P and Q are polynomials.
   Differentiating xr cos x and xr sin x yields

                           d xr cos x = -xr sin x + rxr-1 cos x
                           dx

and                        d xr sin x = xr cos x + rxr-1 sin x.
                           dx

This implies that if

                               yp = A(x) cos x + B(x) sin x

where A and B are polynomials, then

                                 ayp + byp + cyp = F (x) cos x + G(x) sin x,

where F and G are polynomials with coefficients that can be expressed in terms of the coefficients of A
and B. This suggests that we try to choose A and B so that F = P and G = Q, respectively. Then yp
will be a particular solution of (5.5.2). The next theorem tells us how to choose the proper form for yp.
For the proof see Exercise 37.

Theorem 5.5.1 Suppose  is a positive number and P and Q are polynomials. Let k be the larger of the
degrees of P and Q. Then the equation

                           ay + by + cy = P (x) cos x + Q(x) sin x

has a particular solution

                               yp = A(x) cos x + B(x) sin x,                       (5.5.3)
                                      Section 5.5 The Method of Undetermined Coefficients II 239

where

       A(x) = A0 + A1x +    + Akxk and B(x) = B0 + B1x +    + Bkxk,

provided that cos x and sin x are not solutions of the complementary equation. The solutions of

       a(y + 2y) = P (x) cos x + Q(x) sin x

(for which cos x and sin x are solutions of the complementary equation) are of the form (5.5.3), where
          A(x) = A0x + A1x2 +    + Akxk+1 and B(x) = B0x + B1x2 +    + Bkxk+1.

For an analog of this theorem that's applicable to (5.5.1), see Exercise 38.

Example 5.5.1 Find a particular solution of

                                      y - 2y + y = 5 cos 2x + 10 sin 2x.      (5.5.4)

Solution In (5.5.4) the coefficients of cos 2x and sin 2x are both zero degree polynomials (constants).
Therefore Theorem 5.5.1 implies that (5.5.4) has a particular solution

                                      yp = A cos 2x + B sin 2x.

Since

       yp = -2A sin 2x + 2B cos 2x and       yp = -4(A cos 2x + B sin 2x),

replacing y by yp in (5.5.4) yields

       yp - 2yp + yp = -4(A cos 2x + B sin 2x) - 4(-A sin 2x + B cos 2x)
                                 +(A cos 2x + B sin 2x)

                           = (-3A - 4B) cos 2x + (4A - 3B) sin 2x.

Equating the coefficients of cos 2x and sin 2x here with the corresponding coefficients on the right side
of (5.5.4) shows that yp is a solution of (5.5.4) if

                                      -3A - 4B = 5
                                        4A - 3B = 10.

Solving these equations yields A = 1, B = -2. Therefore

                                      yp = cos 2x - 2 sin 2x

is a particular solution of (5.5.4).

Example 5.5.2 Find a particular solution of

                                      y + 4y = 8 cos 2x + 12 sin 2x.          (5.5.5)

Solution The procedure used in Example 5.5.1 doesn't work here; substituting yp = A cos 2x + B sin 2x
for y in (5.5.5) yields

                     yp + 4yp = -4(A cos 2x + B sin 2x) + 4(A cos 2x + B sin 2x) = 0
240 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

for any choice of A and B, since cos 2x and sin 2x are both solutions of the complementary equation

for (5.5.5). We're dealing with the second case mentioned in Theorem 5.5.1, and should therefore try a

particular solution of the form

                                      yp = x(A cos 2x + B sin 2x).                      (5.5.6)

Then

      yp = A cos 2x + B sin 2x + 2x(-A sin 2x + B cos 2x)

and   yp = -4A sin 2x + 4B cos 2x - 4x(A cos 2x + B sin 2x)

      = -4A sin 2x + 4B cos 2x - 4yp (see (5.5.6)),

so
                                        yp + 4yp = -4A sin 2x + 4B cos 2x.

Therefore yp is a solution of (5.5.5) if

      -4A sin 2x + 4B cos 2x = 8 cos 2x + 12 sin 2x,

which holds if A = -3 and B = 2. Therefore

                                      yp = -x(3 cos 2x - 2 sin 2x)

is a particular solution of (5.5.5).

Example 5.5.3 Find a particular solution of

      y + 3y + 2y = (16 + 20x) cos x + 10 sin x.                                        (5.5.7)

Solution The coefficients of cos x and sin x in (5.5.7) are polynomials of degree one and zero, respec-
tively. Therefore Theorem 5.5.1 tells us to look for a particular solution of (5.5.7) of the form

      yp = (A0 + A1x) cos x + (B0 + B1x) sin x.                                         (5.5.8)

Then

      yp = (A1 + B0 + B1x) cos x + (B1 - A0 - A1x) sin x                                (5.5.9)

and

      yp = (2B1 - A0 - A1x) cos x - (2A1 + B0 + B1x) sin x,                             (5.5.10)

so                                                                                      (5.5.11)
             yp + 3yp + 2yp = [A0 + 3A1 + 3B0 + 2B1 + (A1 + 3B1)x] cos x
                                         + [B0 + 3B1 - 3A0 - 2A1 + (B1 - 3A1)x] sin x.

Comparing the coefficients of x cos x, x sin x, cos x, and sin x here with the corresponding coefficients
in (5.5.7) shows that yp is a solution of (5.5.7) if

                                                           A1 + 3B1 = 20
                                                       -3A1 + B1 = 0
                                         A0 + 3B0 + 3A1 + 2B1 = 16
                                      -3A0 + B0 - 2A1 + 3B1 = 10.

Solving the first two equations yields A1 = 2, B1 = 6. Substituting these into the last two equations
yields

         A0 + 3B0 = 16 - 3A1 - 2B1 = -2
      -3A0 + B0 = 10 + 2A1 - 3B1 = -4.
                                           Section 5.5 The Method of Undetermined Coefficients II 241

Solving these equations yields A0 = 1, B0 = -1. Substituting A0 = 1, A1 = 2, B0 = -1, B1 = 6 into
(5.5.8) shows that

                                        yp = (1 + 2x) cos x - (1 - 6x) sin x

is a particular solution of (5.5.7).

A Useful Observation

In (5.5.9), (5.5.10), and (5.5.11) the polynomials multiplying sin x can be obtained by replacing A0, A1, B0,
and B1 by B0, B1, -A0, and -A1, respectively, in the polynomials mutiplying cos x. An analogous re-
sult applies in general, as follows (Exercise 36).

Theorem 5.5.2 If

                  yp = A(x) cos x + B(x) sin x,

where A(x) and B(x) are polynomials with coefficients A0 . . . , Ak and B0, . . . , Bk, then the polynomials

multiplying sin x in
                                 yp, yp , ayp + byp + cyp and yp + 2yp

can be obtained by replacing A0, . . . , Ak by B0, . . . , Bk and B0, . . . , Bk by -A0, . . . , -Ak in the
corresponding polynomials multiplying cos x.

   We won't use this theorem in our examples, but we recommend that you use it to check your manipu-
lations when you work the exercises.

Example 5.5.4 Find a particular solution of

                  y + y = (8 - 4x) cos x - (8 + 8x) sin x.                                 (5.5.12)

Solution According to Theorem 5.5.1, we should look for a particular solution of the form  (5.5.13)
                                yp = (A0x + A1x2) cos x + (B0x + B1x2) sin x,

since cos x and sin x are solutions of the complementary equation. However, let's try

                  yp = (A0 + A1x) cos x + (B0 + B1x) sin x                                 (5.5.14)

first, so you can see why it doesn't work. From (5.5.10),

                  yp = (2B1 - A0 - A1x) cos x - (2A1 + B0 + B1x) sin x,

which together with (5.5.14) implies that

                  yp + yp = 2B1 cos x - 2A1 sin x.

Since the right side of this equation does not contain x cos x or x sin x, (5.5.14) can't satisfy (5.5.12) no
matter how we choose A0, A1, B0, and B1.

   Now let yp be as in (5.5.13). Then

                  yp = A0 + (2A1 + B0)x + B1x2 cos x

                  + B0 + (2B1 - A0)x - A1x2 sin x

and               yp = 2A1 + 2B0 - (A0 - 4B1)x - A1x2 cos x

                  + 2B1 - 2A0 - (B0 + 4A1)x - B1x2 sin x,
242 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

so
                    yp + yp = (2A1 + 2B0 + 4B1x) cos x + (2B1 - 2A0 - 4A1x) sin x.

Comparing the coefficients of cos x and sin x here with the corresponding coefficients in (5.5.12) shows
that yp is a solution of (5.5.12) if

                                                           4B1 = -4
                                                         -4A1 = -8
                                                   2B0 + 2A1 = 8
                                                -2A0 + 2B1 = -8.

The solution of this system is A1 = 2, B1 = -1, A0 = 3, B0 = 2. Therefore

      yp = x [(3 + 2x) cos x + (2 - x) sin x]

is a particular solution of (5.5.12).                                               (5.5.15)
Forcing Functions with Exponential Factors
To find a particular solution of

                               ay + by + cy = ex (P (x) cos x + Q(x) sin x)

when  = 0, we recall from Section 5.4 that substituting y = uex into (5.5.15) will produce a constant

coefficient equation for u with the forcing function P (x) cos x + Q(x) sin x. We can find a particular
solution up of this equation by the procedure that we used in Examples 5.5.1-5.5.4. Then yp = upex is
a particular solution of (5.5.15).

Example 5.5.5 Find a particular solution of                                         (5.5.16)
                             y - 3y + 2y = e-2x [2 cos 3x - (34 - 150x) sin 3x] .

Solution Let y = ue-2x. Then

                       y - 3y + 2y = e-2x [(u - 4u + 4u) - 3(u - 2u) + 2u]
                                            = e-2x(u - 7u + 12u)
                                            = e-2x [2 cos 3x - (34 - 150x) sin 3x]

if                                                                                  (5.5.17)
                                u - 7u + 12u = 2 cos 3x - (34 - 150x) sin 3x.       (5.5.18)

Since cos 3x and sin 3x aren't solutions of the complementary equation

      u - 7u + 12u = 0,

Theorem 5.5.1 tells us to look for a particular solution of (5.5.17) of the form

      up = (A0 + A1x) cos 3x + (B0 + B1x) sin 3x.

Then

      up = (A1 + 3B0 + 3B1x) cos 3x + (B1 - 3A0 - 3A1x) sin 3x

and   up = (-9A0 + 6B1 - 9A1x) cos 3x - (9B0 + 6A1 + 9B1x) sin 3x,
                                       Section 5.5 The Method of Undetermined Coefficients II 243

so

    up - 7up + 12up = [3A0 - 21B0 - 7A1 + 6B1 + (3A1 - 21B1)x] cos 3x
                                 + [21A0 + 3B0 - 6A1 - 7B1 + (21A1 + 3B1)x] sin 3x.

Comparing the coefficients of x cos 3x, x sin 3x, cos 3x, and sin 3x here with the corresponding coeffi-
cients on the right side of (5.5.17) shows that up is a solution of (5.5.17) if

                        3A1 - 21B1 = 0                                                   (5.5.19)
                       21A1 + 3B1 = 150
     3A0 - 21B0 - 7A1 + 6B1 = 2
    21A0 + 3B0 - 6A1 - 7B1 = -34.

Solving the first two equations yields A1 = 7, B1 = 1. Substituting these values into the last two
equations of (5.5.19) yields

     3A0 - 21B0 = 2 + 7A1 - 6B1 = 45
    21A0 + 3B0 = -34 + 6A1 + 7B1 = 15.

Solving this system yields A0 = 1, B0 = -2. Substituting A0 = 1, A1 = 7, B0 = -2, and B1 = 1 into
(5.5.18) shows that

                                       up = (1 + 7x) cos 3x - (2 - x) sin 3x

is a particular solution of (5.5.17). Therefore

                                   yp = e-2x [(1 + 7x) cos 3x - (2 - x) sin 3x]

is a particular solution of (5.5.16).

Example 5.5.6 Find a particular solution of                                              (5.5.20)
                          y + 2y + 5y = e-x [(6 - 16x) cos 2x - (8 + 8x) sin 2x] .

Solution Let y = ue-x. Then                                                              (5.5.21)
                         y + 2y + 5y = e-x [(u - 2u + u) + 2(u - u) + 5u]
                                             = e-x(u + 4u)
                                             = e-x [(6 - 16x) cos 2x - (8 + 8x) sin 2x]

if
                                  u + 4u = (6 - 16x) cos 2x - (8 + 8x) sin 2x.

Since cos 2x and sin 2x are solutions of the complementary equation

                                                       u + 4u = 0,

Theorem 5.5.1 tells us to look for a particular solution of (5.5.21) of the form

                               up = (A0x + A1x2) cos 2x + (B0x + B1x2) sin 2x.
244 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

Then

      up = A0 + (2A1 + 2B0)x + 2B1x2 cos 2x

      + B0 + (2B1 - 2A0)x - 2A1x2 sin 2x

and   up = 2A1 + 4B0 - (4A0 - 8B1)x - 4A1x2 cos 2x

      + 2B1 - 4A0 - (4B0 + 8A1)x - 4B1x2 sin 2x,

so
                  up + 4up = (2A1 + 4B0 + 8B1x) cos 2x + (2B1 - 4A0 - 8A1x) sin 2x.

Equating the coefficients of x cos 2x, x sin 2x, cos 2x, and sin 2x here with the corresponding coefficients
on the right side of (5.5.21) shows that up is a solution of (5.5.21) if

                                                      8B1 = -16            (5.5.22)
                                                   -8A1 = - 8
                                             4B0 + 2A1 = 6
                                           -4A0 + 2B1 = -8.

The solution of this system is A1 = 1, B1 = -2, B0 = 1, A0 = 1. Therefore

      up = x[(1 + x) cos 2x + (1 - 2x) sin 2x]

is a particular solution of (5.5.21), and

      yp = xe-x [(1 + x) cos 2x + (1 - 2x) sin 2x]

is a particular solution of (5.5.20).
   You can also find a particular solution of (5.5.20) by substituting

      yp = xe-x [(A0 + A1x) cos 2x + (B0 + B1x) sin 2x]

for y in (5.5.20) and equating the coefficients of xe-x cos 2x, xe-x sin 2x, e-x cos 2x, and e-x sin 2x in
the resulting expression for

                                                     yp + 2yp + 5yp

with the corresponding coefficients on the right side of (5.5.20). (See Exercise 38). This leads to the same
system (5.5.22) of equations for A0, A1, B0, and B1 that we obtained in Example 5.5.6. However, if you
try this approach you'll see that deriving (5.5.22) this way is much more tedious than the way we did it
in Example 5.5.6.

5.6 REDUCTION OF ORDER

In this section we give a method for finding the general solution of

                        P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F (x)                            (5.6.1)

if we know a nontrivial solution y1 of the complementary equation

                        P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0.                               (5.6.2)

The method is called reduction of order because it reduces the task of solving (5.6.1) to solving a first

order equation. Unlike the method of undetermined coefficients, it does not require P0, P1, and P2 to be
constants, or F to be of any special form.
                                           Section 5.6 Reduction of Order 249

By now you shoudn't be surprised that we look for solutions of (5.6.1) in the form

                     y = uy1                                                                      (5.6.3)

where u is to be determined so that y satisfies (5.6.1). Substituting (5.6.3) and

                     y = u y1 + uy1
                     y = u y1 + 2u y1 + uy1

into (5.6.1) yields

                  P0(x)(u y1 + 2u y1 + uy1 ) + P1(x)(u y1 + uy1) + P2(x)uy1 = F (x).
Collecting the coefficients of u, u , and u yields

                        (P0y1)u + (2P0y1 + P1y1)u + (P0y1 + P1y1 + P2y1)u = F.                    (5.6.4)
However, the coefficient of u is zero, since y1 satisfies (5.6.2). Therefore (5.6.4) reduces to

                     Q0(x)u + Q1(x)u = F,                                                         (5.6.5)

with
                                     Q0 = P0y1 and Q1 = 2P0y1 + P1y1.

(It isn't worthwhile to memorize the formulas for Q0 and Q1!) Since (5.6.5) is a linear first order equation
in u , we can solve it for u by variation of parameters as in Section 1.2, integrate the solution to obtain
u, and then obtain y from (5.6.3).

Example 5.6.1

(a) Find the general solution of                                                                  (5.6.6)
                                           xy - (2x + 1)y + (x + 1)y = x2,                        (5.6.7)

     given that y1 = ex is a solution of the complementary equation
                                            xy - (2x + 1)y + (x + 1)y = 0.

(b) As a byproduct of (a), find a fundamental set of solutions of (5.6.7).

SOLUTION(a) If y = uex, then y = u ex + uex and y = u ex + 2u ex + uex, so                        (5.6.8)
                 xy - (2x + 1)y + (x + 1)y = x(u ex + 2u ex + uex)
                                                              -(2x + 1)(u ex + uex) + (x + 1)uex
                                                        = (xu - u )ex.

Therefore y = uex is a solution of (5.6.6) if and only if
                                                   (xu - u )ex = x2,

which is a first order equation in u . We rewrite it as
                                                    u - u = xe-x.
                                                            x
250 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

To focus on how we apply variation of parameters to this equation, we temporarily write z = u , so that

(5.6.8) becomes                               z - z = xe-x.
                                                    x
                                                                                       (5.6.9)

We leave it to you to show (by separation of variables) that z1 = x is a solution of the complementary

equation                                      z - z =0
                                                    x

for (5.6.9). By applying variation of parameters as in Section 1.2, we can now see that every solution of

(5.6.9) is of the form

          z = vx where v x = xe-x, so v = e-x and v = -e-x + C1.

Since u = z = vx, u is a solution of (5.6.8) if and only if

                                  u = vx = -xe-x + C1x.

Integrating this yields

                                  u = (x + 1)e-x + C1 x2 + C2.
                                                          2

Therefore the general solution of (5.6.6) is

                                  y = uex = x + 1 + C1 x2ex + C2ex.                    (5.6.10)
                                                            2

SOLUTION(b) By letting C1 = C2 = 0 in (5.6.10), we see that yp1 = x + 1 is a solution of (5.6.6). By
letting C1 = 2 and C2 = 0, we see that yp2 = x+1+x2ex is also a solution of (5.6.6). Since the difference
of two solutions of (5.6.6) is a solution of (5.6.7), y2 = yp1 - yp2 = x2ex is a solution of (5.6.7). Since
y2/y1 is nonconstant and we already know that y1 = ex is a solution of (5.6.6), Theorem 5.1.6 implies
that {ex, x2ex} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.6.7).

Although (5.6.10) is a correct form for the general solution of (5.6.6), it's silly to leave the arbitrary co-

efficient of x2ex as C1/2 where C1 is an arbitrary constant. Moreover, it's sensible to make the subscripts
of the coefficients of y1 = ex and y2 = x2ex consistent with the subscripts of the functions themselves.

Therefore we rewrite (5.6.10) as

                                  y = x + 1 + c1ex + c2x2ex

by simply renaming the arbitrary constants. We'll also do this in the next two examples, and in the
answers to the exercises.

Example 5.6.2

(a) Find the general solution of

                                  x2y + xy - y = x2 + 1,

given that y1 = x is a solution of the complementary equation

                                              x2y + xy - y = 0.                        (5.6.11)
                                                                                       (5.6.12)
      As a byproduct of this result, find a fundamental set of solutions of (5.6.11).
(b) Solve the initial value problem

                                 x2y + xy - y = x2 + 1, y(1) = 2, y (1) = -3.
                                                                          Section 5.6 Reduction of Order 251

SOLUTION(a) If y = ux, then y = u x + u and y = u x + 2u , so

                         x2y + xy - y = x2(u x + 2u ) + x(u x + u) - ux
                                               = x3u + 3x2u .

Therefore y = ux is a solution of (5.6.12) if and only if

                         x3u + 3x2u = x2 + 1,

which is a first order equation in u . We rewrite it as

                                                  3      11
                         u + u = + 3.                                                    (5.6.13)
                                                  x xx

To focus on how we apply variation of parameters to this equation, we temporarily write z = u , so that

(5.6.13) becomes               3 11
                         z + z = + 3.
                                                                                         (5.6.14)
                               x xx

We leave it to you to show by separation of variables that z1 = 1/x3 is a solution of the complementary

equation                                       z + 3z = 0
                                                     x

for (5.6.14). By variation of parameters, every solution of (5.6.14) is of the form

                v        v 11                            v = x2 + 1 and        x3
          z = 3 where        = + 3 , so                                   v = + x + C1.

               x         x3 x x                                                 3

Since u = z = v/x3, u is a solution of (5.6.14) if and only if

                         u = x3 v = 13 + x2 1 + x3 C1 .

Integrating this yields

                         u = x3 - 1x - 2x2 C1 + C2.

Therefore the general solution of (5.6.12) is

                         y = ux = x2 - 1 - C1 + C2x.                                     (5.6.15)
                                                  3        2x

Reasoning as in the solution of Example 5.6.1(a), we conclude that y1 = x and y2 = 1/x form a
fundamental set of solutions for (5.6.11).

   As we explained above, we rename the constants in (5.6.15) and rewrite it as

                         y = x2 - 1 + c c 1x + 2 .                                       (5.6.16)
                                               3                x

SOLUTION(b) Differentiating (5.6.16) yields                                              (5.6.17)
                                                  y = 2x3 + c1 - x2 c2 .
252 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

Setting x = 1 in (5.6.16) and (5.6.17) and imposing the initial conditions y(1) = 2 and y (1) = -3
yields

                                        c1 + c2 = 8
                                                            3

                                        c1 - c2 = - 11 .
                                                            3

Solving these equations yields c1 = -1/2, c2 = 19/6. Therefore the solution of (5.6.12) is

                                        y = x2 - 1 - x + 19 .
                                        3             2 6x

   Using reduction of order to find the general solution of a homogeneous linear second order equation
leads to a homogeneous linear first order equation in u that can be solved by separation of variables. The
next example illustrates this.

Example 5.6.3 Find the general solution and a fundamental set of solutions of               (5.6.18)
                                                x2y - 3xy + 3y = 0,

given that y1 = x is a solution.

Solution If y = ux then y = u x + u and y = u x + 2u , so

                        x2y - 3xy + 3y = x2(u x + 2u ) - 3x(u x + u) + 3ux
                                                  = x3u - x2u .

Therefore y = ux is a solution of (5.6.18) if and only if
                                                    x3u - x2u = 0.

Separating the variables u and x yields               u = 1,              u = C1x.
                                                      ux
so                                                     or, equivalently,
                               ln |u | = ln |x| + k,

Therefore                               u = C1 x2 + C2,
so the general solution of (5.6.18) is         2

                                        y = ux = C1 x3 + C2x,
                                                      2

which we rewrite as

                                        y = c1x + c2x3.

Therefore {x, x3} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.6.18).

5.7 VARIATION OF PARAMETERS

In this section we give a method called variation of parameters for finding a particular solution of

P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F (x)                                                                      (5.7.1)

if we know a fundamental set {y1, y2} of solutions of the complementary equation

P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0.                                                                         (5.7.2)

Having found a particular solution yp by this method, we can write the general solution of (5.7.1) as

                                        y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2.

   Since we need only one nontrivial solution of (5.7.2) to find the general solution of (5.7.1) by reduction
of order, it's natural to ask why we're interested in variation of parameters, which requires two linearly
independent solutions of (5.7.2) to achieve the same goal. Here's the answer:

 If we already know two linearly independent solutions of (5.7.2) then variation of parameters will
  probably be simpler than reduction of order.

 Variation of parameters generalizes naturally to a method for finding particular solutions of higher
  order linear equations (Section 9.4) and linear systems of equations (Section 10.7), while reduction
  of order doesn't.

 Variation of parameters is a powerful theoretical tool used by researchers in differential equations.
  Although a detailed discussion of this is beyond the scope of this book, you can get an idea of what
  it means from Exercises 37-39.
256 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

We'll now derive the method. As usual, we consider solutions of (5.7.1) and (5.7.2) on an interval (a, b)

where P0, P1, P2, and F are continuous and P0 has no zeros. Suppose that {y1, y2} is a fundamental

set of solutions of the complementary equation (5.7.2). We look for a particular solution of (5.7.1) in the

form

                      yp = u1y1 + u2y2                                     (5.7.3)

where u1 and u2 are functions to be determined so that yp satisfies (5.7.1). You may not think this is a
good idea, since there are now two unknown functions to be determined, rather than one. However, since
u1 and u2 have to satisfy only one condition (that yp is a solution of (5.7.1)), we can impose a second
condition that produces a convenient simplification, as follows.

   Differentiating (5.7.3) yields

                                          yp = u1y1 + u2y2 + u1y1 + u2y2.  (5.7.4)
As our second condition on u1 and u2 we require that

                      u1y1 + u2y2 = 0.                                     (5.7.5)

Then (5.7.4) becomes

                      yp = u1y1 + u2y2;                                    (5.7.6)

that is, (5.7.5) permits us to differentiate yp (once!) as if u1 and u2 are constants. Differentiating (5.7.4)

yields

                      yp = u1y1 + u2y2 + u1y1 + u2y2.                      (5.7.7)

(There are no terms involving u1 and u2 here, as there would be if we hadn't required (5.7.5).) Substitut-
ing (5.7.3), (5.7.6), and (5.7.7) into (5.7.1) and collecting the coefficients of u1 and u2 yields

              u1(P0y1 + P1y1 + P2y1) + u2(P0y2 + P1y2 + P2y2) + P0(u1y1 + u2y2) = F.

As in the derivation of the method of reduction of order, the coefficients of u1 and u2 here are both zero
because y1 and y2 satisfy the complementary equation. Hence, we can rewrite the last equation as

                                                 P0(u1y1 + u2y2) = F.      (5.7.8)
Therefore yp in (5.7.3) satisfies (5.7.1) if

                      u1y1 + u2y2 = 0                                      (5.7.9)
                      u1y1 + u2y2 = FP ,0

where the first equation is the same as (5.7.5) and the second is from (5.7.8).

   We'll now show that you can always solve (5.7.9) for u1 and u2. (The method that we use here will
always work, but simpler methods usually work when you're dealing with specific equations.) To obtain

u1, multiply the first equation in (5.7.9) by y2 and the second equation by y2. This yields

                      u1y1y2 + u2y2y2 = 0
                      u1y1y2 + u2y2y2 = F y2 P . 0

Subtracting the second equation from the first yields

                      u1(y1y2 - y1y2) = - F y2 P . 0                       (5.7.10)
                                                               Section 5.7 Variation of Parameters 257

Since {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of (5.7.2) on (a, b), Theorem 5.1.6 implies that the
Wronskian y1y2 - y1y2 has no zeros on (a, b). Therefore we can solve (5.7.10) for u1, to obtain

                      u1 = - F y2 P . 0(y1y2 - y1y2)                                            (5.7.11)

We leave it to you to start from (5.7.9) and show by a similar argument that

                      u2 =                        F y1 .                                        (5.7.12)
                                             P0(y1y2 - y1y2)

   We can now obtain u1 and u2 by integrating u1 and u2. The constants of integration can be taken to be
zero, since any choice of u1 and u2 in (5.7.3) will suffice.

You should not memorize (5.7.11) and (5.7.12). On the other hand, you don't want to rederive the

whole procedure for every specific problem. We recommend the a compromise:

(a) Write

                                             yp = u1y1 + u2y2                                   (5.7.13)

to remind yourself of what you're doing.

(b) Write the system

                                             u1y1 + u2y2 = 0                                    (5.7.14)
                                             u1y1 + u2y2 = FP0

for the specific problem you're trying to solve.

(c) Solve (5.7.14) for u1 and u2 by any convenient method.
(d) Obtain u1 and u2 by integrating u1 and u2, taking the constants of integration to be zero.
(e) Substitute u1 and u2 into (5.7.13) to obtain yp.

Example 5.7.1 Find a particular solution yp of

                      x2y - 2xy + 2y = x9/2,                                                    (5.7.15)

given that y1 = x and y2 = x2 are solutions of the complementary equation
                                                x2y - 2xy + 2y = 0.

Then find the general solution of (5.7.15).

Solution We set                              yp = u1x + u2x2,
where

                      u1x + u2x2 = 0

                      u1 + 2u2x                      x9/2 5/2
                                                = 2 =x .

                                                       x

From the first equation, u1 = -u2x. Substituting this into the second equation yields u2x = x5/2, so
u2 = x3/2 and therefore u1 = -u2x = -x5/2. Integrating and taking the constants of integration to be

zero yields           u1 = - 2 x7/2 and           u2 = 2 x5/2.

258 Chapter 5 Linear Second Order Equations

Therefore        yp = u1x + u2x2 = - 2 x7/2x + 2 x5/2x2 = 4 x9/2,

                                             7  5                       35

and the general solution of (5.7.15) is

                                              y = 4 x9/2 + c1x + c2x2.
                                                    35

Example 5.7.2 Find a particular solution yp of

                 (x - 1)y - xy + y = (x - 1)2,                              (5.7.16)

given that y1 = x and y2 = ex are solutions of the complementary equation

                                         (x - 1)y - xy + y = 0.

Then find the general solution of (5.7.16).

Solution We set                              yp = u1x + u2ex,
where

                 u1x + u2ex = 0
                 u1 + u2ex = (x - 1)2 = x - 1.

                                          x-1

Subtracting the first equation from the second yields -u1(x - 1) = x - 1, so u1 = -1. From this and
the first equation, u2 = -xe-xu1 = xe-x. Integrating and taking the constants of integration to be zero

yields
                                       u1 = -x and u2 = -(x + 1)e-x.

Therefore

                 yp = u1x + u2ex = (-x)x + (-(x + 1)e-x)ex = -x2 - x - 1,

so the general solution of (5.7.16) is

y = yp + c1x + c2ex = -x2 - x - 1 + c1x + c2ex = -x2 - 1 + (c1 - 1)x + c2ex. (5.7.17)

However, since c1 is an arbitrary constant, so is c1 -1; therefore, we improve the appearance of this result
by renaming the constant and writing the general solution as

                                        y = -x2 - 1 + c1x + c2ex.           (5.7.18)

   There's nothing wrong with leaving the general solution of (5.7.16) in the form (5.7.17); however, we
think you'll agree that (5.7.18) is preferable. We can also view the transition from (5.7.17) to (5.7.18)
differently. In this example the particular solution yp = -x2-x-1 contained the term -x, which satisfies
the complementary equation. We can drop this term and redefine yp = -x2 - 1, since -x2 - x - 1 is a
solution of (5.7.16) and x is a solution of the complementary equation; hence, -x2-1 = (-x2-x-1)+x
is also a solution of (5.7.16). In general, it's always legitimate to drop linear combinations of {y1, y2}
from particular solutions obtained by variation of parameters. (See Exercise 36 for a general discussion
of this question.) We'll do this in the following examples and in the answers to exercises that ask for a
particular solution. Therefore, don't be concerned if your answer to such an exercise differs from ours
only by a solution of the complementary equation.

Example 5.7.3 Find a particular solution of

                                     y + 3y + 2y =  1                                           (5.7.19)
                                                       x.
                                                    1+e

Then find the general solution.

Solution
   The characteristic polynomial of the complementary equation

                                     y + 3y + 2y = 0                                            (5.7.20)

is p(r) = r2 + 3r + 2 = (r + 1)(r + 2), so y1 = e-x and y2 = e-2x form a fundamental set of solutions
of (5.7.20). We look for a particular solution of (5.7.19) in the form

                                     yp = u1e-x + u2e-2x,

where

                                       u1e-x + u2e-2x = 0
                                     -u1e-x - 2u2e-2x = 1 + ex 1 .

Adding these two equations yields

                          -u2e-2x =          1  x , so u2 = -     e2x  x.

                                     1+e                        1+e

From the first equation,                            ex
                                                       x.
                                     u1 = -u2e-x =  1+e

Integrating by means of the substitution v = ex and taking the constants of integration to be zero yields

           u1 =                    ex dx =       dv = ln(1 + v) = ln(1 + ex)
                                 1 + ex         1+v

and

           u2 = -                      e2x dx = -    v dv =           1 - 1 dv
                                     1 + ex        1+v              1+v

                          = ln(1 + v) - v = ln(1 + ex) - ex.

Therefore

                          yp = u1e-x + u2e-2x
                               = [ln(1 + ex)]e-x + [ln(1 + ex) - ex] e-2x,

so
                                       yp = e-x + e-2x ln(1 + ex) - e-x.

Since the last term on the right satisfies the complementary equation, we drop it and redefine

                                     yp = e-x + e-2x ln(1 + ex).

The general solution of (5.7.19) is

           y = yp + c1e-x + c2e-2x = e-x + e-2x ln(1 + ex) + c1e-x + c2e-2x.

Example 5.7.4 Solve the initial value problem

            (x2 - 1)y + 4xy + 2y = 2 , y(0) = -1,                            y (0) = -5,         (5.7.21)
                                              x+1

given that                 y1 = 1 and y2 = 1

                                   x-1                            x+1

are solutions of the complementary equation

                                 (x2 - 1)y + 4xy + 2y = 0.

Solution We first use variation of parameters to find a particular solution of

                           (x2 - 1)y + 4xy + 2y = 2
                                                             x+1

on (-1, 1) in the form             yp = u1 + u2 ,
where                                     x-1 x+1

                             u1    + u2        =0                                                (5.7.22)
                           x-1         x+1

                           - (x - 1)2 u1 - (x + 1)2 u2 = (x + 1)(x2 2 - 1) .

Multiplying the first equation by 1/(x - 1) and adding the result to the second equation yields

                           1-                 1                   2             .                (5.7.23)
                                                  2 u2 =
                           x2 - 1 (x + 1)                 (x + 1)(x - 1)  2

Since                   1  1                  (x + 1) - (x - 1)                 2

            x2 - 1 - (x + 1)2 = (x + 1)(x2 - 1) = (x + 1)(x2 - 1) ,

(5.7.23) implies that u2 = 1. From (5.7.22),

                                 u1 = - x - 1 x + 1 u2 = - x - 1 x + 1 .

Integrating and taking the constants of integration to be zero yields

                           u1 = -  x - 1 dx = -                   x + 1 - 2 dx
                                   x+1                              x+1

                           = 2 - 1 dx = 2 ln(x + 1) - x
                                     x+1

and
                                                    u2 = dx = x.
                                                                        Section 5.7 Variation of Parameters 261

Therefore

           yp = u1 + u2 = [2 ln(x + 1) - x] 1 + x 1
                x-1 x+1                                   x-1 x+1

                = 2 ln(x + 1) + x 1 - 1 = 2 ln(x + 1) -                                  2x .
                       x-1      x+1 x-1                                 x-1  (x + 1)(x - 1)

However, since

                                    2x = 1 + 1
                             (x + 1)(x - 1) x + 1 x - 1

is a solution of the complementary equation, we redefine

                                                    yp = 2 ln(x + 1) .
                                                              x-1

Therefore the general solution of (5.7.24) is

                             y = 2 ln(x + 1) + c1 + c2 .                                       (5.7.24)
                                x-1  x-1 x+1

Differentiating this yields

                       y = x2 2- 1 - (x - 1)2 2 ln(x + 1) - (x - 1)2 c1 - (x + 1)2 c2 .

Setting x = 0 in the last two equations and imposing the initial conditions y(0) = -1 and y (0) = -5
yields the system

                                     -c1 + c2 = -1
                                -2 - c1 - c2 = -5.

The solution of this system is c1 = 2, c2 = 1. Substituting these into (5.7.24) yields

                             y = 2 ln(x + 1) + 2 + 1
                                x-1      x-1 x+1

                             =  2 ln(x + 1) 3x + 1
                                     +2
                                x-1      x -1

as the solution of (5.7.21). Figure 5.7.1 is a graph of the solution.

Comparison of Methods

We've now considered three methods for solving nonhomogeneous linear equations: undetermined co-
efficients, reduction of order, and variation of parameters. It's natural to ask which method is best for a
given problem. The method of undetermined coefficients should be used for constant coefficient equa-
tions with forcing functions that are linear combinations of polynomials multiplied by functions of the
form ex, ex cos x, or ex sin x. Although the other two methods can be used to solve such problems,
they will be more difficult except in the most trivial cases, because of the integrations involved.

   If the equation isn't a constant coefficient equation or the forcing function isn't of the form just spec-
ified, the method of undetermined coefficients does not apply and the choice is necessarily between the
other two methods. The case could be made that reduction of order is better because it requires only
one solution of the complementary equation while variation of parameters requires two. However, vari-
ation of parameters will probably be easier if you already know a fundamental set of solutions of the
complementary equation.

6.1 SPRING PROBLEMS I

We consider the motion of an object of mass m, suspended from a spring of negligible mass. We say that
the spring-mass system is in equilibrium when the object is at rest and the forces acting on it sum to zero.
The position of the object in this case is the equilibrium position. We define y to be the displacement of
the object from its equilibrium position (Figure 6.1.1), measured positive upward.

Our model accounts for the following kinds of forces acting on the object:

 The force -mg, due to gravity.

 A force Fs exerted by the spring resisting change in its length. The natural length of the spring
  is its length with no mass attached. We assume that the spring obeys Hooke's law: If the length
  of the spring is changed by an amount L from its natural length, then the spring exerts a force
  Fs = kL, where k is a positive number called the spring constant. If the spring is stretched then
  L > 0 and Fs > 0, so the spring force is upward, while if the spring is compressed then L < 0
  and Fs < 0, so the spring force is downward.

 A damping force Fd = -cy that resists the motion with a force proportional to the velocity of
  the object. It may be due to air resistance or friction in the spring. However, a convenient way to
  visualize a damping force is to assume that the object is rigidly attached to a piston with negligible
  mass immersed in a cylinder (called a dashpot) filled with a viscous liquid (Figure 6.1.2). As the
  piston moves, the liquid exerts a damping force. We say that the motion is undamped if c = 0, or
  damped if c > 0.

 An external force F , other than the force due to gravity, that may vary with t, but is independent of
  displacement and velocity. We say that the motion is free if F  0, or forced if F  0.

From Newton's second law of motion,

      my = -mg + Fd + Fs + F = -mg - cy + Fs + F.                           (6.1.1)
                                                                 Section 6.1 Spring Problems I 269

Figure 6.1.3 (a) Natural length of spring (b) Spring stretched by mass

We must now relate Fs to y. In the absence of external forces the object stretches the spring by an amount
l to assume its equilibrium position (Figure 6.1.3). Since the sum of the forces acting on the object is
then zero, Hooke's Law implies that mg = kl. If the object is displaced y units from its equilibrium
position, the total change in the length of the spring is L = l - y, so Hooke's law implies that

                                       Fs = kL = kl - ky.

Substituting this into (6.1.1) yields

my = -mg - cy + kL - ky + F.

Since mg = kl this can be written as

                                       my + cy + ky = F.                (6.1.2)

We call this the equation of motion.

Simple Harmonic Motion

Throughout the rest of this section we'll consider spring-mass systems without damping; that is, c = 0.
We'll consider systems with damping in the next section.

   We first consider the case where the motion is also free; that is, F =0. We begin with an example.

Example 6.1.1 An object stretches a spring 6 inches in equilibrium.
(a) Set up the equation of motion and find its general solution.

(b) Find the displacement of the object for t > 0 if it's initially displaced 18 inches above equilibrium
      and given a downward velocity of 3 ft/s.
270 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations

SOLUTION(a) Setting c = 0 and F = 0 in (6.1.2) yields the equation of motion

                                           my + ky = 0,

which we rewrite as                        y + k y = 0.
                                                  m
                                                                              (6.1.3)

Although we would need the weight of the object to obtain k from the equation mg = kl we can obtain

k/m from l alone; thus, k/m = g/l. Consistent with the units used in the problem statement, we
take g = 32 ft/s2. Although l is stated in inches, we must convert it to feet to be consistent with this

choice of g; that is, l = 1/2 ft. Therefore

                                           k = 32 = 64
                                           m 1/2

and (6.1.3) becomes

                                           y + 64y = 0.                       (6.1.4)

The characteristic equation of (6.1.4) is

                                           r2 + 64 = 0,

which has the zeros r = 8i. Therefore the general solution of (6.1.4) is

                                           y = c1 cos 8t + c2 sin 8t.         (6.1.5)

SOLUTION(b) The initial upward displacement of 18 inches is positive and must be expressed in feet.
The initial downward velocity is negative; thus,

                                    y(0) = 3 and y (0) = -3.
                                             2

Differentiating (6.1.5) yields

                                    y = -8c1 sin 8t + 8c2 cos 8t.             (6.1.6)

Setting t = 0 in (6.1.5) and (6.1.6) and imposing the initial conditions shows that c1 = 3/2 and c2 =

-3/8. Therefore                            y = 3 cos 8t - 3 sin 8t,

                                           2           8

where y is in feet (Figure 6.1.4).

We'll now consider the equation

                                           my + ky = 0

where m and k are arbitrary positive numbers. Dividing through by m and defining 0 = k/m yields

                                           y  +    2   =  0.

                                                 0 y

The general solution of this equation is

                                    y = c1 cos 0t + c2 sin 0t.                (6.1.7)

We can rewrite this in a more useful form by defining

                                           R=    c2    +  c22,                (6.1.8)

and                                                                                    (6.1.9)
                                         c1 = R cos  and c2 = R sin .

Substituting from (6.1.9) into (6.1.7) and applying the identity

                 cos 0t cos  + sin 0t sin  = cos(0t - )

yields

                             y = R cos(0t - ).                                         (6.1.10)

   From (6.1.8) and (6.1.9) we see that the R and  can be interpreted as polar coordinates of the point
with rectangular coordinates (c1, c2) (Figure 6.1.5). Given c1 and c2, we can compute R from (6.1.8).
From (6.1.8) and (6.1.9), we see that  is related to c1 and c2 by

                 cos  =  c1 and          sin  =      c2 .
                         c2  +  c2                   c2                +  c2

There are infinitely many angles , differing by integer multiples of 2, that satisfy these equations. We
will always choose  so that -   < .

   The motion described by (6.1.7) or (6.1.10) is simple harmonic motion. We see from either of these
equations that the motion is periodic, with period

                                T = 2/0.

This is the time required for the object to complete one full cycle of oscillation (for example, to move from
its highest position to its lowest position and back to its highest position). Since the highest and lowest
positions of the object are y = R and y = -R, we say that R is the amplitude of the oscillation. The

angle  in (6.1.10) is the phase angle. It's measured in radians. Equation (6.1.10) is the amplitude-phase
form of the displacement. If t is in seconds then 0 is in radians per second (rad/s); it's the frequency of
the motion. It is also called the natural frequency of the spring-mass system without damping.

Example 6.1.2 We found the displacement of the object in Example 6.1.1 to be

                                      y = 3 cos 8t - 3 sin 8t.

Find the frequency, period, amplitude, and phase angle of the motion.

Solution The frequency is 0 = 8 rad/s, and the period is T = 2/0 = /4 s. Since c1 = 3/2 and
c2 = -3/8, the amplitude is

     R=                           c2  +  c2  =          32     3 2 3

                                                            =                                                         (6.1.12)

Using a calculator, we see from (6.1.11) that

                                               .245 rad.

Since sin  < 0 (see (6.1.12)), the minus sign applies here; that is,

                                                       -.245 rad.

Example 6.1.3 The natural length of a spring is 1 m. An object is attached to it and the length of the
spring increases to 102 cm when the object is in equilibrium. Then the object is initially displaced
downward 1 cm and given an upward velocity of 14 cm/s. Find the displacement for t > 0. Also, find
the natural frequency, period, amplitude, and phase angle of the resulting motion. Express the answers in
cgs units.

Solution  In cgs units g  = 980 cm/s2.   Since  l  =  2  cm,  2    = g/l = 490. Therefore

                                                                0

                          y + 490y = 0, y(0) = -1, y (0) = 14.

The general solution of the differential equation is

                                                                       
                                  y = c1 cos 7 10t + c2 sin 7 10t,

so                                                                       

                          y = 7 10 -c1 sin 7 10t + c2 cos 7 10t .

                                                                                                           
Substituting the initial conditions into the last two equations yields c1 = -1 and c2 = 2/ 10. Hence,

                                                         2             
                                  y = - cos 7 10t +  sin 7 10t.
                                                              10

                                                              
The frequency is 7 10 rad/s, and the period is T = 2/(7 10) s. The amplitude is

                          R=      c2  +  c2  =  (-1)2 +            22    =  7 cm.
                                                                            5

The phase angle is determined by

                          cos  = c1 = - 5 and sin  = c2 = 2 .
                                      R         7                        R  7

Therefore  is in the second quadrant and

                                   = cos-1 - 5  2.58 rad.

Undamped Forced Oscillation

In many mechanical problems a device is subjected to periodic external forces. For example, soldiers
marching in cadence on a bridge cause periodic disturbances in the bridge, and the engines of a propeller
driven aircraft cause periodic disturbances in its wings. In the absence of sufficient damping forces, such
disturbances - even if small in magnitude - can cause structural breakdown if they are at certain critical
frequencies. To illustrate, this we'll consider the motion of an object in a spring-mass system without
damping, subject to an external force

                                                    F (t) = F0 cos t
274 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations

where F0 is a constant. In this case the equation of motion (6.1.2) is

                                           my + ky = F0 cos t,

which we rewrite as                                       F0

                                           y + 0y = cos t2                  (6.1.13)

                                                          m

with 0 = k/m. We'll see from the next two examples that the solutions of (6.1.13) with  = 0
behave very differently from the solutions with  = 0.

Example 6.1.4 Solve the initial value problem

                                     2     F0
                           y + 0y = cos t, y(0) = 0, y (0) = 0,             (6.1.14)
                                           m

given that  = 0.

Solution We first obtain a particular solution of (6.1.13) by the method of undetermined coefficients.
Since  = 0, cos t isn't a solution of the complementary equation

                                                      y + 02y = 0.

Therefore (6.1.13) has a particular solution of the form

                                           yp = A cos t + B sin t.

Since

                                     yp = -2(A cos t + B sin t),

                                                    2     F0
                                           yp + 0yp = cos t
                                                          m

if and only if             2            2                       F0
This holds if and only if  (0 -  ) (A cos t + B sin t) = cos t.
so                                                                    m

                                     A = 2 2 F0 and B = 0,
                                           m(0 -  )

                                           yp =        2 2 F0 cos t.
                                                 m(0 -  )

The general solution of (6.1.13) is

                                y = 2 2 F0 cos t + c1 cos 0t + c2 sin 0t,   (6.1.15)
                                      m(0 -  )

so
                            y = 2 2 -F0 sin t + 0(-c1 sin 0t + c2 cos 0t).
                                  m(0 -  )

The initial conditions y(0) = 0 and y (0) = 0 in (6.1.14) imply that

                              c1 = -             F0           and c2 = 0.

Substituting these into (6.1.15) yields                                                           (6.1.16)
                                        y = 2 2 F0 (cos t - cos 0t).
                                              m(0 -  )

   It is revealing to write this in a different form. We start with the trigonometric identities

         cos( - ) = cos  cos  + sin  sin 
         cos( + ) = cos  cos  - sin  sin .

Subtracting the second identity from the first yields

         cos( - ) - cos( + ) = 2 sin  sin                                                         (6.1.17)

Now let

          -  = t and                                          +  = 0t,                            (6.1.18)
                                                              = (0 - )t .                         (6.1.19)
so that   = (0 + )t and
                    2                                                    2

Substituting (6.1.18) and (6.1.19) into (6.1.17) yields

         cos t - cos 0t = 2 sin (0 - )t sin (0 + )t ,
                                                             2     2

and substituting this into (6.1.16) yields

         y = R(t) sin (0 + )t ,                                                                   (6.1.20)
                              2

where    R(t) = 2 2 2F0 sin (0 - )t .

                                            m(0 -  )            2                                 (6.1.21)

   From (6.1.20) we can regard y as a sinusoidal variation with frequency (0 + )/2 and variable ampli-
tude |R(t)|. In Figure 6.1.6 the dashed curve above the t axis is y = |R(t)|, the dashed curve below the t
axis is y = -|R(t)|, and the displacement y appears as an oscillation bounded by them. The oscillation
of y for t on an interval between successive zeros of R(t) is called a beat.

   You can see from (6.1.20) and (6.1.21) that

                                                 |y(t)|  2 2 2|F0| ;
                                                            m|0 -  |

moreover, if  + 0 is sufficiently large compared with  - 0, then |y| assumes values close to (perhaps
equal to) this upper bound during each beat. However, the oscillation remains bounded for all t. (This
assumes that the spring can withstand deflections of this size and continue to obey Hooke's law.) The
next example shows that this isn't so if  = 0.

Solution We first obtain a particular solution yp of (6.1.22). Since cos 0t is a solution of the comple-
mentary equation, the form for yp is

             yp = t(A cos 0t + B sin 0t).                                                                                                 (6.1.23)

Then

             yp = A cos 0t + B sin 0t + 0t(-A sin 0t + B cos 0t)

and                                                                                                                                       (6.1.24)
                      yp = 20(-A sin 0t + B cos 0t) - 02t(A cos 0t + B sin 0t).

From (6.1.23) and (6.1.24), we see that yp satisfies (6.1.22) if

             -2A0 sin 0t + 2B0 cos 0t = F0 cos 0t;
                                                        m

that is, if             B = F0 .
                              2m0
             A = 0 and

Therefore    yp = F0t sin 0t
                    2m0

is a particular solution of (6.1.22). The general solution of (6.1.22) is

The graph of yp is shown in Figure 6.1.7, where it can be seen that yp oscillates between the dashed lines

y = F0t and y = - F0t
2m0            2m0

with increasing amplitude that approaches  as t  . Of course, this means that the spring must
eventually fail to obey Hooke's law or break.

   This phenomenon of unbounded displacements of a spring-mass system in response to a periodic
forcing function at its natural frequency is called resonance. More complicated mechanical structures
can also exhibit resonance-like phenomena. For example, rhythmic oscillations of a suspension bridge
by wind forces or of an airplane wing by periodic vibrations of reciprocating engines can cause damage
or even failure if the frequencies of the disturbances are close to critical frequencies determined by the
parameters of the mechanical system in question.

6.2 SPRING PROBLEMS II

Free Vibrations With Damping

In this section we consider the motion of an object in a spring-mass system with damping. We start with
unforced motion, so the equation of motion is

                                      my + cy + ky = 0.                         (6.2.1)

Now suppose the object is displaced from equilibrium and given an initial velocity. Intuition suggests that
if the damping force is sufficiently weak the resulting motion will be oscillatory, as in the undamped case
considered in the previous section, while if it's sufficiently strong the object may just move slowly toward
the equilibrium position without ever reaching it. We'll now confirm these intuitive ideas mathematically.
The characteristic equation of (6.2.1) is

                                      mr2 + cr + k = 0.

The roots of this equation are

                                                                  
                         -c - c2 - 4mk                        -c + c2 - 4mk
                   r1 =                          and r2 =                    .  (6.2.2)
                                2m                                2m

In Section 5.2 we saw that the form of the solution of (6.2.1) depends upon whether c2 - 4mk is positive,
negative, or zero. We'll now consider these three cases.

Underdamped Motion
                                                  

We say the motion is underdamped if c < 4mk. In this case r1 and r2 in (6.2.2) are complex conjugates,

which we write as        r1 = - c - i1 and r2 = - c + i1,

                                  2m                          2m

where                                            

                                      1 =        4mk - c2  .

                                                   2m

The general solution of (6.2.1) in this case is

                                y = e-ct/2m(c1 cos 1t + c2 sin 1t).

By the method used in Section 6.1 to derive the amplitude-phase form of the displacement of an object
in simple harmonic motion, we can rewrite this equation as

                                  y = Re-ct/2m cos(1t - ),                      (6.2.3)

The factor Re-ct/2m in (6.2.3) is called the time-varying amplitude of the motion, the quantity 1 is
called the frequency, and T = 2/1 (which is the period of the cosine function in (6.2.3) is called the
quasi-period. A typical graph of (6.2.3) is shown in Figure 6.2.1. As illustrated in that figure, the graph
of y oscillates between the dashed exponential curves y = 켙e-ct/2m.

Overdamped Motion
                                                   

We say the motion is overdamped if c > 4mk. In this case the zeros r1 and r2 of the characteristic
polynomial are real, with r1 < r2 < 0 (see (6.2.2)), and the general solution of (6.2.1) is

                                                  y = c1er1t + c2er2t.

Again limt y(t) = 0 as in the underdamped case, but the motion isn't oscillatory, since y can't equal
zero for more than one value of t unless c1 = c2 = 0. (Exercise 23.)

Critically Damped Motion
                                                         

We say the motion is critically damped if c = 4mk. In this case r1 = r2 = -c/2m and the general
solution of (6.2.1) is

                                                y = e-ct/2m(c1 + c2t).

   Again limt y(t) = 0 and the motion is nonoscillatory, since y can't equal zero for more than one
value of t unless c1 = c2 = 0. (Exercise 22).

Example 6.2.1 Suppose a 64 lb weight stretches a spring 6 inches in equilibrium and a dashpot provides
a damping force of c lb for each ft/sec of velocity.
(a) Write the equation of motion of the object and determine the value of c for which the motion is

      critically damped.
(b) Find the displacement y for t > 0 if the motion is critically damped and the initial conditions are

      y(0) = 1 and y (0) = 20.
(c) Find the displacement y for t > 0 if the motion is critically damped and the initial conditions are

      y(0) = 1 and y (0) = -20.

SOLUTION(a) Here m = 2 slugs and k = 64/.5 = 128 lb/ft. Therefore the equation of motion (6.2.1) is

                                      2y + cy + 128y = 0.                        (6.2.4)

The characteristic equation is            2r2 + cr + 128 = 0,
which has roots                                      
Therefore the damping is critical if
                                       r = -c  c2 - 8  128 .
                                                         4

                                           
                                      c = 8  128 = 32 lb-sec/ft.

SOLUTION(b) Setting c = 32 in (6.2.4) and cancelling the common factor 2 yields

                                      y + 16y + 64y = 0.

The characteristic equation is        r2 + 16r + 64y = (r + 8)2 = 0.
Hence, the general solution is               y = e-8t(c1 + c2t).

                                                                                 (6.2.5)

     Figure 6.2.2 (a) y = e-8t(1 + 28t) (b) y = e-8t(1 - 12t)

Differentiating this yields

                                       y = -8y + c2e-8t.                                (6.2.6)

Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y (0) = 20 in the last two equations shows that 1 = c1 and
20 = -8 + c2. Hence, the solution of the initial value problem is

                                       y = e-8t(1 + 28t).

Therefore the object approaches equilibrium from above as t  . There's no oscillation.

SOLUTION(c) Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y (0) = -20 in (6.2.5) and (6.2.6) yields
1 = c1 and -20 = -8 + c2. Hence, the solution of this initial value problem is

                                                   y = e-8t(1 - 12t).

Therefore the object moves downward through equilibrium just once, and then approaches equilibrium
from below as t  . Again, there's no oscillation. The solutions of these two initial value problems
are graphed in Figure 6.2.2.

Example 6.2.2 Find the displacement of the object in Example 6.2.1 if the damping constant is c = 4
lb-sec/ft and the initial conditions are y(0) = 1.5 ft and y (0) = -3 ft/sec.

                                r = 2 = -1  3 7i.

Therefore the motion is underdamped and the general solution of (6.2.7) is

                                                                 
                                y = e-t(c1 cos 3 7t + c2 sin 3 7t).

Differentiating this yields
                                y = -y + 37e-t(-c1 sin 37t + c2 cos 37t).

Imposing the initial conditions y(0) = 1.5 and y (0) = -3 in the last two equations yields 1.5 = c1 and
-3 = -1.5 + 3 7c2. Hence, the solution of the initial value problem is

                                     -t 3          1

                                     y =  e cos(3 7t - ),

where                      
       cos  = 3 = 3 7 and
                                                                   1        1

Therefore  = -.125 radians.

Example 6.2.3 Let the damping constant in Example 1 be c = 40 lb-sec/ft. Find the displacement y for
t > 0 if y(0) = 1 and y (0) = 1.

Solution With c = 40, the equation of motion (6.2.4) reduces to

                                     y + 20y + 64y = 0                                (6.2.9)
                                                                                     (6.2.10)
after cancelling the common factor 2. The characteristic equation

                                r2 + 20r + 64 = (r + 16)(r + 4) = 0

has the roots r1 = -4 and r2 = -16. Therefore the general solution of (6.2.9) is
                                                 y = c1e-4t + c2e-16t.

Differentiating this yields

                                     y = -4e-4t - 16c2e-16t.

The last two equations and the initial conditions y(0) = 1 and y (0) = 1 imply that

                                -4c1 - 16c2 = 1.

The solution of this system is c1 = 17/12, c2 = -5/12. Substituting these into (6.2.10) yields

Forced Vibrations With Damping

Now we consider the motion of an object in a spring-mass system with damping, under the influence of a
periodic forcing function F (t) = F0 cos t, so that the equation of motion is

                                my + cy + ky = F0 cos t.                                           (6.2.11)

In Section 6.1 we considered this equation with c = 0 and found that the resulting displacement y assumed

arbitrarily large values in the case of resonance (that is, when  = 0 = k/m). Here we'll see that in

the presence of damping the displacement remains bounded for all t, and the initial conditions have little

effect on the motion as t  . In fact, we'll see that for large t the displacement is closely approximated

by a function of the form

                                y = R cos(t - ),                                                   (6.2.12)

where the amplitude R depends upon m, c, k, F0, and . We're interested in the following question:
                                                               Section 6.2 Spring Problems II 285

QUESTION:Assuming that m, c, k, and F0 are held constant, what value of  produces the largest
amplitude R in (6.2.12), and what is this largest amplitude?

   To answer this question, we must solve (6.2.11) and determine R in terms of F0, 0, , and c. We can
obtain a particular solution of (6.2.11) by the method of undetermined coefficients. Since cos t does not
satisfy the complementary equation

                                                  my + cy + ky = 0,

we can obtain a particular solution of (6.2.11) in the form

                                      yp = A cos t + B sin t.              (6.2.13)

Differentiating this yields        yp = (-A sin t + B cos t)
and                                yp = -2(A cos t + B sin t).
From the last three equations,

       myp + cyp + kyp = (-m2A + cB + kA) cos t + (-m2B - cA + kB) sin t,

so yp satisfies (6.2.11) if

                                   (k - m2)A + cB = F0
                                   -cA + (k - m2)B = 0.

Solving for A and B and substituting the results into (6.2.13) yields

               yp = (k - m2)2 + c22 F0 (k - m2) cos t + c sin t ,

which can be written in amplitude-phase form as

                                yp =           F0 cos(t - ),               (6.2.14)
                                      (k - m2)2 + c22

where

       cos  =       k - m2 and                   sin  =           c .      (6.2.15)
               (k - m2)2 + c22                           (k - m2)2 + c22

To compare this with the undamped forced vibration that we considered in Section 6.1 it's useful to

write                           k - m2 = m km - 2 = m(02 - 2),

                                                                           (6.2.16)

where 0 = k/m is the natural angular frequency of the undamped simple harmonic motion of an
object with mass m on a spring with constant k. Substituting (6.2.16) into (6.2.14) yields

                             yp =               F0 cos(t - ).              (6.2.17)
                                      m2(02 - 2)2 + c22

The solution of an initial value problem

               my + cy + ky = F0 cos t, y(0) = y0, y (0) = v0,
286 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations

is of the form y = yc + yp, where yc has one of the three forms

                              yc = e-ct/2m(c1 cos 1t + c2 sin 1t),
                              yc = e-ct/2m(c1 + c2t),
                              yc = c1er1t + c2er2t (r1, r2 < 0).

In all three cases limt yc(t) = 0 for any choice of c1 and c2. For this reason we say that yc is the
transient component of the solution y. The behavior of y for large t is determined by yp, which we call the
steady state component of y. Thus, for large t the motion is like simple harmonic motion at the frequency

of the external force.

   The amplitude of yp in (6.2.17) is

                              R=                          F0 ,                                                (6.2.18)
                                                m2(02 - 2)2 + c22

which is finite for all ; that is, the presence of damping precludes the phenomenon of resonance that we
encountered in studying undamped vibrations under a periodic forcing function. We'll now find the value
max of  for which R is maximized. This is the value of  for which the function

                                         ()  =  m2(2         -  2)2  +  c22

                                                          0

in the denominator of (6.2.18) attains its minimum value. By rewriting this as

                                     () = m2(04 + 4) + (c2 - 2m202)2,                                         (6.2.19)
you can see that  is a strictly increasing function of 2 if

                                                                     
                                                c  2m202 = 2mk.

(Recall  that  2    =  k/m).  Therefore  max  =  0  if  this    inequality holds.  From  (6.2.15),  you  can  see  that

                 0

 = 0 if  = 0. In this case, (6.2.14) reduces to

                                         yp =       F0 = F0 ,
                                                    m24 k

                                                            0

which is consistent with Hooke's law: if the mass is subjected to a constant force F0, its displacement
should approach a constant yp such that kyp = F0. Now suppose c < 2mk. Then, from (6.2.19),

                               () = 2(2m22 + c2 - 2m202),

and max is the value of  for which the expression in parentheses equals zero; that is,

                              max =      02 - 2m2 c = 2         k 1 - c2 .

(To see that (max) is the minimum value of (), note that  () < 0 if  < max and  () > 0

if  > max.) Substituting  = max in (6.2.18) and simplifying shows that the maximum amplitude

Rmax is                       Rmax =  2mF0

                                         c 4mk - c2

We summarize our results as follows.

Theorem 6.2.1 Suppose we consider the amplitude R of the steady state component of the solution of

                        my + cy + ky = F0 cos t

as a functionof .
   (a) If c  2mk, the maximum amplitude is Rmax = F0/k and it's attained when  = max = 0.
   (b) If c < 2mk, the maximum amplitude is

                        Rmax =  2mF0 ,           (6.2.20)
                                   c 4mk - c2

and it's attained when

                         = max =  k 1 - c2 .     (6.2.21)
                                  m  2km

Note that Rmax and max are continuous functions of c, for c  0, since (6.2.20) and (6.2.21) reduce to
Rmax = F0/k and max = 0 if c = 2km.

6.3 THE RLC CIRCUIT

In this section we consider the RLC circuit, shown schematically in Figure 6.3.1. As we'll see, the RLC
circuit is an electrical analog of a spring-mass system with damping.

   Nothing happens while the switch is open (dashed line). When the switch is closed (solid line) we say
that the circuit is closed. Differences in electrical potential in a closed circuit cause current to flow in
the circuit. The battery or generator in Figure 6.3.1 creates a difference in electrical potential E = E(t)
between its two terminals, which we've marked arbitrarily as positive and negative. (We could just as
well interchange the markings.) We'll say that E(t) > 0 if the potential at the positive terminal is greater
than the potential at the negative terminal, E(t) < 0 if the potential at the positive terminal is less than
the potential at the negative terminal, and E(t) = 0 if the potential is the same at the two terminals. We
call E the impressed voltage.

   At any time t, the same current flows in all points of the circuit. We denote current by I = I(t). We
say that I(t) > 0 if the direction of flow is around the circuit from the positive terminal of the battery or
generator back to the negative terminal, as indicated by the arrows in Figure 6.3.1 I(t) < 0 if the flow is
in the opposite direction, and I(t) = 0 if no current flows at time t.

Differences in potential occur at the resistor, induction coil, and capacitor in Figure 6.3.1. Note that the

two sides of each of these components are also identified as positive and negative. The voltage drop across

each component is defined to be the potential on the positive side of the component minus the potential

on the negative side. This terminology is somewhat misleading, since "drop" suggests a decrease even

though changes in potential are signed quantities and therefore may be increases. Nevertheless, we'll go

along with tradition and call them voltage drops. The voltage drop across the resistor in Figure 6.3.1 is

given by

                                    VR = IR,                                                                (6.3.1)

where I is current and R is a positive constant, the resistance of the resistor. The voltage drop across the

induction coil is given by

                                    VI = L dI = LI ,                                                        (6.3.2)
                                             dt

where L is a positive constant, the inductance of the coil.

A capacitor stores electrical charge Q = Q(t), which is related to the current in the circuit by the

equation

                                                                                                t

                                    0

where Q0 is the charge on the capacitor at t = 0. The voltage drop across a capacitor is given by

                                    VC = Q ,                                                                (6.3.4)
                                            C

where C is a positive constant, the capacitance of the capacitor.
   Table 6.3.8 names the units for the quantities that we've discussed. The units are defined so that

                               1 volt = 1 ampere  1 ohm
                                        = 1 henry  1 ampere/second

   According to Kirchoff 's law, the sum of the voltage drops in a closed RLC circuit equals the impressed
voltage. Therefore, from (6.3.1), (6.3.2), and (6.3.4),

292 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations

This equation contains two unknowns, the current I in the circuit and the charge Q on the capacitor.
However, (6.3.3) implies that Q = I, so (6.3.5) can be converted into the second order equation

                                     LQ + RQ + 1 Q = E(t)                                         (6.3.6)

in Q. To find the current flowing in an RLC circuit, we solve (6.3.6) for Q and then differentiate the
solution to obtain I.

   In Sections 6.1 and 6.2 we encountered the equation

                                     my + cy + ky = F (t)                                         (6.3.7)

in connection with spring-mass systems. Except for notation this equation is the same as (6.3.6). The
correspondence between electrical and mechanical quantities connected with (6.3.6) and (6.3.7) is shown
in Table 6.3.9.

   The equivalence between (6.3.6) and (6.3.7) is an example of how mathematics unifies fundamental
similarities in diverse physical phenomena. Since we've already studied the properties of solutions of
(6.3.7) in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, we can obtain results concerning solutions of (6.3.6) by simpling changing
notation, according to Table 6.3.8.

Free Oscillations

We say that an RLC circuit is in free oscillation if E(t) = 0 for t > 0, so that (6.3.6) becomes

                                               LQ + RQ + 1 Q = 0.                                 (6.3.8)

                                 2L                                   2L

There are three cases to consider, all analogous to the cases considered in Section 6.2 for free vibrations

of a damped spring-mass system.

   CASE 1. The oscillation is underdamped if R < 4L/C. In this case, r1 and r2 in (6.3.9) are complex
conjugates, which we write as

                         r1 = - R + i1 and r2 = - R - i1,
                                     2L                     2L
                                                                       Section 6.3 The RLC Circuit 293

where                                            1 =  4L/C - R2 .
The general solution of (6.3.8) is                        2L

                                    Q = e-Rt/2L(c1 cos 1t + c2 sin 1t),

which we can write as

                                           Q = Ae-Rt/2L cos(1t - ),                  (6.3.10)

where

                       A=           c2  +  c22,  A cos  = c1,  and     A sin  = c2.

                                     1

In the idealized case where R = 0, the solution (6.3.10) reduces to

                                           Q = A cos  t -  ,
                                                             LC

which is analogous to the simple harmonic motion of an undamped spring-mass system in free vibration.
   Actual RLC circuits are usually underdamped, so the case we've just considered is the most important.

However, for completeness we'll consider the other two possibilities.
   CASE 2. The oscillation is overdamped if R > 4L/C. In this case, the zeros r1 and r2 of the

characteristic polynomial are real, with r1 < r2 < 0 (see (6.3.9)), and the general solution of (6.3.8) is

                                                 Q = c1er1t + c2er2t.                (6.3.11)

CASE 3. The oscillation is critically damped if R = 4L/C. In this case, r1 = r2 = -R/2L and

the general solution of (6.3.8) is

                                           Q = e-Rt/2L(c1 + c2t).                    (6.3.12)

   If R = 0, the exponentials in (6.3.10), (6.3.11), and (6.3.12) are negative, so the solution of any
homogeneous initial value problem

                             LQ + RQ + 1 Q = 0, Q(0) = Q0, Q (0) = I0,
                                                C

approaches zero exponentially as t  . Thus, all such solutions are transient, in the sense defined
Section 6.2 in the discussion of forced vibrations of a spring-mass system with damping.

Example 6.3.1 At t = 0 a current of 2 amperes flows in an RLC circuit with resistance R = 40 ohms,
inductance L = .2 henrys, and capacitance C = 10-5 farads. Find the current flowing in the circuit at

t > 0 if the initial charge on the capacitor is 1 coulomb. Assume that E(t) = 0 for t > 0.

Solution The equation for the charge Q is                                            (6.3.13)
                                                                                     (6.3.14)
                                             1 Q + 40Q + 10000Q = 0,
                                             5
or
                                             Q + 200Q + 50000Q = 0.
Therefore we must solve the initial value problem

                            Q + 200Q + 50000Q = 0, Q(0) = 1, Q (0) = 2.
294 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations

The desired current is the derivative of the solution of this initial value problem.
   The characteristic equation of (6.3.13) is

                                       r2 + 200r + 50000 = 0,

which has complex zeros r = -100  200i. Therefore the general solution of (6.3.13) is

Q = e-100t(c1 cos 200t + c2 sin 200t).                                                  (6.3.15)

Differentiating this and collecting like terms yields

Q = -e-100t [(100c1 - 200c2) cos 200t + (100c2 + 200c1) sin 200t] .                     (6.3.16)

To find the solution of the initial value problem (6.3.14), we set t = 0 in (6.3.15) and (6.3.16) to obtain

c1 = Q(0) = 1 and - 100c1 + 200c2 = Q (0) = 2;

therefore, c1 = 1 and c2 = 51/100, so

Q = e-100t cos 200t + 51 sin 200t
                               100

is the solution of (6.3.14). Differentiating this yields

I = e-100t(2 cos 200t - 251 sin 200t).

Forced Oscillations With Damping

An initial value problem for (6.3.6) has the form

LQ + RQ + 1 Q = E(t), Q(0) = Q0, Q (0) = I0,                                            (6.3.17)
                   C

where Q0 is the initial charge on the capacitor and I0 is the initial current in the circuit. We've already
seen that if E  0 then all solutions of (6.3.17) are transient. If E  0, we know that the solution of

(6.3.17) has the form Q = Qc + Qp, where Qc satisfies the complementary equation, and approaches
zero exponentially as t   for any initial conditions , while Qp depends only on E and is independent
of the initial conditions. As in the case of forced oscillations of a spring-mass system with damping, we

call Qp the steady state charge on the capacitor of the RLC circuit. Since I = Q = Qc + Qp and Qc
also tends to zero exponentially as t  , we say that Ic = Qc is the transient current and Ip = Qp is
the steady state current. In most applications we're interested only in the steady state charge and current.

Example 6.3.2 Find the amplitude-phase form of the steady state current in the RLC circuit in Fig-
ure 6.3.1 if the impressed voltage, provided by an alternating current generator, is E(t) = E0 cos t.

Solution We'll first find the steady state charge on the capacitor as a particular solution of

                                          LQ + RQ + 1 Q = E0 cos t.
                                                              C

To do, this we'll simply reinterpret a result obtained in Section 6.2, where we found that the steady state
solution of

                                             my + cy + ky = F0 cos t
                                                              Section 6.3 The RLC Circuit 295

is
                                     yp = F0 cos(t - ),
                                               (k - m2)2 + c22

where                      k - m2 and                                  c .
                      (k - m2)2 + c22                         (k - m2)2 + c22
              cos  =                                  sin  =

(See Equations (6.2.14) and (6.2.15).) By making the appropriate changes in the symbols (according to
Table 2) yields the steady state charge

                      Qp =             E0 cos(t - ),
                            (1/C - L2)2 + R22

where                      1/C - L2 and                                 R .
                      (1/C - L2)2 + R22                       (1/C - L2)2 + R22
       cos  =                                         sin  =

Therefore the steady state current in the circuit is

                      Ip = Qp = -            E0 sin(t - ).
                                   (1/C - L2)2 + R22

6.4 MOTION UNDER A CENTRAL FORCE

We'll now study the motion of a object moving under the influence of a central force; that is, a force
whose magnitude at any point P other than the origin depends only on the distance from P to the origin,
and whose direction at P is parallel to the line connecting P and the origin, as indicated in Figure 6.4.1
for the case where the direction of the force at every point is toward the origin. Gravitational forces
are central forces; for example, as mentioned in Section 4.3, if we assume that Earth is a perfect sphere
with constant mass density then Newton's law of gravitation asserts that the force exerted on an object
by Earth's gravitational field is proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to the
square of its distance from the center of Earth, which we take to be the origin.

   If the initial position and velocity vectors of an object moving under a central force are parallel, then
the subsequent motion is along the line from the origin to the initial position. Here we'll assume that the
initial position and velocity vectors are not parallel; in this case the subsequent motion is in the plane
determined by them. For convenience we take this to be the xy-plane. We'll consider the problem of
determining the curve traversed by the object. We call this curve the orbit.

   We can represent a central force in terms of polar coordinates

                                               x = r cos , y = r sin 

as
                                           F(r, ) = f(r)(cos  i + sin  j).

We assume that f is continuous for all r > 0. The magnitude of F at (x, y) = (r cos , r sin ) is |f(r)|,
so it depends only on the distance r from the point to the origin the direction of F is from the point to the
origin if f(r) < 0, or from the origin to the point if f(r) > 0. We'll show that the orbit of an object with
mass m moving under this force is given by

                                                       r() = 1 ,
                                                                u()

and h is a constant defined below.
   Newton's second law of motion (F = ma) says that the polar coordinates r = r(t) and  = (t) of the

particle satisfy the vector differential equation

                       m(r cos  i + r sin  j) = f(r)(cos  i + sin  j).   (6.4.2)

To deal with this equation we introduce the unit vectors

                       e1 = cos  i + sin  j and e2 = - sin  i + cos  j.

Note that e1 points in the direction of increasing r and e2 points in the direction of increasing  (Fig-

ure 6.4.2); moreover,  de1 = e2,                  de2 = -e1,
                       d                          d
                                                                         (6.4.3)

and

                       e1  e2 = cos (- sin ) + sin  cos  = 0,

so e1 and e2 are perpendicular. Recalling that the single prime ( ) stands for differentiation with respect
to t, we see from (6.4.3) and the chain rule that

                       e1 =  e2 and e2 = - e1.                           (6.4.4)

   Now we can write (6.4.2) as            m(re1) = f(r)e1.                                                                                    (6.4.5)
But                             (re1) = r e1 + re1 = r e1 + r e2                                                                              (6.4.6)
(from (6.4.4)), and

(re1)  = (r e1 + r e2)

       = r e1 + r e1 + (r + r  )e2 + r e2
       = r e1 + r  e2 + (r + r  )e2 - r( )2e1 (from (6.4.4))
       = r - r( )2 e1 + (r + 2r  )e2.

Substituting this into (6.4.5) yields

       m r - r( )2 e1 + m(r + 2r  )e2 = f(r)e1.

By equating the coefficients of e1 and e2 on the two sides of this equation we see that
                                                m r - r( )2 = f(r)

and                                        r + 2r  = 0.
Multiplying the last equation by r yields

                                       r2 + 2rr  = (r2 ) = 0,

                                                     h = r2(0) (0).

Since the initial position and velocity vectors are

                            r(0)e1(0) and r (0)e1(0) + r(0) (0)e2(0),

our assumption that these two vectors are not parallel implies that  (0) = 0, so h = 0.
   Now let u = 1/r. Then u2 =  /h (from (6.4.7)) and

                                                  u            u  ,
                            r = - 2 = -h
                                                  u            

which implies that                                r = -h du ,                            (6.4.8)
since                                                       d

                            u = du                   d = du .
                             dt                      dt d

Differentiating (6.4.8) with respect to t yields

                            r = -h  d du                          d2u
                                                     = -h 2  ,
                                    dt d                          d

which implies that

                                       2 2 d2u       since         = hu2.
                            r = -h u 2

                                            d

Substituting from these equalities into (6.4.6) and recalling that r = 1/u yields

                                     2 2 d2u 1 2 4
                            -m h u 2 + h u = f(1/u),

                                          d u

and dividing through by -mh2u2 yields (6.4.1).
   Eqn. (6.4.7) has the following geometrical interpretation, which is known as Kepler's Second Law.

Theorem 6.4.1 The position vector of an object moving under a central force sweeps out equal areas in
equal times; more precisely, if (t1)  (t2) then the (signed) area of the sector

                    {(x, y) = (r cos , r sin ) : 0  r  r(), (t1)  (t2)}

(Figure 6.4.3) is given by

                            A = h(t2 - t1) ,
                                        2

where h = r2 , which we have shown to be constant.

Proof Recall from calculus that the area of the shaded sector in Figure 6.4.3 is

                                    A= 1        (t2)

                                               (t1)

where r = r() is the polar representation of the orbit. Making the change of variable  = (t) yields

                                    A = 1 r t2 2((t)) (t) dt.                                                             (6.4.9)
                                          2 t1

But (6.4.7) and (6.4.9) imply that

                                    A = 1 t2 h dt = h(t2 - t1) ,
                                    2 t1                2

which completes the proof.

Motion Under an Inverse Square Law Force

In the special case where f(r) = -mk/r2 = -mku2, so F can be interpreted as a gravitational force,

(6.4.1) becomes                           d2u

                                                    k
                                               +u = 2.                                                                    (6.4.10)
                                          d2        h

The general solution of the complementary equation

                                          d2u + u = 0

                                              Section 6.4 Motion Under a Central Force 301

can be written in amplitude-phase form as

                                           u = A cos( - ),

where A  0 and  is a phase angle. Since up = k/h2 is a particular solution of (6.4.10), the general

solution of (6.4.10) is                                 k
                              u = A cos( - ) + 2 ;

                                                        h

hence, the orbit is given by

                                                          k -1
                              r = A cos( - ) + h2 ,

which we rewrite as           r=  ,
                                   1 + e cos( - )
                                                                   (6.4.11)

where                          = h2 and e = A.
                                    k

A curve satisfying (6.4.11) is a conic section with a focus at the origin (Exercise 1). The nonnegative
constant e is the eccentricity of the orbit, which is an ellipse if e < 1 ellipse (a circle if e = 0), a parabola
if e = 1, or a hyperbola if e > 1.

   If the orbit is an ellipse, then the minimum and maximum values of r are

                     rmin =  (the perihelion distance, attained when  = )
                                   1+e

                    rmax =  (the aphelion distance, attained when  =  + ).
                                   1-e

Figure 6.4.4 shows a typical elliptic orbit. The point P on the orbit where r = rmin is the perigee and
the point A where r = rmax is the apogee.
302 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations

   For example, Earth's orbit around the Sun is approximately an ellipse with e  .017, rmin  91  106
miles, and rmax  95  106 miles. Halley's comet has a very elongated approximately elliptical orbit
around the sun, with e  .967, rmin  55  106 miles, and rmax  33  108 miles. Some comets (the
nonrecurring type) have parabolic or hyperbolic orbits.

                                            6.4 Exercises

1. Find the equation of the curve
                                                   r =  (A)

in terms of (X, Y ) = (r cos( - ), r sin( - )), which are rectangular coordinates with respect
to the axes shown in Figure 6.4.5. Use your results to verify that (A) is the equation of an ellipse
if 0 < e < 1, a parabola if e = 1, or a hyperbola if e > 1. If e < 1, leave your answer in the form

   (X - X0)2 (Y - Y0)2

                                              (1 - e )

Then use Theorem 6.4.1 to show that the time required for the object to traverse the entire orbit is

                                          T=     22

             CHAPTER 7
Series Solutions of Linear Second

               Equations

IN THIS CHAPTER we study a class of second order differential equations that occur in many applica-
tions, but can't be solved in closed form in terms of elementary functions. Here are some examples:

(1) Bessel's equation

                         x2y + xy + (x2 - 2)y = 0,

which occurs in problems displaying cylindrical symmetry, such as diffraction of light through a circular
aperture, propagation of electromagnetic radiation through a coaxial cable, and vibrations of a circular
drum head.

(2) Airy's equation,

                         y - xy = 0,

which occurs in astronomy and quantum physics.

(3) Legendre's equation

                         (1 - x2)y - 2xy + ( + 1)y = 0,

which occurs in problems displaying spherical symmetry, particularly in electromagnetism.
These equations and others considered in this chapter can be written in the form

                         P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0,                                     (A)

where P0, P1, and P2 are polynomials with no common factor. For most equations that occur in appli-
cations, these polynomials are of degree two or less. We'll impose this restriction, although the methods
that we'll develop can be extended to the case where the coefficient functions are polynomials of arbitrary
degree, or even power series that converge in some circle around the origin in the complex plane.

   Since (A) does not in general have closed form solutions, we seek series representations for solutions.
We'll see that if P0(0) = 0 then solutions of (A) can be written as power series

                                                                                       

                                                      y = anxn

                                                                                      n=0

that converge in an open interval centered at x = 0.

306 Chapter 6 Applications of Linear Second Order Equations

SECTION 7.1 reviews the properties of power series.

SECTIONS 7.2 AND 7.3 are devoted to finding power series solutions of (A) in the case where P0(0) = 0.
The situation is more complicated if P0(0) = 0; however, if P1 and P2 satisfy assumptions that apply to
most equations of interest, then we're able to use a modified series method to obtain solutions of (A).

SECTION 7.4 introduces the appropriate assumptions on P1 and P2 in the case where P0(0) = 0, and
deals with Euler's equation

                                                ax2y + bxy + cy = 0,

where a, b, and c are constants. This is the simplest equation that satisfies these assumptions.

SECTIONS 7.5 -7.7 deal with three distinct cases satisfying the assumptions introduced in Section 7.4.
In all three cases, (A) has at least one solution of the form

                                                                                          

                                                   y1 = xr anxn,

                                                                                         n=0

where r need not be an integer. The problem is that there are three possibilities - each requiring a different
approach - for the form of a second solution y2 such that {y1, y2} is a fundamental pair of solutions of (A).

7.1 REVIEW OF POWER SERIES

Many applications give rise to differential equations with solutions that can't be expressed in terms of
elementary functions such as polynomials, rational functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and
trigonometric functions. The solutions of some of the most important of these equations can be expressed
in terms of power series. We'll study such equations in this chapter. In this section we review relevant
properties of power series. We'll omit proofs, which can be found in any standard calculus text.

Definition 7.1.1 An infinite series of the form

                                                                                                    (7.1.1)

                                           an(x - x0)n,

                                      n=0

where x0 and a0, a1, . . . , an, . . . are constants, is called a power series in x - x0. We say that the power
series (7.1.1) converges for a given x if the limit

                                                                                  N

                                                  lim an(x - x0)n

                                                                      N 
                                                                                 n=0

exists; otherwise, we say that the power series diverges for the given x.

   A power series in x - x0 must converge if x = x0, since the positive powers of x - x0 are all zero
in this case. This may be the only value of x for which the power series converges. However, the next

theorem shows that if the power series converges for some x = x0 then the set of all values of x for which
it converges forms an interval.

Theorem 7.1.2 For any power series

                                       

                                           an(x - x0)n,

                                      n=0

exactly one of the these statements is true:
    (i) The power series converges only for x = x0.

(ii) The power series converges for all values of x.

(iii) There's a positive number R such that the power series converges if |x - x0| < R and diverges
      if |x - x0| > R.

In case (iii) we say that R is the radius of convergence of the power series. For convenience, we include

the other two cases in this definition by defining R = 0 in case (i) and R =  in case (ii). We define the
                                 
open interval of convergence of  n=0  an(x  -    x0)n  to  be

(x0 - R, x0 + R) if 0 < R < , or (-, ) if R = .

If R is finite, no general statement can be made concerning convergence at the endpoints x = x0  R of

the open interval of convergence; the series may converge at one or both points, or diverge at both.

Recall from calculus that a series of constants n=0  n is said to converge absolutely if the series
                    n=0  |n| converges. It can be shown that a power series                an(x  -  x0)n
of absolute values                                                                    n=0                 with

a positive radius of convergence R converges absolutely in its open interval of convergence; that is, the

series 

                                                 |an||x - x0|n

                                      n=0
308 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Equations

of absolute values converges if |x - x0| < R. However, if R < , the series may fail to converge
absolutely at an endpoint x0  R, even if it converges there.

   The next theorem provides a useful method for determining the radius of convergence of a power

series. It's derived in calculus by applying the ratio test to the corresponding series of absolute values.

For related theorems see Exercises 2 and 4.

Theorem 7.1.3 Suppose there's an integer N such that an = 0 if n  N and

                                      lim an+1 = L,
                                     n an

where 0  L  . Then the radius of convergence of              an(x  -  x0)n  is  R  =  1/L,  which  should  be
                                                   n=0
interpreted to mean that R = 0 if L = , or R =  if L = 0.

Example 7.1.1 Find the radius of convergence of the series:

                                      (-1)n  xn (c)           
                                     n=10 n!
               (a)       n!xn (b)                                 2nn2(x - 1)n.

                    n=0                                      n=0

SOLUTION(a) Here an = n!, so

                    lim an+1 = lim (n + 1)! = lim (n + 1) = .
                    n an             n n!          n

Hence, R = 0.

SOLUTION(b) Here an = (1)n/n! for n  N = 10, so

                    lim an+1 = lim n! = lim 1 = 0.
                    n an             n (n + 1)! n n + 1

Hence, R = .

SOLUTION(c) Here an = 2nn2, so

                lim an+1             2n+1(n + 1)2                     1+ 1      2
               n an           = lim  n 2 = 2 lim                           n
                                n 2 n                        n                    = 2.

Hence, R = 1/2.

Taylor Series

If a function f has derivatives of all orders at a point x = x0, then the Taylor series of f about x0 is
defined by

                                                  f (n)(x0) (x - x0)n.
                                                n=0 n!
In the special case where x0 = 0, this series is also called the Maclaurin series of f.
                                                         Section 7.1 Review of Power Series 309

   Taylor series for most of the common elementary functions converge to the functions on their open
intervals of convergence. For example, you are probably familiar with the following Maclaurin series:

    ex =  xn , - < x < ,                                                          (7.1.2)
               n=0 n!                                                             (7.1.3)
                                                                                  (7.1.4)
 sin x =  (-1)n x2n+1 , - < x < ,                                                 (7.1.5)
               n=0 (2n + 1)!

 cos x =  (-1)n x2n , - < x < ,
               n=0 (2n)!

  1 = xn  , -1 < x < 1.
1 - x n=0

Differentiation of Power Series

A power series with a positive radius of convergence defines a function

                                                                                    

                                                f(x) = an(x - x0)n

                                                                                  n=0

on its open interval of convergence. We say that the series represents f on the open interval of conver-
gence. A function f represented by a power series may be a familiar elementary function as in (7.1.2)-
(7.1.5); however, it often happens that f isn't a familiar function, so the series actually defines f.

   The next theorem shows that a function represented by a power series has derivatives of all orders on
the open interval of convergence of the power series, and provides power series representations of the
derivatives.

Theorem 7.1.4 A power series

                                               

                                f(x) = an(x - x0)n

                                              n=0

with positive radius of convergence R has derivatives of all orders in its open interval of convergence,
and successive derivatives can be obtained by repeatedly differentiating term by term; that is,

                              

f (x) =                                 nan(x - x0)n-1,                           (7.1.6)

                              n=1

f (x) =                                                                           (7.1.7)
                                                                                  (7.1.8)
                                 n(n - 1)an(x - x0)n-2,

                              n=2

                              ..
                              .

                                      

f(k)(x) =                               n(n - 1)    (n - k + 1)an(x - x0)n-k.

                              n=k

Moreover, all of these series have the same radius of convergence R.
310 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Equations

Example 7.1.2 Let f(x) = sin x. From (7.1.3),

                                         f(x) = (-1)n x2n+1 .
                                                 n=0 (2n + 1)!

From (7.1.6),

                        f (x) = (-1)n  d                 x2n+1       = (-1)n  x2n ,
                                  n=0 dx               (2n + 1)!        n=0 (2n)!

which is the series (7.1.4) for cos x.

Uniqueness of Power Series

The next theorem shows that if f is defined by a power series in x - x0 with a positive radius of conver-
gence, then the power series is the Taylor series of f about x0.

Theorem 7.1.5 If the power series

                                                                                    

                                                f(x) = an(x - x0)n

                                                                                  n=0

has a positive radius of convergence, then

                                               a f (n)(x n = 0) ;                      (7.1.9)
                                                          n!

that is,       an(x  -  x0)n  is  the  Taylor  series  of  f  about  x0.
          n=0

This result can be obtained by setting x = x0 in (7.1.8), which yields

                                  f(k)(x0) = k(k - 1)    1  ak = k!ak.

This implies that

                                               a f (k)(x k = 0) .
                                                          k!

Except for notation, this is the same as (7.1.9).

The next theorem lists two important properties of power series that follow from Theorem 7.1.5.

Theorem 7.1.6

(a) If

                                                              

                                             an(x - x0)n = bn(x - x0)n

                                        n=0                   n=0

for all x in an open interval that contains x0, then an = bn for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

(b) If

                                                

                                                    an(x - x0)n = 0

                                               n=0

for all x in an open interval that contains x0, then an = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
                                                                             Section 7.1 Review of Power Series 311

   To obtain (a) we observe that the two series represent the same function f on the open interval; hence,
Theorem 7.1.5 implies that

                    a f (n)(x n = bn = 0) ,                                  n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
                                      n!

(b) can be obtained from (a) by taking bn = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Taylor Polynomials

If f has N derivatives at a point x0, we say that

                    N T f(n)(x N (x) = 0) (x - x0)n
                                n=0 n!

is the N -th Taylor polynomial of f about x0. This definition and Theorem 7.1.5 imply that if

                                   

                    f(x) = an(x - x0)n,

                                  n=0

where the power series has a positive radius of convergence, then the Taylor polynomials of f about x0
are given by

                                                                                     N

                                              TN (x) = an(x - x0)n.

                                                                                   n=0

In numerical applications, we use the Taylor polynomials to approximate f on subintervals of the open
interval of convergence of the power series. For example, (7.1.2) implies that the Taylor polynomial TN
of f(x) = ex is

                                                                 N xn
                                                    TN (x) = n! .

                                                                                            n=0

The solid curve in Figure 7.1.1 is the graph of y = ex on the interval [0, 5]. The dotted curves in
Figure 7.1.1 are the graphs of the Taylor polynomials T1, . . . , T6 of y = ex about x0 = 0. From this
figure, we conclude that the accuracy of the approximation of y = ex by its Taylor polynomial TN
improves as N increases.

Shifting the Summation Index
In Definition 7.1.1 of a power series in x - x0, the n-th term is a constant multiple of (x - x0)n. This
isn't true in (7.1.6), (7.1.7), and (7.1.8), where the general terms are constant multiples of (x - x0)n-1,
(x - x0)n-2, and (x - x0)n-k, respectively. However, these series can all be rewritten so that their n-th
terms are constant multiples of (x - x0)n. For example, letting n = k + 1 in the series in (7.1.6) yields

                                                                                                  (7.1.10)

                    f (x) = (k + 1)ak+1(x - x0)k,

                                   k=0

where we start the new summation index k from zero so that the first term in (7.1.10) (obtained by setting

k = 0) is the same as the first term in (7.1.6) (obtained by setting n = 1). However, the sum of a series is

independent of the symbol used to denote the summation index, just as the value of a definite integral is

independent of the symbol used to denote the variable of integration. Therefore we can replace k by n in

(7.1.10) to obtain

where the general term is a constant multiple of (x - x0)n.
   It isn't really necessary to introduce the intermediate summation index k. We can obtain (7.1.11)

directly from (7.1.6) by replacing n by n + 1 in the general term of (7.1.6) and subtracting 1 from the
lower limit of (7.1.6). More generally, we use the following procedure for shifting indices.

                     Shifting the Summation Index in a Power Series

For any integer k, the power series    

                                           bn(x - x0)n-k

                                     n=n0

can be rewritten as                      

                                              bn+k(x - x0)n;

                                     n=n0-k

that is, replacing n by n + k in the general term and subtracting k from the lower limit of summation
leaves the series unchanged.

                                                            Section 7.1 Review of Power Series 313

each is a constant multiple of (x - x0)n:

                       n=2

SOLUTION(a) Replacing n by n + 2 in the general term and subtracting 2 from the lower limit of
summation yields

                                                

                n(n - 1)an(x - x0)n-2 = (n + 2)(n + 1)an+2(x - x0)n.

           n=2                                  n=0

SOLUTION(b) Replacing n by n + k in the general term and subtracting k from the lower limit of
summation yields

                                                

       n(n - 1)    (n - k + 1)an(x - x0)n-k = (n + k)(n + k - 1)    (n + 1)an+k(x - x0)n.

n=k                                             n=0

Example 7.1.4 Given that

                                                          

                                           f(x) = anxn,

                                                n=0

write the function xf as a power series in which the general term is a constant multiple of xn.

Solution From Theorem 7.1.4 with x0 = 0,

                                              

                             f (x) = n(n - 1)anxn-2.

                                             n=2

Therefore                                      

                           xf (x) = n(n - 1)anxn-1.

                                           n=2

Replacing n by n + 1 in the general term and subtracting 1 from the lower limit of summation yields

                                               

                           xf (x) = (n + 1)nan+1xn.

                                             n=1

We can also write this as                      

                           xf (x) = (n + 1)nan+1xn,

                                           n=0

since the first term in this last series is zero. (We'll see later that sometimes it's useful to include zero
terms at the beginning of a series.)

Linear Combinations of Power Series

If a power series is multiplied by a constant, then the constant can be placed inside the summation; that

is,                                                  

                           c an(x - x0)n = can(x - x0)n.

                           n=0                    n=0
314 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Equations

Two power series

                                                                        

                  f(x) = an(x - x0)n and g(x) = bn(x - x0)n

                         n=0                                            n=0

with positive radii of convergence can be added term by term at points common to their open intervals of
convergence; thus, if the first series converges for |x - x0| < R1 and the second converges for |x - x0| <
R2, then

                                                                                    

                                       f(x) + g(x) = (an + bn)(x - x0)n

                                                                                   n=0

for |x - x0| < R, where R is the smaller of R1 and R2. More generally, linear combinations of power
series can be formed term by term; for example,

                                                              

                         c1f(x) + c2f(x) = (c1an + c2bn)(x - x0)n.

                                                            n=0

Example 7.1.5 Find the Maclaurin series for cosh x as a linear combination of the Maclaurin series for
ex and e-x.

Solution By definition,                 cosh x = 1 ex + 1 e-x.
Since                                               22

                         ex  = xn and e-x = (-1)n  xn ,
                              n=0 n!               n=0 n!

it follows that                cosh x = 1 [1 + (-1)n] xn .
                                          n=0 2 n!
                                                                             (7.1.12)

Since             1 [1 + (-1)n] =       1 if n = 2m, an even integer,
                  2                     0 if n = 2m + 1, an odd integer,

we can rewrite (7.1.12) more simply as

                                                      x2m
                                        cosh x = (2m)! .

                                                         m=0

This result is valid on (-, ), since this is the open interval of convergence of the Maclaurin series for
ex and e-x.

Example 7.1.6 Suppose

                                        n=0

on an open interval I that contains the origin.
(a) Express

                                                         (2 - x)y + 2y

as a power series in x on I.

(b) Use the result of (a) to find necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients {an} for y to be
      a solution of the homogeneous equation

                                         (2 - x)y + 2y = 0                                         (7.1.13)

on I.

SOLUTION(a) From (7.1.7) with x0 = 0,

                                             

                                  y = n(n - 1)anxn-2.

                                            n=2

Therefore

(2 - x)y + 2y = 2y - xy + 2y

                                                                                                   (7.1.14)

                   =              2n(n - 1)anxn-2 - n(n - 1)anxn-1 + 2anxn.

                            n=2                      n=2                 n=0

To combine the three series we shift indices in the first two to make their general terms constant multiples

of xn; thus,                                       

                            2n(n - 1)anxn-2 = 2(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2xn                                (7.1.15)

                       n=2                         n=0

and                                                               

                   n(n - 1)anxn-1 = (n + 1)nan+1xn = (n + 1)nan+1xn,                               (7.1.16)

              n=2                 n=1                             n=0

where we added a zero term in the last series so that when we substitute from (7.1.15) and (7.1.16) into
(7.1.14) all three series will start with n = 0; thus,

                                                                                                   (7.1.17)

           (2 - x)y + 2y = [2(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 - (n + 1)nan+1 + 2an]xn.

                                            n=0

SOLUTION(b) From (7.1.17) we see that y satisfies (7.1.13) on I if

              2(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 - (n + 1)nan+1 + 2an = 0, n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..                    (7.1.18)

Conversely, Theorem 7.1.6 (b) implies that if y =       anxn  satisfies  (7.1.13)  on  I  ,  then  (7.1.18)  holds.
                                                   n=0

Example 7.1.7 Suppose

                                                

                                       y = an(x - 1)n

                                               n=0

on an open interval I that contains x0 = 1. Express the function

                                  (1 + x)y + 2(x - 1)2y + 3y                                       (7.1.19)

as a power series in x - 1 on I.
316 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Equations

Solution Since we want a power series in x - 1, we rewrite the coefficient of y in (7.1.19) as 1 + x =
2 + (x - 1), so (7.1.19) becomes

                                        2y + (x - 1)y + 2(x - 1)2y + 3y.

From (7.1.6) and (7.1.7) with x0 = 1,

                                                    

           y = nan(x - 1)n-1 and y = n(n - 1)an(x - 1)n-2.

           n=1                                      n=2

Therefore

                                            

                2y =                           2n(n - 1)an(x - 1)n-2,

                                         n=2

                                            

                (x - 1)y =                     n(n - 1)an(x - 1)n-1,

                                         n=2

                                            

                2(x - 1)2y =                   2nan(x - 1)n+1,

                                         n=1

                                            

                3y =                           3an(x - 1)n.

                                         n=0

Before adding these four series we shift indices in the first three so that their general terms become
constant multiples of (x - 1)n. This yields

                                       

                2y =                        2(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2(x - 1)n,        (7.1.20)

             (x - 1)y =                  (n + 1)nan+1(x - 1)n,

where we added initial zero terms to the series in (7.1.21) and (7.1.22). Adding (7.1.20)-(7.1.23) yields

           (1 + x)y + 2(x - 1)2y + 3y = 2y + (x - 1)y + 2(x - 1)2y + 3y

                                               n=0

where

           b0 = 4a2 + 3a0,                                                      (7.1.24)
           bn = 2(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + (n + 1)nan+1 + 2(n - 1)an-1 + 3an, n  1.  (7.1.25)

The formula (7.1.24) for b0 can't be obtained by setting n = 0 in (7.1.25), since the summation in (7.1.22)
begins with n = 1, while those in (7.1.20), (7.1.21), and (7.1.23) begin with n = 0.

7.2 SERIES SOLUTIONS NEAR AN ORDINARY POINT I

Many physical applications give rise to second order homogeneous linear differential equations of the

form

           P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0,                                                              (7.2.1)

where P0, P1, and P2 are polynomials. Usually the solutions of these equations can't be expressed in
terms of familiar elementary functions. Therefore we'll consider the problem of representing solutions of
(7.2.1) with series.

   We assume throughout that P0, P1 and P2 have no common factors. Then we say that x0 is an ordinary
point of (7.2.1) if P0(x0) = 0, or a singular point if P0(x0) = 0. For Legendre's equation,

           (1 - x2)y - 2xy + ( + 1)y = 0,                                                             (7.2.2)

x0 = 1 and x0 = -1 are singular points and all other points are ordinary points. For Bessel's equation,
                                            x2y + xy + (x2 - 2)y = 0,

x0 = 0 is a singular point and all other points are ordinary points. If P0 is a nonzero constant as in Airy's

equation,

           y - xy = 0,                                                                                (7.2.3)

then every point is an ordinary point.

   Since polynomials are continuous everywhere, P1/P0 and P2/P0 are continuous at any point x0 that
isn't a zero of P0. Therefore, if x0 is an ordinary point of (7.2.1) and a0 and a1 are arbitrary real numbers,
then the initial value problem

           P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0, y(x0) = a0, y (x0) = a1                                      (7.2.4)

has a unique solution on the largest open interval that contains x0 and does not contain any zeros of P0.
To see this, we rewrite the differential equation in (7.2.4) as

           y + P1(x) y + P2(x) y = 0
                  P0(x) P0(x)

and apply Theorem 5.1.1 with p = P1/P0 and q = P2/P0. In this section and the next we consider the
problem of representing solutions of (7.2.1) by power series that converge for values of x near an ordinary
point x0.

   We state the next theorem without proof.

P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0                                                                (7.2.5)

can be represented by a power series

                                                                                            (7.2.6)

                                      y = an(x - x0)n

                                              n=0

that converges at least on the open interval (x0 -, x0 +). ( If P0 is nonconstant, so that  is necessarily
finite, then the open interval of convergence of (7.2.6) may be larger than (x0-, x0 +). If P0 is constant
then  =  and (x0 - , x0 + ) = (-, ).)

   We call (7.2.6) a power series solution in x - x0 of (7.2.5). We'll now develop a method for finding
power series solutions of (7.2.5). For this purpose we write (7.2.5) as Ly = 0, where

                                      Ly = P0y + P1y + P2y.                                 (7.2.7)

   Theorem 7.2.1 implies that every solution of Ly = 0 on (x0 - , x0 + ) can be written as

                                                                                

                                                 y = an(x - x0)n.

                                                                               n=0

Setting x = x0 in this series and in the series

                                                                              

                                               y = nan(x - x0)n-1

                                                                            n=1

shows that y(x0) = a0 and y (x0) = a1. Since every initial value problem (7.2.4) has a unique solution,
this means that a0 and a1 can be chosen arbitrarily, and a2, a3, . . . are uniquely determined by them.

   To find a2, a3, . . . , we write P0, P1, and P2 in powers of x - x0, substitute

                                               

                                      y = an(x - x0)n,

                                              n=0

                                                                             

                                              y = nan(x - x0)n-1,

                                                                            n=1

                                                                        

                                          y = n(n - 1)an(x - x0)n-2

                                                                      n=2

into (7.2.7), and collect the coefficients of like powers of x - x0. This yields

                                                                                            (7.2.8)

                                      Ly = bn(x - x0)n,

                                                 n=0

where {b0, b1, . . . , bn, . . . } are expressed in terms of {a0, a1, . . . , an, . . . } and the coefficients of P0, P1,
and P2, written in powers of x - x0. Since (7.2.8) and (a) of Theorem 7.1.6 imply that Ly = 0 if and
only if bn = 0 for n  0, all power series solutions in x - x0 of Ly = 0 can be obtained by choosing
a0 and a1 arbitrarily and computing a2, a3, . . . , successively so that bn = 0 for n  0. For simplicity,
we call the power series obtained this way the power series in x - x0 for the general solution of Ly = 0,
without explicitly identifying the open interval of convergence of the series.

Example 7.2.1 Let x0 be an arbitrary real number. Find the power series in x-x0 for the general solution

of

                                         y + y = 0.                                              (7.2.9)

Solution Here

                                         Ly = y + y.

If 
                                                 y = an(x - x0)n,

                                                                               n=0

then 
                                         y = n(n - 1)an(x - x0)n-2,

                                                                     n=2

so  
                             Ly = n(n - 1)an(x - x0)n-2 + an(x - x0)n.

                       n=2                                n=0

To collect coefficients of like powers of x - x0, we shift the summation index in the first sum. This yields

                                                                                    

     Ly = (n + 2)(n + 1)an+2(x - x0)n + an(x - x0)n = bn(x - x0)n,

                  n=0                    n=0                                        n=0

with                             bn = (n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + an.
Therefore Ly = 0 if and only if

                                 an+2 =  -an ,            n  0,                                  (7.2.10)
                                         (n + 2)(n + 1)

where a0 and a1 are arbitrary. Since the indices on the left and right sides of (7.2.10) differ by two, we
write (7.2.10) separately for n even (n = 2m) and n odd (n = 2m + 1). This yields

                       a2m+2 =           -a2m              , m  0,                               (7.2.11)

                                         (2m + 2)(2m + 1)

and

                       a2m+3 =           -a2m+1            , m  0.                               (7.2.12)
                                                                                                 (7.2.13)
                                         (2m + 3)(2m + 2)

Computing the coefficients of the even powers of x - x0 from (7.2.11) yields

                    a2 = - a0
                                  21

                    a4 = - a2 = - 1 - a0 = a0 ,

and, in general,                 a2m = (-1)m a0 ,
                                                   (2m)!

Computing the coefficients of the odd powers of x - x0 from (7.2.12) yields

                  a3 = - a1
                                32

                  a5 = - a3 = - 1 - a1 = a1 ,

and, in general,                     a (-1)ma 2m+1 = 1
                                                 (2m + 1)!

Thus, the general solution of (7.2.9) can be written as

                                                         

                         y = a2m(x - x0)2m + a2m+1(x - x0)2m+1,

                         m=0                 m=0

or, from (7.2.13) and (7.2.14), as

                   y = a0 (-1)m (x - x0)2m  + a1 (-1)m (x - x0)2m+1 .        (7.2.15)
                           m=0 (2m)! m=0 (2m + 1)!

If we recall from calculus that

         (-1)m (x - x0)2m = cos(x - x0) and                (-1)m (x - x0)2m+1 = sin(x - x0),
       m=0 (2m)!                                         m=0 (2m + 1)!

then (7.2.15) becomes

                                    y = a0 cos(x - x0) + a1 sin(x - x0),

which should look familiar.
   Equations like (7.2.10), (7.2.11), and (7.2.12), which define a given coefficient in the sequence {an}

in terms of one or more coefficients with lesser indices are called recurrence relations. When we use a

recurrence relation to compute terms of a sequence we're computing recursively.
   In the remainder of this section we consider the problem of finding power series solutions in x - x0

for equations of the form

                         1 + (x - x0)2 y + (x - x0)y + y = 0.                (7.2.16)

Many important equations that arise in applications are of this form with x0 = 0, including Legendre's
equation (7.2.2), Airy's equation (7.2.3), Chebyshev's equation,

                                     (1 - x2)y - xy + 2y = 0,

and Hermite's equation,

                                     y - 2xy + 2y = 0.

Since

                                     P0(x) = 1 + (x - x0)2

in (7.2.16), the point x0 is an ordinary point of (7.2.16), and Theorem 7.2.1 implies that the solutions of
(7.2.16) can be written as power series in x-x0 that converge on the interval (x0 -1/ ||, x0+1/ ||)

if  = 0, or on (-, ) if  = 0. We'll see that the coefficients in these power series can be obtained
by methods similar to the one used in Example 7.2.1.

   To simplify finding the coefficients, we introduce some notation for products:

                                    s

                                      bj = brbr+1    bs if s  r.

                                  j =r

Thus,                                          7

and                                           bj = b2b3b4b5b6b7,

To collect coefficients of xn, we shift the summation index in the first sum. This yields

                               bn = (n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + 2(n + 1)2an, n  0.

To obtain solutions of (7.2.17), we set bn = 0 for n  0. This is equivalent to the recurrence relation

                        an+2 = -2 n + 1 an,  n  0.                                         (7.2.18)
                                      n+2

Since the indices on the left and right differ by two, we write (7.2.18) separately for n = 2m and
n = 2m + 1, as in Example 7.2.1. This yields

             a2m+2 = -2 2m + 1 a2m = - 2m + 1 a2m, m  0,                                   (7.2.19)

and

             a2m+3 = -2 2m + 2 a2m+1 = -4 m + 1 a2m+1,                      m  0.          (7.2.20)
                        2m + 3               2m + 3

Computing the coefficients of even powers of x from (7.2.19) yields

             a2 = - 1 a0,

             a8 = - 7 a6 = - 7 - 1  3  5 a0 = 1  3  5  7 a0.

(Note that (7.2.21) is correct for m = 0 because we defined j=1 0 bj = 1 for any bj.)
   Computing the coefficients of odd powers of x from (7.2.20) yields

             a3 = -4 1 a1,

is the power series in x for the general solution of (7.2.17). Since P0(x) = 1+2x2 has no real zeros, Theo-
rem 5.1.1 implies that every solution of (7.2.17) is defined on (-, ). However, since P0(켲/ 2) = 0,
Theorem 7.2.1 implies only that the power series converges in (-1/ 2, 1/ 2) for any choice of a0 and
a1.

   The results in Examples 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 are consequences of the following general theorem.

Theorem 7.2.2 The coefficients {an} in any solution y = n=0  an(x - x0)n of                    (7.2.23)
                                    1 + (x - x0)2 y + (x - x0)y + y = 0

satisfy the recurrence relation

                                 an+2 = - p(n) an,            n  0,                            (7.2.24)
                                              (n + 2)(n + 1)

where

                                 p(n) = n(n - 1) + n + .                                       (7.2.25)

Moreover, the coefficients of the even and odd powers of x - x0 can be computed separately as

                    a2m+2 = -               p(2m)  a2m, m  0                                   (7.2.26)

                                 (2m + 2)(2m + 1)

and

                    a2m+3 = - p(2m + 1) a2m+1, m  0,                                           (7.2.27)
                                       (2m + 3)(2m + 2)

where a0 and a1 are arbitrary.

Proof Here                   Ly = (1 + (x - x0)2)y + (x - x0)y + y.
If
then                                      
Hence,
                                 y = an(x - x0)n,

                                         n=0

                                                   

            y = nan(x - x0)n-1 and y = n(n - 1)an(x - x0)n-2.

               n=1                                 n=2

                                            

       Ly =         n(n - 1)an(x - x0)n-2 + [n(n - 1) + n + ] an(x - x0)n

               n=2                          n=0

from (7.2.25). To collect coefficients of powers of x - x0, we shift the summation index in the first sum.
This yields

                                                       

                              Ly = [(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + p(n)an] (x - x0)n.

                                                      n=0

Thus, Ly = 0 if and only if

                   (n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + p(n)an = 0, n  0,

which is equivalent to (7.2.24). Writing (7.2.24) separately for the cases where n = 2m and n = 2m + 1
yields (7.2.26) and (7.2.27).

Example 7.2.3 Find the power series in x - 1 for the general solution of               (7.2.28)
                                   (2 + 4x - 2x2)y - 12(x - 1)y - 12y = 0.

Solution We must first write the coefficient P0(x) = 2 + 4x - x2 in powers of x - 1. To do this, we
write x = (x - 1) + 1 in P0(x) and then expand the terms, collecting powers of x - 1; thus,

                           2 + 4x - 2x2 = 2 + 4[(x - 1) + 1] - 2[(x - 1) + 1]2
                                               = 4 - 2(x - 1)2.

Therefore we can rewrite (7.2.28) as
                                    4 - 2(x - 1)2 y - 12(x - 1)y - 12y = 0,

or, equivalently,

                                 1 - 1 (x - 1)2 y - 3(x - 1)y - 3y = 0.
                                      2

This is of the form (7.2.23) with  = -1/2,  = -3, and  = -3. Therefore, from (7.2.25)

                   p(n) = - n(n - 1) - 3n - 3 = - (n + 2)(n + 3) .
                                    2          2

Hence, Theorem 7.2.2 implies that

     a2m+2 = - p(2m) a2m
                        (2m + 2)(2m + 1)

                   = (2m + 2)(2m + 3) a2m = 2m + 3 a2m, m  0
                   2(2m + 2)(2m + 1)      2(2m + 1)

and

     a2m+3 = - p(2m + 1) a2m+1
                        (2m + 3)(2m + 2)

                   = (2m + 3)(2m + 4) a2m+1 = m + 2 a2m+1, m  0.
                   2(2m + 3)(2m + 2)      2(m + 1)

We leave it to you to show that

                   2m + 1                 m+1
                   a2m = m a0 and a2m+1 = m a1, m  0,
                                 2        2
328 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations

which implies that the power series in x - 1 for the general solution of (7.2.28) is

                    2m + 1                        2m  m + 1                     2m+1
           y = a0         m (x - 1) + a1                         m (x - 1) .
                   m=0 2                                  m=0 2

   In the examples considered so far we were able to obtain closed formulas for coefficients in the power
series solutions. In some cases this is impossible, and we must settle for computing a finite number of
terms in the series. The next example illustrates this with an initial value problem.

Example 7.2.4 Compute a0, a1, . . . , a7 in the series solution y =       anxn  of    the  initial  value  prob-
                                                                     n=0
lem
                          (1 + 2x2)y + 10xy + 8y = 0, y(0) = 2,      y (0) = -3.                    (7.2.29)

Solution Since  = 2,  = 10, and  = 8 in (7.2.29),
                                    p(n) = 2n(n - 1) + 10n + 8 = 2(n + 2)2.

Therefore  an+2 = -2 (n + 2)2 an = -2 n + 2 an,

                                       (n + 2)(n + 1)        n+1          n  0.

Writing this equation separately for n = 2m and n = 2m + 1 yields

           a2m+2 = -2 (2m + 2) a2m = -4 m + 1 a2m, m  0                                             (7.2.30)
                                       2m + 1             2m + 1                                    (7.2.31)

and

           a2m+3 = -2 2m + 3 a2m+1 = - 2m + 3 a2m+1, m  0.
                                       2m + 2             m+1

Starting with a0 = y(0) = 2, we compute a2, a4, and a6 from (7.2.30):

                                       a2 = -4 1 2 = -8,
                                                       1

                                       a4 = -4 2 (-8) = 64 ,
                                                  3          3

                                       a6 = -4 3 64 = - 256 .
                                                  53             5

Starting with a1 = y (0) = -3, we compute a3, a5 and a7 from (7.2.31):

                                       a3 = - 3 (-3) = 9,
                                                     1

                                       a5 = - 5 9 = - 45 ,
                                                  2       2

                                       a7 = - 7 - 45 = 105 .
                                                  32            2

Therefore the solution of (7.2.29) is

           y = 2 - 3x - 8x2 + 9x3 + 64 x4 - 45 x5 - 256 x6 + 105 x7 +    .

 USING TECHNOLOGY

   Computing coefficients recursively as in Example 7.2.4 is tedious. We recommend that you do this
kind of computation by writing a short program to implement the appropriate recurrence relation on a
calculator or computer. You may wish to do this in verifying examples and doing exercises (identified by
the symbol C ) in this chapter that call for numerical computation of the coefficients in series solutions.
We obtained the answers to these exercises by using software that can produce answers in the form of
rational numbers. However, it's perfectly acceptable - and more practical - to get your answers in decimal
form. You can always check them by converting our fractions to decimals.

   If you're interested in actually using series to compute numerical approximations to solutions of a
differential equation, then whether or not there's a simple closed form for the coefficents is essentially
irrelevant. For computational purposes it's usually more efficient to start with the given coefficients
a0 = y(x0) and a1 = y (x0), compute a2, . . . , aN recursively, and then compute approximate values of
the solution from the Taylor polynomial

                                                                                     N

                                              TN (x) = an(x - x0)n.

                                                                                   n=0

The trick is to decide how to choose N so the approximation y(x)  TN (x) is sufficiently accurate on
the subinterval of the interval of convergence that you're interested in. In the computational exercises
in this and the next two sections, you will often be asked to obtain the solution of a given problem by
numerical integration with software of your choice (see Section 10.1 for a brief discussion of one such
method), and to compare the solution obtained in this way with the approximations obtained with TN for
various values of N . This is a typical textbook kind of exercise, designed to give you insight into how
the accuracy of the approximation y(x)  TN (x) behaves as a function of N and the interval that you're
working on. In real life, you would choose one or the other of the two methods (numerical integration or
series solution). If you choose the method of series solution, then a practical procedure for determining
a suitable value of N is to continue increasing N until the maximum of |TN - TN-1| on the interval of
interest is within the margin of error that you're willing to accept.

   In doing computational problems that call for numerical solution of differential equations you should
choose the most accurate numerical integration procedure your software supports, and experiment with
the step size until you're confident that the numerical results are sufficiently accurate for the problem at
hand.

7.3 SERIES SOLUTIONS NEAR AN ORDINARY POINT II

In this section we continue to find series solutions

                                                                                 

                                                  y = an(x - x0)n

                                                                               n=0

of initial value problems

      P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0, y(x0) = a0, y (x0) = a1,                                                     (7.3.1)

where P0, P1, and P2 are polynomials and P0(x0) = 0, so x0 is an ordinary point of (7.3.1). However,
here we consider cases where the differential equation in (7.3.1) is not of the form

                1 + (x - x0)2 y + (x - x0)y + y = 0,

so Theorem 7.2.2 does not apply, and the computation of the coefficients {an} is more complicated. For
the equations considered here it's difficult or impossible to obtain an explicit formula for an in terms of
n. Nevertheless, we can calculate as many coefficients as we wish. The next three examples illustrate

this.

Example 7.3.1 Find the coefficients a0, . . . , a7 in the series solution y =                     anxn  of  the  initial  value
                                                                                             n=0
problem
                   (1 + x + 2x2)y + (1 + 7x)y + 2y = 0, y(0) = -1,                         y (0) = -2.           (7.3.2)

Solution Here
                                    Ly = (1 + x + 2x2)y + (1 + 7x)y + 2y.

The zeros (-1  i7)/4 of P0(x) = 1 + x + 2x2 have absolute value 1/2, so Theorem 7.2.2 implies
that the series solution converges to the solution of (7.3.2) on (-1/ 2, 1/ 2). Since

                                                                                      

y = anxn, y = nanxn-1 and y = n(n - 1)anxn-2,

      n=0       n=1                                                                   n=2

                                                                                           

Ly =         n(n - 1)anxn-2 + n(n - 1)anxn-1 + 2 n(n - 1)anxn

        n=2            n=2                                                                 n=2

                                                

        + nanxn-1 + 7 nanxn + 2 anxn.

           n=1       n=1         n=0

Shifting indices so the general term in each series is a constant multiple of xn yields

where          bn = (n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + (n + 1)2an+1 + (n + 2)(2n + 1)an.
Therefore y =

               n=0

From the initial conditions in (7.3.2), a0 = y(0) = -1 and a1 = y (0) = -2. Setting n = 0 in (7.3.3)

yields                           a2 = - 1 a1 - a0 = - 1 (-2) - (-1) = 2.

Setting n = 1 in (7.3.3) yields

                          a3 = - 2 a2 - 3 a1 = - 2 (2) - 3 (-2) = 5 .

We leave it to you to compute a4, a5, a6, a7 from (7.3.3) and show that

               y = -1 - 2x + 2x2 + 5 x3 - 55 x4 + 3 x5 + 61 x6 - 443 x7 +    .

We also leave it to you (Exercise 13) to verify numerically that the Taylor polynomials TN (x) =  n=0 N anxn
converge to the solution of (7.3.2) on (-1/ 2, 1/ 2).

                                                  y = an(x + 1)n

                                                                                n=0

of the initial value problem

Solution Since the desired series is in powers of x + 1 we rewrite the differential equation in (7.3.4) as
Ly = 0, with

                        Ly = (2 + (x + 1)) y - (1 - 2(x + 1)) y - (3 - (x + 1)) y.

compute a2, . . . , a5 with (7.3.8) and (7.3.9) and show that the solution of (7.3.7) is

7.4 REGULAR SINGULAR POINTS EULER EQUATIONS

This section sets the stage for Sections 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7. If you're not interested in those sections, but wish
to learn about Euler equations, omit the introductory paragraphs and start reading at Definition 7.4.2.

In the next three sections we'll continue to study equations of the form

                                  P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0                 (7.4.1)

where P0, P1, and P2 are polynomials, but the emphasis will be different from that of Sections 7.2 and
7.3, where we obtained solutions of (7.4.1) near an ordinary point x0 in the form of power series in
x - x0. If x0 is a singular point of (7.4.1) (that is, if P (x0) = 0), the solutions can't in general be
represented by power series in x - x0. Nevertheless, it's often necessary in physical applications to study
the behavior of solutions of (7.4.1) near a singular point. Although this can be difficult in the absence of

some sort of assumption on the nature of the singular point, equations that satisfy the requirements of the
next definition can be solved by series methods discussed in the next three sections. Fortunately, many

equations arising in applications satisfy these requirements.

Definition 7.4.1 Let P0, P1, and P2 be polynomials with no common factor and suppose P0(x0) = 0.
Then x0 is a regular singular point of the equation

                                  P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = 0                 (7.4.2)

if (7.4.2) can be written as                                                   (7.4.3)
                                (x - x0)2A(x)y + (x - x0)B(x)y + C(x)y = 0

where A, B, and C are polynomials and A(x0) = 0; otherwise, x0 is an irregular singular point of
(7.4.2).

Example 7.4.1 Bessel's equation,

                                  x2y + xy + (x2 - 2)y = 0,                    (7.4.4)

has the singular point x0 = 0. Since this equation is of the form (7.4.3) with x0 = 0, A(x) = 1,
B(x) = 1, and C(x) = x2 - 2, it follows that x0 = 0 is a regular singular point of (7.4.4).

Example 7.4.2 Legendre's equation,

(1 - x2)y - 2xy + ( + 1)y = 0,                                                 (7.4.5)

has the singular points x0 = 1. Mutiplying through by 1 - x yields
                          (x - 1)2(x + 1)y + 2x(x - 1)y - ( + 1)(x - 1)y = 0,

which is of the form (7.4.3) with x0 = 1, A(x) = x + 1, B(x) = 2x, and C(x) = -( + 1)(x - 1).
Therefore x0 = 1 is a regular singular point of (7.4.5). We leave it to you to show that x0 = -1 is also a
regular singular point of (7.4.5).

Example 7.4.3 The equation

                            x3y + xy + y = 0

has an irregular singular point at x0 = 0. (Verify.)

   For convenience we restrict our attention to the case where x0 = 0 is a regular singular point of (7.4.2).
This isn't really a restriction, since if x0 = 0 is a regular singular point of (7.4.2) then introducing the
new independent variable t = x - x0 and the new unknown Y (t) = y(t + x0) leads to a differential
equation with polynomial coefficients that has a regular singular point at t0 = 0. This is illustrated in
Exercise 22 for Legendre's equation, and in Exercise 23 for the general case.

Euler Equations

The simplest kind of equation with a regular singular point at x0 = 0 is the Euler equation, defined as
follows.

Definition 7.4.2 An Euler equation is an equation that can be written in the form

                            ax2y + bxy + cy = 0,                                   (7.4.6)

where a, b, and c are real constants and a = 0.

Theorem 5.1.1 implies that (7.4.6) has solutions defined on (0, ) and (-, 0), since (7.4.6) can be

rewritten as                                     b    c

                            ay + y + 2 y = 0.
                                                 xx

For convenience we'll restrict our attention to the interval (0, ). (Exercise 19 deals with solutions of
(7.4.6) on (-, 0).) The key to finding solutions on (0, ) is that if x > 0 then xr is defined as a
real-valued function on (0, ) for all values of r, and substituting y = xr into (7.4.6) produces

                 ax2(xr) + bx(xr) + cxr = ax2r(r - 1)xr-2 + bxrxr-1 + cxr          (7.4.7)
                                                    = [ar(r - 1) + br + c]xr.

The polynomial

                            p(r) = ar(r - 1) + br + c

is called the indicial polynomial of (7.4.6), and p(r) = 0 is its indicial equation. From (7.4.7) we can see
that y = xr is a solution of (7.4.6) on (0, ) if and only if p(r) = 0. Therefore, if the indicial equation
has distinct real roots r1 and r2 then y1 = xr1 and y2 = xr2 form a fundamental set of solutions of (7.4.6)
on (0, ), since y2/y1 = xr2-r1 is nonconstant. In this case

                            y = c1xr1 + c2xr2

is the general solution of (7.4.6) on (0, ).

Example 7.4.4 Find the general solution of

                            x2y - xy - 8y = 0                                      (7.4.8)

on (0, ).

Solution The indicial polynomial of (7.4.8) is

                                    p(r) = r(r - 1) - r - 8 = (r - 4)(r + 2).
Therefore y1 = x4 and y2 = x-2 are solutions of (7.4.8) on (0, ), and its general solution on (0, ) is

                                                     y = c1x4 + x2 c2 .
                                         Section 7.4 Regular Singular Points: Euler Equations 345

Example 7.4.5 Find the general solution of                                            (7.4.9)
                                                 6x2y + 5xy - y = 0

on (0, ).

Solution The indicial polynomial of (7.4.9) is

                 p(r) = 6r(r - 1) + 5r - 1 = (2r - 1)(3r + 1).

Therefore the general solution of (7.4.9) on (0, ) is

                                    y = c1x1/2 + c2x-1/3.

If the indicial equation has a repeated root r1, then y1 = xr1 is a solution of

                                    ax2y + bxy + cy = 0,                              (7.4.10)

on (0, ), but (7.4.10) has no other solution of the form y = xr. If the indicial equation has complex
conjugate zeros then (7.4.10) has no real-valued solutions of the form y = xr. Fortunately we can use

the results of Section 5.2 for constant coefficient equations to solve (7.4.10) in any case.

Theorem 7.4.3 Suppose the roots of the indicial equation

                                    ar(r - 1) + br + c = 0                            (7.4.11)

are r1 and r2. Then the general solution of the Euler equation                        (7.4.12)
                                                ax2y + bxy + cy = 0

on (0, ) is

                 y = c1xr1 + c2xr2 if r1 and r2 are distinct real numbers ;
                 y = xr1 (c1 + c2 ln x) if r1 = r2 ;
                 y = x [c1 cos ( ln x) + c2 sin ( ln x)] if r1, r2 =   i with  > 0.

Proof We first show that y = y(x) satisfies (7.4.12) on (0, ) if and only if Y (t) = y(et) satisfies the

constant coefficient equation

                                    d2Y                dY
                                    a 2 + (b - a) + cY = 0                            (7.4.13)
                                    dt                 dt

on (-, ). To do this, it's convenient to write x = et, or, equivalently, t = ln x; thus, Y (t) = y(x),

where x = et. From the chain rule,       dY = dy dx
                                         dt dx dt

and, since                               dx = et = x,
                                         dt

it follows that                          dY = x dy .
                                         dt dx
                                                                                      (7.4.14)
346 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations

Differentiating this with respect to t and using the chain rule again yields

                         d2Y = d dY = d x dy
                         dt2     dt dt         dt dx

                                 dx dy d2y dx
                              =  +x 2
                                 dt dx dx dt

                                     dy 2 d2y  since dx = x .
                              = x +x 2                dt

                                     dx dx

From this and (7.4.14),           2 d2y d2Y dY
                                 x 2= 2 - .

                                    dx dt dt

Substituting this and (7.4.14) into (7.4.12) yields (7.4.13). Since (7.4.11) is the characteristic equation of

(7.4.13), Theorem 5.2.1 implies that the general solution of (7.4.13) on (-, ) is

           Y (t) = c1er1t + c2er2t if r1 and r2 are distinct real numbers;
           Y (t) = er1t(c1 + c2t) if r1 = r2;
           Y (t) = et (c1 cos t + c2 sin t) if r1, r2 =   i with  = 0.

Since Y (t) = y(et), substituting t = ln x in the last three equations shows that the general solution of
(7.4.12) on (0, ) has the form stated in the theorem.

Example 7.4.6 Find the general solution of                                         (7.4.15)
                                                 x2y - 5xy + 9y = 0

on (0, ).

Solution The indicial polynomial of (7.4.15) is                                    (7.4.16)
                                       p(r) = r(r - 1) - 5r + 9 = (r - 3)2.

Therefore the general solution of (7.4.15) on (0, ) is
                                                  y = x3(c1 + c2 ln x).

Example 7.4.7 Find the general solution of
                                                 x2y + 3xy + 2y = 0

on (0, ).

Solution The indicial polynomial of (7.4.16) is
                                     p(r) = r(r - 1) + 3r + 2 = (r + 1)2 + 1.

The roots of the indicial equation are r = -1  i and the general solution of (7.4.16) on (0, ) is
                                         y = 1 [c1 cos(ln x) + c2 sin(ln x)] .

7.5 THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS I

In this section we begin to study series solutions of a homogeneous linear second order differential equa-
tion with a regular singular point at x0 = 0, so it can be written as

                              x2A(x)y + xB(x)y + C(x)y = 0,             (7.5.1)

where A, B, C are polynomials and A(0) = 0.
                                                            Section 7.5 The Method of Frobenius I 349

We'll see that (7.5.1) always has at least one solution of the form

                                                     

                                       y = xr anxn

                                                    n=0

where a0 = 0 and r is a suitably chosen number. The method we will use to find solutions of this form

and other forms that we'll encounter in the next two sections is called the method of Frobenius, and we'll

call them Frobenius solutions.

It can be shown that the power series       anxn  in  a     Frobenius  solution  of  (7.5.1)  converges  on  some
                                       n=0
open interval (-, ), where 0 <   . However, since xr may be complex for negative x or undefined

if x = 0, we'll consider solutions defined for positive values of x. Easy modifications of our results yield

solutions defined for negative values of x. (Exercise 54).

We'll restrict our attention to the case where A, B, and C are polynomials of degree not greater than

two, so (7.5.1) becomes

x2(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + x(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + (0 + 1x + 2x2)y = 0,                                              (7.5.2)

 where i, i, and i are real constants and 0 = 0. Most equations that arise in applications can be
 written this way. Some examples are

                                   x2y + xy + y = 0 (Euler's equation),
                            x2y + xy + (x2 - 2)y = 0 (Bessel's equation),
and

                                xy + (1 - x)y + y = 0, (Laguerre's equation),

where we would multiply the last equation through by x to put it in the form (7.5.2). However, the
method of Frobenius can be extended to the case where A, B, and C are functions that can be represented
by power series in x on some interval that contains zero, and A0(0) = 0 (Exercises 57 and 58).

   The next two theorems will enable us to develop systematic methods for finding Frobenius solutions

of (7.5.2).

Theorem 7.5.1 Let
             Ly = x2(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + x(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + (0 + 1x + 2x2)y,

and define

                                p0(r) = 0r(r - 1) + 0r + 0,
                                p1(r) = 1r(r - 1) + 1r + 1,
                                p2(r) = 2r(r - 1) + 2r + 2.

Suppose the series                                                                                       (7.5.3)
converges on (0, ). Then                                                                                 (7.5.4)
                                       y = anxn+r

                                                n=0

                                                   

                                       Ly = bnxn+r

on (0, ), where

           b0 = p0(r)a0,                                                                   (7.5.5)
           b1 = p0(r + 1)a1 + p1(r)a0,                                                     (7.5.6)
           bn = p0(n + r)an + p1(n + r - 1)an-1 + p2(n + r - 2)an-2, n  2.                 (7.5.7)
                                                                                           (7.5.8)
Proof We begin by showing that if y is given by (7.5.3) and , , and  are constants, then
                                                                                           (7.5.9)
                                                                                          (7.5.10)

                 x2y + xy + y = p(n + r)anxn+r,

                                                          n=0

where

                                       p(r) = r(r - 1) + r + .

Differentiating (3) twice yields

                                                   

                                         y = (n + r)anxn+r-1

                                                  n=0

and 
                                      y = (n + r)(n + r - 1)anxn+r-2.

                                                                 n=0

Multiplying (7.5.7) by x and (7.5.8) by x2 yields

                                                      

                                         xy = (n + r)anxn+r

                                                    n=0

and                                               
Therefore
                                  x2y = (n + r)(n + r - 1)anxn+r.

                                                n=0

                                         

           x2y + xy + y =                     [(n + r)(n + r - 1) + (n + r) + ] anxn+r

                                         n=0

                                         

                                    =         p(n + r)anxn+r,

                                         n=0

which proves (7.5.6).
   Multiplying (7.5.6) by x yields

                                                               

       x(x2y + xy + y) = p(n + r)anxn+r+1 = p(n + r - 1)an-1xn+r.

                                    n=0            n=1

Multiplying (7.5.6) by x2 yields

                                                               

       x2(x2y    + xy + y) = p(n + r)anxn+r+2 = p(n + r - 2)an-2xn+r.

                                    n=0            n=2

To use these results, we rewrite

Ly = x2(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + x(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + (0 + 1x + 2x2)y

as                             0x2y + 0xy + 0y + x 1x2y + 1xy + 1y                          (7.5.11)
                      Ly =    + x2 2x2y + 2xy + 2y .

From (7.5.6) with p = p0,

                            0x2y                                   

                                  + 0xy + 0y = p0(n + r)anxn+r.

                                                                  n=0

From (7.5.9) with p = p1,

                                                                          

                   x 1x2y + 1xy + 1y = p1(n + r - 1)an-1xn+r.

                                                                         n=1

From (7.5.10) with p = p2,

                                                                            

                   x2 2x2y + 2xy + 2y = p2(n + r - 2)an-2xn+r.

                                                                          n=2

Therefore we can rewrite (7.5.11) as

                                      

Ly = p0(n + r)anxn+r + p1(n + r - 1)an-1xn+r

                         n=0          n=1

                                                                                        

                                                          + p2(n + r - 2)an-2xn+r,

                                                                                       n=2

or

Ly = p0(r)a0xr + [p0(r + 1)a1 + p1(r)a2] xr+1

                      

            + [p0(n + r)an + p1(n + r - 1)an-1 + p2(n + r - 2)an-2] xn+r,

                     n=2

which implies (7.5.4) with {bn} defined as in (7.5.5).

Theorem 7.5.2 Let

Ly = x2(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + x(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + (0 + 1x + 2x2)y,

where 0 = 0, and define

                              p0(r) = 0r(r - 1) + 0r + 0,
                              p1(r) = 1r(r - 1) + 1r + 1,

Suppose r is a real number such that p0(n + r) is nonzero for all positive integers n. Define

           a0(r) = 1,                                                                                   (7.5.12)
           a1(r) = - p1(r) ,

                             p0(r + 1)
           an(r) = - p1(n + r - 1)an-1(r) + p2(n + r - 2)an-2(r) , n  2.

                                                    p0(n + r)

Then the Frobenius series                          

                           y(x, r) = xr an(r)xn                                                         (7.5.13)

                                                 n=0

converges and satisfies

                           Ly(x, r) = p0(r)xr                                                           (7.5.14)

on the interval (0, ), where  is the distance from the origin to the nearest zero of A(x) = 0 + 1x +
2x2 in the complex plane. (If A is constant, then  = .)

   If {an(r)} is determined by the recurrence relation (7.5.12) then substituting an = an(r) into (7.5.5)
yields b0 = p0(r) and bn = 0 for n  1, so (7.5.4) reduces to (7.5.14). We omit the proof that the series
(7.5.13) converges on (0, ).

   If i = i = i = 0 for i = 1, 2, then Ly = 0 reduces to the Euler equation

                                             0x2y + 0xy + 0y = 0.

Theorem 7.4.3 shows that the solutions of this equation are determined by the zeros of the indicial poly-
nomial

                                           p0(r) = 0r(r - 1) + 0r + 0.

Since (7.5.14) implies that this is also true for the solutions of Ly = 0, we'll also say that p0 is the indicial
polynomial of (7.5.2), and that p0(r) = 0 is the indicial equation of Ly = 0. We'll consider only cases
where the indicial equation has real roots r1 and r2, with r1  r2.

Theorem 7.5.3 Let L and {an(r)} be as in Theorem 7.5.2, and suppose the indicial equation p0(r) = 0
of Ly = 0 has real roots r1 and r2, where r1  r2. Then

                                                                                                     

                                        y1(x) = y(x, r1) = xr1 an(r1)xn

                                                                                                   n=0

is a Frobenius solution of Ly = 0. Moreover, if r1 - r2 isn't an integer then

                                                                                                     

                                        y2(x) = y(x, r2) = xr2 an(r2)xn

                                                                                                   n=0

is also a Frobenius solution of Ly = 0, and {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions.

Proof Since r1 and r2 are roots of p0(r) = 0, the indicial polynomial can be factored as

                           p0(r) = 0(r - r1)(r - r2).                                                   (7.5.15)

Therefore

                           p0(n + r1) = n0(n + r1 - r2),
     Section 7.5 The Method of Frobenius I 353

which is nonzero if n > 0, since r1 - r2  0. Therefore the assumptions of Theorem 7.5.2 hold with
r = r1, and (7.5.14) implies that Ly1 = p0(r1)xr1 = 0.

   Now suppose r1 - r2 isn't an integer. From (7.5.15),

                           p0(n + r2) = n0(n - r1 + r2) = 0 if n = 1, 2,    .

Hence, the assumptions of Theorem 7.5.2 hold with r = r2, and (7.5.14) implies that Ly2 = p0(r2)xr2 =
0. We leave the proof that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions as an exercise (Exercise 52).

   It isn't always possible to obtain explicit formulas for the coefficients in Frobenius solutions. However,
we can always set up the recurrence relations and use them to compute as many coefficients as we want.
The next example illustrates this.

Example 7.5.1 Find a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of                     (7.5.16)
                    2x2(1 + x + x2)y + x(9 + 11x + 11x2)y + (6 + 10x + 7x2)y = 0.

Compute just the first six coefficients a0,. . . , a5 in each solution.

Solution For the given equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.5.2 are

p0(r) = 2r(r - 1) + 9r + 6 = (2r + 3)(r + 2),
p1(r) = 2r(r - 1) + 11r + 10 = (2r + 5)(r + 2),
p2(r) = 2r(r - 1) + 11r + 7 = (2r + 7)(r + 1).

The zeros of the indicial polynomial p0 are r1 = -3/2 and r2 = -2, so r1 - r2 = 1/2. Therefore
Theorem 7.5.3 implies that

                                                                         

y1 = x-3/2 an(-3/2)xn and y2 = x-2 an(-2)xn                                        (7.5.17)

n=0                                                                      n=0

form a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of (7.5.16). To find the coefficients in these series, we use
the recurrence relation of Theorem 7.5.2; thus,

a0(r) = 1,
a1(r) = - p1(r) = - (2r + 5)(r + 2) = - r + 2 ,

                 p0(r + 1) (2r + 5)(r + 3) r + 3

an(r) = - p1(n + r - 1)an-1 + p2(n + r - 2)an-2
                                     p0(n + r)

= - (n + r + 1)(2n + 2r + 3)an-1(r) + (n + r - 1)(2n + 2r + 3)an-2(r)
                                    (n + r + 2)(2n + 2r + 3)

                 = - (n + r + 1)an-1(r) + (n + r - 1)an-2(r) ,           n  2.
                                             n+r+2

Setting r = -3/2 in these equations yields

Special Cases With Two Term Recurrence Relations

For n  2, the recurrence relation (7.5.12) of Theorem 7.5.2 involves the three coefficients an(r),
an-1(r), and an-2(r). We'll now consider some special cases where (7.5.12) reduces to a two term
recurrence relation; that is, a relation involving only an(r) and an-1(r) or only an(r) and an-2(r).
This simplification often makes it possible to obtain explicit formulas for the coefficents of Frobenius
solutions.

   We first consider equations of the form

x2(0 + 1x)y + x(0 + 1x)y + (0 + 1x)y = 0

with 0 = 0. For this equation, 2 = 2 = 2 = 0, so p2  0 and the recurrence relations in
Theorem 7.5.2 simplify to

                                  a0(r) = 1,                        n  1.      (7.5.20)

                                                      p0(n + r)

Example 7.5.2 Find a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of

                           x2(3 + x)y + 5x(1 + x)y - (1 - 4x)y = 0.            (7.5.21)

Give explicit formulas for the coefficients in the solutions.

Solution For this equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.5.2 are

p0(r) = 3r(r - 1) + 5r - 1 = (3r - 1)(r + 1),

p1(r) = r(r - 1) + 5r + 4 =                                         (r + 2)2,

p2(r) =                         0.

The zeros of the indicial polynomial p0 are r1 = 1/3 and r2 = -1, so r1 - r2 = 4/3. Therefore
Theorem 7.5.3 implies that

form a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of (7.5.21). To find the coefficients in these series, we use
the recurrence relationss (7.5.20); thus,

                              a0(r) =      1,
                             an(r) =

Setting r = 1/3 in (7.5.22) yields             (3n + 3r - 1)(n + r + 1)
                                           - n + r + 1 an-1(r), n  1.

By using the product notation introduced in Section 7.2 and proceeding as we did in the examples in that

                                                               j=1(3j - 4)

   We now consider equations of the form

with 0 = 0. For this equation, 1 = 1 = 1 = 0, so p1  0 and the recurrence relations in
Theorem 7.5.2 simplify to

                a0(r) = 1,

Give explicit formulas for the coefficients in the solutions.

Solution For this equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.5.2 are

           p1(r) =                         0

           p2(r) = - [r(r - 1) + 4r + 2] = -(r + 1)(r + 2).

The zeros of the indicial polynomial p0 are r1 = 2 and r2 = 1/2, so r1 - r2 = 3/2. Therefore
Theorem 7.5.3 implies that

so                                     1 m (4j - 1)(4j + 1)
Therefore            a2m(1/2) = 8mm!                     4j - 3 .

is a Frobenius solution of (7.5.25) and {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions.
REMARK: Thus far, we considered only the case where the indicial equation has real roots that don't
differ by an integer, which allows us to apply Theorem 7.5.3. However, for equations of the form (7.5.23),
the sequence {a2m(r)} in (7.5.24) is defined for r = r2 if r1 - r2 isn't an even integer. It can be shown
(Exercise 56) that in this case

                                                         

           y1 = xr1       a2m(r1)x2m and y2 = xr2             a2m(r2)x2m

                     m=0                                 m=0

form a fundamental set Frobenius solutions of (7.5.23).

 USING TECHNOLOGY

   As we said at the end of Section 7.2, if you're interested in actually using series to compute numerical
approximations to solutions of a differential equation, then whether or not there's a simple closed form
for the coefficents is essentially irrelevant; recursive computation is usually more efficient. Since it's also
laborious, we encourage you to write short programs to implement recurrence relations on a calculator or
computer, even in exercises where this is not specifically required.

   In practical use of the method of Frobenius when x0 = 0 is a regular singular point, we're interested
in how well the functions

                                                                                    N

                                     yN (x, ri) = xri an(ri)xn, i = 1, 2,

                                                                                  n=0

approximate solutions to a given equation when ri is a zero of the indicial polynomial. In dealing with
the corresponding problem for the case where x0 = 0 is an ordinary point, we used numerical integration
to solve the differential equation subject to initial conditions y(0) = a0, y (0) = a1, and compared the
result with values of the Taylor polynomial

                                                                                            N

                                                   TN (x) = anxn.

                                                                                          n=0

We can't do that here, since in general we can't prescribe arbitrary initial values for solutions of a dif-
ferential equation at a singular point. Therefore, motivated by Theorem 7.5.2 (specifically, (7.5.14)), we
suggest the following procedure.
358 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations

                                   Verification Procedure

Let L and Yn(x; ri) be defined by

Ly = x2(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + x(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + (0 + 1x + 2x2)y

and

                                                                                              N

                                            yN (x; ri) = xri an(ri)xn,

                                                                                            n=0

where the coefficients {an(ri)}Nn=0 are computed as in (7.5.12), Theorem 7.5.2. Compute the error

EN (x; ri) = x-ri LyN (x; ri)/0                                  (7.5.27)

for various values of N and various values of x in the interval (0, ), with  as defined in Theorem 7.5.2.

   The multiplier x-ri/0 on the right of (7.5.27) eliminates the effects of small or large values of xri
near x = 0, and of multiplication by an arbitrary constant. In some exercises you will be asked to
estimate the maximum value of EN (x; ri) on an interval (0, ] by computing EN (xm; ri) at the M points
xm = m/M, m = 1, 2, . . . , M , and finding the maximum of the absolute values:

N () = max{|EN(xm; ri)|, m = 1, 2, . . . , M }.                  (7.5.28)

(For simplicity, this notation ignores the dependence of the right side of the equation on i and M .)
   To implement this procedure, you'll have to write a computer program to calculate {an(ri)} from the

applicable recurrence relation, and to evaluate EN (x; ri).

verification procedure. These particular exercises were chosen arbitrarily you can just as well formulate

7.6 THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS II

In this section we discuss a method for finding two linearly independent Frobenius solutions of a homo-
geneous linear second order equation near a regular singular point in the case where the indicial equation
has a repeated real root. As in the preceding section, we consider equations that can be written as

x2(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + x(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + (0 + 1x + 2x2)y = 0                                         (7.6.1)

where 0 = 0. We assume that the indicial equation p0(r) = 0 has a repeated real root r1. In this case
Theorem 7.5.3 implies that (7.6.1) has one solution of the form

                                                                                           

                                                   y1 = xr1 anxn,

                                                                                         n=0

but does not provide a second solution y2 such that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions. The
following extension of Theorem 7.5.2 provides a way to find a second solution.

Theorem 7.6.1 Let                                                                                  (7.6.2)
         Ly = x2(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + x(0 + 1x + 2x2)y + (0 + 1x + 2x2)y,

where 0 = 0 and define

                           p0(r) = 0r(r - 1) + 0r + 0,

                           p1(r) = 1r(r - 1) + 1r + 1,

                           p2(r) = 2r(r - 1) + 2r + 2.

Suppose r is a real number such that p0(n + r) is nonzero for all positive integers n, and define

a0(r) = 1,
a1(r) = - p1(r) ,

                  p0(r + 1)

an(r) = - p1(n + r - 1)an-1(r) + p2(n + r - 2)an-2(r) , n  2.
                                         p0(n + r)

Then the Frobenius series                          

                           y(x, r) = xr an(r)xn                                                    (7.6.3)

satisfies                            Ly(x, r) = p0(r)xr.                                            (7.6.4)
Moreover,               y (x, r) = y(x, r) ln x + xr an(r)xn  ,                                     (7.6.5)
                        r n=1                                                                       (7.6.6)
and                     L y r (x, r) = p0(r)xr + xrp0(r) ln x.

Proof Theorem 7.5.2 implies (7.6.4). Differentiating formally with respect to r in (7.6.3) yields

                     y (x, r) =  (xr) an(r)xn + xr an(r)xn  
                     r r n=0 n=1

                                                                   

                         = xr ln x an(r)xn + xr an(r)xn

                                           n=0                     n=1

                                                                

                         = y(x, r) ln x + xr an(r)xn,

                                                              n=1

which proves (7.6.5).
   To prove that y(x, r)/r satisfies (7.6.6), we view y in (7.6.2) as a function y = y(x, r) of two

variables, where the prime indicates partial differentiation with respect to x; thus,

                y = y (x, r) = y (x, r) and                          2y
                                    x           y = y (x, r) = 2 (x, r).

                                                                     x

With this notation we can use (7.6.2) to rewrite (7.6.4) as

                2    2y                    y                               r
                x q0(x) 2 (x, r) + xq1(x) (x, r) + q2(x)y(x, r) = p0(r)x ,                          (7.6.7)
                     x                     x

where

                         q0(x) = 0 + 1x + 2x2,
                         q1(x) = 0 + 1x + 2x2,
                         q2(x) = 0 + 1x + 2x2.

Differentiating both sides of (7.6.7) with respect to r yields

       2        3y  2 (x, r) + xq1(x)  2y                       y       r     r
       x q0(x)                             (x, r) + q2(x) (x, r) = p0(r)x + p0(r)x ln x.
                rx                     rx                       r

By changing the order of differentiation in the first two terms on the left we can rewrite this as

       2        3y                     2y                       y       r     r
       x q0(x) 2 (x, r) + xq1(x)           (x, r) + q2(x) (x, r) = p0(r)x + p0(r)x ln x,
                x r                    xr                       r

or               y (x, r) + xq1(x)    y x (x, r) + q2(x) y r (x, r) = p0(r)xr + p0(r)xr ln x,
    x2q0(x) 2 2  r                 r
              x

which is equivalent to (7.6.6).

Theorem 7.6.2 Let L be as in Theorem 7.6.1 and suppose the indicial equation p0(r) = 0 has a repeated
real root r1. Then

                                                                                                     

                                        y1(x) = y(x, r1) = xr1 an(r1)xn

                                                                                                   n=0

and 
                    y2(x) = y (x, r1) = y1(x) ln x + xr1
                               r                               an(r1)xn                      (7.6.8)

                                                          n=1

form a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0.

Proof  Since r1 is a repeated root of p0(r) = 0, the indicial polynomial can be factored as
                                              p0(r) = 0(r - r1)2,

so
                                                  p0(n + r1) = 0n2,

which is nonzero if n > 0. Therefore the assumptions of Theorem 7.6.1 hold with r = r1, and (7.6.4)
implies that Ly1 = p0(r1)xr1 = 0. Since

                                                   p0(r) = 2(r - r1)

it follows that p0(r1) = 0, so (7.6.6) implies that
                                       Ly2 = p0(r1)xr1 + xr1 p0(r1) ln x = 0.

This proves that y1 and y2 are both solutions of Ly = 0. We leave the proof that {y1, y2} is a fundamental
set as an exercise (Exercise 53).

Example 7.6.1 Find a fundamental set of solutions of                                         (7.6.9)
                                x2(1 - 2x + x2)y - x(3 + x)y + (4 + x)y = 0.

Compute just the terms involving xn+r1, where 0  n  4 and r1 is the root of the indicial equation.

Solution For the given equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.6.1 are

                    p0(r) = r(r - 1) - 3r + 4 = (r - 2)2,
                    p1(r) = -2r(r - 1) - r + 1 = -(r - 1)(2r + 1),
                    p2(r) = r(r - 1).

Since r1 = 2 is a repeated root of the indicial polynomial p0, Theorem 7.6.2 implies that

Computing recursively with (7.6.13) and (7.6.14) yields

   Since the recurrence formula (7.6.11) involves three terms, it's not possible to obtain a simple explicit

formula for the coefficients in the Frobenius solutions of (7.6.9). However, as we saw in the preceding
sections, the recurrrence formula for {an(r)} involves only two terms if either 1 = 1 = 1 = 0 or
2 = 2 = 2 = 0 in (7.6.1). In this case, it's often possible to find explicit formulas for the coefficients.
The next two examples illustrate this.

Example 7.6.2 Find a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of                               (7.6.15)
                                      2x2(2 + x)y + 5x2y + (1 + x)y = 0.

Give explicit formulas for the coefficients in the solutions.

Solution For the given equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.6.1 are

                        p0(r) = 4r(r - 1) + 1 = (2r - 1)2,

                        p1(r) = 2r(r - 1) + 5r + 1 = (r + 1)(2r + 1),

                        p2(r) =         0.

Since r1 = 1/2 is a repeated zero of the indicial polynomial p0, Theorem 7.6.2 implies that

                                                                                             (7.6.16)

Theorem 7.6.1 reduce to

                        an(r) = - p1(n + r - 1) an-1(r),

Substituting this into (7.6.16) yields

   To obtain y2 in (7.6.17), we must compute an(1/2) for n = 1, 2,. . . . We'll do this by logarithmic
differentiation. From (7.6.18),

                                            n |j + r|            n  1.
                              |an(r)| = |2j + 2r - 1| ,

                                                j =1

Therefore                                             n

                              ln |an(r)| = (ln |j + r| - ln |2j + 2r - 1|) .

                                                    j =1

Differentiating with respect to r yields

                              an(r) n = 1 - 2 .
                              an(r) j=1 j + r 2j + 2r - 1

Therefore                                    n1 2

                              an(r) = an(r)         j + r - 2j + 2r - 1 .

                                             j =1

Setting r = 1/2 here and recalling (7.6.19) yields

Since                         1 - 1 = j - j - 1/2 = - 1 ,
(7.6.20) can be rewritten as  j + 1/2 j j(j + 1/2)               j(2j + 1)

Solution For (7.6.21), the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.6.1 are

                      p0(r) = 2r(r - 1) - 2r + 2 = 2(r - 1)2,

                      p1(r) =               0,

                      p2(r) = -r(r - 1) - 4r - 2 = -(r + 1)(r + 2).

As in Section 7.5, since p1  0, the recurrence formulas of Theorem 7.6.1 imply that an(r) = 0 if n is

odd, and
                                 a0(r) = 1,

                                      2(2m + r - 1)

Since r1 = 1 is a repeated root of the indicial polynomial p0, Theorem 7.6.2 implies that

To obtain y2 in (7.6.23), we must compute a2m(1) for m = 1, 2, . . . .       Again we use logarithmic

differentiation. From (7.6.24),                  1 m |2j + r|

                                                                     j =1

Setting r = 1 and recalling (7.6.25) yields

                              a2m(1) =  j=1 m (2j + 1) m                               1 -1 .        (7.6.26)

                                                                     4mm! j=1 2j + 1 2j

Since                            1 - 1 =- 1 ,
(7.6.26) can be rewritten as  2j + 1 2j 2j(2j + 1)

                              a2m(1) = -                             j=1 m (2j + 1) m  1.

                                                                     2  4mm! j=1 j(2j + 1)

Substituting this into (7.6.23) yields                               m m 
                                          x                          j=1(2j + 1)       1  x2m.
                                                                                    
                       y2 = y1 ln x - 2                              4mm!             j=1 j(2j + 1)

                                                                m=1

   If the solution y1 = y(x, r1) of Ly = 0 reduces to a finite sum, then there's a difficulty in using

logarithmic differentiation to obtain the coefficients {an(r1)} in the second solution. The next example
illustrates this difficulty and shows how to overcome it.

Example 7.6.4 Find a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of                                       (7.6.27)
                                        x2y - x(5 - x)y + (9 - 4x)y = 0.

Give explicit formulas for the coefficients in the solutions.

Solution For (7.6.27) the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.6.1 are

                              p0(r) = r(r - 1) - 5r + 9 = (r - 3)2,

                              p1(r) =                                r - 4,

                              p2(r) =                                0.

Since r1 = 3 is a repeated zero of the indicial polynomial p0, Theorem 7.6.2 implies that

                                                                                                     (7.6.28)

and 

                                 y2 = y1 ln x + x3 an(3)xn                                (7.6.29)

                                                                 n=1

are linearly independent Frobenius solutions of (7.6.27). To find the coefficients in (7.6.28) we use the

recurrence formulas        a0(r) = 1,
                           an(r) = - p1(n + r - 1) an-1(r)

                                               p0(n + r)

                                 =-         n+r-5                2 an-1(r), n  1.

                                            (n + r - 3)

We leave it to you to show that

                                                              n  j+r-5                    (7.6.30)
                                                                             2.
                                 an(r) = (-1)n
                                                  j=1 (j + r - 3)

Setting r = 3 here yields                             n n j-2

                                          an(3) = (-1)           j=1 j  2,

so a1(3) = 1 and an(3) = 0 if n  2. Substituting these coefficients into (7.6.28) yields

                                            y1 = x3(1 + x).

To obtain y2 in (7.6.29) we must compute an(3) for n = 1, 2, . . . . Let's first try logarithmic differenti-

ation. From (7.6.30),                          n |j + r - 5|
                                 |an(r)| = |j + r - 3|2 ,
                                                                          n  1,
                                                   j =1

so n
                               ln |an(r)| = (ln |j + r - 5| - 2 ln |j + r - 3|) .

                                                                    j =1

Differentiating with respect to r yields

                                 an(r) n =        1-2 .
                                 an(r) j=1 j + r - 5 j + r - 3

Therefore                                   n1 2

                           an(r) = an(r)          j+r-5 - j+r-3 .                         (7.6.31)

                                            j =1

However, we can't simply set r = 3 here if n  2, since the bracketed expression in the sum correspond-

ing to j = 2 contains the term 1/(r - 3). In fact, since an(3) = 0 for n  2, the formula (7.6.31) for
an(r) is actually an indeterminate form at r = 3.

   We overcome this difficulty as follows. From (7.6.30) with n = 1,

                                          a1(r) = -              r-4  2.

                                                     (r - 2)
374 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations

Therefore                 a1(r) =                    r-6    3,
so
                                                     (r - 2)

                          a1(3) = -3.                                                   (7.6.32)

From (7.6.30) with n  2,

           an(r) = (-1)n(r - 4)(r - 3)               j=3 n (j + r - 5) = (r - 3)cn(r),
                                                     j=1 n (j + r - 3)2

where                                                j=3 n (j + r - 5) ,
                                                     j=1 n (j + r - 3)2
           cn(r) = (-1)n(r - 4)                                           n  2.

Therefore

                          an(r) = cn(r) + (r - 3)cn(r), n  2,

which implies that an(3) = cn(3) if n  3. We leave it to you to verify that

                          an(3) = cn(3) =            (-1)n+1           ,  n  2.

                                                     n(n - 1)n!

Substituting this and (7.6.32) into (7.6.29) yields

                                                                          (-1)n xn.

                                              Ly(x, r) = p0(r)xr.

Now suppose p0(r) = 0(r - r1)2 and p1(k + r1) = 0 if k is a nonnegative integer.

(a) Show that Ly = 0 has the solution

                              0 (n!)
                                                    j =1

(b) Show that Ly = 0 has the second solution

                                                     

                  y2 = y1 ln x + xr1 an(r1)Jnxn,

(c) Conclude from (a) and (b) that if 1 = 0 then

7.7 THE METHOD OF FROBENIUS III

In Sections 7.5 and 7.6 we discussed methods for finding Frobenius solutions of a homogeneous linear
second order equation near a regular singular point in the case where the indicial equation has a repeated
root or distinct real roots that don't differ by an integer. In this section we consider the case where the
indicial equation has distinct real roots that differ by an integer. We'll limit our discussion to equations
that can be written as

                   x2(0 + 1x)y + x(0 + 1x)y + (0 + 1x)y = 0        (7.7.1)

or
                           x2(0 + 2x2)y + x(0 + 2x2)y + (0 + 2x2)y = 0,

where the roots of the indicial equation differ by a positive integer.
   We begin with a theorem that provides a fundamental set of solutions of equations of the form (7.7.1).

Theorem 7.7.1 Let

                   Ly = x2(0 + 1x)y + x(0 + 1x)y + (0 + 1x)y,

where 0 = 0, and define

                         p0(r) = 0r(r - 1) + 0r + 0,
                         p1(r) = 1r(r - 1) + 1r + 1.
380 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations

Suppose r is a real number such that p0(n + r) is nonzero for all positive integers n, and define

      a0(r) = 1,                                                                                                 (7.7.2)

Let r1 and r2 be the roots of the indicial equation p0(r) = 0, and suppose r1 = r2 + k, where k is a
positive integer. Then

                                                                                      n=0

is a Frobenius solution of Ly = 0. Moreover, if we define

      a0(r2)                     = 1,                                                1  n  k - 1,                (7.7.3)

                                           p0(n + r2)

and                                                                                                              (7.7.4)

      y2 = xr2 an(r2)xn + C                                                                                   

                      n=0                                                            y1 ln x + xr1 an(r1)xn

                                                                                                            n=1

is also a solution of Ly = 0, and {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions.

Proof Theorem 7.5.3 implies that Ly1 = 0. We'll now show that Ly2 = 0. Since L is a linear operator,
this is equivalent to showing that

      k-1                                                                            

      L xr2 an(r2)xn + CL y1 ln x + xr1 an(r1)xn = 0.                                                            (7.7.6)

      n=0                                                                            n=1

To verify this, we'll show that

                   k-1                                                                                           (7.7.7)

      L xr2 an(r2)xn = p1(r1 - 1)ak-1(r2)xr1

                   n=0

and

                                                                                   

              L y1 ln x + xr1 an(r1)xn = k0xr1 .                                                                 (7.7.8)

                                 n=1

This will imply that Ly2 = 0, since substituting (7.7.7) and (7.7.8) into (7.7.6) and using (7.7.4) yields

      Ly2 = [p1(r1 - 1)ak-1(r2) + Ck0] xr1
             = [p1(r1 - 1)ak-1(r2) - p1(r1 - 1)ak-1(r2)] xr1 = 0.

We'll prove (7.7.8) first. From Theorem 7.6.1,

                                            

      L y(x, r) ln x + xr an(r)xn = p0(r)xr + xrp0(r) ln x.

                                           n=1
                                           Section 7.7 The Method of Frobenius III 381

Setting r = r1 and recalling that p0(r1) = 0 and y1 = y(x, r1) yields

                                                                                                   (7.7.9)

                                  L y1 ln x + xr1 an(r1)xn = p0(r1)xr1 .

                                                                               n=1

Since r1 and r2 are the roots of the indicial equation, the indicial polynomial can be written as

                         p0(r) = 0(r - r1)(r - r2) = 0 r2 - (r1 + r2)r + r1r2 .

Differentiating this yields

                                  p0(r) = 0(2r - r1 - r2).

Therefore p0(r1) = 0(r1 - r2) = k0, so (7.7.9) implies (7.7.8).
   Before proving (7.7.7), we first note an(r2) is well defined by (7.7.3) for 1  n  k - 1, since

p0(n + r2) = 0 for these values of n. However, we can't define an(r2) for n  k with (7.7.3), since

p0(k + r2) = p0(r1) = 0. For convenience, we define an(r2) = 0 for n  k. Then, from Theorem 7.5.1,

                  k-1             =L                                                               (7.7.10)

     L xr2 an(r2)xn                   xr2 an(r2)xn                     = xr2 bnxn,

                  n=0                       n=0                                   n=0

where b0 = p0(r2) = 0 and

     bn = p0(n + r2)an(r2) + p1(n + r2 - 1)an-1(r2), n  1.

If 1  n  k - 1, then (7.7.3) implies that bn = 0. If n  k + 1, then bn = 0 because an-1(r2) =
an(r2) = 0. Therefore (7.7.10) reduces to

                  k-1

     L xr2 an(r2)xn = [p0(k + r2)ak(r2) + p1(k + r2 - 1)ak-1(r2)] xk+r2 .

                  n=0

Since ak(r2) = 0 and k + r2 = r1, this implies (7.7.7).
   We leave the proof that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set as an exercise (Exercise 41).

Example 7.7.1 Find a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of

                             2x2(2 + x)y - x(4 - 7x)y - (5 - 3x)y = 0.

Give explicit formulas for the coefficients in the solutions.

Solution For the given equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.7.1 are

     p0(r) = 4r(r - 1) - 4r - 5 = (2r + 1)(2r - 5),
     p1(r) = 2r(r - 1) + 7r + 3 = (r + 1)(2r + 3).

The roots of the indicial equation are r1 = 5/2 and r2 = -1/2, so k = r1 - r2 = 3. Therefore

Theorem 7.7.1 implies that

                                      

                                  y1 = x5/2 an(5/2)xn                                              (7.7.11)

(with C as in (7.7.4)) form a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0. The recurrence formula (7.7.2) is

                         a0(r) = 1,                                                   (7.7.13)
                         an(r) = - p1(n + r - 1) an-1(r)
                                                                                      (7.7.14)
                                             p0(n + r)                                (7.7.15)

                                   = - (n + r)(2n + 2r + 1) an-1(r),
                                           (2n + 2r + 1)(2n + 2r - 5)

                                   = - n + r an-1(r), n  1,
                                           2n + 2r - 5

which implies that                                    n

                         an(r) = (-1)n                   j + r , n  0.
                                          j=1 2j + 2r - 5

Therefore                              (-1)n              j=1 n (2j + 5) .
                         an(5/2) =                       4nn!

Substituting this into (7.7.11) yields

                                        (-1)n             j=1 n (2j + 5) xn.
                         y1 = x5/2                       4nn!

                                           n=0

   To compute the coefficients a0(-1/2), a1(-1/2) and a2(-1/2) in y2, we set r = -1/2 in (7.7.13)
and apply the resulting recurrence formula for n = 1, 2; thus,

                         a0(-1/2) = 1,
                         an(-1/2) = - 2n - 1 an-1(-1/2), n = 1, 2.

                                                4(n - 3)

The last formula yields

                         a1(-1/2) = 1/8 and a2(-1/2) = 3/32.

Substituting r1 = 5/2, r2 = -1/2, k = 3, and 0 = 4 into (7.7.4) yields C = -15/128. Therefore,
from (7.7.12),

           y2 = x-1/2 1 + 1 x + 3 x2 - 15                                             (7.7.16)

                                                         y1 ln x + x5/2 an(5/2)xn .
                         8 32 128 n=1

We use logarithmic differentiation to obtain obtain an(r). From (7.7.14),
                                                    n |j + r|

                                     |an(r)| = |2j + 2r - 5| , n  1.

                                                                        j =1

Therefore                                        n

                         ln |an(r)| = (ln |j + r| - ln |2j + 2r - 5|) .

                                               j =1

Differentiating with respect to r yields

                         an(r) n = 1 - 2 .
                         an(r) j=1 j + r 2j + 2r - 5

Therefore                                  n1 2

                            an(r) = an(r)           j + r - 2j + 2r - 5 .

                                           j =1

Setting r = 5/2 here and recalling (7.7.15) yields

                         (-1)n             j=1 n (2j + 5) n                                          1 -1 .     (7.7.17)
           an(5/2) =
                                           n
                                           4 n!                                           j=1 j + 5/2 j

Since                                       1 -1 =- 5 ,
we can rewrite (7.7.17) as              j + 5/2 j j(2j + 5)

                             (-1)n            n n 
           an(5/2) = -5                       j=1(2j + 5)                                            1.

Substituting this into (7.7.16) yields

           y2 = x-1/2 1 + 1 x + 3 x2 - 15 y1 ln x

   If C = 0 in (7.7.4), there's no need to compute

in the formula (7.7.5) for y2. Therefore it's best to compute C before computing {an(r1)} n=1. This is
illustrated in the next example. (See also Exercises 44 and 45.)

Example 7.7.2 Find a fundamental set of Frobenius solutions of
                                  x2(1 - 2x)y + x(8 - 9x)y + (6 - 3x)y = 0.

Give explicit formulas for the coefficients in the solutions.

Solution For the given equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.7.1 are

           p0(r) = r(r - 1) + 8r + 6 = (r + 1)(r + 6)
           p1(r) = -2r(r - 1) - 9r - 3 = -(r + 3)(2r + 1).

The roots of the indicial equation are r1 = -1 and r2 = -6, so k = r1-r2 = 5. Therefore Theorem 7.7.1

implies that

(with C as in (7.7.4)) form a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0. The recurrence formula (7.7.2) is

                         a0(r) = 1,                                              (7.7.20)
                         an(r) = - p1(n + r - 1) an-1(r)                         (7.7.21)

                                             p0(n + r)

                                   = (n + r + 2)(2n + 2r - 1) an-1(r), n  1,
                                          (n + r + 1)(n + r + 6)

which implies that                      n (j + r + 2)(2j + 2r - 1)

                         an(r) =              (j + r + 1)(j + r + 6)

                                        j =1

                                          n j+r+2             n 2j + 2r - 1    

                         =  j + r + 1   j + r + 6 .
                                        j =1                  j =1

Since                n j + r + 2 (r + 3)(r + 4)    (n + r + 2) n + r + 2
                         j + r + 1 = (r + 2)(r + 3)    (n + r + 1) = r + 2

                    j =1

because of cancellations, (7.7.21) simplifies to

                                              n + r + 2 n 2j + 2r - 1
                         an(r) = r + 2                        j+r+6 .
                                                        j =1

Therefore                                                       n 2j - 3
                                        an(-1) = (n + 1) j + 5 .

                                                                         j =1

Substituting this into (7.7.18) yields

                                                                       
                         y1 = x-1 (n + 1)   n 2j - 3  xn.
                                          n=0 j=1 j + 5

   To compute the coefficients a0(-6), . . . , a4(-6) in y2, we set r = -6 in (7.7.20) and apply the
resulting recurrence formula for n = 1, 2, 3, 4; thus,

                    a0(-6) = 1,
                    an(-6) = (n - 4)(2n - 13) an-1(-6), n = 1, 2, 3, 4.

                                           n(n - 5)

The last formula yields

                    a1(-6) = - 33 , a2(-6) = 99 , a3(-6) = - 231 , a4(-6) = 0.

Since a4(-6) = 0, (7.7.4) implies that the constant C in (7.7.19) is zero. Therefore (7.7.19) reduces to

                         y2 = x-6 1 - 33 x + 99 x2 - 231 x3 .

We now consider equations of the form
                        x2(0 + 2x2)y + x(0 + 2x2)y + (0 + 2x2)y = 0,

where the roots of the indicial equation are real and differ by an even integer. The case where the roots
are real and differ by an odd integer can be handled by the method discussed in 56.

   The proof of the next theorem is similar to the proof of Theorem 7.7.1 (Exercise 43).

Theorem 7.7.2 Let
                          Ly = x2(0 + 2x2)y + x(0 + 2x2)y + (0 + 2x2)y,

where 0 = 0, and define

                              p0(r) = 0r(r - 1) + 0r + 0,
                              p2(r) = 2r(r - 1) + 2r + 2.

Suppose r is a real number such that p0(2m + r) is nonzero for all positive integers m, and define

        a0(r) = 1,                                                               (7.7.22)
      a2m(r) = - p2(2m + r - 2) a2m-2(r), m  1.

                            p0(2m + r)

Let r1 and r2 be the roots of the indicial equation p0(r) = 0, and suppose r1 = r2 + 2k, where k is a
positive integer. Then

is a Frobenius solution of Ly = 0. Moreover, if we define

        a0(r2)           = 1,                                             1mk-1

386 Chapter 7 Series Solutions of Linear Second Order Equations

Solution For the given equation, the polynomials defined in Theorem 7.7.2 are

                    p0(r) = r(r - 1) + 3r - 15 = (r - 3)(r + 5)
                    p2(r) = r(r - 1) + 10r + 14 = (r + 2)(r + 7).

The roots of the indicial equation are r1 = 3 and r2 = -5, so k = (r1 - r2)/2 = 4. Therefore

Theorem 7.7.2 implies that

                                                                                     

                                        y1 = x3 a2m(3)x2m                                                        (7.7.25)

(with C as in (7.7.23)) form a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0. The recurrence formula (7.7.22) is

                     a0(r) = 1,                                                                                  (7.7.26)
                    a2m(r) = - p2(2m + r - 2) a2m-2(r)
                                                                                                                 (7.7.27)
                                          p0(2m + r)                                                             (7.7.28)

                               = - (2m + r)(2m + r + 5) a2m-2(r)
                                        (2m + r - 3)(2m + r + 5)

                               = - 2m + r a2m-2(r), m  1,
                                        2m + r - 3

which implies that                                  m

                    a2m(r) = (-1)m                                                     2j + r , m  0.
                                             j=1 2j + r - 3

Therefore                                    (-1)m j=1 m (2j + 3)

                         a2m(3) =                                                      m     .
                                                                                       2 m!

Substituting this into (7.7.25) yields

                                   (-1)m                                               j=1 m (2j + 3) x2m.
                       y1 = x3                                                         2mm!

                                        m=0

   To compute the coefficients a2(-5), a4(-5), and a6(-5) in y2, we set r = -5 in (7.7.26) and apply
the resulting recurrence formula for m = 1, 2, 3; thus,

                                a2m(-5) = - 2m - 5 a2m-2(-5), m = 1, 2, 3.
                                                  2(m - 4)

This yields         a2(-5) = - 1 , a4(-5) = 1 , a6(-5) = 1 .

                                        2                                              8        16

Substituting r1 = 3, r2 = -5, k = 4, and 0 = 1 into (7.7.23) yields C = -3/16. Therefore, from
(7.7.24),

     y2 = x-5 1 - 1 x2 + 1 x4 + 1 x6 - 3                                                                         (7.7.29)

                                                                                       y1 ln x + x3 a2m(3)x2m .

To obtain a2m(r) we use logarithmic differentiation. From (7.7.27),
                                                    m |2j + r|

                                     |a2m(r)| = |2j + r - 3| , m  1.

                                                                          j =1

Therefore                                              n

                            ln |a2m(r)| = (ln |2j + r| - ln |2j + r - 3|) .

                                                     j =1

Differentiating with respect to r yields

                            a2m(r) m = 1 - 1 .
                            a2m(r) j=1 2j + r 2j + r - 3

Therefore                                         n1 1

                            a2m(r) = a2m(r)        2j + r - 2j + r - 3 .

                                             j =1

Setting r = 3 here and recalling (7.7.28) yields

                        (-1)m              j=1 m (2j + 3) m           1 -1 .             (7.7.30)
           a2m(3) =
                                           m
                                           2 m!           j=1 2j + 3 2j

Since                                      1 - 1 =- 3 ,
we can rewrite (7.7.30) as              2j + 3 2j 2j(2j + 3)

                                                                                 
                                                  j=1 m (2j + 3) n

                                        2

Substituting this into (7.7.29) yields

The roots of the indicial equation are r1 = 0 and r2 = -6, so k = (r1 - r2)/2 = 3. Therefore

Theorem 7.7.2 implies that

(with C as in (7.7.23)) form a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0. The recurrence formulas (7.7.22)

are

                                        = 4m + 2r + 3 a2m-2(r), m  1,
                                              2m + r + 6

which implies that                                    m 4j + 2r + 3
                                        a2m(r) = 2j + r + 6 .

Setting r = 0 yields                    a2m(0) = 6       j=1 m (4j + 3)  .
Substituting this into (7.7.31) yields
                                                         m
                                                         2 (m + 3)!

                                                    m=0

   To compute the coefficients a0(-6), a2(-6), and a4(-6) in y2, we set r = -6 in (7.7.33) and apply
the resulting recurrence formula for m = 1, 2; thus,

                              a0(-6) = 1,
                            a2m(-6) = 4m - 9 a2m-2(-6), m = 1, 2.

                                                  2m

The last formula yields        a2(-6) = - 5 and a4(-6) = 5 .

Since p2(-2) = 0, the constant C in (7.7.23) is zero. Therefore (7.7.32) reduces to

            Laplace Transforms

IN THIS CHAPTER we study the method of Laplace transforms, which illustrates one of the basic prob-
lem solving techniques in mathematics: transform a difficult problem into an easier one, solve the lat-
ter, and then use its solution to obtain a solution of the original problem. The method discussed here
transforms an initial value problem for a constant coefficient equation into an algebraic equation whose
solution can then be used to solve the initial value problem. In some cases this method is merely an
alternative procedure for solving problems that can be solved equally well by methods that we considered
previously; however, in other cases the method of Laplace transforms is more efficient than the methods
previously discussed. This is especially true in physical problems dealing with discontinuous forcing
functions.
SECTION 8.1 defines the Laplace transform and developes its properties.
SECTION 8.2 deals with the problem of finding a function that has a given Laplace transform.
SECTION 8.3 applies the Laplace transform to solve initial value problems for constant coefficient second
order differential equations on (0, ).
SECTION 8.4 introduces the unit step function.
SECTION 8.5 uses the unit step function to solve constant coefficient equations with piecewise continu-
ous forcing functions.
SECTION 8.6 deals with the convolution theorem, an important theoretical property of the Laplace trans-
form.
SECTION 8.7 introduces the idea of impulsive force, and treats constant coefficient equations with im-
pulsive forcing functions.

8.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

Definition of the Laplace Transform

To define the Laplace transform, we first recall the definition of an improper integral. If g is integrable
over the interval [a, T ] for every T > a, then the improper integral of g over [a, ) is defined as

                                                                                            T

                                        g(t) dt = lim g(t) dt.                                              (8.1.1)
                                                 T  a
                                     a

We say that the improper integral converges if the limit in (8.1.1) exists; otherwise, we say that the
improper integral diverges or does not exist. Here's the definition of the Laplace transform of a function
f.

Definition 8.1.1 Let f be defined for t  0 and let s be a real number. Then the Laplace transform of f

is the function F defined by

                                                                                       

                                        F (s) = e-stf(t) dt,                                                (8.1.2)

                                              0

for those values of s for which the improper integral converges.

   It is important to keep in mind that the variable of integration in (8.1.2) is t, while s is a parameter
independent of t. We use t as the independent variable for f because in applications the Laplace transform
is usually applied to functions of time.

   The Laplace transform can be viewed as an operator L that transforms the function f = f(t) into the
function F = F (s). Thus, (8.1.2) can be expressed as

                                              F = L(f).

The functions f and F form a transform pair, which we'll sometimes denote by

                                              f(t)  F (s).

It can be shown that if F (s) is defined for s = s0 then it's defined for all s > s0 (Exercise 14(b)).
Computation of Some Simple Laplace Transforms

Example 8.1.1 Find the Laplace transform of f(t) = 1.

Solution From (8.1.2) with f(t) = 1,

                                                                                                T

               F (s) =                        e-st dt = lim                                       e-st dt.
                                                                                         T 
                                        0                                                      0

If s = 0 then     e- T stdt = - 1 e-st T = 1 - e . -sT                                                      (8.1.3)

                                                                                             s

If s = 0 the integrand reduces to the constant 1, and

                                       T                T

                          lim 1 dt = lim 1 dt = lim T = .

Therefore F (0) is undefined, and

                                    F (s) = e-stdt = 1 ,           s > 0.
                                                            s
                                              0

This result can be written in operator notation as

                                              L(1) = 1 , s > 0,
                                                        s

or as the transform pair                      1  1 , s > 0.
                                                    s

REMARK: It is convenient to combine the steps of integrating from 0 to T and letting T  . Therefore,

instead of writing (8.1.3) and (8.1.4) as separate steps we write

We'll follow this practice throughout this chapter.

Example 8.1.2 Find the Laplace transform of f(t) = t.

Solution From (8.1.2) with f(t) = t,

                                                                                             (8.1.5)

                                           F (s) = e-stt dt.

                                                           0

If s = 0, integrating by parts yields

    e-stt dt = - te-st  + 1                                                t1

                                                              e-st dt = -        e-st
                                                                           ss
0                                                                                         0

                             =             1 , s > 0,
                                          s2
                                              , s < 0.

If s = 0, the integral in (8.1.5) becomes      t dt = t2  = .
                                                        20
Therefore F (0) is undefined and           0
This result can also be written as
or as the transform pair                              1    s > 0.
                                           F (s) = 2 ,     s > 0,

                                                     s

Example 8.1.3 Find the Laplace transform of f(t) = eat, where a is a constant.

Solution From (8.1.2) with f(t) = eat,

                                                         

                                        F (s) =            e-steat dt.

                                                      0

Combining the exponentials yields

                                      F (s) =          

                                                          e-(s-a)t dt.

                                                      0

However, we know from Example 8.1.1 that

                                          e-st dt = 1 ,       s > 0.
                                                           s
                                      0

Replacing s by s - a here shows that

                                      F (s) = 1 , s > a.
                                                s-a

This can also be written as

                 L(eat) = 1 , s > a, or eat  1 , s > a.
                                   s-a                                s-a

Example 8.1.4 Find the Laplace transforms of f(t) = sin t and g(t) = cos t, where  is a constant.

Solution Define                                         

                                      F (s) =              e-st sin t dt        (8.1.6)
                                                                                (8.1.7)
and                                                   0
                                              G(s) =                            (8.1.8)
                                                       

                                                          e-st cos t dt.

                                                      0

If s > 0, integrating (8.1.6) by parts yields

                             F (s) = - e-st  sin t +   e-st cos t dt,
                                      s               0 s0

so 
                                                     F (s) = s G(s).

If s > 0, integrating (8.1.7) by parts yields

                             G(s) = - e-st cos t  -   e-st sin t dt,
                                               s      0 s0

so
                                                  G(s) = 1 -  F (s).
                                                             ss

Now substitute from (8.1.8) into this to obtain

                                                   1 2
                                         G(s) = - 2 G(s).

Solving this for G(s) yields                s
This and (8.1.8) imply that   G(s) = 2 2 , s > 0.

                                        s +

                                        s +

Tables of Laplace transforms

Extensive tables of Laplace transforms have been compiled and are commonly used in applications. The
brief table of Laplace transforms in the Appendix will be adequate for our purposes.

Example 8.1.5 Use the table of Laplace transforms to find L(t3e4t).

Solution The table includes the transform pair

                                                  tneat  (s - a)n+1 n! .
Setting n = 3 and a = 4 here yields

                                        L(t3e4t) = (s - 4)4 3! = (s - 4)4 6 .

   We'll sometimes write Laplace transforms of specific functions without explicitly stating how they are
obtained. In such cases you should refer to the table of Laplace transforms.

Linearity of the Laplace Transform

The next theorem presents an important property of the Laplace transform.

Theorem 8.1.2 [Linearity Property] Suppose L(fi) is defined for s > si, 1  i  n). Let s0 be the
largest of the numbers s1, s2, . . . ,sn , and let c1, c2,. . . , cn be constants. Then

       L(c1f1 + c2f2 +    + cnfn) = c1L(f1) + c2L(f2) +    + cnL(fn) for s > s0.

Proof  We give the proof for the case where n = 2. If s > s0 then

       L(c1f1 + c2f2) =                    

                                              e-st (c1f1(t) + c2f2(t))) dt

                                        0                                         

                              = c1                 e-stf1(t) dt + c2                 e-stf2(t) dt

                                           0                                   0

                              = c1L(f1) + c2L(f2).

Example 8.1.6 Use Theorem 8.1.2 and the known Laplace transform
                                                     L(eat) = 1
                                                                  s-a

to find L(cosh bt) (b = 0).
398 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Solution By definition,

                                     cosh bt = ebt + e-bt .
                                                       2

Therefore  L(cosh bt) = L 1 ebt + 1 e-bt

                                     2          2
                               = 1 L(ebt) + 1 L(e-bt)
                                  2             2            (linearity property)  (8.1.9)

                                  2 s-b 2 s+b

where the first transform on the right is defined for s > b and the second for s > -b; hence, both are
defined for s > |b|. Simplifying the last expression in (8.1.9) yields

                                                    s
                               L(cosh bt) = 2 2 , s > |b|.

                                                s -b

The First Shifting Theorem

The next theorem enables us to start with known transform pairs and derive others. (For other results of
this kind, see Exercises 6 and 13.)

Theorem 8.1.3 [First Shifting Theorem] If

                                                                                   (8.1.10)

                                  F (s) = e-stf(t) dt

                                                  0

is the Laplace transform of f(t) for s > s0, then F (s - a) is the Laplace transform of eatf(t) for
s > s0 + a.

PROOF. Replacing s by s - a in (8.1.10) yields

                                                

                               F (s - a) =         e-(s-a)tf (t) dt                (8.1.11)

                                            0

if s - a > s0; that is, if s > s0 + a. However, (8.1.11) can be rewritten as

                                                         

                               F (s - a) = e-st eatf(t) dt,

                                                       0

which implies the conclusion.

Example 8.1.7 Use Theorem 8.1.3 and the known Laplace transforms of 1, t, cos t, and sin t to find
                              L(eat), L(teat), L(et sin t), and L(et cos t).

Solution In the following table the known transform pairs are listed on the left and the required transform
pairs listed on the right are obtained by applying Theorem 8.1.3.

Existence of Laplace Transforms

Not every function has a Laplace transform. For example, it can be shown (Exercise 3) that

                                                      e-stet2 dt = 

                                                                           0

for every real number s. Hence, the function f(t) = et2 does not have a Laplace transform.
   Our next objective is to establish conditions that ensure the existence of the Laplace transform of a

function. We first review some relevant definitions from calculus.
   Recall that a limit
                                                          lim f(t)

                                                                                  tt0

exists if and only if the one-sided limits

                                         lim f(t) and lim f(t)
                                         tt0-        tt0+

both exist and are equal; in this case,

                                 lim f(t) = lim f(t) = lim f(t).
                                 tt0           tt0-  tt0+

Recall also that f is continuous at a point t0 in an open interval (a, b) if and only if

                                               lim f(t) = f(t0),

                                               tt0

which is equivalent to           lim f(t) = lim f(t) = f(t0).                             (8.1.12)
For simplicity, we define        tt0+          tt0-

                           f(t0+) = lim f(t) and f(t0-) = lim f(t),
                                 tt0+                              tt0-

so (8.1.12) can be expressed as

                                         f(t0+) = f(t0-) = f(t0).

If f(t0+) and f(t0-) have finite but distinct values, we say that f has a jump discontinuity at t0, and

                                               f(t0+) - f(t0-)

is called the jump in f at t0 (Figure 8.1.1).

   If f(t0+) and f(t0-) are finite and equal, but either f isn't defined at t0 or it's defined but
                                              f(t0) = f(t0+) = f(t0-),

we say that f has a removable discontinuity at t0 (Figure 8.1.2). This terminolgy is appropriate since a
function f with a removable discontinuity at t0 can be made continuous at t0 by defining (or redefining)

                                              f(t0) = f(t0+) = f(t0-).
REMARK: We know from calculus that a definite integral isn't affected by changing the values of its
integrand at isolated points. Therefore, redefining a function f to make it continuous at removable dis-
continuities does not change L(f).
Definition 8.1.4

    (i) A function f is said to be piecewise continuous on a finite closed interval [0, T ] if f(0+) and
         f(T -) are finite and f is continuous on the open interval (0, T ) except possibly at finitely many
         points, where f may have jump discontinuities or removable discontinuities.

   (ii) A function f is said to be piecewise continuous on the infinite interval [0, ) if it's piecewise
         continuous on [0, T ] for every T > 0.

   Figure 8.1.3 shows the graph of a typical piecewise continuous function.
   It is shown in calculus that if a function is piecewise continuous on a finite closed interval then it's
integrable on that interval. But if f is piecewise continuous on [0, ), then so is e-stf(t), and therefore

                                                                                 T

                                                                         T

                        0

converges for s in some interval (s0, ). For example, we noted earlier that (8.1.13) diverges for all
s if f(t) = et2. Stated informally, this occurs because et2 increases too rapidly as t  . The next
definition provides a constraint on the growth of a function that guarantees convergence of its Laplace
transform for s in some interval (s0, ) .

Definition 8.1.5 A function f is said to be of exponential order s0 if there are constants M and t0 such

that

                                                                   |f(t)|  M es0t, t  t0.       (8.1.14)

In situations where the specific value of s0 is irrelevant we say simply that f is of exponential order.

   The next theorem gives useful sufficient conditions for a function f to have a Laplace transform. The
proof is sketched in Exercise 10.

Theorem 8.1.6 If f is piecewise continuous on [0, ) and of exponential order s0, then L(f) is defined
for s > s0.

REMARK: We emphasize that the conditions of Theorem 8.1.6 are sufficient, but not necessary, for f to
have a Laplace transform. For example, Exercise 14(c) shows that f may have a Laplace transform even
though f isn't of exponential order.

Example 8.1.8 If f is bounded on some interval [t0, ), say

                                                                   |f(t)|  M, t  t0,

then (8.1.14) holds with s0 = 0, so f is of exponential order zero. Thus, for example, sin t and cos t
are of exponential order zero, and Theorem 8.1.6 implies that L(sin t) and L(cos t) exist for s > 0.
This is consistent with the conclusion of Example 8.1.4.
402 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Example 8.1.9 It can be shown that if limt e-s0tf(t) exists and is finite then f is of exponential
order s0 (Exercise 9). If  is any real number and s0 > 0 then f(t) = t is of exponential order s0, since

                                                     lim e-s0tt = 0,

                                                                          t

by L'Hpital's rule. If   0, f is also continuous on [0, ). Therefore Exercise 9 and Theorem 8.1.6
imply that L(t) exists for s  s0. However, since s0 is an arbitrary positive number, this really implies
that L(t) exists for all s > 0. This is consistent with the results of Example 8.1.2 and Exercises 6 and 8.

Example 8.1.10 Find the Laplace transform of the piecewise continuous function

                            f(t) =               1, 0  t < 1,

Solution Since f is defined by different formulas on [0, 1) and [1, ), we write

                                                    1

and                                                                     3e-(s+1)

                       e-st(-3e-t) dt = -3          e           dt = -            ,  s > -1,

                 1                            1

it follows that                   1 - e-s - 3 e-(s+1) ,

                                     s                 s+1           s > -1, s = 0,
                    F (s) =                            3             s = 0.
                                                 1- e ,
                              

This is consistent with Theorem 8.1.6, since

                                  |f(t)|  3e-t, t  1,

and therefore f is of exponential order s0 = -1.
REMARK: In Section 8.4 we'll develop a more efficient method for finding Laplace transforms of piece-
wise continuous functions.

Example 8.1.11 We stated earlier that

                                                      e-stet2 dt = 

                                                                           0

for all s, so Theorem 8.1.6 implies that f(t) = et2 is not of exponential order, since

                                     et2 1 t2-s0t
                         lim s t = lim e                             = ,
                         t M e 0 t M

so
                                                       et2 > M es0t

for sufficiently large values of t, for any choice of M and s0 (Exercise 3).

8.2 THE INVERSE LAPLACE TRANSFORM

Definition of the Inverse Laplace Transform

In Section 8.1 we defined the Laplace transform of f by

                                                                                              

                                          F (s) = L(f) = e-stf(t) dt.

                                                                                            0

We'll also say that f is an inverse Laplace Transform of F , and write

                                                       f = L-1(F ).
406 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

To solve differential equations with the Laplace transform, we must be able to obtain f from its transform
F . There's a formula for doing this, but we can't use it because it requires the theory of functions of a
complex variable. Fortunately, we can use the table of Laplace transforms to find inverse transforms that
we'll need.

Example 8.2.1 Use the table of Laplace transforms to find

                    (a) L-1          1    and (b) L s2 -1 s+ 9 .
                                  s2 - 1

SOLUTION(a) Setting b = 1 in the transform pair

                                                   b
                                  sinh bt  2 2

                                               s -b

shows that                        L s2 -1 1- 1 = sinh t.

SOLUTION(b) Setting  = 3 in the transform pair

                                                  s
                                  cos t  2 2

                                              s +

shows that                        L s2 -1 s+ 9 = cos 3t.

   The next theorem enables us to find inverse transforms of linear combinations of transforms in the
table. We omit the proof.

Theorem 8.2.1 [Linearity Property] If F1, F2, . . . , Fn are Laplace transforms and c1, c2, . . . , cn are
constants, then

             L-1(c1F1 + c2F2 +    + cnFn) = c1L-1(F1) + c2L-1(F2) +    + cnL-1Fn.

Example 8.2.2 Find

                                  L-1 8 s + 5 + s2 7+ 3 .

Solution From the table of Laplace transforms in Section 8.8,,

                                     eat  1 and

Theorem 8.2.1 with a = -5 and  = 3 yields

            L-1 8 s + 5 + s2 7+ 3 = 8L-1 1 s + 5 + 7L s2 -1 1+ 3

                                                   -1 1           7 -1     3

Example 8.2.3 Find

                        L s2 -1 3s + 8 + 2s + 5 .

Solution Completing the square in the denominator yields

                        3s + 8                    =  3s + 8
                                                             2.
                        s2 + 2s + 5 (s + 1) + 4

Because of the form of the denominator, we consider the transform pairs

           e-t cos 2t  (s + 1)2 s + 1+ 4 and e-t sin 2t  (s + 1)2 2 + 4 ,

and write

           L (s + 1)2 -1 3s + 8+ 4 = L (s + 1)2 -1 3s + 3+ 4 + L (s + 1)2 -1 5 + 4

                        = 3L (s + 1)2 -1 s + 1+ 4 + 52 L (s + 1)2 -1 2 + 4

                                            = e-t(3 cos 2t + 5 sin 2t).
                                                                     2

REMARK: We'll often write inverse Laplace transforms of specific functions without explicitly stating
how they are obtained. In such cases you should refer to the table of Laplace transforms in Section 8.8.

Inverse Laplace Transforms of Rational Functions

Using the Laplace transform to solve differential equations often requires finding the inverse transform

of a rational function  F (s) = P (s) ,
                                  Q(s)

where P and Q are polynomials in s with no common factors. Since it can be shown that lims F (s) =
0 if F is a Laplace transform, we need only consider the case where degree(P ) < degree(Q). To obtain
L-1(F ), we find the partial fraction expansion of F , obtain inverse transforms of the individual terms in
the expansion from the table of Laplace transforms, and use the linearity property of the inverse transform.

The next two examples illustrate this.

Example 8.2.4 Find the inverse Laplace transform of

                        F (s) = 2                    3s + 2  .                      (8.2.1)

                                s - 3s + 2

Solution (METHOD 1) Factoring the denominator in (8.2.1) yields                     (8.2.2)
                                                F (s) = 3s + 2 .                    (8.2.3)
                                                           (s - 1)(s - 2)

The form for the partial fraction expansion is
                                               3s + 2 = A + B .

                                          (s - 1)(s - 2) s - 1 s - 2
408 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Multiplying this by (s - 1)(s - 2) yields

                       3s + 2 = (s - 2)A + (s - 1)B.

Setting s = 2 yields B = 8 and setting s = 1 yields A = -5. Therefore

                                  F (s) = - 5 + 8
                                              s-1 s-2

and               L-1(F ) = -5L-1 1 + 8L-1 1 = -5et + 8e2t.

                                           s-1   s-2

Solution (METHOD 2) We don't really have to multiply (8.2.3) by (s - 1)(s - 2) to compute A and
B. We can obtain A by simply ignoring the factor s - 1 in the denominator of (8.2.2) and setting s = 1

elsewhere; thus,

                       A = 3s + 2 = 3  1 + 2 = -5.                                      (8.2.4)
                              s - 2 s=1 1 - 2

Similarly, we can obtain B by ignoring the factor s - 2 in the denominator of (8.2.2) and setting s = 2

elsewhere; thus,

                       B = 3s + 2 = 3  2 + 2 = 8.                                       (8.2.5)
                              s - 1 s=2 2 - 1

To justify this, we observe that multiplying (8.2.3) by s - 1 yields

                                  3s + 2 = A + (s - 1) B ,
                                  s-2            s-2

and setting s = 1 leads to (8.2.4). Similarly, multiplying (8.2.3) by s - 2 yields

                                  3s + 2 = (s - 2) A + B
                                  s-1           s-2

and setting s = 2 leads to (8.2.5). (It isn't necesary to write the last two equations. We wrote them only
to justify the shortcut procedure indicated in (8.2.4) and (8.2.5).)

   The shortcut employed in the second solution of Example 8.2.4 is Heaviside's method. The next theo-
rem states this method formally. For a proof and an extension of this theorem, see Exercise 10.

Theorem 8.2.2 Suppose

                       F (s) =                  P (s) ,                                  (8.2.6)
                                  (s - s1)(s - s2)    (s - sn)

where s1, s2, . . . , sn are distinct and P is a polynomial of degree less than n. Then

                       F (s) = A1 + A2 +    + An ,
                                  s - s1 s - s2        s - sn

where Ai can be computed from (8.2.6) by ignoring the factor s - si and setting s = si elsewhere.

Solution The partial fraction expansion of (8.2.7) is of the form

              F (s) = A + B + C + D .                                                 (8.2.8)
                        s s-1 s-2 s+1

To find A, we ignore the factor s in the denominator of (8.2.7) and set s = 0 elsewhere. This yields

                       A = 6 + (1)(11) = 17 .
                             (-1)(-2)(1) 2

Similarly, the other coefficients are given by

                       B = 6 + (2)(7) = -10,
                             (1)(-1)(2)

and                        C = 6 + 3(5) = 7 ,
Therefore                          2(1)(3) 2
and
                      D = 6 = -1.
                             (-1)(-2)(-3)

              F (s) = 17 1 - 10 + 7 1 - 1

           = 17 - 10et + 7 e2t - e-t.

REMARK: We didn't "multiply out" the numerator in (8.2.7) before computing the coefficients in (8.2.8),
since it wouldn't simplify the computations.

                    F (s) = A + B +                                  C                (8.2.10)
                                                                          2.
                          s + 1 s + 2 (s + 2)

Because of the repeated factor (s + 2)2 in (8.2.9), Heaviside's method doesn't work. Instead, we find a
common denominator in (8.2.10). This yields

           F (s) =  A(s + 2)2 + B(s + 1)(s + 2) + C(s + 1)                    .       (8.2.11)

                                                    (s + 1)(s + 2)2

If (8.2.9) and (8.2.11) are to be equivalent, then

           A(s + 2)2 + B(s + 1)(s + 2) + C(s + 1) = 8 - (s + 2)(4s + 10).             (8.2.12)
410 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

The two sides of this equation are polynomials of degree two. From a theorem of algebra, they will be
equal for all s if they are equal for any three distinct values of s. We may determine A, B and C by
choosing convenient values of s.

   The left side of (8.2.12) suggests that we take s = -2 to obtain C = -8, and s = -1 to obtain A = 2.
We can now choose any third value of s to determine B. Taking s = 0 yields 4A + 2B + C = -12.
Since A = 2 and C = -8 this implies that B = -6. Therefore

           F (s) =                   2        -      6      -      8

                                     F (s) =  s2 - 5s + 7

                                                 (s + 2)

Solution The form for the partial fraction expansion is

           F (s) = A +                           B                    C
                                                      2+                   3.
                                     s + 2 (s + 2) (s + 2)

The easiest way to obtain A, B, and C is to expand the numerator in powers of s + 2. This yields
              s2 - 5s + 7 = [(s + 2) - 2]2 - 5[(s + 2) - 2] + 7 = (s + 2)2 - 9(s + 2) + 21.

Therefore

           F (s) =                   (s + 2)2 - 9(s + 2) + 21

                                                 (s + 2)       3

                                  =  1        -          9     2+     21

Solution One form for the partial fraction expansion of F is

                                                  A Bs + C
                                     F (s) = +                  2.                   (8.2.14)
                                                  s (s + 1) + 1

However, we see from the table of Laplace transforms that the inverse transform of the second fraction
on the right of (8.2.14) will be a linear combination of the inverse transforms

                                               e-t cos t and e-t sin t

of                                                                  1
                                             s + 1 and       (s + 1)2 + 1

                                         (s + 1)2 + 1
respectively. Therefore, instead of (8.2.14) we write

                                               A B(s + 1) + C
                                     F (s) = +                           .           (8.2.15)
                                               s (s + 1) + 1    2

Finding a common denominator yields

                            F (s) =  A (s + 1)2 + 1 + B(s + 1)s + Cs
                                                  s [(s + 1)2 + 1] .                 (8.2.16)

If (8.2.13) and (8.2.16) are to be equivalent, then
                             A (s + 1)2 + 1 + B(s + 1)s + Cs = 1 - s(5 + 3s).

This is true for all s if it's true for three distinct values of s. Choosing s = 0, -1, and 1 yields the system

                                                  2A = 1
                                              A-C = 3
                                     5A + 2B + C = -7.

Solving this system yields           A = 1,      B = -7,     C = -5.
Hence, from (8.2.15),                       2             2           2

                            F (s)  = 1 -7          s+1       -     5        1  2.

Therefore

           L-1(F ) = 12 L-1 1s - 72 L (s + 1)2 -1 s + 1+ 1 - 52 L (s + 1)2 -1 1 + 1

           = 1 - 7 e-t cos t - 5 e-t sin t.

412 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Solution The form for the partial fraction expansion is

                                                A + Bs C + Ds          .
                                   F (s) = 2            +2
                                                s +1 s +4

The coefficients A, B, C and D can be obtained by finding a common denominator and equating the
resulting numerator to the numerator in (8.2.17). However, since there's no first power of s in the denom-
inator of (8.2.17), there's an easier way: the expansion of

                                        F1(s) = 2        1

                                                   (s + 1)(s + 4)2

can be obtained quickly by using Heaviside's method to expand

                                   1 =1 1 - 1
                           (x + 1)(x + 4) 3 x + 1 x + 4

and then setting x = s2 to obtain

                                   1               11                     1
                           (s2 + 1)(s2 + 4) = 3 s2 + 1 - s2 + 4 .

Multiplying this by 8 + 3s yields

                                        8 + 3s       =  1 8 + 3s 8 + 3s
                     F (s) = 2                                         -2          .
                                   (s + 1)(s + 4) 3 s + 1 s + 422

Therefore                  L-1(F ) = 8 sin t + cos t - 4 sin 2t - cos 2t.

 USING TECHNOLOGY

   Some software packages that do symbolic algebra can find partial fraction expansions very easily. We
recommend that you use such a package if one is available to you, but only after you've done enough
partial fraction expansions on your own to master the technique.

8.3 SOLUTION OF INITIAL VALUE PROBLEMS

Laplace Transforms of Derivatives

In the rest of this chapter we'll use the Laplace transform to solve initial value problems for constant
coefficient second order equations. To do this, we must know how the Laplace transform of f is related
to the Laplace transform of f. The next theorem answers this question.

Theorem 8.3.1 Suppose f is continuous on [0, ) and of exponential order s0, and f is piecewise
continuous on [0, ). Then f and f have Laplace transforms for s > s0, and

                                   L(f ) = sL(f) - f(0).                                      (8.3.1)

Proof

   We know from Theorem 8.1.6 that L(f) is defined for s > s0. We first consider the case where f is
continuous on [0, ). Integration by parts yields

          T                               T              T
               e-stf (t) dt = e-stf(t) + s e-stf(t) dt
       0 00 T
                                                                                              (8.3.2)

                                   = e-sT f(T ) - f(0) + s e-stf(t) dt

                                                              0

for any T > 0. Since f is of exponential order s0, limT  e-sT f(T ) = 0 and the last integral in (8.3.2)
converges as T   if s > s0. Therefore

                                                            

                    e-stf (t) dt = -f(0) + s e-stf(t) dt

               0                                         0

                                          = -f(0) + sL(f),
                                               Section 8.3 Solution of Initial Value Problems 415

which proves (8.3.1). Now suppose T > 0 and f is only piecewise continuous on [0, T ], with discon-
tinuities at t1 < t2 <    < tn-1. For convenience, let t0 = 0 and tn = T . Integrating by parts
yields

           ti e-stf (t) dt = e-stf (t) ti ti + s e-stf (t) dt
                                               ti-1
           ti-1                                      ti-1

                          = e-sti f (ti) - e-sti-1 f (ti-1) + s               ti      e-stf(t) dt.

                                                                              ti-1

Summing both sides of this equation from i = 1 to n and noting that

e-st1 f (t1) - e-st0 f (t0) + e-st2 f (t2) - e-st1 f (t1) +    + e-stN f (tN ) - e-stN-1 f (tN-1)

                                = e-stN f (tN ) - e-st0 f (t0) = e-sT f (T ) - f (0)
yields (8.3.2), so (8.3.1) follows as before.

Example 8.3.1 In Example 8.1.4 we saw that
                                                                      s

                                                 L(cos t) = 2 2 .
                                                                  s +

Applying (8.3.1) with f(t) = cos t shows that

                                               s                         2
                          L(- sin t) = s 2 2 - 1 = - 2 2 .
                                               s +                       s +

Therefore                                     
                          L(sin t) = 2 2 ,

                                          s +

which agrees with the corresponding result obtained in 8.1.4.

In Section 2.1 we showed that the solution of the initial value problem

                          y = ay, y(0) = y0,                                                        (8.3.3)

is y = y0eat. We'll now obtain this result by using the Laplace transform.
   Let Y (s) = L(y) be the Laplace transform of the unknown solution of (8.3.3). Taking Laplace trans-

forms of both sides of (8.3.3) yields
                                                     L(y ) = L(ay),

which, by Theorem 8.3.1, can be rewritten as

                          sL(y) - y(0) = aL(y),

or
                                                 sY (s) - y0 = aY (s).

Solving for Y (s) yields  Y (s) = y0 ,
                                    s-a

so                                                                         1  = y0eat,
                        y = L-1(Y (s)) = L-1 y0 = y0L-1                  s-a
                                                        s-a

which agrees with the known result.
   We need the next theorem to solve second order differential equations using the Laplace transform.
416 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Theorem 8.3.2 Suppose f and f are continuous on [0, ) and of exponential order s0, and that f is
piecewise continuous on [0, ). Then f, f , and f have Laplace transforms for s > s0,

                                  L(f ) = sL(f) - f(0),                                          (8.3.4)

and

                     L(f ) = s2L(f) - f (0) - sf(0).                                             (8.3.5)

Proof Theorem 8.3.1 implies that L(f ) exists and satisfies (8.3.4) for s > s0. To prove that L(f )
exists and satisfies (8.3.5) for s > s0, we first apply Theorem 8.3.1 to g = f . Since g satisfies the
hypotheses of Theorem 8.3.1, we conclude that L(g ) is defined and satisfies

                                  L(g ) = sL(g) - g(0)

for s > s0. However, since g = f , this can be rewritten as

                                  L(f ) = sL(f ) - f (0).

Substituting (8.3.4) into this yields (8.3.5).
Solving Second Order Equations with the Laplace Transform
We'll now use the Laplace transform to solve initial value problems for second order equations.

Example 8.3.2 Use the Laplace transform to solve the initial value problem                       (8.3.6)
                                 y - 6y + 5y = 3e2t, y(0) = 2, y (0) = 3.

Solution Taking Laplace transforms of both sides of the differential equation in (8.3.6) yields

                     L(y - 6y + 5y) = L 3e2t = 3 ,
                                                              s-2

which we rewrite as  L(y ) - 6L(y ) + 5L(y) = 3 .
                                                        s-2
                                                                                                 (8.3.7)
Now denote L(y) = Y (s). Theorem 8.3.2 and the initial conditions in (8.3.6) imply that          (8.3.8)

                     L(y ) = sY (s) - y(0) = sY (s) - 2

and
                             L(y ) = s2Y (s) - y (0) - sy(0) = s2Y (s) - 3 - 2s.

Substituting from the last two equations into (8.3.7) yields

                     s2Y (s) - 3 - 2s - 6 (sY (s) - 2) + 5Y (s) = 3 .
                                                                               s-2

Therefore            (s2 - 6s + 5)Y (s) = 3 + (3 + 2s) + 6(-2),
so                                              s-2

                        (s - 5)(s - 1)Y (s) = 3 + (s - 2)(2s - 9),
                                                             s-2
                                                 Section 8.3 Solution of Initial Value Problems 417

and
                                            Y (s) = 3 + (s - 2)(2s - 9) .
                                                      (s - 2)(s - 5)(s - 1)

Heaviside's method yields the partial fraction expansion

Y (s) = - 1 + 1 1 + 5 1 ,
            s-2 2s-5 2s-1

and taking the inverse transform of this yields

y = -e2t + 1 e5t + 5 et
                                                 2  2

as the solution of (8.3.6).
   It isn't necessary to write all the steps that we used to obtain (8.3.8). To see how to avoid this, let's

apply the method of Example 8.3.2 to the general initial value problem

ay + by + cy = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1.                                             (8.3.9)

Taking Laplace transforms of both sides of the differential equation in (8.3.9) yields

aL(y ) + bL(y ) + cL(y) = F (s).                                                        (8.3.10)

Now let Y (s) = L(y). Theorem 8.3.2 and the initial conditions in (8.3.9) imply that
                           L(y ) = sY (s) - k0 and L(y ) = s2Y (s) - k1 - k0s.

Substituting these into (8.3.10) yields                                                 (8.3.11)
                          a s2Y (s) - k1 - k0s + b (sY (s) - k0) + cY (s) = F (s).

The coefficient of Y (s) on the left is the characteristic polynomial
                                                  p(s) = as2 + bs + c

of the complementary equation for (8.3.9). Using this and moving the terms involving k0 and k1 to the
right side of (8.3.11) yields

p(s)Y (s) = F (s) + a(k1 + k0s) + bk0.                                                  (8.3.12)

This equation corresponds to (8.3.8) of Example 8.3.2. Having established the form of this equation in
the general case, it is preferable to go directly from the initial value problem to this equation. You may
find it easier to remember (8.3.12) rewritten as

p(s)Y (s) = F (s) + a (y (0) + sy(0)) + by(0).                                          (8.3.13)

Example 8.3.3 Use the Laplace transform to solve the initial value problem

2y + 3y + y = 8e-2t, y(0) = -4, y (0) = 2.                                              (8.3.14)

Solution The characteristic polynomial is
                                      p(s) = 2s2 + 3s + 1 = (2s + 1)(s + 1)
418 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

and
                                              F (s) = L(8e-2t) = 8 ,
                                                                        s+2

so (8.3.13) becomes       (2s + 1)(s + 1)Y (s) = 8 + 2(2 - 4s) + 3(-4).
                                                        s+2

Solving for Y (s) yields

                                   Y (s) = 4 (1 - (s + 2)(s + 1)) .
                                             (s + 1/2)(s + 1)(s + 2)

Heaviside's method yields the partial fraction expansion

                                   Y (s) = 4 1 - 8 + 8 1 ,
                                             3 s + 1/2 s + 1 3 s + 2

so the solution of (8.3.14) is

                                y = L-1(Y (s)) = 4 e-t/2 - 8e-t + 8 e-2t

Solution The characteristic polynomial is
                                         p(s) = s2 + 2s + 2 = (s + 1)2 + 1

and

                                                                        s

so (8.3.13) becomes       (s + 1)2 + 1 Y (s) = 1 + 1  (1 - 3s) + 2(-3).
                                                      s

Solving for Y (s) yields

                          Y (s) =  1 - s(5 + 3s)                    .

                                   s [(s + 1) + 1]            2

In Example 8.2.8 we found the inverse transform of this function to be

                          y = 1 - 7 e-t cos t - 5 e-t sin t
                          22                                     2

(Figure 8.3.2), which is therefore the solution of (8.3.15).

REMARK: In our examples we applied Theorems 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 without verifying that the unknown
function y satisfies their hypotheses. This is characteristic of the formal manipulative way in which the
Laplace transform is used to solve differential equations. Any doubts about the validity of the method for
solving a given equation can be resolved by verifying that the resulting function y is the solution of the
given problem.

8.4 THE UNIT STEP FUNCTION

In the next section we'll consider initial value problems

                               ay + by + cy = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1,
where a, b, and c are constants and f is piecewise continuous. In this section we'll develop procedures
for using the table of Laplace transforms to find Laplace transforms of piecewise continuous functions,
and to find the piecewise continuous inverses of Laplace transforms.
                                                               Section 8.4 The Unit Step Function 421

Example 8.4.1 Use the table of Laplace transforms to find the Laplace transform of

                                f(t) =   2t + 1, 0  t < 2,                          (8.4.1)
                                           3t, t  2

(Figure 8.4.1).

Solution Since the formula for f changes at t = 2, we write

                           L(f) =                                                   (8.4.2)
                                    =
                                             e-stf(t) dt           e-st(3t) dt.

                                         02                    2

                                            e-st(2t + 1) dt +

                                         0

To relate the first term to a Laplace transform, we add and subtract

                                          

                                             e-st(2t + 1) dt

                                         2

in (8.4.2) to obtain

                                                             

                      L(f) =             e-st(2t + 1) dt + e-st(3t - 2t - 1) dt

                                0                    2

                             =           e-st(2t + 1) dt + e-st(t - 1) dt           (8.4.3)

                             = L(2t + 1) + e-st(t - 1) dt.

                                         2

To relate the last integral to a Laplace transform, we make the change of variable x = t - 2 and rewrite
the integral as

                                                      

                                 e-st(t - 1) dt =        e-s(x+2)(x + 1) dx

                             2                       0

                                                              

                                         = e-2s e-sx(x + 1) dx.

                                                            0

Since the symbol used for the variable of integration has no effect on the value of a definite integral, we
can now replace x by the more standard t and write

                                                   

                           e-st(t - 1) dt = e-2s e-st(t + 1) dt = e-2sL(t + 1).

                      2                  0

This and (8.4.3) imply that

                                L(f) = L(2t + 1) + e-2sL(t + 1).

Now we can use the table of Laplace transforms to find that

                                L(f) = s22 + 1s + e s2 -2s 1 + 1s .

Laplace Transforms of Piecewise Continuous Functions

We'll now develop the method of Example 8.4.1 into a systematic way to find the Laplace transform of a
piecewise continuous function. It is convenient to introduce the unit step function, defined as

                                  u(t) =              0, t < 0                             (8.4.4)
                                                      1, t  0.

Thus, u(t) "steps" from the constant value 0 to the constant value 1 at t = 0. If we replace t by t -  in

(8.4.4), then

                                  u(t -  ) =          0, t < , ;
                                                      1, t  

that is, the step now occurs at t =  (Figure 8.4.2).

The step function enables us to represent piecewise continuous functions conveniently. For example,

consider the function

                             f(t) =     f0(t), 0  t < t1,                                  (8.4.5)
                                        f1(t), t  t1,

where we assume that f0 and f1 are defined on [0, ), even though they equal f only on the indicated
intervals. This assumption enables us to rewrite (8.4.5) as

                          f(t) = f0(t) + u(t - t1) (f1(t) - f0(t)) .                       (8.4.6)

To verify this, note that if t < t1 then u(t - t1) = 0 and (8.4.6) becomes

                          f(t) = f0(t) + (0) (f1(t) - f0(t)) = f0(t).

If t  t1 then u(t - t1) = 1 and (8.4.6) becomes

                          f(t) = f0(t) + (1) (f1(t) - f0(t)) = f1(t).

We need the next theorem to show how (8.4.6) can be used to find L(f).
                                                Section 8.4 The Unit Step Function 423

Theorem 8.4.1 Let g be defined on [0, ). Suppose   0 and L (g(t +  )) exists for s > s0. Then
L (u(t -  )g(t)) exists for s > s0, and

                                        L(u(t -  )g(t)) = e-s L (g(t +  )) .

Proof By definition,                             

                            L (u(t -  )g(t)) =      e-stu(t -  )g(t) dt.

                                                0

From this and the definition of u(t -  ),

                                                                   

                      L (u(t -  )g(t)) = e-st(0) dt + e-stg(t) dt.

                                           0                     

The first integral on the right equals zero. Introducing the new variable of integration x = t -  in the
second integral yields

                                                                               

L (u(t -  )g(t)) =               e-s(x+)g(x +  ) dx = e-s                        e-sxg(x +  ) dx.

                            0                                               0

Changing the name of the variable of integration in the last integral from x to t yields

                                                

L (u(t -  )g(t)) = e-s e-stg(t +  ) dt = e-s L(g(t +  )).

                                              0

Example 8.4.2 Find

                                           L u(t - 1)(t2 + 1) .

Solution Here  = 1 and g(t) = t2 + 1, so
                                       g(t + 1) = (t + 1)2 + 1 = t2 + 2t + 2.

Since                                              2 22
Theorem 8.4.1 implies that     L (g(t + 1)) = 3 + 2 + ,

                                                  sss

                            L u(t - 1)(t2 + 1) = e s3 -s 2 + s22 + 2s .

Example 8.4.3 Use Theorem 8.4.1 to find the Laplace transform of the function

                               f(t) =      2t + 1, 0  t < 2,
                                             3t, t  2,

from Example 8.4.1.

Solution We first write f in the form (8.4.6) as
                                          f(t) = 2t + 1 + u(t - 2)(t - 1).
424 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Therefore

                 L(f) = L(2t + 1) + L (u(t - 2)(t - 1))
                          = L(2t + 1) + e-2sL(t + 1) (from Theorem 8.4.1)
                          = s22 + 1s + e s2 -2s 1 + 1s ,

which is the result obtained in Example 8.4.1.

Formula (8.4.6) can be extended to more general piecewise continuous functions. For example, we can

write                                                   0  t < t1,
                                        f0(t),          t1  t < t2,
                              f(t) = f1(t),

                                              f2(t), t  t2,

as
                     f(t) = f0(t) + u(t - t1) (f1(t) - f0(t)) + u(t - t2) (f2(t) - f1(t))

if f0, f1, and f2 are all defined on [0, ).

                              f(t) =          -2t + 1,  3  t < 5,                          (8.4.7)

                                              t - 1,

(Figure 8.4.3).

Solution In terms of step functions,

                 f(t) = 1 + u(t - 2)(-2t + 1 - 1) + u(t - 3)(3t + 2t - 1)
                              +u(t - 5)(t - 1 - 3t),

or
                        f(t) = 1 - 2u(t - 2)t + u(t - 3)(5t - 1) - u(t - 5)(2t + 1).

Now Theorem 8.4.1 implies that

            L(f) = L(1) - 2e-2sL(t + 2) + e-3sL (5(t + 3) - 1) - e-5sL (2(t + 5) + 1)
                     = L(1) - 2e-2sL(t + 2) + e-3sL(5t + 14) - e-5sL(2t + 11)
                     = 1s - 2e s2 -2s 1 + 2s + e s2 -3s 5 + 14s - e s2 -5s 2 + 11s .

The trigonometric identities

                 sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B                                    (8.4.8)
                 cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B                                    (8.4.9)

are useful in problems that involve shifting the arguments of trigonometric functions. We'll use these
identities in the next example.

Solution In terms of step functions,

                 f(t) = sin t + u(t - /2)(cos t - 4 sin t) + u(t - )(2 cos t + 3 sin t).

Now Theorem 8.4.1 implies that

                    L(f )     =  L(sin   t)  +  e-     sL  cos  t + 2  - 4 sin t + 2

                                         +e-sL (2 cos(t + ) + 3 sin(t + )) .

Since                      cos t +  - 4 sin t +  = - sin t - 4 cos t
                                      2                    2
and
we see from (8.4.11) that  2 cos(t + ) + 3 sin(t + ) = -2 cos t - 3 sin t,

                  L(f) =   L(sin t) - e-s/2L(sin t + 4 cos t) - e-sL(2 cos t + 3 sin t)

                    = s2 1+ 1 - e s2 - 2 s 1 + 4s + 1 - e s2 -s 3 + 2s + 1 .

The Second Shifting Theorem
Replacing g(t) by g(t -  ) in Theorem 8.4.1 yields the next theorem.

Theorem 8.4.2 [Second Shifting Theorem] If   0 and L(g) exists for s > s0 then L (u(t -  )g(t -  ))

exists for s > s0 and     L(u(t -  )g(t -  )) = e-s L(g(t)),

or, equivalently,

                       if g(t)  G(s), then u(t -  )g(t -  )  e-s G(s).             (8.4.12)

REMARK: Recall that the First Shifting Theorem (Theorem 8.1.3 states that multiplying a function by eat

corresponds to shifting the argument of its transform by a units. Theorem 8.4.2 states that multiplying a
Laplace transform by the exponential e-s corresponds to shifting the argument of the inverse transform
by  units.

Example 8.4.6 Use (8.4.12) to find

                                       L-1 e-2s .

Solution To apply (8.4.12) we let  = 2 and G(s) = 1/s2. Then g(t) = t and (8.4.12) implies that

and find distinct formulas for h on appropriate intervals.

Solution Let              1                         12                 41
Then          G0(s) = 2 ,               G1(s) = 2 + ,      G2(s) = 3 + .

                              g0(t) = t, g1(t) = t + 2, g2(t) = 2t2 + 1.

Hence, (8.4.12) and the linearity of L-1 imply that

              h(t) = L-1 (G0(s)) - L-1 e-sG1(s) + L-1 e-4sG2(s)
                      = t - u(t - 1) [(t - 1) + 2] + u(t - 4) 2(t - 4)2 + 1
                      = t - u(t - 1)(t + 1) + u(t - 4)(2t2 - 16t + 33),

which can also be written as

                                              t,           0  t < 1,

Solution Let                            2s                 (3s + 1)

                              G0(s) = 2 , G1(s) = - 2                    ,

and                                           s+1          (s + 3) - 2
                              G2(s) = 2

                                        s + 6s + 10 (s + 3) + 1

Then          g0(t) = 2 cos 2t, g1(t) = -3 cos 3t - 1 sin 3t,

                         g2(t) = e-3t(cos t - 2 sin t).

Therefore (8.4.12) and the linearity of L-1 imply that

              h(t) = 2 cos 2t - u(t - /2) 3 cos 3(t - /2) + 1 sin 3 t - 
                                                                      3                           2

428 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Using the trigonometric identities (8.4.8) and (8.4.9), we can rewrite this as

                        f(t) = fm(t), tm  t < tm+1 (m = 0, 1, . . . ).

Show that f is piecewise continuous on [0, ) and that it has the step function representation

8.5 CONSTANT COEEFFICIENT EQUATIONS WITH PIECEWISE CONTINUOUS FORCING FUNC-
TIONS

We'll now consider initial value problems of the form

ay + by + cy = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1,                                       (8.5.1)

where a, b, and c are constants (a = 0) and f is piecewise continuous on [0, ). Problems of this kind
occur in situations where the input to a physical system undergoes instantaneous changes, as when a
switch is turned on or off or the forces acting on the system change abruptly.

   It can be shown (Exercises 23 and 24) that the differential equation in (8.5.1) has no solutions on an
open interval that contains a jump discontinuity of f. Therefore we must define what we mean by a
solution of (8.5.1) on [0, ) in the case where f has jump discontinuities. The next theorem motivates
our definition. We omit the proof.
432 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Theorem 8.5.1 Suppose a, b, and c are constants (a = 0), and f is piecewise continuous on [0, ). with
jump discontinuities at t1, . . . , tn, where

                                  0 < t1 <    < tn.

Let k0 and k1 be arbitrary real numbers. Then there is a unique function y defined on [0, ) with these
properties:
(a) y(0) = k0 and y (0) = k1.
(b) y and y are continuous on [0, ).

(c) y is defined on every open subinterval of [0, ) that does not contain any of the points t1, . . . , tn,
      and
                                                    ay + by + cy = f(t)

      on every such subinterval.

(d) y has limits from the right and left at t1, . . . , tn.

   We define the function y of Theorem 8.5.1 to be the solution of the initial value problem (8.5.1).
   We begin by considering initial value problems of the form

       ay + by + cy =             f0(t), 0  t < t1,     y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1,      (8.5.2)
                                  f1(t), t  t1,

where the forcing function has a single jump discontinuity at t1.
   We can solve (8.5.2) by the these steps:

 Step 1. Find the solution y0 of the initial value problem

       ay + by + cy = f0(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1.

Step 2. Compute c0 = y0(t1) and c1 = y0(t1).                          y (t1) = c1.
Step 3. Find the solution y1 of the initial value problem

                                ay + by + cy = f1(t), y(t1) = c0,

Step 4. Obtain the solution y of (8.5.2) as         y0(t), 0  t < t1
                                                y=  y1(t), t  t1.

   It is shown in Exercise 23 that y exists and is continuous at t1. The next example illustrates this
procedure.

Example 8.5.1 Solve the initial value problem

       y + y = f(t), y(0) = 2, y (0) = -1,                                          (8.5.3)

where                                               0  t < ,

                                  f(t) =
                                            -1,     t 2.

Solution The initial value problem in Step 1 is

                                   y + y = 1, y(0) = 2, y (0) = -1.

We leave it to you to verify that its solution is

                                      y0 = 1 + cos t - sin t.

Doing Step 2 yields y0(/2) = 0 and y0(/2) = -1, so the second initial value problem is

       y + y = -1, y  = 0, y  = -1.
                                                   2                  2

We leave it to you to verify that the solution of this problem is

                                   y1 = -1 + cos t + sin t.

Hence, the solution of (8.5.3) is

                                                      0  t < ,                             (8.5.4)

             -1 + cos t + sin t,                      t 2

(Figure:8.5.1).
   If f0 and f1 are defined on [0, ), we can rewrite (8.5.2) as

ay + by + cy = f0(t) + u(t - t1) (f1(t) - f0(t)) , y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1,

and apply the method of Laplace transforms. We'll now solve the problem considered in Example 8.5.1
by this method.
434 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Example 8.5.2 Use the Laplace transform to solve the initial value problem

               y + y = f(t), y(0) = 2, y (0) = -1,                                         (8.5.5)

where                                               0  t < ,
                                              1,         2
                                    f(t) =
                                              -1,   t 2.

Solution Here                           f(t) = 1 - 2u t -  ,
                                                                 2

so Theorem 8.4.1 (with g(t) = 1) implies that

                                         L(f) = 1 - 2e-s/2 .
                                                          s

Therefore, transforming (8.5.5) yields

                                      (s2 + 1)Y (s) = 1 - 2e - 1 + 2s, -s/2                (8.5.6)
                                                                  s                        (8.5.7)

so
                                       Y (s) = (1 - 2e-s/2)G(s) + s2 2s - 1 + 1 ,

with
                                                                   1

                                                   G(s) = 2 .
                                                              s(s + 1)

The form for the partial fraction expansion of G is

                                         1          A Bs + C
                                                 = +2 .
                                        s(s2 + 1) s s + 1

Multiplying through by s(s2 + 1) yields

                                    A(s2 + 1) + (Bs + C)s = 1,

or
                                              (A + B)s2 + Cs + A = 1.

Equating coefficients of like powers of s on the two sides of this equation shows that A = 1, B = -A =

-1 and C = 0. Hence, from (8.5.7),               1  s

                                         G(s) = - 2 .
                                                 s s +1

Therefore

                                         g(t) = 1 - cos t.

From this, (8.5.6), and Theorem 8.4.2,

               y = 1 - cos t - 2u t -            1 - cos t -           + 2 cos t - sin t.

Simplifying this (recalling that cos(t - /2) = sin t) yields

               y = 1 + cos t - sin t - 2u t -  (1 - sin t),

                                                                 2

                     -1 + cos t + sin t,

which is the result obtained in Example 8.5.1.

REMARK: It isn't obvious that using the Laplace transform to solve (8.5.2) as we did in Example 8.5.2
yields a function y with the properties stated in Theorem 8.5.1; that is, such that y and y are continuous
on [0, ) and y has limits from the right and left at t1. However, this is true if f0 and f1 are continuous
and of exponential order on [0, ). A proof is sketched in Exercises 8.6.11-8.61. 3.

                                          =   1 e-s

Since transforming (8.5.8) yields                - 2.
                                             s2 s

               (s2 - 1)Y (s) = L(f) + 2 - s,

we see that    Y (s) = (1 - e-s)H(s) + s22 - s - 1 ,                                  (8.5.9)
where                                                                                (8.5.10)
                               1                           1           1

                                             s (s - 1) s - 1 s

therefore

                                             h(t) = sinh t - t.

Since          L s2 -1 2 - s - 1 = 2 sinh t - cosh t,

we conclude from (8.5.9), (8.5.10), and Theorem 8.4.1 that

               y = sinh t - t - u(t - 1) (sinh(t - 1) - t + 1) + 2 sinh t - cosh t,

or

               y = 3 sinh t - cosh t - t - u(t - 1) (sinh(t - 1) - t + 1)            (8.5.11)

We leave it to you to verify that y and y are continuous and y has limits from the right and left at t1 = 1.

Example 8.5.4 Solve the initial value problem

                               y + y = f(t), y(0) = 0, y (0) = 0,                              (8.5.12)

where                                               0 t < ,
                                                    4
                                              0,    4  t < ,
                                                    t  .

                                    f(t) = cos 2t,
                                             
                                              0,

Solution Here               f(t) = u(t - /4) cos 2t - u(t - ) cos 2t,
so

               L(f) = L (u(t - /4) cos 2t) - L (u(t - ) cos 2t)

                            = e-s/4L (cos 2(t + /4)) - e-sL (cos 2(t + ))

                            = -e-s/4L(sin 2t) - e-sL(cos 2t)

                                    2e-s/4 se-s
                            = -2             -2 .
                                    s +4 s +4

Since transforming (8.5.12) yields

                                          (s2 + 1)Y (s) = L(f),

we see that

                               Y (s) = e-s/4H1(s) + e-sH2(s),                                  (8.5.13)
                                                                                               (8.5.14)
where                               2                                        s

               H1(s) = - 2             2        and H2(s) = - 2                 2        .

To simplify the required partial fraction expansions, we first write

                                       1 =1 1 - 1 .
                               (x + 1)(x + 4) 3 x + 1 x + 4

Setting x = s2 and substituting the result in (8.5.14) yields

               21                         1                              1s        s
             H1(s) = - 2 - 2                    and H2(s) = - 2 - 2                         .

The inverse transforms are

               h1(t) = - 2 sin t + 1 sin 2t     and h2(t) = - 1 cos t + 1 cos 2t.

From (8.5.13) and Theorem 8.4.2,

                            y = u t -  h1 t -  + u(t - )h2(t - ).

8.6 CONVOLUTION
                                                                           Section 8.6 Convolution 441

In this section we consider the problem of finding the inverse Laplace transform of a product H(s) =
F (s)G(s), where F and G are the Laplace transforms of known functions f and g. To motivate our
interest in this problem, consider the initial value problem

                              ay + by + cy = f(t), y(0) = 0, y (0) = 0.

Taking Laplace transforms yields

                                       (as2 + bs + c)Y (s) = F (s),

so

                                            Y (s) = F (s)G(s),                          (8.6.1)

where                                                 1

                                            G(s) = 2                    .
                                            as + bs + c

    Until now wen't been interested in the factorization indicated in (8.6.1), since we dealt only with differ-

ential equations with specific forcing functions. Hence, we could simply do the indicated multiplication
in (8.6.1) and use the table of Laplace transforms to find y = L-1(Y ). However, this isn't possible if we

want a formula for y in terms of f, which may be unspecified.
   To motivate the formula for L-1(F G), consider the initial value problem

                                       y - ay = f(t), y(0) = 0,                         (8.6.2)

which we first solve without using the Laplace transform. The solution of the differential equation in

(8.6.2) is of the form y = ueat where       u = e-atf(t).

Integrating this from 0 to t and imposing the initial condition u(0) = y(0) = 0 yields

                                                        t

                                            u = e-a f( ) d.

                                                      0

Therefore                                 t                 t

                    y(t) = eat             e-a f( ) d =      ea(t-)f ( ) d.             (8.6.3)

                                       0                 0

    Now we'll use the Laplace transform to solve (8.6.2) and compare the result to (8.6.3). Taking Laplace

transforms in (8.6.2) yields

                                            (s - a)Y (s) = F (s),

so
                                                   Y (s) = F (s) 1 ,
                                                                   s-a

which implies that

                                       y(t) = L-1 F (s) 1 .                             (8.6.4)
                                                              s-a

If we now let g(t) = eat, so that

                                            G(s) = 1 ,
                                                      s-a

then (8.6.3) and (8.6.4) can be written as

                                                        t

                                       y(t) = f( )g(t -  ) d

                                                      0
442 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

and
                                                     y = L-1(F G),

respectively. Therefore

                                    L-1(F G) =      t                                 (8.6.5)

                                                     f( )g(t -  ) d

                                                   0

in this case.
   This motivates the next definition.

Definition 8.6.1 The convolution f  g of two functions f and g is defined by

                                                               t

                                    (f  g)(t) = f( )g(t -  ) d.

                                                             0

It can be shown (Exercise 6) that f  g = g  f; that is,

                                 t                        t

                                    f(t -  )g( ) d = f( )g(t -  ) d.

                              0                        0

   Eqn. (8.6.5) shows that L-1(F G) = f  g in the special case where g(t) = eat. This next theorem
states that this is true in general.

Theorem 8.6.2 [The Convolution Theorem] If L(f) = F and L(g) = G, then

                                           L(f  g) = F G.

   A complete proof of the convolution theorem is beyond the scope of this book. However, we'll assume
that f  g has a Laplace transform and verify the conclusion of the theorem in a purely computational
way. By the definition of the Laplace transform,

                                                                       t

L(f  g) = e-st(f  g)(t) dt = e-st f( )g(t -  ) d dt.

This iterated integral equals a double integral over the region shown in Figure 8.6.1. Reversing the order

of integration yields                                  

                           L(f  g) = f( ) e-stg(t -  ) dt d.                          (8.6.6)

                                        0            

However, the substitution x = t -  shows that

                                                   

                           e-stg(t -  ) dt =         e-s(x+)g(x) dx

                                                0

                                                          

                                        = e-s                e-sxg(x) dx = e-s G(s).

                                                       0

Substituting this into (8.6.6) and noting that G(s) is independent of  yields

Verify that L(f  g) = L(f)L(g), as implied by the convolution theorem.

Solution We first compute

                                  =

                                          a-b

Since                      eat  1 and ebt  1 ,
it follows that                      s-a             s-b

A Formula for the Solution of an Initial Value Problem

The convolution theorem provides a formula for the solution of an initial value problem for a linear
constant coefficient second order equation with an unspecified. The next three examples illustrate this.

Example 8.6.2 Find a formula for the solution of the initial value problem

           y - 2y + y = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1.                                      (8.6.7)

Solution Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.7) yields

           (s2 - 2s + 1)Y (s) = F (s) + (k1 + k0s) - 2k0.

Therefore

           Y (s) = (s - 1)2 1 F (s) + (s - 1)2 k1 + k0s - 2k0

                                      = (s - 1)2 1 F (s) + k0 s - 1 + (s - 1)2 k1 - k0 .

From the table of Laplace transforms,

           L-1 k0 s - 1 + (s - 1)2 k1 - k0 = et (k0 + (k1 - k0)t) .

Since      (s - 1)2 1  tet and F (s)  f(t),

the convolution theorem implies that

           L-1 (s - 1)2 1 F (s) =  e t  f(t -  ) d. 0

Therefore the solution of (8.6.7) is

                                                                     t

           y(t) = et (k0 + (k1 - k0)t) +  e f(t -  ) d.

                                                                   0

Example 8.6.3 Find a formula for the solution of the initial value problem

           y + 4y = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1.                                          (8.6.8)

Solution Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.8) yields

                                      (s2 + 4)Y (s) = F (s) + k1 + k0s.

Therefore  Y (s) = (s2 1+ 4) F (s) + s2 k1 + k0s + 4 .

From the table of Laplace transforms,

           L s2 -1 k1 + k0s + 4 = k0 cos 2t + k12 sin 2t.
                                                                       Section 8.6 Convolution 445

Since             1  1 sin 2t and
              (s2 + 4) 2
                                                          F (s)  f(t),

the convolution theorem implies that

              -1                      1          1t
           L                          2 F (s) =       f(t -  ) sin 2 d.
                  (s + 4)                        20

Therefore the solution of (8.6.8) is

           y(t) = k k 0 cos 2t + 1 sin 2t + 1 t f(t -  ) sin 2 d.
                                         2            20

Example 8.6.4 Find a formula for the solution of the initial value problem

           y + 2y + 2y = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1.                                     (8.6.9)

Solution Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.9) yields

              (s2 + 2s + 2)Y (s) = F (s) + k1 + k0s + 2k0.

Therefore

           Y (s) = (s + 1)2 1 + 1 F (s) + (s + 1)2 k1 + k0s + 2k0 + 1

                  = (s + 1)2 1 + 1 F (s) + (s + 1)2 (k1 + k0) + k0(s + 1) + 1 .

From the table of Laplace transforms,

           L (s + 1)2 -1 (k1 + k0) + k0(s + 1) + 1 = e-t ((k1 + k0) sin t + k0 cos t) .

Since      (s + 1)2 1 + 1  e-t sin t and

                                                          F (s)  f(t),

the convolution theorem implies that

                             L-1 (s + 1)2 1 + 1 F (s) = f(t -  )e- t  sin  d. 0
Therefore the solution of (8.6.9) is

                                                                                       t  (8.6.10)

           y(t) = e-t ((k1 + k0) sin t + k0 cos t) + f(t -  )e- sin  d.

                                                                                     0

Evaluating Convolution Integrals
We'll say that an integral of the form 0t u( )v(t -  ) d is a convolution integral. The convolution
theorem provides a convenient way to evaluate convolution integrals.

Example 8.6.5 Evaluate the convolution integral

                                                                                      t

                                                h(t) = (t -  )5 7d.

                                                                                    0

Solution We could evaluate this integral by expanding (t -  )5 in powers of  and then integrating.
However, the convolution theorem provides an easier way. The integral is the convolution of f(t) = t5
and g(t) = t7. Since

                                              t5  s6 5! and t7  s8 7! ,

the convolution theorem implies that

                                            5!7! 5!7! 13!
                                      h(t)  14 =               14 ,
                                            s             13! s

where we have written the second equality because

                                            s14 13!  t13.

Hence,                                   h(t) = 5!7! t13.
                                                   13!

Example 8.6.6 Use the convolution theorem and a partial fraction expansion to evaluate the convolution

integral

                                                                   t

                                  h(t) = sin a(t -  ) cos b d (|a| = |b|).

                                                                 0

Solution Since                        a                                                     s

                             sin at  2 2 and cos bt  2 2 ,
                                      s +a                                               s +b

the convolution theorem implies that

                                                   a       s
                                      H(s) = 2 2 2 2 .
                                            s +a s +b

Expanding this in a partial fraction expansion yields

                                           a           s                                 s
                             H(s) = 2 2            2 2- 2 2 .
                                      b -a s +a s +b

Therefore                                 a
                             h(t) = 2 2 (cos at - cos bt) .

Volterra Integral Equations
An equation of the form

is a Volterra integral equation. Here f and k are given functions and y is unknown. Since the integral
on the right is a convolution integral, the convolution theorem provides a convenient formula for solving
(8.6.11). Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.11) yields

                                   Y (s) = F (s) + K(s)Y (s),

and solving this for Y (s) yields

                                   Y (s) = F (s) .
                                             1 - K(s)

We then obtain the solution of (8.6.11) as y = L-1(Y ).

Example 8.6.7 Solve the integral equation                                                  (8.6.12)

                                                                                        t

                                          y(t) = 1 + 2 e-2(t-)y( ) d.

                                                                                      0

Solution Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.12) yields

                                   Y (s) = 1 + 2 Y (s),
                                             s s+2

and solving this for Y (s) yields            12
Hence,                             Y (s) = + 2 .

                                    y(t) = 1 + 2t.

Transfer Functions
The next theorem presents a formula for the solution of the general initial value problem

                               ay + by + cy = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1,

where we assume for simplicity that f is continuous on [0, ) and that L(f) exists. In Exercises 11-14
it's shown that the formula is valid under much weaker conditions on f.

Theorem 8.6.3 Suppose f is continuous on [0, ) and has a Laplace transform. Then the solution of the

initial value problem

                         ay + by + cy = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1,                       (8.6.13)

is                                                                             t           (8.6.14)
where y1 and y2 satisfy
                         y(t) = k0y1(t) + k1y2(t) + w( )f(t -  ) d,

                                                                             0

                         ay1 + by1 + cy1 = 0, y1(0) = 1, y1(0) = 0,                        (8.6.15)

and

                         ay2 + by2 + cy2 = 0, y2(0) = 0, y2(0) = 1,                        (8.6.16)

and                                w(t) = 1 y2(t).

448 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

Proof Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.13) yields

                  p(s)Y (s) = F (s) + a(k1 + k0s) + bk0,

where

                                     p(s) = as2 + bs + c.

Hence,

                                     Y (s) = W (s)F (s) + V (s)                      (8.6.18)
                                                                                     (8.6.19)
with                                                                                 (8.6.20)
                                                      W (s) = 1
                                                                  p(s)

and
                                              V (s) = a(k1 + k0s) + bk0 .
                                                                 p(s)

Taking Laplace transforms in (8.6.15) and (8.6.16) shows that

                  p(s)Y1(s) = as + b and p(s)Y2(s) = a.

Therefore                            Y1(s) = as + b                                  (8.6.21)
and                                              p(s)
Hence, (8.6.20) can be rewritten as
                                     Y2(s) = a .
                                                 p(s)

                                     V (s) = k0Y1(s) + k1Y2(s).

Substituting this into (8.6.18) yields

                                    Y (s) = k0Y1(s) + k1Y2(s) + 1 Y2(s)F (s).
                                                                          a

Taking inverse transforms and invoking the convolution theorem yields (8.6.14). Finally, (8.6.19) and
(8.6.21) imply (8.6.17).

   It is useful to note from (8.6.14) that y is of the form

                                     y = v + h,

where

                                     v(t) = k0y1(t) + k1y2(t)

depends on the initial conditions and is independent of the forcing function, while

                                                      t

                                     h(t) = w( )f(t -  ) d

                                                    0

depends on the forcing function and is independent of the initial conditions. If the zeros of the character-

istic polynomial

                                     p(s) = as2 + bs + c

of the complementary equation have negative real parts, then y1 and y2 both approach zero as t  ,
so limt v(t) = 0 for any choice of initial conditions. Moreover, the value of h(t) is essentially
                                                                         Section 8.6 Convolution 449

independent of the values of f(t -  ) for large  , since lim w( ) = 0. In this case we say that v and
h are transient and steady state components, respectively, of the solution y of (8.6.13). These definitions
apply to the initial value problem of Example 8.6.4, where the zeros of

                                         p(s) = s2 + 2s + 2 = (s + 1)2 + 1

are -1  i. From (8.6.10), we see that the solution of the general initial value problem of Example 8.6.4

is y = v + h, where          v(t) = e-t ((k1 + k0) sin t + k0 cos t)

is the transient component of the solution and

                                              t

                             h(t) = f(t -  )e- sin  d

                                            0

is the steady state component. The definitions don't apply to the initial value problems considered in
Examples 8.6.2 and 8.6.3, since the zeros of the characteristic polynomials in these two examples don't
have negative real parts.

   In physical applications where the input f and the output y of a device are related by (8.6.13), the
zeros of the characteristic polynomial usually do have negative real parts. Then W = L(w) is called the
transfer function of the device. Since

                                   H(s) = W (s)F (s),

we see that                        W (s) = H(s)
                                              F (s)

is the ratio of the transform of the steady state output to the transform of the input.

   Because of the form of t
                                             h(t) = w( )f(t -  ) d,

                                                                                 0

w is sometimes called the weighting function of the device, since it assigns weights to past values of the
input f. It is also called the impulse response of the device, for reasons discussed in the next section.

   Formula (8.6.14) is given in more detail in Exercises 8-10 for the three possible cases where the zeros
of p(s) are real and distinct, real and repeated, or complex conjugates, respectively.

8.7 CONSTANT COEFFICIENT EQUATIONS WITH IMPULSES
So far in this chapter, we've considered initial value problems for the constant coefficient equation

                                                ay + by + cy = f(t),
454 Chapter 8 Laplace Transforms

where f is continuous or piecewise continuous on [0, ). In this section we consider initial value prob-
lems where f represents a force that's very large for a short time and zero otherwise. We say that such
forces are impulsive. Impulsive forces occur, for example, when two objects collide. Since it isn't feasible
to represent such forces as continuous or piecewise continuous functions, we must construct a different
mathematical model to deal with them.

   If f is an integrable function and f(t) = 0 for t outside of the interval [t0, t0 + h], then t0t0+h f(t) dt
is called the total impulse of f. We're interested in the idealized situation where h is so small that the
total impulse can be assumed to be applied instantaneously at t = t0. We say in this case that f is an
impulse function. In particular, we denote by (t - t0) the impulse function with total impulse equal to
one, applied at t = t0. (The impulse function (t) obtained by setting t0 = 0 is the Dirac  function.) It
must be understood, however, that (t - t0) isn't a function in the standard sense, since our "definition"
implies that (t - t0) = 0 if t = t0, while

                                                                            t0

                                                       (t - t0) dt = 1.

                                                                          t0

From calculus we know that no function can have these properties; nevertheless, there's a branch of
mathematics known as the theory of distributions where the definition can be made rigorous. Since the
theory of distributions is beyond the scope of this book, we'll take an intuitive approach to impulse
functions.

   Our first task is to define what we mean by the solution of the initial value problem

         ay + by + cy = (t - t0), y(0) = 0, y (0) = 0,

where t0 is a fixed nonnegative number. The next theorem will motivate our definition.

Theorem 8.7.1 Suppose t0  0. For each positive number h, let yh be the solution of the initial value

problem

         ayh + byh + cyh = fh(t), yh(0) = 0, yh(0) = 0,                                       (8.7.1)

where              
                    0,
                                      0  t < t0,                                              (8.7.2)
                                      t0  t < t0 + h,
         fh(t) = 1/h,                 t  t0 + h,

                   
                    0,

so fh has unit total impulse equal to the area of the shaded rectangle in Figure 8.7.1. Then

          lim yh(t) = u(t - t0)w(t - t0),                                                     (8.7.3)

         h0+

where                                 w = L as2 -1 1 + bs + c .

Proof    Taking Laplace transforms in (8.7.1) yields
                                           (as2 + bs + c)Yh(s) = Fh(s),

so                                    Yh(s) = as2Fh(s) + bs + c .

Since yh(t) = 0 for all h if 0  t  t0, it follows that

Since                                     1 t0+h d = 1,
we can write                              h t0

From this and (8.7.7),

                        yh(t) - w(t - t0) =  1 t0+h    (w(t -  ) - w(t - t0)) d.

                                             h t0

Therefore                                     1 t0+h

Now let Mh be the maximum value of |w(t -  ) - w(t - t0)| as  varies over the interval [t0, t0 + h].
(Remember that t and t0 are fixed.) Then (8.7.8) and (8.7.9) imply that

                                                    1 t0+h
                        |yh(t) - w(t - t0)|  Mh             d = Mh.               (8.7.10)

                                                       t0

But limh0+ Mh = 0, since w is continuous. Therefore (8.7.10) implies (8.7.6). This and (8.7.5) imply
(8.7.3).

   Theorem 8.7.1 motivates the next definition.

Definition 8.7.2 If t0 > 0, then the solution of the initial value problem

                        ay + by + cy = (t - t0), y(0) = 0, y (0) = 0,             (8.7.11)

is defined to be                    y = u(t - t0)w(t - t0),
where                             w = L as2 -1 1 + bs + c .

   In physical applications where the input f and the output y of a device are related by the differential
equation

                                                ay + by + cy = f(t),

w is called the impulse response of the device. Note that w is the solution of the initial value problem

                        aw + bw + cw = 0, w(0) = 0, w (0) = 1/a,                  (8.7.12)

as can be seen by using the Laplace transform to solve this problem. (Verify.) On the other hand, we can
solve (8.7.12) by the methods of Section 5.2 and show that w is defined on (-, ) by

                        w = e , w = te r2t - er1t 1 r1t, or w = 1 et sin t,       (8.7.13)

depending upon whether the polynomial p(r) = ar2 + br + c has distinct real zeros r1 and r2, a repeated
zero r1, or complex conjugate zeros   i. (In most physical applications, the zeros of the characteristic
polynomial have negative real parts, so limt w(t) = 0.) This means that y = u(t - t0)w(t - t0) is
defined on (-, ) and has the following properties:

                                    y(t) = 0, t < t0,

                        ay + by + cy = 0 on (-, t0) and (t0, ),

and

                          Figure 8.7.2 An illustration of Theorem 8.7.1

(remember that y-(t0) and y+(t0) are derivatives from the right and left, respectively) and y (t0) does
not exist. Thus, even though we defined y = u(t-t0)w(t-t0) to be the solution of (8.7.11), this function
doesn't satisfy the differential equation in (8.7.11) at t0, since it isn't differentiable there; in fact (8.7.14)
indicates that an impulse causes a jump discontinuity in velocity. (To see that this is reasonable, think of

what happens when you hit a ball with a bat.) This means that the initial value problem (8.7.11) doesn't

make sense if t0 = 0, since y (0) doesn't exist in this case. However y = u(t)w(t) can be defined to be
the solution of the modified initial value problem

               ay + by + cy = (t), y(0) = 0, y-(0) = 0,

where the condition on the derivative at t = 0 has been replaced by a condition on the derivative from the
left.

   Figure 8.7.2 illustrates Theorem 8.7.1 for the case where the impulse response w is the first expression
in (8.7.13) and r1 and r2 are distinct and both negative. The solid curve in the figure is the graph of w.
The dashed curves are solutions of (8.7.1) for various values of h. As h decreases the graph of yh moves
to the left toward the graph of w.

Example 8.7.1 Find the solution of the initial value problem

               y - 2y + y = (t - t0), y(0) = 0, y (0) = 0,                     (8.7.15)

where t0 > 0. Then interpret the solution for the case where t0 = 0.

as the solution of (8.7.15) if t0 > 0. If t0 = 0, then (8.7.15) doesn't have a solution; however, y =
u(t)te-t (which we would usually write simply as y = te-t) is the solution of the modified initial value
problem

The graph of y = u(t - t0)(t - t0)e-(t-t0) is shown in Figure 8.7.3
Definition 8.7.2 and the principle of superposition motivate the next definition.

Definition 8.7.3 Suppose  is a nonzero constant and f is piecewise continuous on [0, ). If t0 > 0,
then the solution of the initial value problem

       ay + by + cy = f(t) + (t - t0), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1

is defined to be             y(t) = y^(t) + u(t - t0)w(t - t0),
where y^ is the solution of

                             ay + by + cy = f(t), y(0) = k0, y (0) = k1.

This definition also applies if t0 = 0, provided that the initial condition y (0) = k1 is replaced by
y-(0) = k1.

466 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations

9.1 INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR HIGHER ORDER EQUATIONS

An nth order differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written in the form  (9.1.1)
                                    y(n) + p1(x)y(n-1) +    + pn(x)y = f(x).

We considered equations of this form with n = 1 in Section 2.1 and with n = 2 in Chapter 5. In this
chapter n is an arbitrary positive integer.

   In this section we sketch the general theory of linear nth order equations. Since this theory has already
been discussed for n = 2 in Sections 5.1 and 5.3, we'll omit proofs.

   For convenience, we consider linear differential equations written as

                       P0(x)y(n) + P1(x)y(n-1) +    + Pn(x)y = F (x),                  (9.1.2)

which can be rewritten as (9.1.1) on any interval on which P0 has no zeros, with p1 = P1/P0, . . . ,
pn = Pn/P0 and f = F/P0. For simplicity, throughout this chapter we'll abbreviate the left side of
(9.1.2) by Ly; that is,

                                       Ly = P0y(n) + P1y(n-1) +    + Pny.

We say that the equation Ly = F is normal on (a, b) if P0, P1, . . . , Pn and F are continuous on (a, b)
and P0 has no zeros on (a, b). If this is so then Ly = F can be written as (9.1.1) with p1, . . . , pn and f
continuous on (a, b).

   The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.3.1.

Theorem 9.1.1 Suppose Ly = F is normal on (a, b), let x0 be a point in (a, b), and let k0, k1, . . . , kn-1
be arbitrary real numbers. Then the initial value problem

                      Ly = F, y(x0) = k0, y (x0) = k1, . . . , y(n-1)(x0) = kn-1

has a unique solution on (a, b).

Homogeneous Equations

Eqn. (9.1.2) is said to be homogeneous if F  0 and nonhomogeneous otherwise. Since y  0 is
obviously a solution of Ly = 0, we call it the trivial solution. Any other solution is nontrivial.

   If y1, y2, . . . , yn are defined on (a, b) and c1, c2, . . . , cn are constants, then

                                  y = c1y1 + c2y2 +    + cnyn                          (9.1.3)

is a linear combination of {y1, y2 . . . , yn}. It's easy to show that if y1, y2, . . . , yn are solutions of Ly = 0

on (a, b), then so is any linear combination of {y1, y2, . . . , yn}. (See the proof of Theorem 5.1.2.) We

say that {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0 on (a, b) if every solution of Ly = 0

on (a, b) can be written as a linear combination of {y1, y2, . . . , yn}, as in (9.1.3). In this case we say that

(9.1.3) is the general solution of Ly = 0 on (a, b).

It can be shown (Exercises 14 and 15) that if the equation Ly = 0 is normal on (a, b) then it has in-

finitely many fundamental sets of solutions on (a, b). The next definition will help to identify fundamental

sets of solutions of Ly = 0.

We say that {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is linearly independent on (a, b) if the only constants c1, c2, . . . , cn such

that

      c1y1(x) + c2y2(x) +    + cnyn(x) = 0, a < x < b,                                 (9.1.4)

are c1 = c2 =    = cn = 0. If (9.1.4) holds for some set of constants c1, c2, . . . , cn that are not all zero,
then {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is linearly dependent on (a, b)

   The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.1.3.
                                         Section 9.1 Introduction to Linear Higher Order Equations 467

Theorem 9.1.2 If Ly = 0 is normal on (a, b), then a set {y1, y2, . . . , yn} of n solutions of Ly = 0 on
(a, b) is a fundamental set if and only if it's linearly independent on (a, b).

Example 9.1.1 The equation

                            x3y - x2y - 2xy + 6y = 0                                           (9.1.5)

is normal and has the solutions y1 = x2, y2 = x3, and y3 = 1/x on (-, 0) and (0, ). Show that
{y1, y2, y3} is linearly independent on (-, 0) and (0, ). Then find the general solution of (9.1.5) on
(-, 0) and (0, ).

Solution Suppose                         c1x2 + c2x3 + c3 = 0
                                                            x
                                                                                               (9.1.6)
on (0, ). We must show that c1 = c2 = c3 = 0. Differentiating (9.1.6) twice yields the system  (9.1.7)

                              c1x2 + c2x3 + c3 = 0
                                                 x
                                                 c3

                            2c1x + 3c2x2 - x2 = 0
                              2c1 + 6c2x + 3 2c3 = 0.
                                                x

If (9.1.7) holds for all x in (0, ), then it certainly holds at x = 1; therefore,

                                          c1 + c2 + c3 = 0                                     (9.1.8)
                                         2c1 + 3c2 - c3 = 0
                                         2c1 + 6c2 + 2c3 = 0.

By solving this system directly, you can verify that it has only the trivial solution c1 = c2 = c3 =

0; however, for our purposes it's more useful to recall from linear algebra that a homogeneous linear

system of n equations in n unknowns has only the trivial solution if its determinant is nonzero. Since the

determinant of (9.1.8) is

                            11 1                   10 0

                            2 3 -1 = 2 1 -3 = 12,

                            26 2                   24 0

it follows that (9.1.8) has only the trivial solution, so {y1, y2, y3} is linearly independent on (0, ). Now

Theorem 9.1.2 implies that               y = c1x2 + c2x3 + c3
                                                                  x

is the general solution of (9.1.5) on (0, ). To see that this is also true on (-, 0), assume that (9.1.6)

holds on (-, 0). Setting x = -1 in (9.1.7) yields

                               c1 - c2 - c3 = 0
                            -2c1 + 3c2 - c3 = 0

                              2c1 - 6c2 - 2c3 = 0.

Since the determinant of this system is

                            1 -1 -1                100

                            2 -6 -2                2 -4 0

it follows that c1 = c2 = c3 = 0; that is, {y1, y2, y3} is linearly independent on (-, 0).
468 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations

Example 9.1.2 The equation

                                     y(4) + y - 7y - y + 6y = 0            (9.1.9)

is normal and has the solutions y1 = ex, y2 = e-x, y3 = e2x, and y4 = e-3x on (-, ). (Verify.)
Show that {y1, y2, y3, y4} is linearly independent on (-, ). Then find the general solution of (9.1.9).

Solution Suppose c1, c2, c3, and c4 are constants such that                (9.1.10)
                                        c1ex + c2e-x + c3e2x + c4e-3x = 0

for all x. We must show that c1 = c2 = c3 = c4 = 0. Differentiating (9.1.10) three times yields the

system

                            c1ex + c2e-x + c3e2x + c4e-3x = 0              (9.1.11)
                            c1ex - c2e-x + 2c3e2x - 3c4e-3x = 0
                            c1ex + c2e-x + 4c3e2x + 9c4e-3x = 0
                            c1ex - c2e-x + 8c3e2x - 27c4e-3x = 0.

If (9.1.11) holds for all x, then it certainly holds for x = 0. Therefore

                                     c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 = 0
                                     c1 - c2 + 2c3 - 3c4 = 0
                                     c1 + c2 + 4c3 + 9c4 = 0
                                     c1 - c2 + 8c3 - 27c4 = 0.

The determinant of this system is

        1 11 1                       1 11 1      -2 1 -4

        1 -1 2 -3 = 0 -2 1 -4 = 0 3 8
        1 14 9                       0 03 8
                                                 -2 7 -28
        1 -1 8 -27                   0 -2 7 -28                            (9.1.12)

                                     -2 1 -4     38

                                     = 0 3 8 = -2 0 6 -24 6 -24 = 240,

so the system has only the trivial solution c1 = c2 = c3 = c4 = 0. Now Theorem 9.1.2 implies that
                                        y = c1ex + c2e-x + c3e2x + c4e-3x

is the general solution of (9.1.9).
The Wronskian

We can use the method used in Examples 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 to test n solutions {y1, y2, . . . , yn} of any nth
order equation Ly = 0 for linear independence on an interval (a, b) on which the equation is normal.
Thus, if c1, c2 ,. . . , cn are constants such that

                            c1y1 + c2y2 +    + cnyn = 0, a < x < b,

then differentiating n - 1 times leads to the n  n system of equations

                            c1y1(x) + c2y2(x)+    +cnyn(x) = 0

                            c1y1(x) + c2y2(x)+    +cnyn(x) = 0          (9.1.13)
                                                         ..

for c1, c2, . . . , cn. For a fixed x, the determinant of this system is

                                  y1(x)  y2(x)    yn(x)
                                  y1(x)
                                         y2(x)    yn(x)
                                     ..
                         W (x) =     .                  ..  ..            ..           .

                                                       .        .         .

                                  (n-1)  (n-1)                            (n-1)
                                  y1 (x) y2 (x)    yn (x)

We call this determinant the Wronskian of {y1, y2, . . . , yn}. If W (x) = 0 for some x in (a, b) then the
system (9.1.13) has only the trivial solution c1 = c2 =    = cn = 0, and Theorem 9.1.2 implies that

                                  y = c1y1 + c2y2 +    + cnyn

is the general solution of Ly = 0 on (a, b).
   The next theorem generalizes Theorem 5.1.4. The proof is sketched in (Exercises 17-20).

Theorem 9.1.3 Suppose the homogeneous linear nth order equation                             (9.1.14)
                                   P0(x)y(n) + P1(x)yn-1 +    + Pn(x)y = 0

is normal on (a, b), let y1, y2, . . . , yn be solutions of (9.1.14) on (a, b), and let x0 be in (a, b). Then the
Wronskian of {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is given by

                         x W (x) = W (x P 0) exp - 1(t) dt ,              a < x < b.        (9.1.15)
                                                         x0 P0(t)

Therefore, either W has no zeros in (a, b) or W  0 on (a, b).

Formula (9.1.15) is Abel's formula.
The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.1.6..

Theorem 9.1.4 Suppose Ly = 0 is normal on (a, b) and let y1, y2, . . . , yn be n solutions of Ly = 0 on
(a, b). Then the following statements are equivalent; that is, they are either all true or all false:
(a) The general solution of Ly = 0 on (a, b) is y = c1y1 + c2y2 +    + cnyn.

(b) {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0 on (a, b).

(c) {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is linearly independent on (a, b).

(d) The Wronskian of {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is nonzero at some point in (a, b).

(e) The Wronskian of {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is nonzero at all points in (a, b).

Example 9.1.3 In Example 9.1.1 we saw that the solutions y1 = x2, y2 = x3, and y3 = 1/x of
                                            x3y - x2y - 2xy + 6y = 0

are linearly independent on (-, 0) and (0, ). Calculate the Wronskian of {y1, y2, y3}.

where we factored x2, x, and 2 out of the first, second, and third rows of W (x), respectively. Adding the
second row of the last determinant to the first and third rows yields

                                        3 6x 0

Therefore W (x) = 0 on (-, 0) and (0, ).

Example 9.1.4 In Example 9.1.2 we saw that the solutions y1 = ex, y2 = e-x, y3 = e2x, and y4 = e-3x
of

                                           y(4) + y - 7y - y + 6y = 0

are linearly independent on every open interval. Calculate the Wronskian of {y1, y2, y3, y4}.

Solution For all x,              ex e-x e2x                                 e-3x

                                                         -x      2x

                                 ex -e-x 8e2x -27e-3x

Factoring the exponential common factor from each row yields

                     W (x) = e-x 1 -1 2 1 1 4 -39 = 240e-x,

                                        1 -1 8 -27

from (9.1.12).
REMARK: Under the assumptions of Theorem 9.1.4, it isn't necessary to obtain a formula for W (x). Just
evaluate W (x) at a convenient point in (a, b), as we did in Examples 9.1.1 and 9.1.2.

Theorem 9.1.5 Suppose c is in (a, b) and 1, 2, . . . , are real numbers, not all zero. Under the assump-
tions of Theorem 10.3.3, suppose y1 and y2 are solutions of (5.1.35) such that

                     yi(c) + yi(c) +    + yi(n-1)(c) = 0, 1  i  n.                         (9.1.16)

Then {y1, y2, . . . yn} isn't linearly independent on (a, b).

Proof Since 1, 2, . . . , n are not all zero, (9.1.14) implies that

                            y1(c) y1(c)    y1(n-1)(c)
                            y2(c) y2(c)    y2(n-1)(c)
                              .  ..                                    .         = 0,
                            ..   .. . .                              ..

                                                                   (n-1)

                            yn(c) yn(c)    yn (c)

so                   y1(c)       y2(c)                       렁          yn(c)

General Solution of a Nonhomogeneous Equation

The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.3.2. It shows how to find the general solution of Ly = F
if we know a particular solution of Ly = F and a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary
equation Ly = 0.

Theorem 9.1.6 Suppose Ly = F is normal on (a, b). Let yp be a particular solution of Ly = F on
(a, b), and let {y1, y2, . . . , yn} be a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation Ly = 0
on (a, b). Then y is a solution of Ly = F on (a, b) if and only if

                                        y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2 +    + cnyn,
where c1, c2, . . . , cn are constants.

   The next theorem is analogous to Theorem 5.3.2.

on (a, b).

We'll apply Theorems 9.1.6 and 9.1.7 throughout the rest of this chapter.

9.2 HIGHER ORDER CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS EQUATIONS

If a0, a1, . . . , an are constants and a0 = 0, then
                                      a0y(n) + a1y(n-1) +    + any = F (x)

is said to be a constant coefficient equation. In this section we consider the homogeneous constant coef-

ficient equation

                                 a0y(n) + a1y(n-1) +    + any = 0.               (9.2.1)

Since (9.2.1) is normal on (-, ), the theorems in Section 9.1 all apply with (a, b) = (-, ).

As in Section 5.2, we call

                                 p(r) = a0rn + a1rn-1 +    + an                  (9.2.2)

the characteristic polynomial of (9.2.1). We saw in Section 5.2 that when n = 2 the solutions of (9.2.1)
are determined by the zeros of the characteristic polynomial. This is also true when n > 2, but the
situation is more complicated in this case. Consequently, we take a different approach here than in

Section 5.2.
   If k is a positive integer, let Dk stand for the k-th derivative operator; that is

                                 Dky = y(k).

If
                                         q(r) = b0rm + b1rm-1 +    + bm

is an arbitrary polynomial, define the operator

                                       q(D) = b0Dm + b1Dm-1 +    + bm

such that

           q(D)y = (b0Dm + b1Dm-1 +    + bm)y = b0y(m) + b1y(m-1) +    + bmy

whenever y is a function with m derivatives. We call q(D) a polynomial operator.

With p as in (9.2.2),            p(D) = a0Dn + a1Dn-1 +    + an,

so (9.2.1) can be written as p(D)y = 0. If r is a constant then

                       p(D)erx = a0Dnerx + a1Dn-1erx +    + anerx
                                    = (a0rn + a1rn-1 +    + an)erx;

that is

                                 p(D)(erx ) = p(r)erx.

This shows that y = erx is a solution of (9.2.1) if p(r) = 0. In the simplest case, where p has n distinct
real zeros r1, r2,. . . , rn, this argument yields n solutions

                                 y1 = er1x, y2 = er2x, . . . , yn = ernx.

It can be shown (Exercise 39) that the Wronskian of {er1x, er2x, . . . , ernx} is nonzero if r1, r2, . . . , rn
are distinct; hence, {er1x, er2x, . . . , ernx} is a fundamental set of solutions of p(D)y = 0 in this case.

Example 9.2.1

(a) Find the general solution of

                                     y - 6y + 11y - 6y = 0.                                   (9.2.3)
                                                                                              (9.2.4)
(b) Solve the initial value problem

               y - 6y + 11y - 6y = 0, y(0) = 4, y (0) = 5, y (0) = 9.

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.3) is

               p(r) = r3 - 6r2 + 11r - 6 = (r - 1)(r - 2)(r - 3).

Therefore {ex, e2x, e3x} is a set of solutions of (9.2.3). It is a fundamental set, since its Wronskian is

               ex e2x e3x                             111

               W (x) = ex 2e2x 3e3x = e6x 1 2 3 = 2e6x = 0.

               ex 4e2x 9e3x                           149

Therefore the general solution of (9.2.3) is

                                     y = c1ex + c2e2x + c3e3x.                                (9.2.5)

SOLUTION(b) We must determine c1, c2 and c3 in (9.2.5) so that y satisfies the initial conditions in
(9.2.4). Differentiating (9.2.5) twice yields

                                  y = c1ex + 2c2e2x + 3c3e3x                                  (9.2.6)
                                  y = c1ex + 4c2e2x + 9c3e3x.

Setting x = 0 in (9.2.5) and (9.2.6) and imposing the initial conditions yields

                                                c1 + c2 + c3 = 4
                                                c1 + 2c2 + 3c3 = 5
                                                c1 + 4c2 + 9c3 = 9.

The solution of this system is c1 = 4, c2 = -1, c3 = 1. Therefore the solution of (9.2.4) is

                                                  y = 4ex - e2x + e3x

(Figure 9.2.1).
   Now we consider the case where the characteristic polynomial (9.2.2) does not have n distinct real

zeros. For this purpose it is useful to define what we mean by a factorization of a polynomial operator.
We begin with an example.

Example 9.2.2 Consider the polynomial
                                                p(r) = r3 - r2 + r - 1

and the associated polynomial operator
                                              p(D) = D3 - D2 + D - 1.

Since p(r) can be factored as
                                    p(r) = (r - 1)(r2 + 1) = (r2 + 1)(r - 1),

it's reasonable to expect that p(D) can be factored as                                (9.2.7)
                                  p(D) = (D - 1)(D2 + 1) = (D2 + 1)(D - 1).

However, before we can make this assertion we must define what we mean by saying that two operators

are equal, and what we mean by the products of operators in (9.2.7). We say that two operators are equal
if they apply to the same functions and always produce the same result. The definitions of the products in
(9.2.7) is this: if y is any three-times differentiable function then
(a) (D - 1)(D2 + 1)y is the function obtained by first applying D2 + 1 to y and then applying D - 1

      to the resulting function

(b) (D2 + 1)(D - 1)y is the function obtained by first applying D - 1 to y and then applying D2 + 1

to the resulting function.

From (a),

                   (D - 1)(D2 + 1)y = (D - 1)[(D2 + 1)y]

                             = (D - 1)(y + y) = D(y + y) - (y + y)                    (9.2.8)
                             = (y + y ) - (y + y)

                             = y - y + y - y = (D3 - D2 + D - 1)y.

This implies that

                             (D - 1)(D2 + 1) = (D3 - D2 + D - 1).
            Section 9.2 Higher Order Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations 479

From (b),

            (D2 + 1)(D - 1)y = (D2 + 1)[(D - 1)y]                               (9.2.9)
                                      = (D2 + 1)(y - y) = D2(y - y) + (y - y)  (9.2.10)

                                      = (y - y ) + (y - y)
                                      = y - y + y - y = (D3 - D2 + D - 1)y,

            (D2 + 1)(D - 1) = (D3 - D2 + D - 1),

which completes the justification of (9.2.7).

Example 9.2.3 Use the result of Example 9.2.2 to find the general solution of

                                      y - y + y - y = 0.

Solution From (9.2.8), we can rewrite (9.2.10) as
                                                (D - 1)(D2 + 1)y = 0,

which implies that any solution of (D2 + 1)y = 0 is a solution of (9.2.10). Therefore y1 = cos x and
y2 = sin x are solutions of (9.2.10).

   From (9.2.9), we can rewrite (9.2.10) as

                                                (D2 + 1)(D - 1)y = 0,

which implies that any solution of (D - 1)y = 0 is a solution of (9.2.10). Therefore y3 = ex is solution
of (9.2.10).

   The Wronskian of {ex, cos x, sin x} is

                            cos x sin x ex
            W (x) = - sin x cos x ex .

                         - cos x - sin x ex

Since                                                 101
                                      W (0) = 0 1 1 = 2,

                                                   -1 0 1

{cos x, sin x, ex} is linearly independent and

                                      y = c1 cos x + c2 sin x + c3ex

is the general solution of (9.2.10).

Example 9.2.4 Find the general solution of                                     (9.2.11)
                                                     y(4) - 16y = 0.

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.11) is

            p(r) = r4 - 16 = (r2 - 4)(r2 + 4) = (r - 2)(r + 2)(r2 + 4).

By arguments similar to those used in Examples 9.2.2 and 9.2.3, it can be shown that (9.2.11) can be

written as

                                      (D2 + 4)(D + 2)(D - 2)y = 0
480 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations

or
                                           (D2 + 4)(D - 2)(D + 2)y = 0

or
                                           (D - 2)(D + 2)(D2 + 4)y = 0.

Therefore y is a solution of (9.2.11) if it's a solution of any of the three equations

                               (D - 2)y = 0, (D + 2)y = 0, (D2 + 4)y = 0.

Hence, {e2x, e-2x, cos 2x, sin 2x} is a set of solutions of (9.2.11). The Wronskian of this set is

       e2x                                 e-2x              cos 2x  sin 2x

       2e2x -2e-2x -2 sin 2x                                         2 cos 2x .
       W (x) = 2x
       4e                                  4e      -2x  -4 cos 2x -4 sin 2x

       8e2x -8e-2x 8 sin 2x -8 cos 2x

Since               1110
       W (0) = 2 -2 0 4 4 -4 20 = -512,

                    8 -8 0 -8

{e2x, e-2x, cos 2x, sin 2x} is linearly independent, and

       y1 = c1e2x + c2e-2x + c3 cos 2x + c4 sin 2x

is the general solution of (9.2.11).
   It is known from algebra that every polynomial

       p(r) = a0rn + a1rn-1 +    + an

with real coefficients can be factored as

       p(r) = a0p1(r)p2(r)    pk(r),

where no pair of the polynomials p1, p2, . . . , pk has a commom factor and each is either of the form

                                           pj(r) = (r - rj )mj ,                                    (9.2.12)

where rj is real and mj is a positive integer, or

                                                          2  2 mj
       pj(r) = (r - j ) + j ,                                                                       (9.2.13)

where j and j are real, j = 0, and mj is a positive integer. If (9.2.12) holds then rj is a real zero of
p, while if (9.2.13) holds then  + i and  - i are complex conjugate zeros of p. In either case, mj is
the multiplicity of the zero(s).

   By arguments similar to those used in our examples, it can be shown that

       p(D) = a0p1(D)p2(D)    pk(D)                                                              (9.2.14)

and that the order of the factors on the right can be chosen arbitrarily. Therefore, if pj(D)y = 0 for some
j then p(D)y = 0. To see this, we simply rewrite (9.2.14) so that pj(D) is applied first. Therefore the
           Section 9.2 Higher Order Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations 481

problem of finding solutions of p(D)y = 0 with p as in (9.2.14) reduces to finding solutions of each of
these equations

                                               pj(D)y = 0, 1  j  k,

where pj is a power of a first degree term or of an irreducible quadratic. To find a fundamental set of
solutions {y1, y2, . . . , yn} of p(D)y = 0, we find fundamental set of solutions of each of the equations
and take {y1, y2, . . . , yn} to be the set of all functions in these separate fundamental sets. In Exercise 40
we sketch the proof that {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is linearly independent, and therefore a fundamental set of
solutions of p(D)y = 0.

   To apply this procedure to general homogeneous constant coefficient equations, we must be able to
find fundamental sets of solutions of equations of the form

                                                     (D - a)my = 0

and
                                                (D - )2 + 2 m y = 0,

where m is an arbitrary positive integer. The next two theorems show how to do this.

Theorem 9.2.1 If m is a positive integer, then                                        (9.2.15)
                                               {eax, xeax, . . . , xm-1eax}

is a fundamental set of solutions of

                                      (D - a)my = 0.                                  (9.2.16)

Proof We'll show that if

                          f(x) = c1 + c2x +    + cmxm-1

is an arbitrary polynomial of degree  m - 1, then y = eaxf is a solution of (9.2.16). First note that if g
is any differentiable function then

           (D - a)eaxg = Deaxg - aeaxg = aeaxg + eaxg - aeaxg,

so

                                      (D - a)eaxg = eaxg .                            (9.2.17)

Therefore

    (D - a)eaxf = eaxf                                (from (9.2.17) with g = f)

    (D - a)2eaxf = (D - a)eaxf = eaxf                 (from (9.2.17) with g = f )

    (D - a)3eaxf = (D - a)eaxf = eaxf                 (from (9.2.17) with g = f )

           ..
           .

    (D - a)meaxf = (D - a)eaxf(m-1) = eaxf(m) (from (9.2.17) with g = f(m-1)).

Since f(m) = 0, the last equation implies that y = eaxf is a solution of (9.2.16) if f is any polynomial
of degree  m - 1. In particular, each function in (9.2.15) is a solution of (9.2.16). To see that (9.2.15)
is linearly independent (and therefore a fundamental set of solutions of (9.2.16)), note that if

                                   c1eax + c2xeax + c    + cm-1xm-1eax = 0

for all x in some interval (a, b), then
                                         c1 + c2x + c    + cm-1xm-1 = 0

for all x in (a, b). However, we know from algebra that if this polynomial has more than m - 1 zeros then
c1 = c2 =    = cn = 0.
482 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations                                            (9.2.18)
                                                                                       (9.2.19)
Example 9.2.5 Find the general solution of                                             (9.2.20)
                                               y + 3y + 3y + y = 0.

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.18) is

p(r) = r3 + 3r2 + 3r + 1 = (r + 1)3.

Therefore (9.2.18) can be written as

                                      (D + 1)3y = 0,

so Theorem 9.2.1 implies that the general solution of (9.2.18) is

                                      y = e-x(c1 + c2x + c3x2).

The proof of the next theorem is sketched in Exercise 41.

Theorem 9.2.2 If  = 0 and m is a positive integer, then

                                {ex cos x, xex cos x, . . . , xm-1ex cos x,
                                  ex sin x, xex sin x, . . . , xm-1ex sin x}

is a fundamental set of solutions of

                                      [(D - )2 + 2]my = 0.

Example 9.2.6 Find the general solution of
                                                (D2 + 4D + 13)3y = 0.

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.19) is
                                    p(r) = (r2 + 4r + 13)3 = (r + 2)2 + 9 3 .

Therefore (9.2.19) can be be written as
                                                 [(D + 2)2 + 9]3y = 0,

so Theorem 9.2.2 implies that the general solution of (9.2.19) is
                     y = (a1 + a2x + a3x2)e-2x cos 3x + (b1 + b2x + b3x2)e-2x sin 3x.

Example 9.2.7 Find the general solution of
                                             y(4) + 4y + 6y + 4y = 0.

Solution The characteristic polynomial of (9.2.20) is

                                          p(r) = r4 + 4r3 + 6r2 + 4r
                                                  = r(r3 + 4r2 + 6r + 4)
                                                  = r(r + 2)(r2 + 2r + 2)
                                                  = r(r + 2)[(r + 1)2 + 1].
                   Section 9.2 Higher Order Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Equations 483

Therefore (9.2.20) can be written as

                                      [(D + 1)2 + 1](D + 2)Dy = 0.

Fundamental sets of solutions of
                            (D + 1)2 + 1 y = 0, (D + 2)y = 0, and Dy = 0.

are given by

                   {e-x cos x, e-x sin x}, {e-2x}, and {1},

respectively. Therefore the general solution of (9.2.20) is

                   y = e-x(c1 cos x + c2 sin x) + c3e-2x + c4.

Example 9.2.8 Find a fundamental set of solutions of                                  (9.2.21)
                                    [(D + 1)2 + 1]2(D - 1)3(D + 1)D2y = 0.

Solution A fundamental set of solutions of (9.2.21) can be obtained by combining fundamental sets of

solutions of       (D + 1)2 + 1 2 y = 0, (D - 1)3y = 0,
                      (D + 1)y = 0, and D2y = 0.

Fundamental sets of solutions of these equations are given by

              {e-x cos x, xe-x cos x, e-x sin x, xe-x sin x},       {ex, xex, x2ex},
                                          {e-x}, and {1, x},

respectively. These ten functions form a fundamental set of solutions of (9.2.21).

40. A theorem from algebra says that if P1 and P2 are polynomials with no common factors then there
       are polynomials Q1 and Q2 such that

                                            Q1P1 + Q2P2 = 1.

This implies that

                                Q1(D)P1(D)y + Q2(D)P2(D)y = y

for every function y with enough derivatives for the left side to be defined.

(a) Use this to show that if P1 and P2 have no common factors and

                                               P1(D)y = P2(D)y = 0

      then y = 0.

(b) Suppose P1 and P2 are polynomials with no common factors. Let u1, . . . , ur be linearly
      independent solutions of P1(D)y = 0 and let v1, . . . , vs be linearly independent solutions of
      P2(D)y = 0. Use (a) to show that {u1, . . . , ur, v1, . . . , vs} is a linearly independent set.

(c) Suppose the characteristic polynomial of the constant coefficient equation

                                    a0y(n) + a1y(n-1) +    + any = 0                        (A)

has the factorization                     p(r) = a0p1(r)p2(r)    pk(r),
where each pj is of the form

                   pj (r)  =    (r  -  rj )nj  or  pj (r)  =  [(r  -  j )2  +  w2]mj  (j > 0)

                                                                                  j

and no two of the polynomials p1, p2, . . . , pk have a common factor. Show that we can
find a fundamental set of solutions {y1, y2, . . . , yn} of (A) by finding a fundamental set of
solutions of each of the equations

                                            pj (D)y = 0, 1  j  k,

and taking {y1, y2, . . . , yn} to be the set of all functions in these separate fundamental sets.

9.3 UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS FOR HIGHER ORDER EQUATIONS

In this section we consider the constant coefficient equation

                            a0y(n) + a1y(n-1) +    + any = F (x),         (9.3.1)

where n  3 and F is a linear combination of functions of the form

                            ex p0 + p1x +    + pkxk

or
                 ex p0 + p1x +    + pkxk cos x + q0 + q1x +    + qkxk sin x .

   From Theorem 9.1.5, the general solution of (9.3.1) is y = yp + yc, where yp is a particular solution of
(9.3.1) and yc is the general solution of the complementary equation

                                        a0y(n) + a1y(n-1) +    + any = 0.

In Section 9.2 we learned how to find yc. Here we will learn how to find yp when the forcing function
has the form stated above. The procedure that we use is a generalization of the method that we used in
Sections 5.4 and 5.5, and is again called method of undetermined coefficients. Since the underlying ideas
are the same as those in Sections 5.4 and 5.5, we'll give an informal presentation based on examples.

Forcing Functions of the Form ex p0 + p1x +    + pkxk

We first consider equations of the form

a0y(n) + a1y(n-1) +    + any = ex p0 + p1x +    + pkxk .

Example 9.3.1 Find a particular solution of

                       y + 3y + 2y - y = ex(21 + 24x + 28x2 + 5x3).          (9.3.2)

Solution Substituting

                              y = uex,
                             y = ex(u + u),
                            y = ex(u + 2u + u),
                            y = ex(u + 3u + 3u + u)
                       Section 9.3 Undetermined Coefficients for Higher Order Equations 489

into (9.3.2) and canceling ex yields
         (u + 3u + 3u + u) + 3(u + 2u + u) + 2(u + u) - u = 21 + 24x + 28x2 + 5x3,

or

                       u + 6u + 11u + 5u = 21 + 24x + 28x2 + 5x3.                          (9.3.3)

Since the unknown u appears on the left, we can see that (9.3.3) has a particular solution of the form

                       up = A + Bx + Cx2 + Dx3.

Then

                                              up = B + 2Cx + 3Dx2
                                              up = 2C + 6Dx
                                             up = 6D.

Substituting from the last four equations into the left side of (9.3.3) yields

            up + 6up + 11up + 5up = 6D + 6(2C + 6Dx) + 11(B + 2Cx + 3Dx2)
                                                   +5(A + Bx + Cx2 + Dx3)

                                              = (5A + 11B + 12C + 6D) + (5B + 22C + 36D)x
                                                   +(5C + 33D)x2 + 5Dx3.

Comparing coefficients of like powers of x on the right sides of this equation and (9.3.3) shows that up
satisfies (9.3.3) if

                                                                    5D = 5
                                                           5C + 33D = 28
                                                  5B + 22C + 36D = 24
                                         5A + 11B + 12C + 6D = 21.

Solving these equations successively yields D = 1, C = -1, B = 2, A = 1. Therefore

                                                up = 1 + 2x - x2 + x3

is a particular solution of (9.3.3), so
                                         yp = exup = ex(1 + 2x - x2 + x3)

is a particular solution of (9.3.2) (Figure 9.3.1).

Example 9.3.2 Find a particular solution of                                                (9.3.4)
                              y(4) - y - 6y + 4y + 8y = e2x(4 + 19x + 6x2).

Solution Substituting

                          y = ue2x,
                         y = e2x(u + 2u),
                        y = e2x(u + 4u + 4u),
                        y = e2x(u + 6u + 12u + 8u),
                       y(4) = e2x(u(4) + 8u + 24u + 32u + 16u)

                 -6(u + 4u + 4u) + 4(u + 2u) + 8u = 4 + 19x + 6x2,

or

                            u(4) + 7u + 12u = 4 + 19x + 6x2.                         (9.3.5)

Since neither u nor u appear on the left, we can see that (9.3.5) has a particular solution of the form

                                       up = Ax2 + Bx3 + Cx4.                         (9.3.6)

Then

                                       up = 2Ax + 3Bx2 + 4Cx3

                                       up = 2A + 6Bx + 12Cx2

                                       up = 6B + 24Cx

                              (4)      =  24C.

                            up

                                              (4)

Substituting up, up , and up into the left side of (9.3.5) yields

      u(4) + 7up p  + 12up  =          24C + 7(6B + 24Cx) + 12(2A + 6Bx + 12Cx2)

                            = (24A + 42B + 24C) + (72B + 168C)x + 144Cx2.

                                             24

Comparing coefficients of like powers of x on the right sides of this equation and (9.3.5) shows that up
satisfies (9.3.5) if

                                                              144C = 6
                                                     72B + 168C = 19
                                            24A + 42B + 24C = 4.

Solving these equations successively yields C = 1/24, B = 1/6, A = -1/6. Substituting these into

(9.3.6) shows that                       u x2 p = (-4 + 4x + x2)

is a particular solution of (9.3.4). (Figure 9.3.2).
Forcing Functions of the Form ex (P (x) cos x + Q(x) sin x)

We now consider equations of the form

a0y(n) + a1y(n-1) +    + any = ex (P (x) cos x + Q(x) sin x) ,

where P and Q are polynomials.

Example 9.3.3 Find a particular solution of

                    y + y - 4y - 4y = ex[(5 - 5x) cos x + (2 + 5x) sin x].   (9.3.7)
492 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations

Solution Substituting

                         y = uex,
                        y = ex(u + u),
                       y = ex(u + 2u + u),
                       y = ex(u + 3u + 3u + u)

into (9.3.7) and canceling ex yields

(u + 3u + 3u + u) + (u + 2u + u) - 4(u + u) - 4u = (5 - 5x) cos x + (2 + 5x) sin x,

or                                                                                               (9.3.8)
                            u + 4u + u - 6u = (5 - 5x) cos x + (2 + 5x) sin x.

Since cos x and sin x are not solutions of the complementary equation

                                         u + 4u + u - 6u = 0,

a theorem analogous to Theorem 5.5.1 implies that (9.3.8) has a particular solution of the form

                       up = (A0 + A1x) cos x + (B0 + B1x) sin x.                                 (9.3.9)

Then

                  up = (A1 + B0 + B1x) cos x + (B1 - A0 - A1x) sin x,
               up = (2B1 - A0 - A1x) cos x - (2A1 + B0 + B1x) sin x,
            up = -(3A1 + B0 + B1x) cos x - (3B1 - A0 - A1x) sin x,

so
                     up + 4up + up - 6up = - [10A0 + 2A1 - 8B1 + 10A1x] cos x
                                                         - [10B0 + 2B1 + 8A1 + 10B1x] sin x.

Comparing the coefficients of x cos x, x sin x, cos x, and sin x here with the corresponding coefficients
in (9.3.8) shows that up is a solution of (9.3.8) if

                                                          -10A1 = -5
                                                          -10B1 = 5
                                         -10A0 - 2A1 + 8B1 = 5
                                         -10B0 - 2B1 - 8A1 = 2.

Solving the first two equations yields A1 = 1/2, B1 = -1/2. Substituting these into the last two
equations yields

                       -10A0 = 5 + 2A1 - 8B1 = 10
                       -10B0 = 2 + 2B1 + 8A1 = 5,

so A0 = -1, B0 = -1/2. Substituting A0 = -1, A1 = 1/2, B0 = -1/2, B1 = -1/2 into (9.3.9)

shows that             up = - 1 [(2 - x) cos x + (1 + x) sin x]
                                2

Example 9.3.4 Find a particular solution of                                                       (9.3.10)
                        y + 4y + 6y + 4y = e-x [(1 - 6x) cos x - (3 + 2x) sin x] .

Solution Substituting

                         y = ue-x,
                        y = e-x(u - u),
                       y = e-x(u - 2u + u),
                       y = e-x(u - 3u + 3u - u)

into (9.3.10) and canceling e-x yields

(u - 3u + 3u - u) + 4(u - 2u + u) + 6(u - u) + 4u = (1 - 6x) cos x - (3 + 2x) sin x,

or                                                                                                (9.3.11)
                              u + u + u + u = (1 - 6x) cos x - (3 + 2x) sin x.

Since cos x and sin x are solutions of the complementary equation

                                        u + u + u + u = 0,

a theorem analogous to Theorem 5.5.1 implies that (9.3.11) has a particular solution of the form

                       up = (A0x + A1x2) cos x + (B0x + B1x2) sin x.                              (9.3.12)
494 Chapter 9 Linear Higher Order Equations

   Then

            up = [A0 + (2A1 + B0)x + B1x2] cos x + [B0 + (2B1 - A0)x - A1x2] sin x,
            up = [2A1 + 2B0 - (A0 - 4B1)x - A1x2] cos x

                        +[2B1 - 2A0 - (B0 + 4A1)x - B1x2] sin x,
           up = -[3A0 - 6B1 + (6A1 + B0)x + B1x2] cos x

                        -[3B0 + 6A1 + (6B1 - A0)x - A1x2] sin x,

so
              up + up + up + up = -[2A0 - 2B0 - 2A1 - 6B1 + (4A1 - 4B1)x] cos x
                                               -[2B0 + 2A0 - 2B1 + 6A1 + (4B1 + 4A1)x] sin x.

Comparing the coefficients of x cos x, x sin x, cos x, and sin x here with the corresponding coefficients
in (9.3.11) shows that up is a solution of (9.3.11) if

                                                         -4A1 + 4B1 = -6
                                                         -4A1 - 4B1 = -2
                                       -2A0 + 2B0 + 2A1 + 6B1 = 1
                                       -2A0 - 2B0 - 6A1 + 2B1 = -3.

Solving the first two equations yields A1 = 1, B1 = -1/2. Substituting these into the last two equations
yields

                                     -2A0 + 2B0 = 1 - 2A1 - 6B1 = 2

9.4 VARIATION OF PARAMETERS FOR HIGHER ORDER EQUATIONS

Derivation of the method

We assume throughout this section that the nonhomogeneous linear equation

                          P0(x)y(n) + P1(x)y(n-1) +    + Pn(x)y = F (x)                        (9.4.1)

is normal on an interval (a, b). We'll abbreviate this equation as Ly = F , where

                          Ly = P0(x)y(n) + P1(x)y(n-1) +    + Pn(x)y.

When we speak of solutions of this equation and its complementary equation Ly = 0, we mean solutions
on (a, b). We'll show how to use the method of variation of parameters to find a particular solution of
Ly = F , provided that we know a fundamental set of solutions {y1, y2, . . . , yn} of Ly = 0.

   We seek a particular solution of Ly = F in the form

                                      yp = u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn                             (9.4.2)

where {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is a known fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation
                                  P0(x)y(n) + P1(x)y(n-1) +    + Pn(x)y = 0

and u1, u2, . . . , un are functions to be determined. We begin by imposing the following n - 1 conditions

on u1, u2, . . . , un:

                               u1y1 + u2y2+    +unyn = 0

                               u1y1 + u2y2+    +unyn = 0                                       (9.4.3)
                                                     ..
                                                     .

                               (n-2)       (n-2)       (n-2)
                          u1y1 + u2y2 +    +unyn = 0.

These conditions lead to simple formulas for the first n - 1 derivatives of yp:

                          (r)         (r)  (r)    (r)
                          yp = u1y1 + u2y2    + unyn , 0  r  n - 1.                            (9.4.4)
                                       Section 9.4 Variation of Parameters for Higher Order Equations 499

These formulas are easy to remember, since they look as though we obtained them by differentiating
(9.4.2) n - 1 times while treating u1, u2, . . . , un as constants. To see that (9.4.3) implies (9.4.4), we first
differentiate (9.4.2) to obtain

                  yp = u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn + u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn,

which reduces to

                                       yp = u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn

because of the first equation in (9.4.3). Differentiating this yields

                  yp = u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn + u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn,

which reduces to

                                       yp = u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn

because of the second equation in (9.4.3). Continuing in this way yields (9.4.4).
   The last equation in (9.4.4) is

                                (n-1)     (n-1)         (n-1)             (n-1)
                             yp = u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn .

Differentiating this yields

(n)               (n)           (n)                (n)      (n-1)         (n-1)       (n-1)
yp = u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn + u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn .

Substituting this and (9.4.4) into (9.4.1) yields

                                                        (n-1)      (n-1)            (n-1)
u1Ly1 + u2Ly2 +    + unLyn + P0(x) u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn                           = F (x).

Since Lyi = 0 (1  i  n), this reduces to

                                (n-1)     (n-1)                (n-1) F (x)       .
                             u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn =
                                                                          P0(x)

Combining this equation with (9.4.3) shows that

                                       yp = u1y1 + u2y2 +    + unyn

is a solution of (9.4.1) if

                                       u1y1 + u2y2+    +unyn = 0

                                       u1y1 + u2y2+    +unyn = 0
                                                             ..
                                                             .

                             u1y1 + u2y2 +    +unyn = 0

                             u1y1 + u2y2 +    +unyn = F/P0,

The determinant of this system is the Wronskian W of the fundamental set of solutions {y1, y2, . . . , yn},
which has no zeros on (a, b), by Theorem 9.1.4. Solving (9.4.5) by Cramer's rule yields

                           uj = (-1)n-j F Wj P , 0W 1  j  n,                        (9.4.6)

where Wj is the Wronskian of the set of functions obtained by deleting yj from {y1, y2, . . . , yn} and
keeping the remaining functions in the same order. Equivalently, Wj is the determinant obtained by
deleting the last row and j-th column of W .

   Having obtained u1, u2, . . . ,un, we can integrate to obtain u1, u2, . . . , un. As in Section 5.7, we take
the constants of integration to be zero, and we drop any linear combination of {y1, y2, . . . , yn} that may
appear in yp.

REMARK: For efficiency, it's best to compute W1, W2, . . . , Wn first, and then compute W by expanding
in cofactors of the last row; thus,

                                              n

                                  W = (-1)n-j yj(n-1)Wj.

                                             y1 y2 y3

given that y1 = x, y2 = ex, and y3 = e-x form a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary

Solution We seek a particular solution of (9.4.8) of the form

                                              yp = u1x + u2ex + u3e-x.

The Wronskian of {y1, y2, y3} is

so

                        W1 =                  ex e-x = -2,
                                              ex -e-x

                        W2 =                  x e-x - -x = -e x(x + 1),
                        W3 =                  1 -e
                                              x exx = ex(x - 1).
                                              1e

Expanding W by cofactors of the last row yields

           W = 0W1 - exW2 + e-xW3 = 0(-2) - ex -e-x(x + 1) + e-xex(x - 1) = 2x.

Since F (x) = 8x2ex and P0(x) = x,

                                                   F = 8x2ex = 4ex.
                                                 P0W x  2x
Therefore, from (9.4.7)

                            u1 = 4exW1 = 4ex(-2) = -8ex,
                            u2 = -4exW2 = -4ex -e-x(x + 1) = 4(x + 1),
                            u3 = 4exW3 = 4ex (ex(x - 1)) = 4e2x(x - 1).

Integrating and taking the constants of integration to be zero yields
                                u1 = -8ex, u2 = 2(x + 1)2, u3 = e2x(2x - 3).

Hence,

                            yp = u1y1 + u2y2 + u3y3
                                 = (-8ex)x + ex(2(x + 1)2) + e-x e2x(2x - 3)
                                 = ex(2x2 - 2x - 1).

Since -ex is a solution of the complementary equation, we redefine

                                                   yp = 2xex(x - 1).

Therefore the general solution of (9.4.8) is

                        y = 2xex(x - 1) + c1x + c2ex + c3e-x.

Since F (x) = 12x2 and P0(x) = x4,

Integrating these and taking the constants of integration to be zero yields

                          u1 = -2x,     u2 = ln |x|,         2x3             x4

                                               12

Since -19x2/12 is a solution of the complementary equation, we redefine

                                        yp = x2 ln |x|.

Therefore                 y = x2 ln |x| + c1x + c2x2 + c3x + x2 c4

is the general solution of (9.4.10) on (-, 0) and (0, ).

10.1 INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Many physical situations are modelled by systems of n differential equations in n unknown functions,
where n  2. The next three examples illustrate physical problems that lead to systems of differential
equations. In these examples and throughout this chapter we'll denote the independent variable by t.

Example 10.1.1 Tanks T1 and T2 contain 100 gallons and 300 gallons of salt solutions, respectively. Salt
solutions are simultaneously added to both tanks from external sources, pumped from each tank to the
other, and drained from both tanks (Figure 10.1.1). A solution with 1 pound of salt per gallon is pumped
into T1 from an external source at 5 gal/min, and a solution with 2 pounds of salt per gallon is pumped
into T2 from an external source at 4 gal/min. The solution from T1 is pumped into T2 at 2 gal/min, and the
solution from T2 is pumped into T1 at 3 gal/min. T1 is drained at 6 gal/min and T2 is drained at 3 gal/min.
Let Q1(t) and Q2(t) be the number of pounds of salt in T1 and T2, respectively, at time t > 0. Derive a
system of differential equations for Q1 and Q2. Assume that both mixtures are well stirred.

                                                      Figure 10.1.1

Solution As in Section 4.2, let rate in and rate out denote the rates (lb/min) at which salt enters and
leaves a tank; thus,

                                          Q1 = (rate in)1 - (rate out)1,
                                          Q2 = (rate in)2 - (rate out)2.
Note that the volumes of the solutions in T1 and T2 remain constant at 100 gallons and 300 gallons,
respectively.
                            Section 10.1 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations 509

T1 receives salt from the external source at the rate of

                            (1 lb/gal)  (5 gal/min) = 5 lb/min,

and from T2 at the rate of

           (lb/gal in T2)  (3 gal/min) = 1 Q2  3 = 1 Q2 lb/min.
                                        300                             100

Therefore                               (rate in)1 = 5 + 1 100 Q2.

                                                                                 (10.1.1)

Solution leaves T1 at the rate of 8 gal/min, since 6 gal/min are drained and 2 gal/min are pumped to T2;

hence,     (rate out)1 = ( lb/gal in T1)  (8 gal/min) = 1 100 Q1  8 = 225 Q1.

                                                                                 (10.1.2)

Eqns. (10.1.1) and (10.1.2) imply that

                                           Q1 = 5 + 1 100 Q2 - 225 Q1.           (10.1.3)
T2 receives salt from the external source at the rate of

                            (2 lb/gal)  (4 gal/min) = 8 lb/min,

and from T1 at the rate of

           (lb/gal in T1)  (2 gal/min) = 1 Q1  2 = 1 Q1 lb/min.
                                        100                             50

Therefore                               (rate in)2 = 8 + 150 Q1.

                                                                                 (10.1.4)

Solution leaves T2 at the rate of 6 gal/min, since 3 gal/min are drained and 3 gal/min are pumped to T1;

hence,     (rate out)2 = ( lb/gal in T2)  (6 gal/min) = 1 300 Q2  6 = 150 Q2.

                                                                                 (10.1.5)

Eqns. (10.1.4) and (10.1.5) imply that

                                        Q2 = 8 + 150 Q1 - 150 Q2.                (10.1.6)

   We say that (10.1.3) and (10.1.6) form a system of two first order equations in two unknowns, and write
them together as

                                         Q1 = 5 - 225 Q1 + 1100 Q2
                                         Q2 = 8 + 150 Q1 - 150 Q2.

Example 10.1.2 A mass m1 is suspended from a rigid support on a spring S1 and a second mass m2
is suspended from the first on a spring S2 (Figure 10.1.2). The springs obey Hooke's law, with spring
constants k1 and k2. Internal friction causes the springs to exert damping forces proportional to the rates
of change of their lengths, with damping constants c1 and c2. Let y1 = y1(t) and y2 = y2(t) be the
displacements of the two masses from their equilibrium positions at time t, measured positive upward.
Derive a system of differential equations for y1 and y2, assuming that the masses of the springs are
negligible and that vertical external forces F1 and F2 also act on the objects.

         Figure 10.1.2

Solution In equilibrium, S1 supports both m1 and m2 and S2 supports only m2. Therefore, if  1 and
 2 are the elongations of the springs in equilibrium then

         (m1 + m2)g = k1 1 and m2g = k2 2.                (10.1.7)

Let H1 be the Hooke's law force acting on m1, and let D1 be the damping force on m1. Similarly, let

H2 and D2 be the Hooke's law and damping forces acting on m2. According to Newton's second law of

motion,

         m1y1 = -m1g + H1 + D1 + F1,                      (10.1.8)
         m2y2 = -m2g + H2 + D2 + F2.

When the displacements are y1 and y2, the change in length of S1 is -y1 +  1 and the change in length
of S2 is -y2 + y1 +  2. Both springs exert Hooke's law forces on m1, while only S2 exerts a Hooke's
law force on m2. These forces are in directions that tend to restore the springs to their natural lengths.
Therefore

H1 = k1(-y1 +  1) - k2(-y2 + y1 +  2) and H2 = k2(-y2 + y1 +  2). (10.1.9)

When the velocities are y1 and y2, S1 and S2 are changing length at the rates -y1 and -y2 + y1, respec-
tively. Both springs exert damping forces on m1, while only S2 exerts a damping force on m2. Since the
force due to damping exerted by a spring is proportional to the rate of change of length of the spring and

in a direction that opposes the change, it follows that

         D1 = -c1y1 + c2(y2 - y1) and D2 = -c2(y2 - y1).  (10.1.10)
                   Section 10.1 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations 511

From (10.1.8), (10.1.9), and (10.1.10),

                   m1y1 = -m1g + k1(-y1 +  1) - k2(-y2 + y1 +  2)             (10.1.11)
                                  -c1y1 + c2(y2 - y1) + F1                    (10.1.12)

                             = -(m1g - k1 1 + k2 2) - k1y1 + k2(y2 - y1)
                                  -c1y1 + c2(y2 - y1) + F1

and
                m2y2 = -m2g + k2(-y2 + y1 +  2) - c2(y2 - y1) + F2

                   = -(m2g - k2 2) - k2(y2 - y1) - c2(y2 - y1) + F2.

From (10.1.7),

                   m1g - k1 1 + k2 2 = -m2g + k2 2 = 0.

Therefore we can rewrite (10.1.11) and (10.1.12) as

                   m1y1 = -(c1 + c2)y1 + c2y2 - (k1 + k2)y1 + k2y2 + F1
                   m2y2 = c2y1 - c2y2 + k2y1 - k2y2 + F2.

Example 10.1.3 Let X = X(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j + z(t) k be the position vector at time t of an object

with mass m, relative to a rectangular coordinate system with origin at Earth's center (Figure 10.1.3).

According to Newton's law of gravitation, Earth's gravitational force F = F(x, y, z) on the object is

inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the object from Earth's center, and directed toward

the center; thus,

                   K                        X        xi+yj+zk
                   F= 2 -                      = -K              3/2 ,        (10.1.13)
                   X                        X        2(x + y + z )22

where K is a constant. To determine K, we observe that the magnitude of F is

                                         X     K        K
                   F =K 3 =                          2= 2 2 2 .
                      X                        X     (x + y + z )

Let R be Earth's radius. Since F = mg when the object is at Earth's surface,
                                           mg = R2 K , so K = mgR2.

Therefore we can rewrite (10.1.13) as
                                          F = -mgR 3/2 2 x i + y j + z k .
                                                            (x2 + y2 + z2)

Now suppose F is the only force acting on the object. According to Newton's second law of motion,

F = mX ; that is,  m(x i + y j + z k) = -mgR 3/2 2 x i + y j + z k .
                                                             (x2 + y2 + z2)

Cancelling the common factor m and equating components on the two sides of this equation yields the

system

                                            gR2x                              (10.1.14)

                                          ..
                                          .

                                   yn = gn(t, y1, y2, . . . , yn)

is called a first order system, since the only derivatives occurring in it are first derivatives. The derivative
of each of the unknowns may depend upon the independent variable and all the unknowns, but not on
the derivatives of other unknowns. When we wish to emphasize the number of unknown functions in
(10.1.15) we will say that (10.1.15) is an n  n system.

   Systems involving higher order derivatives can often be reformulated as first order systems by intro-
ducing additional unknowns. The next two examples illustrate this.

Example 10.1.4 Rewrite the system

                         m1y1 = -(c1 + c2)y1 + c2y2 - (k1 + k2)y1 + k2y2 + F1               (10.1.16)
                         m2y2 = c2y1 - c2y2 + k2y1 - k2y2 + F2.

derived in Example 10.1.2 as a system of first order equations.

Solution If we define v1 = y1 and v2 = y2, then v1 = y1 and v2 = y2 , so (10.1.16) becomes

                         m1v1 = -(c1 + c2)v1 + c2v2 - (k1 + k2)y1 + k2y2 + F1
                         m2v2 = c2v1 - c2v2 + k2y1 - k2y2 + F2.
                                Section 10.1 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations 513

Therefore {y1, y2, v1, v2} satisfies the 4  4 first order system

y1 = v1                                                                       (10.1.17)

y2 = v2
v1 = 1m [-(c 1 1 + c2)v1 + c2v2 - (k1 + k2)y1 + k2y2 + F1]
v2 = 1 [c2v1 - c2v2 + k2y1 - k2y2 + F2] .

           m2

REMARK: The difference in form between (10.1.15) and (10.1.17), due to the way in which the unknowns
are denoted in the two systems, isn't important; (10.1.17) is a first order system, in that each equation in
(10.1.17) expresses the first derivative of one of the unknown functions in a way that does not involve
derivatives of any of the other unknowns.

Example 10.1.5 Rewrite the system

                                   x = f(t, x, x , y, y , y )
                                   y = g(t, x, x , y, y y )

as a first order system.

Solution We regard x, x , y, y , and y as unknown functions, and rename them

                                x = x1, x = x2, y = y1, y = y2, y = y3.

These unknowns satisfy the system

                                            x1 = x2
                                            x2 = f(t, x1, x2, y1, y2, y3)
                                            y1 = y2
                                            y2 = y3
                                            y3 = g(t, x1, x2, y1, y2, y3).

Rewriting Scalar Differential Equations as Systems

In this chapter we'll refer to differential equations involving only one unknown function as scalar differ-
ential equations. Scalar differential equations can be rewritten as systems of first order equations by the
method illustrated in the next two examples.

Example 10.1.6 Rewrite the equation                  + 6y + 4y + y = 0        (10.1.18)
                                          y(4) + 4y

as a 4  4 first order system.

Solution We regard y, y , y , and y as unknowns and rename them
                                 y = y1, y = y2, y = y3, and y = y4.

Then y(4) = y4, so (10.1.18) can be written as
                                           y4 + 4y4 + 6y3 + 4y2 + y1 = 0.
514 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

Therefore {y1, y2, y3, y4} satisfies the system

       y1 = y2
       y2 = y3
       y3 = y4
       y4 = -4y4 - 6y3 - 4y2 - y1.

Example 10.1.7 Rewrite                 x = f(t, x, x , x )
as a system of first order equations.

Solution We regard x, x , and x as unknowns and rename them

       x = y1, x = y2, and x = y3.

Then

       y1 = x = y2, y2 = x = y3, and y3 = x .

Therefore {y1, y2, y3} satisfies the first order system

                                                y1 = y2
                                                y2 = y3
                                                y3 = f(t, y1, y2, y3).

   Since systems of differential equations involving higher derivatives can be rewritten as first order sys-
tems by the method used in Examples 10.1.5 -10.1.7 , we'll consider only first order systems.

Numerical Solution of Systems

The numerical methods that we studied in Chapter 3 can be extended to systems, and most differential
equation software packages include programs to solve systems of equations. We won't go into detail on
numerical methods for systems; however, for illustrative purposes we'll describe the Runge-Kutta method
for the numerical solution of the initial value problem

                                       y1 = g1(t, y1, y2), y1(t0) = y10,
                                       y2 = g2(t, y1, y2), y2(t0) = y20

at equally spaced points t0, t1, . . . , tn = b in an interval [t0, b]. Thus,

                                       ti = t0 + ih, i = 0, 1, . . . , n,

where                                            h = b - t0 .
                                                         n

We'll denote the approximate values of y1 and y2 at these points by y10, y11, . . . , y1n and y20, y21, . . . , y2n.
Section 10.1 Introduction to Systems of Differential Equations 515

The Runge-Kutta method computes these approximate values as follows: given y1i and y2i, compute

I1i = g1(ti, y1i, y2i),

J1i = g2(ti, y1i, y2i),

I2i = g1 ti + h , y1i + h I1i, y2i + h J1i ,
2                        2  2

J2i = g2 ti + h , y1i + h I1i, y2i + h J1i ,
2                        2  2

I3i = g1 ti + h , y1i + h I2i, y2i + h J2i ,
2                        2  2

J3i = g2 ti + h , y1i + h I2i, y2i + h J2i ,
2                        2  2

I4i = g1(ti + h, y1i + hI3i, y2i + hJ3i),

J4i = g2(ti + h, y1i + hI3i, y2i + hJ3i),

and

                                  y1,i+1 = y1i + h (I1i + 2I2i + 2I3i + I4i),
                                                          6

                                  y2,i+1 = y2i + h (J1i + 2J2i + 2J3i + J4i)
                                                          6

for i = 0, . . . , n-1. Under appropriate conditions on g1 and g2, it can be shown that the global truncation
error for the Runge-Kutta method is O(h4), as in the scalar case considered in Section 3.3.

10.2 LINEAR SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

A first order system of differential equations that can be written in the form

                            y1 = a11(t)y1 + a12(t)y2 +    + a1n(t)yn + f1(t)            (10.2.1)
                            y2 = a21(t)y1 + a22(t)y2 +    + a2n(t)yn + f2(t)

                                   ..
                                   .
                            yn = an1(t)y1 + an2(t)y2 +    + ann(t)yn + fn(t)

is called a linear system.
   The linear system (10.2.1) can be written in matrix form as

                                                                                  f1(t)

  yn                     an1(t) an2(t)    ann(t)      yn                       fn(t)
                                        Section 10.2 Linear Systems of Differential Equations 517

or more briefly as

                                        y = A(t)y + f (t),                           (10.2.2)

where

                                    a11(t) a12(t)    a1n(t)                f1(t)

                                                        ..  , and f (t) =  ..  .
       y =  ..  , A(t) =  ..            .. . .                                       

       .                          .     .              . .                  .

       yn                           an1(t) an2(t)    ann(t)                fn(t)

We call A the coefficient matrix of (10.2.2) and f the forcing function. We'll say that A and f are con-

tinuous if their entries are continuous. If f = 0, then (10.2.2) is homogeneous; otherwise, (10.2.2) is

nonhomogeneous.

An initial value problem for (10.2.2) consists of finding a solution of (10.2.2) that equals a given

constant vector                            
                                              k1

                                              k2 
                                             
                                        k =  . .
                                              .. 

                                                    kn

at some initial point t0. We write this initial value problem as

                                    y = A(t)y + f (t), y(t0) = k.

   The next theorem gives sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions of initial value problems for
(10.2.2). We omit the proof.

Theorem 10.2.1 Suppose the coefficient matrix A and the forcing function f are continuous on (a, b), let
t0 be in (a, b), and let k be an arbitrary constant n-vector. Then the initial value problem

                                    y = A(t)y + f (t), y(t0) = k

has a unique solution on (a, b).

Example 10.2.1

(a) Write the system

                                        y1 = y1 + 2y2 + 2e4t                         (10.2.3)
                                        y2 = 2y1 + y2 + e4t

in matrix form and conclude from Theorem 10.2.1 that every initial value problem for (10.2.3) has
a unique solution on (-, ).

(b) Verify that

                      y = 1 8 5 7 e4t + c1 11 e3t + c2 1-1 e-t                       (10.2.4)

is a solution of (10.2.3) for all values of the constants c1 and c2.

(c) Find the solution of the initial value problem

                      y = 1 2 y + 2 e4t, y(0) = 1 3 .                                (10.2.5)
                                    21              1                 5 22
518 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

SOLUTION(a) The system (10.2.3) can be written in matrix form as

                        y = 1 2 y + 2 e4t.
                        21                               1

An initial value problem for (10.2.3) can be written as

                        y = 1 2 2 1 y + 21 e4t, y(t0) = k1 k2 .

Since the coefficient matrix and the forcing function are both continuous on (-, ), Theorem 10.2.1
implies that this problem has a unique solution on (-, ).

SOLUTION(b) If y is given by (10.2.4), then

Ay + f = 1 1 2 5 2 1 87 e4t + c1 1 2 2 1 11 e3t

                        +c2 1 2 2 1 1-1 e-t + 21 e4t

                        = 1 22 5 23 e4t + c1 33 e3t + c2 -1 1 e-t + 21 e4t

                        = 1 32 5 28 e4t + 3c1 11 e3t - c2 1-1 e-t = y .

SOLUTION(c) We must choose c1 and c2 in (10.2.4) so that

                        1 8 5 7 + c1 11 + c2 1-1 = 1 3 5 22 ,

which is equivalent to

                        11                      c1 = -1 .
                        1 -1                    c2          3

Solving this system yields c1 = 1, c2 = -2, so

                        y = 1 8 5 7 e4t + 11 e3t - 2 1-1 e-t

is the solution of (10.2.5).
REMARK: The theory of n  n linear systems of differential equations is analogous to the theory of the
scalar n-th order equation

                        P0(t)y(n) + P1(t)y(n-1) +    + Pn(t)y = F (t),   (10.2.6)

as developed in Sections 9.1. For example, by rewriting (10.2.6) as an equivalent linear system it can be
shown that Theorem 10.2.1 implies Theorem 9.1.1 (Exercise 12).

10.3 BASIC THEORY OF HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS

In this section we consider homogeneous linear systems y = A(t)y, where A = A(t) is a continuous

n  n matrix function on an interval (a, b). The theory of linear homogeneous systems has much in

common with the theory of linear homogeneous scalar equations, which we considered in Sections 2.1,

5.1, and 9.1.

Whenever we refer to solutions of y = A(t)y we'll mean solutions on (a, b). Since y  0 is obviously

a solution of y = A(t)y, we call it the trivial solution. Any other solution is nontrivial.

If y1, y2, . . . , yn are vector functions defined on an interval (a, b) and c1, c2, . . . , cn are constants,

then

               y = c1y1 + c2y2 +    + cnyn                                                (10.3.1)

is a linear combination of y1, y2, . . . ,yn . It's easy show that if y1, y2, . . . ,yn are solutions of y = A(t)y
on (a, b), then so is any linear combination of y1, y2, . . . , yn (Exercise 1). We say that {y1, y2, . . . , yn}
is a fundamental set of solutions of y = A(t)y on (a, b) on if every solution of y = A(t)y on (a, b) can

be written as a linear combination of y1, y2, . . . , yn, as in (10.3.1). In this case we say that (10.3.1) is
the general solution of y = A(t)y on (a, b).

   It can be shown that if A is continuous on (a, b) then y = A(t)y has infinitely many fundamental sets
of solutions on (a, b) (Exercises 15 and 16). The next definition will help to characterize fundamental
sets of solutions of y = A(t)y.

   We say that a set {y1, y2, . . . , yn} of n-vector functions is linearly independent on (a, b) if the only
constants c1, c2, . . . , cn such that

               c1y1(t) + c2y2(t) +    + cnyn(t) = 0, a < t < b,                           (10.3.2)

are c1 = c2 =    = cn = 0. If (10.3.2) holds for some set of constants c1, c2, . . . , cn that are not all
zero, then {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is linearly dependent on (a, b)

   The next theorem is analogous to Theorems 5.1.3 and 9.1.2.
                             Section 10.3 Basic Theory of Homogeneous Linear System 523

Theorem 10.3.1 Suppose the nn matrix A = A(t) is continuous on (a, b). Then a set {y1, y2, . . . , yn}
of n solutions of y = A(t)y on (a, b) is a fundamental set if and only if it's linearly independent on (a, b).

Example 10.3.1 Show that the vector functions

                        et          0                                          e2t 

                  y1 =  0  , y2 =  e3t  , and y3 =  e3t 
                       e-t
                                                        1                     0

are linearly independent on every interval (a, b).

Solution Suppose

                   et   0   e2t   0 

                  c1  0  + c2  e3t  + c3  e3t  =  0  ,                        a < t < b.

                  e-t            1                         0         0

We must show that c1 = c2 = c3 = 0. Rewriting this equation in matrix form yields

                   et 0 e2t   c1   0 
                   0 e3t e3t   c2  =  0  , a < t < b.
                       e-t 1 0
                                                    c3        0

Expanding the determinant of this system in cofactors of the entries of the first row yields

      et 0 e2t           = et e - 0 3t e3t                    0 e3t -t + e2t         0 e3t
       0 e3t e3t                                              e0
      e-t 1 0                                                                        -t
                                    10                                             e1

                         = et(-e3t) + e2t(-e2t) = -2e4t.

Since this determinant is never zero, c1 = c2 = c3 = 0.
   We can use the method in Example 10.3.1 to test n solutions {y1, y2, . . . , yn} of any n  n system

y = A(t)y for linear independence on an interval (a, b) on which A is continuous. To explain this (and

for other purposes later), it's useful to write a linear combination of y1, y2, . . . , yn in a different way. We
first write the vector functions in terms of their components as

                                                                              y1n

                  y1 =  ..  ,    y2 =  ..  , . . . ,
                         .              .                                   .

is called the Wronskian of {y1, y2, . . . , yn}. It can be shown (Exercises 2 and 3) that this definition is
analogous to definitions of the Wronskian of scalar functions given in Sections 5.1 and 9.1. The next
theorem is analogous to Theorems 5.1.4 and 9.1.3. The proof is sketched in Exercise 4 for n = 2 and in
Exercise 5 for general n.

Theorem 10.3.2 [Abel's Formula] Suppose the n  n matrix A = A(t) is continuous on (a, b), let
y1, y2, . . . , yn be solutions of y = A(t)y on (a, b), and let t0 be in (a, b). Then the Wronskian of
{y1, y2, . . . , yn} is given by

       W (t) = W (t0) exp   t                                               a < t < b.  (10.3.6)

                               a11(s) + a22(s) +    + ann(s)] ds ,

                           t0

Therefore, either W has no zeros in (a, b) or W  0 on (a, b).

REMARK: The sum of the diagonal entries of a square matrix A is called the trace of A, denoted by
tr(A). Thus, for an n  n matrix A,

                           tr(A) = a11 + a22 +    + ann,

                              W (t) = W (t0) exp

                                                  t0

The next theorem is analogous to Theorems 5.1.6 and 9.1.4.

Theorem 10.3.3 Suppose the n  n matrix A = A(t) is continuous on (a, b) and let y1, y2, . . . ,yn be
solutions of y = A(t)y on (a, b). Then the following statements are equivalent; that is, they are either
all true or all false:
(a) The general solution of y = A(t)y on (a, b) is y = c1y1 + c2y2 +    + cnyn, where c1, c2, . . . ,

      cn are arbitrary constants.

(b) {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is a fundamental set of solutions of y = A(t)y on (a, b).

(c) {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is linearly independent on (a, b).

(d) The Wronskian of {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is nonzero at some point in (a, b).

(e) The Wronskian of {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is nonzero at all points in (a, b).

   We say that Y in (10.3.4) is a fundamental matrix for y = A(t)y if any (and therefore all) of the
statements (a)-(e) of Theorem 10.3.2 are true for the columns of Y . In this case, (10.3.3) implies that the
general solution of y = A(t)y can be written as y = Y c, where c is an arbitrary constant n-vector.

Example 10.3.2 The vector functions

                  y1 =                -e2t        and y2 =   -e-t

                                                                   e-t

                                            y = -4 -3 y                           (10.3.7)

(a) Compute the Wronskian of {y1, y2} directly from the definition (10.3.5)
(b) Verify Abel's formula (10.3.6) for the Wronskian of {y1, y2}.
(c) Find the general solution of (10.3.7).

(d) Solve the initial value problem

                                      y = -4 -3 6 5 y, y(0) = 4 -5 .              (10.3.8)

SOLUTION(a) From (10.3.5)             -e2t  -e-t  = e2te-t   -1 -1      = et.     (10.3.9)
                             W (t) =  2e2t   e-t               21

SOLUTION(b) Here

                                            A = -4 -3 6 5 ,
526 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

so tr(A) = -4 + 5 = 1. If t0 is an arbitrary real number then (10.3.6) implies that

       W (t) = W (t0) exp               t -e2t0 -e-t0 (t-t0) t0 t-t0 t
                                        1 ds =     2t0     -t0 e      =e e =e,
                                                2e       e
                                    t0

which is consistent with (10.3.9).

SOLUTION(c) Since W (t) = 0, Theorem 10.3.3 implies that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions

of (10.3.7) and

                                          Y=    -e2t    -e-t
                                                2e2t     e-t

is a fundamental matrix for (10.3.7). Therefore the general solution of (10.3.7) is

       y = c1y1 + c2y2 = c1         -e2t        -e-t    =     -e2t -e-t              c1 c2 .
                                      2t + c2 -t                                              (10.3.10)
                                    2e          e             2t      -t
                                                              2e e

SOLUTION(d) Setting t = 0 in (10.3.10) and imposing the initial condition in (10.3.8) yields

                                    c1 -12 + c2 -11 = 4 -5 .

Thus,

                                          -c1 - c2 = 4
                                          2c1 + c2 = -5.

The solution of this system is c1 = -1, c2 = -3. Substituting these values into (10.3.10) yields

                          y=-       -e2t        -e-t          e2t + 3e-t
                                        2t - 3 -t =
                                    2e                        2t      -t
                                                e             -2e - 3e

as the solution of (10.3.8).

(a) Rewrite (A) as a system of first order equations and show that W is the Wronskian (as defined
     in this section) of n solutions of this system.

(b) Apply Eqn. (10.3.6) to the system derived in (a), and show that

which is the form of Abel's formula given in Theorem 9.1.3.

4. Suppose

                            y1 = y11 y21  and y2 = y12 y22

are solutions of the 2  2 system y = Ay on (a, b), and let

                   Y=       y11 y12       and W = y11 y12 y21 y22 ;
                            y21 y22

thus, W is the Wronskian of {y1, y2}.
(a) Deduce from the definition of determinant that

                            W = y11 y12 + y11 y12 .

(b) Use the equation Y = A(t)Y and the definition of matrix multiplication to show that

                            [y11 y12] = a11[y11 y12] + a12[y21 y22]

     and
                                 [y21 y22] = a21[y11 y12] + a22[y21 y22].

(c) Use properties of determinants to deduce from (a) and (a) that

                   y11 y12 y21 y22 = a11W and         y11 y12 y = a 21 y22 22W.

10.4 CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS I

We'll now begin our study of the homogeneous system

               y = Ay,                                                        (10.4.1)

where A is an n  n constant matrix. Since A is continuous on (-, ), Theorem 10.2.1 implies that
all solutions of (10.4.1) are defined on (-, ). Therefore, when we speak of solutions of y = Ay,
we'll mean solutions on (-, ).

   In this section we assume that all the eigenvalues of A are real and that A has a set of n linearly
independent eigenvectors. In the next two sections we consider the cases where some of the eigenvalues
of A are complex, or where A does not have n linearly independent eigenvectors.

   In Example 10.3.2 we showed that the vector functions

y1 =     -e2t                                                        -e-t
         2e2t                                      and y2 = -t

                                                                     e

form a fundamental set of solutions of the system

         y = -4 -3 6 5 y,                                                     (10.4.2)
                                 Section 10.4 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Systems I 531

but we did not show how we obtained y1 and y2 in the first place.  To see  how these solutions can be
obtained we write (10.4.2) as                                                                     (10.4.3)

                                                  y1 = -4y1 - 3y2
                                                  y2 = 6y1 + 5y2

and look for solutions of the form

                                 y1 = x1et and y2 = x2et,                               (10.4.4)

where x1, x2, and  are constants to be determined. Differentiating (10.4.4) yields
                                         y1 = x1et and y2 = x2et.

Substituting this and (10.4.4) into (10.4.3) and canceling the common factor et yields

                                 -4x1 - 3x2 = x1
                                  6x1 + 5x2 = x2.

For a given , this is a homogeneous algebraic system, since it can be rewritten as

                                 (-4 - )x1 - 3x2 = 0                                    (10.4.5)
                                   6x1 + (5 - )x2 = 0.

The trivial solution x1 = x2 = 0 of this system isn't useful, since it corresponds to the trivial solution
y1  y2  0 of (10.4.3), which can't be part of a fundamental set of solutions of (10.4.2). Therefore we
consider only those values of  for which (10.4.5) has nontrivial solutions. These are the values of  for

which the determinant of (10.4.5) is zero; that is,

-4 -  -3                                    = (-4 - )(5 - ) + 18
   6 5-
                                            = 2 -  - 2
                                            = ( - 2)( + 1) = 0,

which has the solutions 1 = 2 and 2 = -1.
   Taking  = 2 in (10.4.5) yields

                                 -6x1 - 3x2 = 0
                                   6x1 + 3x2 = 0,

which implies that x1 = -x2/2, where x2 can be chosen arbitrarily. Choosing x2 = 2 yields the solution
y1 = -e2t, y2 = 2e2t of (10.4.3). We can write this solution in vector form as

                                 y1 = -12 e2t.                                          (10.4.6)

Taking  = -1 in (10.4.5) yields the system

                                 -3x1 - 3x2 = 0

                                 6x1 + 6x2 = 0,

so x1 = -x2. Taking x2 = 1 here yields the solution y1 = -e-t, y2 = e-t of (10.4.3). We can write

this solution in vector form as  y2 = -11 e-t.

                                                                                        (10.4.7)

   In (10.4.6) and (10.4.7) the constant coefficients in the arguments of the exponential functions are the
eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix in (10.4.2), and the vector coefficients of the exponential functions
are associated eigenvectors. This illustrates the next theorem.
532 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

Theorem 10.4.1 Suppose the nn constant matrix A has n real eigenvalues 1, 2, . . . , n (which need
not be distinct) with associated linearly independent eigenvectors x1, x2, . . . , xn. Then the functions

          y1 = x1e1t, y2 = x2e2t, . . . , yn = xnent

form a fundamental set of solutions of y = Ay; that is, the general solution of this system is

          y = c1x1e1t + c2x2e2t +    + cnxnent.

Proof Differentiating yi = xieit and recalling that Axi = ixi yields

                                  yi = ixieit = Axieit = Ayi.

This shows that yi is a solution of y = Ay.
   The Wronskian of {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is

x11e1t x12e2t                     x1nen t                     x11 x12    x1n
x21e1t x22e2t                     x2nen t                     x21 x22    x2n

...  ...  ...                            ..   = e1te2t    ent .            ... . . . .. ..
                                         .                                ..

xn1e1t xn2e2t    xnnexnt                                      xn1 xn2    xnn

Since the columns of the determinant on the right are x1, x2, . . . , xn, which are assumed to be linearly
independent, the determinant is nonzero. Therefore Theorem 10.3.3 implies that {y1, y2, . . . , yn} is a
fundamental set of solutions of y = Ay.

          2- 4                                = ( - 2)2 - 16
            4 2-
                                              = ( - 2 - 4)( - 2 + 4)
                                              = ( - 6)( + 2).

Hence, 1 = 6 and 2 = -2 are eigenvalues of A. To obtain the eigenvectors, we must solve the system

                                     2- 4     x1 = 0                                            (10.4.10)

with  = 6 and  = -2. Setting  = 6 in (10.4.10) yields

                                     -4 4     x1 x2 = 00 ,

which implies that x1 = x2. Taking x2 = 1 yields the eigenvector

                                                       x1 = 11 ,
so

                                                     y1 = 11 e6t
is a solution of (10.4.8). Setting  = -2 in (10.4.10) yields

                                  44  x1 = 0 ,
                                  44  x2                          0

which implies that x1 = -x2. Taking x2 = 1 yields the eigenvector

                                                      x2 = -11 ,
so

                                                   y2 = -11 e-2t
is a solution of (10.4.8). From Theorem 10.4.1, the general solution of (10.4.8) is

y = c1y1 + c2y2 = c1 11 e6t + c2 -11 e-2t.                                           (10.4.11)

SOLUTION(b) To satisfy the initial condition in (10.4.9), we must choose c1 and c2 in (10.4.11) so that
                                         c1 11 + c2 -11 = 5 -1 .

This is equivalent to the system
                                                    c1 - c2 = 5
                                                    c1 + c2 = -1,

so c1 = 2, c2 = -3. Therefore the solution of (10.4.9) is
                                          y = 2 11 e6t - 3 -11 e-2t,

or, in terms of components,
                                     y1 = 2e6t + 3e-2t, y2 = 2e6t - 3e-2t.

Hence, the eigenvalues of A are 1 = 2, 2 = 3, and 3 = -1. To find the eigenvectors, we must solve

Hence, x1 = x2 = x3, and we choose x3 = 1 to obtain the solution

                                                  1                                 (10.4.17)

                                     222.0

Hence, the components of these eigenvectors need only satisfy the single condition

                                     x1 + x2 + x3 = 0.

Since there's only one equation here, we can choose x2 and x3 arbitrarily. We obtain one eigenvector by

choosing x2 = 0 and x3 = 1, and another by choosing x2 = 1 and x3 = 0. In both cases x1 = -1.

are linearly independent eigenvectors associated with 2 = -5, and the corresponding solutions of

(10.4.16) are

Because of this and (10.4.17), Theorem 10.4.1 implies that the general solution of (10.4.16) is

Geometric Properties of Solutions when n = 2

We'll now consider the geometric properties of solutions of a 2  2 constant coefficient system

                  y1 = a11 a12                         y1 y2 .                                   (10.4.18)
                  y2                          a21 a22

It is convenient to think of a "y1-y2 plane," where a point is identified by rectangular coordinates (y1, y2).
If y = y1 y2 is a non-constant solution of (10.4.18), then the point (y1(t), y2(t)) moves along a curve
C in the y1-y2 plane as t varies from - to . We call C the trajectory of y. (We also say that
C is a trajectory of the system (10.4.18).) I's important to note that C is the trajectory of infinitely

many solutions of (10.4.18), since if  is any real number, then y(t -  ) is a solution of (10.4.18)

(Exercise 28(b)), and (y1(t -  ), y2(t -  )) also moves along C as t varies from - to . Moreover,
Exercise 28(c) implies that distinct trajectories of (10.4.18) can't intersect, and that two solutions y1 and
y2 of (10.4.18) have the same trajectory if and only if y2(t) = y1(t -  ) for some  .

   From Exercise 28(a), a trajectory of a nontrivial solution of (10.4.18) can't contain (0, 0), which we
define to be the trajectory of the trivial solution y  0. More generally, if y = k1 = 0 is a constant

                                                                                                   k2
solution of (10.4.18) (which could occur if zero is an eigenvalue of the matrix of (10.4.18)), we define the

trajectory of y to be the single point (k1, k2).
   To be specific, this is the question: What do the trajectories look like, and how are they traversed? In

this section we'll answer this question, assuming that the matrix

                      A=                      a11 a12
                                              a21 a22

of (10.4.18) has real eigenvalues 1 and 2 with associated linearly independent eigenvectors x1 and x2.
Then the general solution of (10.4.18) is

                  y = c1x1e1t + c2x2e2t.                                                         (10.4.19)

We'll consider other situations in the next two sections.
   We leave it to you (Exercise 35) to classify the trajectories of (10.4.18) if zero is an eigenvalue of A.

We'll confine our attention here to the case where both eigenvalues are nonzero. In this case the simplest
situation is where 1 = 2 = 0, so (10.4.19) becomes

                                                y = (c1x1 + c2x2)e1t.

Since x1 and x2 are linearly independent, an arbitrary vector x can be written as x = c1x1 + c2x2.
Therefore the general solution of (10.4.18) can be written as y = xe1t where x is an arbitrary 2-
vector, and the trajectories of nontrivial solutions of (10.4.18) are half-lines through (but not including)
538 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations
the origin. The direction of motion is away from the origin if 1 > 0 (Figure 10.4.1), toward it if 1 < 0
(Figure 10.4.2). (In these and the next figures an arrow through a point indicates the direction of motion
along the trajectory through the point.)

                                                                           y2 y2

   Now suppose 2 > 1, and let L1 and L2 denote lines through the origin parallel to x1 and x2,
respectively. By a half-line of L1 (or L2), we mean either of the rays obtained by removing the origin
from L1 (or L2).

   Letting c2 = 0 in (10.4.19) yields y = c1x1e1t. If c1 = 0, the trajectory defined by this solution is a
half-line of L1. The direction of motion is away from the origin if 1 > 0, toward the origin if 1 < 0.
Similarly, the trajectory of y = c2x2e2t with c2 = 0 is a half-line of L2.

   Henceforth, we assume that c1 and c2 in (10.4.19) are both nonzero. In this case, the trajectory of
(10.4.19) can't intersect L1 or L2, since every point on these lines is on the trajectory of a solution for
which either c1 = 0 or c2 = 0. (Remember: distinct trajectories can't intersect!). Therefore the trajectory
of (10.4.19) must lie entirely in one of the four open sectors bounded by L1 and L2, but do not any point
on L1 or L2. Since the initial point (y1(0), y2(0)) defined by

                                      y(0) = c1x1 + c2x2

is on the trajectory, we can determine which sector contains the trajectory from the signs of c1 and c2, as
shown in Figure 10.4.3.

   The direction of y(t) in (10.4.19) is the same as that of

        e-2ty(t) = c1x1e-(2-1)t + c2x2                                                  (10.4.20)

and of

        e-1ty(t) = c1x1 + c2x2e(2-1)t.                                                  (10.4.21)

Since the right side of (10.4.20) approaches c2x2 as t  , the trajectory is asymptotically parallel to L2
as t  . Since the right side of (10.4.21) approaches c1x1 as t  -, the trajectory is asymptotically
parallel to L1 as t  -.

   The shape and direction of traversal of the trajectory of (10.4.19) depend upon whether 1 and 2 are
both positive, both negative, or of opposite signs. We'll now analyze these three cases.

   Henceforth u denote the length of the vector u.

Case 1: 2 > 1 > 0

Figure 10.4.4 shows some typical trajectories. In this case, limt- y(t) = 0, so the trajectory is not
only asymptotically parallel to L1 as t  -, but is actually asymptotically tangent to L1 at the origin.

so, although the trajectory is asymptotically parallel to L2 as t  , it's not asymptotically tangent to

Case 2: 0 > 2 > 1

Figure 10.4.5 shows some typical trajectories. In this case, limt y(t) = 0, so the trajectory is

   t-                             t-

so, although the trajectory is asymptotically parallel to L1 as t  -, it's not asymptotically tangent to
it. The direction of motion along each trajectory is toward the origin.

Case 3: 2 > 0 > 1

Figure 10.4.6 shows some typical trajectories. In this case,

lim y(t) =  and               lim y(t) - c2x2e2t = lim c1x1e1t = 0,

so the trajectory is asymptotically tangent to L2 as t  . Similarly,

so the trajectory is asymptotically tangent to L1 as t  -. The direction of motion is toward the origin

L1, toward L2.

where a and b are positive constants. One way to model the effect of competition is to assume
that the growth rate per individual of each population is reduced by an amount proportional to the
other population, so (A) is replaced by

                                  P = aP - Q

holds only while P and Q are both positive.) Now suppose P (0) = P0 > 0 and Q(0) = Q0 > 0.

(a) For several choices of a, b, , and , verify experimentally (by graphing trajectories of (A)

           (i) If Q0 > P0, then P decreases monotonically to zero in finite time, during which Q
                remains positive.
          (ii) If Q0 < P0, then Q decreases monotonically to zero in finite time, during which P
                remains positive.

(b) Conclude from (a) that exactly one of the species becomes extinct in finite time if Q0 = P0.

10.5 CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS II

We saw in Section 10.4 that if an n  n constant matrix A has n real eigenvalues 1, 2, . . . , n (which
need not be distinct) with associated linearly independent eigenvectors x1, x2, . . . , xn, then the general
solution of y = Ay is

                                   y = c1x1e1t + c2x2e2t +    + cnxnent.

In this section we consider the case where A has n real eigenvalues, but does not have n linearly indepen-
dent eigenvectors. It is shown in linear algebra that this occurs if and only if A has at least one eigenvalue
of multiplicity r > 1 such that the associated eigenspace has dimension less than r. In this case A is
said to be defective. Since it's beyond the scope of this book to give a complete analysis of systems with
defective coefficient matrices, we will restrict our attention to some commonly occurring special cases.

Example 10.5.1 Show that the system

                                     y = 11 -25 4 -9 y                                       (10.5.1)

does not have a fundamental set of solutions of the form {x1e1t, x2e2t}, where 1 and 2 are eigenval-
ues of the coefficient matrix A of (10.5.1) and x1, and x2 are associated linearly independent eigenvectors.

Solution The characteristic polynomial of A is

11 -  -25                                       = ( - 11)( + 9) + 100
   4 -9 -                                       = 2 - 2 + 1 = ( - 1)2.

Hence,  = 1 is the only eigenvalue of A. The augmented matrix of the system (A - I)x = 0 is

                                      .. 
                                        10 -25 . 0

                                      . ,

544 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

which is row equivalent to

                                                         
                                     5 ..
                              1 - . 0               2
                                                         .

                             .. 
                              0 0.0

Hence, x1 = 5x2/2 where x2 is arbitrary. Therefore all eigenvectors of A are scalar multiples of x1 =
   52 , so A does not have a set of two linearly independent eigenvectors.

   From Example 10.5.1, we know that all scalar multiples of y1 = 52 et are solutions of (10.5.1);
however, to find the general solution we must find a second solution y2 such that {y1, y2} is linearly
independent. Based on your recollection of the procedure for solving a constant coefficient scalar equation

                            ay + by + cy = 0

in the case where the characteristic polynomial has a repeated root, you might expect to obtain a second

solution of (10.5.1) by multiplying the first solution by t. However, this yields y2 =  5 tet, which
                                                                                        2

doesn't work, since

y2 = 52 (tet + et), while                              11 -25 4 -9 y2 = 52 tet.

The next theorem shows what to do in this situation.

Theorem 10.5.1 Suppose the nn matrix A has an eigenvalue 1 of multiplicity  2 and the associated
eigenspace has dimension 1; that is, all 1-eigenvectors of A are scalar multiples of an eigenvector x.
Then there are infinitely many vectors u such that

                              (A - 1I)u = x.                                            (10.5.2)

Moreover, if u is any such vector then                 y2 = ue1t + xte1t                (10.5.3)
                                     y1 = xe1t and

are linearly independent solutions of y = Ay.

   A complete proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this book. The difficulty is in proving that
there's a vector u satisfying (10.5.2), since det(A - 1I) = 0. We'll take this without proof and verify
the other assertions of the theorem.

   We already know that y1 in (10.5.3) is a solution of y = Ay. To see that y2 is also a solution, we
compute

                     y2 - Ay2 = 1ue1t + xe1t + 1xte1t - Aue1t - Axte1t
                                     = (1u + x - Au)e1t + (1x - Ax)te1t.

Since Ax = 1x, this can be written as
                                       y2 - Ay2 = - ((A - 1I)u - x) e1t,

and now (10.5.2) implies that y2 = Ay2.
                               Section 10.5 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Systems II 545

To see that y1 and y2 are linearly independent, suppose c1 and c2 are constants such that  (10.5.4)
                            c1y1 + c2y2 = c1xe1t + c2(ue1t + xte1t) = 0.

We must show that c1 = c2 = 0. Multiplying (10.5.4) by e-1t shows that

                               c1x + c2(u + xt) = 0.                                       (10.5.5)

By differentiating this with respect to t, we see that c2x = 0, which implies c2 = 0, because x = 0.
Substituting c2 = 0 into (10.5.5) yields c1x = 0, which implies that c1 = 0, again because x = 0

Example 10.5.2 Use Theorem 10.5.1 to find the general solution of the system

                               y = 11 -25 4 -9 y                                           (10.5.6)

considered in Example 10.5.1.

Solution In Example 10.5.1 we saw that 1 = 1 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 2 of the coefficient
matrix A in (10.5.6), and that all of the eigenvectors of A are multiples of

                                            x= 5 .
                                                    2

Therefore                                   y1 = 52 et

is a solution of (10.5.6). From Theorem 10.5.1, a second solution is given by y2 = uet + xtet, where
(A - I)u = x. The augmented matrix of this system is

                                .. 
                                  10 -25 . 5

                                . ,
                                    4 -10 .. 2

which is row equivalent to

                               5  .. 1 
                                1 - 2 .. 2  . .

                                  0 0. 0

Therefore the components of u must satisfy

                                            u1 - 5 u2 = 1 ,
                                            2   2

where u2 is arbitrary. We choose u2 = 0, so that u1 = 1/2 and

                                                         1

                                            u= 2 .
                                                     0

Thus,                          y2 = 1 et + 5 tet.

546 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

Since y1 and y2 are linearly independent by Theorem 10.5.1, they form a fundamental set of solutions of
(10.5.6). Therefore the general solution of (10.5.6) is

                            y = c1 52 et + c2  1 et + 5 tet .
                                               02               2

   Note that choosing the arbitrary constant u2 to be nonzero is equivalent to adding a scalar multiple of
y1 to the second solution y2 (Exercise 33).

Example 10.5.3 Find the general solution of

                                        3 4 -10                                             (10.5.7)
                                 y =  2 1 -2  y.

                                           2 2 -5

Solution The characteristic polynomial of the coefficient matrix A in (10.5.7) is

                            3-     4          -10   = -( - 1)( + 1)2.
                              2  1-            -2

                                   2

Hence, the eigenvalues are 1 = 1 with multiplicity 1 and 2 = -1 with multiplicity 2.

Eigenvectors associated with 1 = 1 must satisfy (A - I)x = 0. The augmented matrix of this system

is  ..

                                   2 2 -6 . 0

which is row equivalent to

                                  .. 
                                    1 0 -1 . 0

                                               0.0

Hence, x1 = x3 and x2 = 2x3, where x3 is arbitrary. Choosing x3 = 1 yields the eigenvector

                                                    1
                                             x1 =  2  .

                                                       1

                                000.0

Hence, x3 = 0 and x1 = -x2, where x2 is arbitrary. Choosing x2 = 1 yields the eigenvector

                                        -1 
                                x2 =  1  ,

                                             0

so                                     
                                       -1

is a solution of (10.5.7).
   Since all the eigenvectors of A associated with 2 = -1 are multiples of x2, we must now use Theo-

rem 10.5.1 to find a third solution of (10.5.7) in the form

                                              -1                                                      (10.5.8)

Hence, u3 = 1/2 and u1 = 1 - u2, where u2 is arbitrary. Choosing u2 = 0 yields

                                                              1

Theorem 10.5.2 Suppose the nn matrix A has an eigenvalue 1 of multiplicity  3 and the associated
eigenspace is one-dimensional; that is, all eigenvectors associated with 1 are scalar multiples of the
eigenvector x. Then there are infinitely many vectors u such that

                          (A - 1I)u = x,                                                         (10.5.9)

and, if u is any such vector, there are infinitely many vectors v such that

                          (A - 1I)v = u.                                                         (10.5.10)

If u satisfies (10.5.9) and v satisfies (10.5.10), then

                                         y1 = xe1t,
                                         y2 = ue1t + xte1t, and
                                         y3 = ve1t + ute1t + x t2e1t

                                                                                2

are linearly independent solutions of y = Ay.

   Again, it's beyond the scope of this book to prove that there are vectors u and v that satisfy (10.5.9)
and (10.5.10). Theorem 10.5.1 implies that y1 and y2 are solutions of y = Ay. We leave the rest of the
proof to you (Exercise 34).

Example 10.5.4 Use Theorem 10.5.2 to find the general solution of

                           1 1 1                                                                 (10.5.11)
                     y =  1 3 -1  y.

                               02 2

Solution The characteristic polynomial of the coefficient matrix A in (10.5.11) is

   1-                    1                          1  = -( - 2)3.

Hence, 1 = 2 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 3. The associated eigenvectors satisfy (A - 2I)x = 0.

Hence, x1 = x3 and x2 = 0, so the eigenvectors are all scalar multiples of

is a solution of (10.5.11). Since y1, y2, and y3 are linearly independent by Theorem 10.5.2, they form a
fundamental set of solutions of (10.5.11). Therefore the general solution of (10.5.11) is

Theorem 10.5.3 Suppose the nn matrix A has an eigenvalue 1 of multiplicity  3 and the associated

eigenspace is two-dimensional; that is, all eigenvectors of A associated with 1 are linear combinations

of two linearly independent eigenvectors x1 and x2. Then there are constants  and  (not both zero)

such that if

                                        x3 = x1 + x2,                         (10.5.12)

then there are infinitely many vectors u such that

                                        (A - 1I)u = x3.                       (10.5.13)

If u satisfies (10.5.13), then

                                    y1 = x1e1t,                               (10.5.14)
                                    y2 = x2e1t, and
                                    y3 = ue1t + x3te1t,

are linearly independent solutions of y = Ay.

We omit the proof of this theorem.

Example 10.5.5 Use Theorem 10.5.3 to find the general solution of                   (10.5.15)

                                                        0 0 1

                                                          -1 0 2

Solution The characteristic polynomial of the coefficient matrix A in (10.5.15) is

                            - 0                   1

                                    -1 1 -  1 = -( - 1)3.

                                    -1 0 2 - 

Hence, 1 = 1 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 3. The associated eigenvectors satisfy (A - I)x = 0. The

augmented matrix of this system is

                                       .. 
                                         -1 0 1 . 0

                                          -1 0 1 . 0

which is row equivalent to

                                                  0.0

Hence, x1 = x3 and x2 is arbitrary, so the eigenvectors are of the form

                                                  1            0
                                         x3

                            x1 =  x2  = x3  0  + x2  1  .

Therefore the vectors                 1                   0

                            x1 =  0  and x2 =  1                                    (10.5.16)

form a basis for the eigenspace, and

                                   1                             0

are linearly independent solutions of (10.5.15).

To find a third linearly independent solution of (10.5.15), we must find constants  and  (not both

zero) such that the system

                                      (A - I)u = x1 + x2                            (10.5.17)

has a solution u. The augmented matrix of this system is

Therefore (10.5.17) has a solution if and only if  = , where  is arbitrary. If  =  = 1 then (10.5.12)

and (10.5.16) yield

                                            1 0 1

and the augmented matrix (10.5.18) becomes

                                     1 0 -1 . -1

                                      00 0. 0

This implies that u1 = -1 + u3, while u2 and u3 are arbitrary. Choosing u2 = u3 = 0 yields

                                               -1 
                                         u =  0 .

                                                    0

Therefore (10.5.14) implies that

is a solution of (10.5.15). Since y1, y2, and y3 are linearly independent by Theorem 10.5.3, they form a
fundamental set of solutions for (10.5.15). Therefore the general solution of (10.5.15) is

Geometric Properties of Solutions when n = 2

has a repeated eigenvalue 1 and the associated eigenspace is one-dimensional. In this case we know
from Theorem 10.5.1 that the general solution of (10.5.19) is

                                  y = c1xe1t + c2(ue1t + xte1t),                                 (10.5.20)

   Let L denote the line through the origin parallel to x. By a half-line of L we mean either of the rays
obtained by removing the origin from L. Eqn. (10.5.20) is a parametric equation of the half-line of L in
the direction of x if c1 > 0, or of the half-line of L in the direction of -x if c1 < 0. The origin is the
trajectory of the trivial solution y  0.

   Henceforth, we assume that c2 = 0. In this case, the trajectory of (10.5.20) can't intersect L, since
every point of L is on a trajectory obtained by setting c2 = 0. Therefore the trajectory of (10.5.20) must
lie entirely in one of the open half-planes bounded by L, but does not contain any point on L. Since the
initial point (y1(0), y2(0)) defined by y(0) = c1x1 + c2u is on the trajectory, we can determine which
half-plane contains the trajectory from the sign of c2, as shown in Figure 552. For convenience we'll call
the half-plane where c2 > 0 the positive half-plane. Similarly, the-half plane where c2 < 0 is the negative
half-plane. You should convince yourself (Exercise 35) that even though there are infinitely many vectors
u that satisfy (10.5.21), they all define the same positive and negative half-planes. In the figures simply
regard u as an arrow pointing to the positive half-plane, since wen't attempted to give u its proper length
or direction in comparison with x. For our purposes here, only the relative orientation of x and u is
important; that is, whether the positive half-plane is to the right of an observer facing the direction of x
(as in Figures 10.5.2 and 10.5.5), or to the left of the observer (as in Figures 10.5.3 and 10.5.4).

   Multiplying (10.5.20) by e-1t yields

                                           e-1ty(t) = c1x + c2u + c2tx.

Since the last term on the right is dominant when |t| is large, this provides the following information on
the direction of y(t):
(a) Along trajectories in the positive half-plane (c2 > 0), the direction of y(t) approaches the direction

      of x as t   and the direction of -x as t  -.

(b) Along trajectories in the negative half-plane (c2 < 0), the direction of y(t) approaches the direction
      of -x as t   and the direction of x as t  -.

    Since

there are four possible patterns for the trajectories of (10.5.19), depending upon the signs of c2 and 1.
Figures 10.5.2-10.5.5 illustrate these patterns, and reveal the following principle:

   If 1 and c2 have the same sign then the direction of the traectory approaches the direction of -x as
 y  0 and the direction of x as y  . If 1 and c2 have opposite signs then the direction of the
trajectory approaches the direction of x as y  0 and the direction of -x as y  .

10.6 CONSTANT COEFFICIENT HOMOGENEOUS SYSTEMS III

We now consider the system y = Ay, where A has a complex eigenvalue  =  + i with  = 0.
We continue to assume that A has real entries, so the characteristic polynomial of A has real coefficients.
This implies that  =  - i is also an eigenvalue of A.

   An eigenvector x of A associated with  =  + i will have complex entries, so we'll write

                                 x = u + iv

where u and v have real entries; that is, u and v are the real and imaginary parts of x. Since Ax = x,

                         A(u + iv) = ( + i)(u + iv).                                      (10.6.1)

Taking complex conjugates here and recalling that A has real entries yields

                         A(u - iv) = ( - i)(u - iv),

which shows that x = u - iv is an eigenvector associated with  =  - i. The complex conjugate
eigenvalues  and  can be separately associated with linearly independent solutions y = Ay; however,
we won't pursue this approach, since solutions obtained in this way turn out to be complex-valued.
Instead, we'll obtain solutions of y = Ay in the form

                                 y = f1u + f2v                                            (10.6.2)

where f1 and f2 are real-valued scalar functions. The next theorem shows how to do this.
558 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

Theorem 10.6.1 Let A be an n  n matrix with real entries. Let  =  + i ( = 0) be a complex
eigenvalue of A and let x = u + iv be an associated eigenvector, where u and v have real components.
Then u and v are both nonzero and

                 y1 = et(u cos t - v sin t) and y2 = et(u sin t + v cos t),

which are the real and imaginary parts of

                           et(cos t + i sin t)(u + iv),                             (10.6.3)

are linearly independent solutions of y = Ay.

Proof A function of the form (10.6.2) is a solution of y = Ay if and only if

                           f1u + f2v = f1Au + f2Av.                                 (10.6.4)

Carrying out the multiplication indicated on the right side of (10.6.1) and collecting the real and imaginary
parts of the result yields

                                      A(u + iv) = (u - v) + i(v + u).

Equating real and imaginary parts on the two sides of this equation yields

                                           Au = u - v
                                           Av = v + u.

We leave it to you (Exercise 25) to show from this that u and v are both nonzero. Substituting from these
equations into (10.6.4) yields

                    f1u + f2v = f1(u - v) + f2(v + u)
                                    = (f1 + f2)u + (-f1 + f2)v.

This is true if

                 f1 = f1 + f2              or, equivalently,        f1 - f1 = f2
                 f2 = -f1 + f2,                                     f2 - f2 = -f1.

If we let f1 = g1et and f2 = g2et, where g1 and g2 are to be determined, then the last two equations

become                                     g1 = g2

                                           g2 = -g1,

which implies that

                                           g1 = g2 = -2g1,

so
                                                     g1 + 2g1 = 0.

The general solution of this equation is

                           g1 = c1 cos t + c2 sin t.

Moreover, since g2 = g1/,

                           g2 = -c1 sin t + c2 cos t.
                            Section 10.6 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Systems III 559

Multiplying g1 and g2 by et shows that        et( c1 cos t + c2 sin t),
                                              et(-c1 sin t + c2 cos t).
                                        f1 =
                                        f2 =

Substituting these into (10.6.2) shows that                                                     (10.6.5)
                       y = et [(c1 cos t + c2 sin t)u + (-c1 sin t + c2 cos t)v]
                           = c1et(u cos t - v sin t) + c2et(u sin t + v cos t)

is a solution of y = Ay for any choice of the constants c1 and c2. In particular, by first taking c1 = 1
and c2 = 0 and then taking c1 = 0 and c2 = 1, we see that y1 and y2 are solutions of y = Ay. We leave
it to you to verify that they are, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of (10.6.3) (Exercise 26), and

that they are linearly independent (Exercise 27).

                                              y = 4 -5 y.                                       (10.6.6)
                                                       5 -2

Solution The characteristic polynomial of the coefficient matrix A in (10.6.6) is

                            4 -  -5 = ( - 1)2 + 16.
                              5 -2 - 

Hence,  = 1 + 4i is an eigenvalue of A. The associated eigenvectors satisfy (A - (1 + 4i) I) x = 0.
The augmented matrix of this system is

                             .. 
                               3 - 4i -5 . 0

                             . ,
                                  5 -3 - 4i .. 0

which is row equivalent to

                                                          .    
                                                  3+4i .
                                              1-           .0

                                              0 0 .0

Therefore x1 = (3 + 4i)x2/5. Taking x2 = 5 yields x1 = 3 + 4i, so

                                              x = 3 + 4i 5

is an eigenvector. The real and imaginary parts of

are  y1 = et 3 cos 4t - 4 sin 4t 5 cos 4t           and y2 = et 3 sin 4t + 4 cos 4t 5 sin 4t ,

which are linearly independent solutions of (10.6.6). The general solution of (10.6.6) is

     y = c1et 3 cos 4t - 4 sin 4t 5 cos 4t + c2et 3 sin 4t + 4 cos 4t 5 sin 4t .

Solution The characteristic polynomial of the coefficient matrix A in (10.6.7) is

                            -14 -  39 = ( - 1)2 + 9.
                               -6 16 - 

Hence,  = 1 + 3i is an eigenvalue of A. The associated eigenvectors satisfy (A - (1 + 3i)I) x = 0.
The augmented augmented matrix of this system is

                             ..

                                   -6 15 - 3i .. 0

which is row equivalent to

                                  0 0 .0

Therefore x1 = (5 - i)/2. Taking x2 = 2 yields x1 = 5 - i, so

                               x= 5-i
                                          2

is an eigenvector. The real and imaginary parts of

are

Geometric Properties of Solutions when n = 2
We'll now consider the geometric properties of solutions of a 2  2 constant coefficient system

under the assumptions of this section; that is, when the matrix

                                       A=      a11 a12
                                               a21 a22

has a complex eigenvalue  =  + i ( = 0) and x = u + iv is an associated eigenvector, where
u and v have real components. To describe the trajectories accurately it's necessary to introduce a new
rectangular coordinate system in the y1-y2 plane. This raises a point that hasn't come up before: It is
always possible to choose x so that (u, v) = 0. A special effort is required to do this, since not every
eigenvector has this property. However, if we know an eigenvector that doesn't, we can multiply it by a
suitable complex constant to obtain one that does. To see this, note that if x is a -eigenvector of A and
k is an arbitrary real number, then

     x1 = (1 + ik)x = (1 + ik)(u + iv) = (u - kv) + i(v + ku)
564 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

is also a -eigenvector of A, since

Ax1 = A((1 + ik)x) = (1 + ik)Ax = (1 + ik)x = ((1 + ik)x) = x1.

The real and imaginary parts of x1 are

                         u1 = u - kv and v1 = v + ku,                                   (10.6.11)

so
                (u1, v1) = (u - kv, v + ku) = - (u, v)k2 + ( v 2 - u 2)k - (u, v) .

Therefore (u1, v1) = 0 if (u, v)k2 + ( v 2 - u 2)k - (u, v) = 0.                        (10.6.12)

If (u, v) = 0 we can use the quadratic formula to find two real values of k such that (u1, v1) = 0
(Exercise 28).

                         x = 3 + 4i 5 = 35 + i 40

for the matrix of the system (10.6.6). Here u = 3 and v = 4 are not orthogonal, since

(u, v) = 12. Since v 2 - u 2 = -18, (10.6.12) is equivalent to

                                        2k2 - 3k - 2 = 0.

The zeros of this equation are k1 = 2 and k2 = -1/2. Letting k = 2 in (10.6.11) yields

u1 = u - 2v = -55 and v1 = v + 2u = 10 10 ,

and (u1, v1) = 0. Letting k = -1/2 in (10.6.11) yields
                           u1 = u + v2 = 55 and v1 = v - u2 = 1 -5 2 5 ,

and again (u1, v1) = 0.

   (The numbers don't always work out as nicely as in this example. You'll need a calculator or computer

to do Exercises 29-40.)
   Henceforth, we'll assume that (u, v) = 0. Let U and V be unit vectors in the directions of u and v,

respectively; that is, U = u/ u and V = v/ v . The new rectangular coordinate system will have the
same origin as the y1-y2 system. The coordinates of a point in this system will be denoted by (z1, z2),
where z1 and z2 are the displacements in the directions of U and V, respectively.

   From (10.6.5), the solutions of (10.6.10) are given by

y = et [(c1 cos t + c2 sin t)u + (-c1 sin t + c2 cos t)v] .                             (10.6.13)

For convenience, let's call the curve traversed by e-ty(t) a shadow trajectory of (10.6.10). Multiplying

(10.6.13) by e-t yields             e-ty(t) = z1(t)U + z2(t)V,
                             Section 10.6 Constant Coefficient Homogeneous Systems III 565

where

                         z1(t) =     u (c1 cos t + c2 sin t)
                         z2(t) =     v (-c1 sin t + c2 cos t).

Therefore                    (z1(t))2 (z2(t))2 2 2

                             u2      +       v  2 = c1 + c2

(verify!), which means that the shadow trajectories of (10.6.10) are ellipses centered at the origin, with
axes of symmetry parallel to U and V. Since

                         z1 =  u z2 and z2 = -  v z1,
                             v                      u

the vector from the origin to a point on the shadow ellipse rotates in the same direction that V would have
to be rotated by /2 radians to bring it into coincidence with U (Figures 10.6.1 and 10.6.2).

If  = 0, then any trajectory of (10.6.10) is a shadow trajectory of (10.6.10); therefore, if  is

purely imaginary, then the trajectories of (10.6.10) are ellipses traversed periodically as indicated in Fig-

ures 10.6.1 and 10.6.2.

If  > 0, then

                         lim y(t) =  and lim y(t) = 0,
                         t                      t-

so the trajectory spirals away from the origin as t varies from - to . The direction of the spiral

depends upon the relative orientation of U and V, as shown in Figures 10.6.3 and 10.6.4.

If  < 0, then

                         lim y(t) =  and lim y(t) = 0,
                         t-                     t

so the trajectory spirals toward the origin as t varies from - to . Again, the direction of the spiral
depends upon the relative orientation of U and V, as shown in Figures 10.6.5 and 10.6.6.

10.7 VARIATION OF PARAMETERS FOR NONHOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS

We now consider the nonhomogeneous linear system

                                                   y = A(t)y + f (t),

where A is an n  n matrix function and f is an n-vector forcing function. Associated with this system is
the complementary system y = A(t)y.

   The next theorem is analogous to Theorems 5.3.2 and 9.1.5. It shows how to find the general solution
of y = A(t)y + f (t) if we know a particular solution of y = A(t)y + f (t) and a fundamental set of
solutions of the complementary system. We leave the proof as an exercise (Exercise 21).

Theorem 10.7.1 Suppose the n  n matrix function A and the n-vector function f are continuous on
(a, b). Let yp be a particular solution of y = A(t)y + f (t) on (a, b), and let {y1, y2, . . . , yn} be a
fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation y = A(t)y on (a, b). Then y is a solution
of y = A(t)y + f (t) on (a, b) if and only if

                                        y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2 +    + cnyn,

where c1, c2, . . . , cn are constants.

Finding a Particular Solution of a Nonhomogeneous System

We now discuss an extension of the method of variation of parameters to linear nonhomogeneous systems.
This method will produce a particular solution of a nonhomogenous system y = A(t)y + f (t) provided
that we know a fundamental matrix for the complementary system. To derive the method, suppose Y is a
fundamental matrix for the complementary system; that is,

is a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary system. In Section 10.3 we saw that Y = A(t)Y .

We seek a particular solution of

                                    yp = Y u,                          (10.7.2)
570 Chapter 10 Linear Systems of Differential Equations

where u is to be determined. Differentiating (10.7.2) yields

                                      yp = Y u + Y u
                                             = AY u + Y u (since Y = AY )
                                             = Ayp + Y u (since Y u = yp).

Comparing this with (10.7.1) shows that yp = Y u is a solution of (10.7.1) if and only if

                                                         Yu = f.

Thus, we can find a particular solution yp by solving this equation for u , integrating to obtain u, and
computing Y u. We can take all constants of integration to be zero, since any particular solution will
suffice.

   Exercise 22 sketches a proof that this method is analogous to the method of variation of parameters
discussed in Sections 5.7 and 9.4 for scalar linear equations.

Example 10.7.1

(a) Find a particular solution of the system

                                                12          2e4t

                                                21          e

      which we considered in Example 10.2.1.
(b) Find the general solution of (10.7.3).

SOLUTION(a) The complementary system is

                y = 1 2 2 1 y.                                        (10.7.4)

The characteristic polynomial of the coefficient matrix is

                1 -  2 2 1 -  = ( + 1)( - 3).

Using the method of Section 10.4, we find that

                          e3t                   and y2 =       e-t
                y1 = 3t

                          e

are linearly independent solutions of (10.7.4). Therefore

                Y=                              e3t e-t
                                                e3t -e-t

is a fundamental matrix for (10.7.4). We seek a particular solution yp = Y u of (10.7.3), where Y u = f ;

                                                                             2e       2

                   u2 =                    1 e3t 2e4t                  = e = e 7t 1 5t.

Therefore                                                  1 3et

                                           u=              2e     5t .

Integrating and taking the constants of integration to be zero yields

                                           u= 1                   15et
                                                                    5t ,
                                                           10 e

so                                 1 e3t e-t
                   yp = Y u = 10 3t -t

is a particular solution of (10.7.3).

SOLUTION(b) From Theorem 10.7.1, the general solution of (10.7.3) is

           y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2 =          1 8e4t                            e3t              e-t
                                                           4t + c1 3t + c2                     -t ,  (10.7.5)

which can also be written as

                              y=       1 8e4t                     e3t     e-t

where c is an arbitrary constant vector.
   Writing (10.7.5) in terms of coordinates yields

                                       y1 = 8 e4t + c1e3t + c2e-t
                                                  5

                                       y2 = 7 e4t + c1e3t - c2e-t,
                                                  5

so our result is consistent with Example 10.2.1.                                                     .

    If A isn't a constant matrix, it's usually difficult to find a fundamental set of solutions for the system

y = A(t)y. It is beyond the scope of this text to discuss methods for doing this. Therefore, in the

following examples and in the exercises involving systems with variable coefficient matrices we'll provide

fundamental matrices for the complementary systems without explaining how they were obtained.

IN THIS CHAPTER we develop series representations of functions that will be used to solve partial
differential equations in Chapter 12.
SECTION 11.1 deals with five boundary value problems for the differential equation

                                                       y + y = 0.
They are related to problems in partial differential equations that will be discussed in Chapter 12. We
define what is meant by eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the boundary value problems, and show that
the eigenfunctions have a property called orthogonality.
SECTION 11.2 introduces Fourier series, which are expansions of given functions in term of sines and
cosines.
SECTION 11.3 deals with expansions of functions in terms of the eigenfunctions of four of the eigenvalue
problems discussed in Section 11.1. They are all related to the Fourier series discussed in Section 11.2.

11.1 EIGENVALUE PROBLEMS FOR y + y = 0

In Chapter 12 we'll study partial differential equations that arise in problems of heat conduction, wave

propagation, and potential theory. The purpose of this chapter is to develop tools required to solve these

equations. In this section we consider the following problems, where  is a real number and L > 0:

Problem 1:                   y + y = 0, y(0) = 0, y(L) = 0

Problem 2:                   y + y = 0, y (0) = 0, y (L) = 0

Problem 3:                   y + y = 0, y(0) = 0, y (L) = 0

Problem 4:                   y + y = 0, y (0) = 0, y(L) = 0

Problem 5:                   y + y = 0, y(-L) = y(L), y (-L) = y (L)

   In each problem the conditions following the differential equation are called boundary conditions. Note
that the boundary conditions in Problem 5, unlike those in Problems 1-4, don't require that y or y be zero
at the boundary points, but only that y have the same value at x = 켏 , and that y have the same value
at x = 켏. We say that the boundary conditions in Problem 5 are periodic.

   Obviously, y  0 (the trivial solution) is a solution of Problems 1-5 for any value of . For most values
of , there are no other solutions. The interesting question is this:

   For what values of  does the problem have nontrivial solutions, and what are they?
   A value of  for which the problem has a nontrivial solution is an eigenvalue of the problem, and
the nontrivial solutions are -eigenfunctions, or eigenfunctions associated with . Note that a nonzero
constant multiple of a -eigenfunction is again a -eigenfunction.
   Problems 1-5 are called eigenvalue problems. Solving an eigenvalue problem means finding all its
eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions. We'll take it as given here that all the eigenvalues of Prob-
lems 1-5 are real numbers. This is proved in a more general setting in Section 13.2.

Theorem 11.1.1 Problems 1-5 have no negative eigenvalues. Moreover,  = 0 is an eigenvalue of
Problems 2 and 5, with associated eigenfunction y0 = 1, but  = 0 isn't an eigenvalue of Problems 1, 3,
or 4.

Proof We consider Problems 1-4, and leave Problem 5 to you (Exercise 1). If y  + y = 0, then
                                                                                          (11.1.1)
y(y + y) = 0, so

                                                                L

                                               y(x)(y (x) + y(x)) dx = 0;

                                                              0

therefore,                      L          L

                              y2(x) dx = - y(x)y (x) dx.

                             0          0

Integration by parts yields

            L                           L     L

               y(x)y (x) dx = y(x)y (x) - (y (x))2 dx

            0 00 L                                                             (11.1.2)

                                   = y(L)y (L) - y(0)y (0) - (y (x))2 dx.

                                                              0

However, if y satisfies any of the boundary conditions of Problems 1-4, then

                                y(L)y (L) - y(0)y (0) = 0;
582 Chapter 11 Boundary Value Problems and Fourier Expansions

hence, (11.1.1) and (11.1.2) imply that

                                         L                      L
                                      y2(x) dx = (y (x))2 dx.

                                     0                       0

If y  0, then  L  y2 (x)  dx  >  0.  Therefore      0  and,  if    =  0,  then  y  (x)  =  0  for  all  x  in  (0,  L)  (why?),
               0
and y is constant on (0, L). Any constant function satisfies the boundary conditions of Problem 2, so

 = 0 is an eigenvalue of Problem 2 and any nonzero constant function is an associated eigenfunction.

However, the only constant function that satisfies the boundary conditions of Problems 1, 3, or 4 is y  0.

Therefore  = 0 isn't an eigenvalue of any of these problems.

Example 11.1.1 (Problem 1) Solve the eigenvalue problem

                                     y + y = 0, y(0) = 0, y(L) = 0.                                                     (11.1.3)

Solution From Theorem 11.1.1, any eigenvalues of (11.1.3) must be positive. If y satisfies (11.1.3) with

 > 0, then                                                            

                                     y = c1 cos  x + c2 sin  x,

where c1 and c2 are constants. The boundary condition y(0) = 0                     implies that c1 = 0.             Therefore
y = c2 sin  x. Now the boundary conditiony(L) = 0 implies                          that c2 sin  L = 0.               To make
c2 sin  L = 0 with c2 = 0, we must choose  = n/L, where                            n is a positive integer.         Therefore
n = n22/L2 is an eigenvalue and

                                                      yn = sin nx
                                                                    L

is an associated eigenfunction.

For future reference, we state the result of Example 11.1.1 as a theorem.

                                      y + y = 0, y(0) = 0, y (L) = 0.

Solution From Theorem 11.1.1, any eigenvalues of (11.1.4) must be positive. If y satisfies (11.1.4) with

 > 0, then                                                  

                                 y = c1 cos  x + c2 sin  x,

where c1 and c2 are constants. The boundary condition y(0) = 0 implies that c1 = 0. Therefore
y = c2 sin  x. Hence, y = c2  cos  x and the boundary condition y (L) = 0 implies that
c2 cos  L = 0. To make c2 cos  L = 0 with c2 = 0 we must choose

                                        = (2n - 1) ,

where c1 and c2 are constants. The boundary condition y(-L) = y(L) implies that

                                                                          
       c1 cos(-  L) + c2 sin(-  L) = c1 cos  L + c2 sin  L.                          (11.1.7)

Since                                                                     

                       cos(-  L) = cos  L and sin(-  L) = - sin  L,                  (11.1.8)
                                                                                     (11.1.9)
(11.1.7) implies that                          
                                        c2 sin  L = 0.

Differentiating (11.1.6) yields

                                                          
                                 y =  -c1 sin x + c2 cos x .

The boundary condition y (-L) = y (L) implies that

                                                                            
       -c1 sin(-  L) + c2 cos(-  L) = -c1 sin  L + c2 cos  L,

and (11.1.8) implies that                 

                                        c1 sin  L = 0.                               (11.1.10)

Eqns. (11.1.9) and (11.1.10) imply that c1 = c2 = 0 unless  = n/L, where n is a positive integer.

In this case (11.1.9) and (11.1.10) both hold for arbitrary c1 and c2. The eigenvalue determined in this
way is n = n22/L2, and each such eigenvalue has the linearly independent associated eigenfunctions

                                    cos nx and      sin nx .

For future reference we state the result of Example 11.1.3 as a theorem.

Theorem 11.1.6 The eigenvalue problem

                           y + y = 0, y(-L) = y(L), y (-L) = y (L),

has the eigenvalue 0 = 0, with associated eigenfunction y0 = 1 and infinitely many positive eigenvalues
n = n22/L2, with associated eigenfunctions

There are no other eigenvalues.

Orthogonality

We say that two integrable functions f and g are orthogonal on an interval [a, b] if

                                                                           b

                                                      f(x)g(x) dx = 0.

                                                                          a

More generally, we say that the functions 1, 2, . . . , n, . . . (finitely or infinitely many) are orthogonal
on [a, b] if

                                                        b

                                         i(x)j(x) dx = 0 whenever i = j.

                                                      a

The importance of orthogonality will become clear when we study Fourier series in the next two sections.

Example 11.1.4 Show that the eigenfunctions

of Problem 5 are orthogonal on [-L, L].

Solution We must show that                L

                                             f(x)g(x) dx = 0                               (11.1.12)

                                         -L

whenever f and g are distinct functions from (11.1.11). If r is any nonzero integer, then

                                L rx                  L rx L
                                    cos dx = sin                   = 0.                    (11.1.13)
                                         L            r     L -L
                                -L

and                             L rx                  L rx L

                            -L sin L dx = - r cos L -L = 0.

Therefore (11.1.12) holds if f  1 and g is any other function in (11.1.11).
   If f(x) = cos mx/L and g(x) = cos nx/L where m and n are distinct positive integers, then

                            L L f(x)g(x) dx = cos mx cos nx dx.                            (11.1.14)

                            -L                     -L

To evaluate this integral, we use the identity

                            cos A cos B = 1 [cos(A - B) + cos(A + B)]
                                              2

with A = mx/L and B = nx/L. Then (11.1.14) becomes

         L f(x)g(x) dx = 1              L cos (m - n)x L dx + cos (m + n)x dx .
                                2                     L                     L
     -L                             -L                         -L

Since m - n and m + n are both nonzero integers, (11.1.13) implies that the integrals on the right are
both zero. Therefore (11.1.12) is true in this case.

   If f(x) = sin mx/L and g(x) = sin nx/L where m and n are distinct positive integers, then

                            L L f(x)g(x) dx = sin mx sin nx dx.                            (11.1.15)

                            sin A sin B = 1 [cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)]
                                              2

with A = mx/L and B = nx/L. Then (11.1.15) becomes

     L f(x)g(x) dx = 1              L cos (m - n)x L dx - cos (m + n)x dx = 0.

586 Chapter 11 Boundary Value Problems and Fourier Expansions

If f(x) = sin mx/L and g(x) = cos nx/L where m and n are positive integers (not necessarily

distinct), then

                 L L f(x)g(x) dx = sin mx cos nx dx = 0

because the integrand is an odd function and the limits are symmetric about x = 0.

11.2 FOURIER EXPANSIONS I

In Example 11.1.4 and Exercises 11.1.4-11.1.22 we saw that the eigenfunctions of Problem 5 are orthog-
onal on [-L, L] and the eigenfunctions of Problems 1-4 are orthogonal on [0, L]. In this section and the
next we introduce some series expansions in terms of these eigenfunctions. We'll use these expansions to
solve partial differential equations in Chapter 12.

Theorem 11.2.1 Suppose the functions 1, 2, 3, . . . , are orthogonal on [a, b] and

                            b                                  n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..            (11.2.1)

Let c1, c2, c3,. . . be constants such that the partial sums fN (x) = m=1 N cmm(x) satisfy the inequalities

|fN (x)|  M, a  x  b, N = 1, 2, 3, . . .

for some constant M < . Suppose also that the series                                          (11.2.2)

converges and is integrable on [a, b]. Then

588 Chapter 11 Boundary Value Problems and Fourier Expansions

Proof Multiplying (11.2.2) by n and integrating yields

                     b                                       b        

                        f(x)n(x) dx = n(x)                              cmm(x) dx.                                 (11.2.4)

It can be shown that the boundedness of the partial sums {fN } N=1 and the integrability of f allow us to
interchange the operations of integration and summation on the right of (11.2.4), and rewrite (11.2.4) as

                        b                                           b

                           f(x)n(x) dx = cm                           n(x)m(x) dx.                                 (11.2.5)

                        a                                 m=1      a

(This isn't easy to prove.) Since

                                    b                                      m = n,

                                      n(x)m(x) dx = 0 if

                                   a

(11.2.5) reduces to

                                    b                              b    2
                                                                        n
                                      f(x)n(x) dx = cn                     (x  )  d  x  .

Now (11.2.1) implies (11.2.3).
   Theorem 11.2.1 motivates the next definition.

Definition 11.2.2 Suppose 1, 2, . . . , n,. . . are orthogonal on [a, b] and               b  2n(x)  dx  =  0,  n  =  1,  2,  3,
                                                                                           a
. . . . Let f be integrable on [a, b], and define

                                   b

                                      f(x)n(x) dx

                           cn =    ab ,                            n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..                             (11.2.6)

                                                   2  (x  )  d  x
                                                   n
                                      a

Then the infinite series n=1  cnn(x) is called the Fourier expansion of f in terms of the orthogonal
set {n} n=1, and c1, c2, . . . , cn, . . . are called the Fourier coefficients of f with respect to {n} n=1. We
indicate the relationship between f and its Fourier expansion by

                                                                   a  x  b.                                        (11.2.7)

                                   f(x)  cnn(x),

                                                 n=1

You may wonder why we don't write

                                                                   a  x  b,

                                   f(x) = cnn(x),

                                                 n=1

rather than (11.2.7). Unfortunately, this isn't always true. The series on the right may diverge for some or
all values of x in [a, b], or it may converge to f(x) for some values of x and not for others. So, for now,
we'll just think of the series as being associated with f because of the definition of the coefficients {cn},
and we'll indicate this association informally as in (11.2.7).

Fourier series of f on [-L, L]. Since

                                                                               L

                                                                             -L

                                                                                         -L

and

                                                                                       -L

we see from (11.2.6) that the Fourier series of f on [-L, L] is

                                        nx nx
                               a0 +       an cos L + bn sin L ,

                                     n=1

where                                           L

                                        a0 = 1    f(x) dx,
                                             2L -L

                 1L                 nx              1L                    nx
           an =            f(x) cos dx, and bn =                   f(x) sin dx, n  1.

Note that a0 is the average value of f on [-L, L], while an and bn (for n  1) are twice the average

values of                      f(x) cos nx and f(x) sin nx

                                          L                        L

on [-L, L], respectively.

Convergence of Fourier Series

The question of convergence of Fourier series for arbitrary integrable functions is beyond the scope of
this book. However, we can state a theorem that settles this question for most functions that arise in
applications.

Definition 11.2.3 A function f is said to be piecewise smooth on [a, b] if:
(a) f has at most finitely many points of discontinuity in (a, b);
(b) f exists and is continuous except possibly at finitely many points in (a, b);

(c) f(x0+) = limxx0+ f(x) and f (x0+) = limxx0+ f (x) exist if a  x0 < b;
(d) f(x0-) = limxx0- f(x) and f (x0-) = limxx0- f (x) exist if a < x0  b.

   Since f and f are required to be continuous at all but finitely many points in [a, b], f(x0+) = f(x0-)
and f (x0+) = f (x0-) for all but finitely many values of x0 in (a, b). Recall from Section 8.1 that f is
said to have a jump discontinuity at x0 if f(x0+) = f(x0-).

   The next theorem gives sufficient conditions for convergence of a Fourier series. The proof is beyond

the scope of this book.
590 Chapter 11 Boundary Value Problems and Fourier Expansions

Theorem 11.2.4 If f is piecewise smooth on [-L, L], then the Fourier series

            F (x) = a0 +      nx nx
                                  an cos L + bn sin L                              (11.2.8)

                          n=1

of f on [-L, L] converges for all x in [-L, L]; moreover,

                    f (x)      if -L < x < L and f is continuous at x
                               if -L < x < L and f is discontinuous at x
             f(x-) + f(x+)     if x = L or x = -L.
                      2
          
F (x) =     f(-L+) + f(L-)
                      2
          
          
          

Since f(x+) = f(x-) if f is continuous at x, we can also say that

                     
                      f(x+) + f(x-)
                               2                           if - L < x < L,
            F (x) =   f(L-) + f(-L+)                       if x = 켏.

                               2

   Note that F is itself piecewise smooth on [-L, L], and F (x) = f(x) at all points in the open interval
(-L, L) where f is continuous. Since the series in (11.2.8) converges to F (x) for all x in [-L, L], you
may be tempted to infer that the error

                                  N nx nx
EN (x) = F (x) - a0 -               an cos L + bn sin L

                               n=1

can be made as small as we please for all x in [-L, L] by choosing N sufficiently large. However, this
isn't true if f has a discontinuity somewhere in (-L, L), or if f(-L+) = f(L-). Here's the situation in
this case.

   If f has a jump discontinuity at a point  in (-L, L), there will be sequences of points {uN } and {vN }
in (-L, ) and (, L), respectively, such that

                       lim uN = lim vN = 
                       N            N 

and
                EN (uN )  .09|f(-) - f(+)| and EN (vN )  .09|f(-) - f(+)|.

Thus, the maximum value of the error EN (x) near  does not approach zero as N  , but just occurs
closer and closer to (and on both sides of ) , and is essentially independent of N .

   If f(-L+) = f(L-), then there will be sequences of points {uN } and {vN } in (-L, L) such that

                     lim uN = -L, lim vN = L,
                     N              N 

EN (uN )  .09|f(-L+) - f(L-)| and EN (vN )  .09|f(-L+) - f(L-)|.

   This is the Gibbs phenomenon. Having been alerted to it, you may see it in Figures 11.2.2-11.2.4,
below; however, we'll give a specific example at the end of this section.

Solution Note that wen't bothered to define f(-2), f(0), and f(2). No matter how they may be defined,
f is piecewise smooth on [-2, 2], and the coefficients in the Fourier series

                                       n=1

are not affected by them. In any case, Theorem 11.2.4 implies that F (x) = f(x) in (-2, 0) and (0, 2),
where f is continuous, while

                   F (-2) = F (2) = f(-2+) + f(2-) = 1 2 + 1 = 5

and                      F (0) = f(0-) + f(0+) = 1 0 + 1              = 1.
                                                                         4

Even and Odd Functions

Computing the Fourier coefficients of a function f can be tedious; however, the computation can often be
simplified by exploiting symmetries in f or some of its terms. To focus on this, we recall some concepts
that you studied in calculus. Let u and v be defined on [-L, L] and suppose that

u(-x) = u(x) and v(-x) = -v(x), -L  x  L.

Then we say that u is an even function and v is an odd function. Note that:
      The product of two even functions is even.

 The product of two odd functions is even.

 The product of an even function and an odd function is odd.

Example 11.2.2 The functions u(x) = cos x and u(x) = x2 are even, while v(x) = sin x and
v(x) = x3 are odd. The function w(x) = ex is neither even nor odd.

   You learned parts (a) and (b) of the next theorem in calculus, and the other parts follow from them
(Exercise 1).

Theorem 11.2.5 Suppose u is even and v is odd on [-L, L]. Then:

                       L                  L                      L

the terms in (11.2.12) for which n = 2m are all zeros. Therefore we only to include the terms for which
n = 2m + 1; that is, we can rewrite (11.2.12) as

                                     4 1
                          F (x) = 2 -  (2m + 1)2 cos(2m + 1)x.

                                                      m=0

However, since the name of the index of summation doesn't matter, we prefer to replace m by n, and

write                                4 1
                          F (x) = 2 -  (2n + 1)2 cos(2n + 1)x.

                                                      n=0

Since |x| is continuous for all x and | - | = ||, Theorem 11.2.4 implies that F (x) = |x| for all x in
[-, ].

thus, F (as well as f) has unit jump discontinuities at x =  12 . Figures 11.2.6-11.2.7 show the graphs of
y = f(x) and

for N = 10, 20, and 30. You can see that although F2N-1 approximates F (and therefore f) well on

larger intervals as N increases, the maximum absolute values of the errors remain approximately equal
to .09, but occur closer to the discontinuities x =  12 as N increases.

 USING TECHNOLOGY

   The computation of Fourier coefficients will be tedious in many of the exercises in this chapter and
the next. To learn the technique, we recommend that you do some exercises in each section "by hand,"
perhaps using the table of integrals at the front of the book. However, we encourage you to use your
favorite symbolic computation software in the more difficult problems.

In this section we discuss Fourier expansions in terms of the eigenfunctions of Problems 1-4 for Sec-
tion 11.1.

(Problem 2) are orthogonal on [0, L]. If f is integrable on [0, L] then the Fourier expansion of f in terms
of these functions is called the Fourier cosine series of f on [0, L]. This series is

                                                  nx

Fourier series of the function

   We'll call this expansion the mixed Fourier cosine series of f on [0, L], because the boundary condi-
tions of (11.3.2) are "mixed" in that they require y to be zero at one boundary point and y to be zero at the
other. By contrast, the "ordinary" Fourier cosine series is associated with (11.3.1), where the boundary
conditions require that y be zero at both endpoints.

   It can be shown (Exercise 57) that the mixed Fourier cosine series of f on [0, L] is simply the restriction
to [0, L] of the Fourier cosine series of

                             f3(x) =     f (x),     0  x  L,

A Useful Observation

In applications involving expansions in terms of the eigenfunctions of Problems 1-4, the functions being
expanded are often polynomials that satisfy the boundary conditions of the problem under consideration.
In this case the next theorem presents an efficient way to obtain the coefficients in the expansion.

Theorem 11.3.5

                             f(x) = a0 + an cos L ,                                       (11.3.4)

Proof We'll prove (a) and leave the rest to you (Exercises 35, 42, and 50). Since f is continuous on
[0, L], Theorem 11.3.1 implies (11.3.3) with a0, a1, a2,... as defined in Theorem 11.3.1. We already know
that a0 is as in (11.3.4). If n  1, integrating twice by parts yields

            2L                 nx
      an =                     f(x) cos dx

            2 nx L L nx
      = n f(x) sin L 0 0 - f (x) sin L dx

      = - 2 L f (x) sin nx dx (since sin 0 = sin n = 0)
            n 0                                        L

             2L nx L L nx
      = n22 f (x) cos L 0 0 - f (x) cos L dx

               2L              L f (x) cos nx dx (since f (0) = f (L) = 0)
      = -22                                               L
            n 0

            2L2                                        nx L L nx
      = - n33 f (x) sin L 0 0 - f (x) sin L dx

            2L2 L                                      nx
      = 3 3 f (x) sin dx (since sin 0 = sin n = 0).
            n 0                                           L

(By an argument similar to one used in the proof of Theorem 8.3.1, the last integration by parts is le-
gitimate in the case where f is undefined at finitely many points in [0, L], so long as it's piecewise
continuous on [0, L].) This completes the proof.

Solution Here     a0 = 1 (3Lx L 2 - 2x3) dx = 1                                L L3
                                                                               0= 2

and               a 2 L n = (3Lx2 - 2x3) cos nx dx, n  1.

                               L0                             L

Evaluating this integral directly is laborious. However, since f (x) = 6Lx - 6x2, we see that f (0) =

f (L) = 0. Since f (x) = -12, we see from (11.3.4) that if n  1 then

                         24L2  L nx             24L3 nx L 24L3                       n

Solution Since f(0) = f(L) = 0 and f (x) = 6(x - L), we see from (11.3.5) that

                                12L     L(x - L) sin nx dx
                  bn = - 2 2

12.1 THE HEAT EQUATION

We begin the study of partial differential equations with the problem of heat flow in a uniform bar of
length L, situated on the x axis with one end at the origin and the other at x = L (Figure 12.1.1).

   We assume that the bar is perfectly insulated except possibly at its endpoints, and that the temperature
is constant on each cross section and therefore depends only on x and t. We also assume that the thermal
properties of the bar are independent of x and t. In this case, it can be shown that the temperature
u = u(x, t) at time t at a point x units from the origin satisfies the partial differential equation

                                         ut = a2uxx, 0 < x < L, t > 0,

where a is a positive constant determined by the thermal properties. This is the heat equation.

            x = 0                                               x
                                           x = L

                        Figure 12.1.1 A uniform bar of length L

To determine u, we must specify the temperature at every point in the bar when t = 0, say

                        u(x, 0) = f(x), 0  x  L.

We call this the initial condition. We must also specify boundary conditions that u must satisfy at the

ends of the bar for all t > 0. We'll call this problem an initial-boundary value problem.

We begin with the boundary conditions u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0, and write the initial-boundary value

problem as

                        ut = a2uxx, 0 < x < L, t > 0,

                        u(0, t) = 0, u(L, t) = 0, t > 0,                                   (12.1.1)

                        u(x, 0) = f(x), 0  x  L.

Our method of solving this problem is called separation of variables (not to be confused with method
of separation of variables used in Section 2.2 for solving ordinary differential equations). We begin by
looking for functions of the form

                                                   v(x, t) = X(x)T (t)

that are not identically zero and satisfy

                        vt = a2vxx, v(0, t) = 0, v(L, t) = 0
620 Chapter 12 Fourier Solutions of Partial Differential

for all (x, t). Since                vt = XT and vxx = X T,
vt = a2vxx if and only if                     XT = a2X T,

which we rewrite as                      T =X .
                                        a2T X

Since the expression on the left is independent of x while the one on the right is independent of t, this

equation can hold for all (x, t) only if the two sides equal the same constant, which we call a separation

constant, and write it as -; thus,   X  T

                                        = 2 = -.
                                     X aT

This is equivalent to

                                        X + X = 0

and

                                        T = -a2T.                                              (12.1.2)

Since v(0, t) = X(0)T (t) = 0 and v(L, t) = X(L)T (t) = 0 and we don't want T to be identically zero,
X(0) = 0 and X(L) = 0. Therefore  must be an eigenvalue of the boundary value problem

                           X + X = 0, X(0) = 0, X(L) = 0,                                      (12.1.3)

and X must be a -eigenfunction. From Theorem 11.1.2, the eigenvalues of (12.1.3) are n = n22/L2,
with associated eigenfunctions

                                          Xn = sin nx , n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..
                                                        L

Substituting  = n22/L2 into (12.1.2) yields

                                                T = -(n22a2/L2)T,

which has the solution               Tn = e-n22a2t/L2 .

Now let  vn(x, t) = Xn(x)Tn(t) = e-n22a2t/L2 sin nx ,
                                                                L
                                                                   n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

Since                                vn(x, 0) = sin nx ,
                                                         L

vn satisfies (12.1.1) with f(x) = sin nx/L. More generally, if 1, . . . , m are constants and

                           um(x, t) = ne-n22a2t/L2 m sin nx ,
                                         n=1 L

then um satisfies (12.1.1) with                 m nx
This motivates the next definition.  f(x) = n sin L .

is the Fourier sine series of f on [0, L]; that is,

            L0                                       L

   We use the term "formal solution" in this definition because it's not in general true that the infinite
series in (12.1.5) actually satisfies all the requirements of the initial-boundary value problem (12.1.4)
when it does, we say that it's an actual solution of (12.1.4).

   Because of the negative exponentials in (12.1.5), u converges for all (x, t) with t > 0 (Exercise 54).
Since each term in (12.1.5) satisfies the heat equation and the boundary conditions in (12.1.4), u also has
these properties if ut and uxx can be obtained by differentiating the series in (12.1.5) term by term once
with respect to t and twice with respect to x, for t > 0. However, it's not always legitimate to differentiate
an infinite series term by term. The next theorem gives a useful sufficient condition for legitimacy of term
by term differentiation of an infinite series. We omit the proof.

Theorem 12.1.2 A convergent infinite series

                                                                                         n=1

can be differentiated term by term on a closed interval [z1, z2] to obtain

                                                                                           

                                                  W (z) = wn(z)

                                                                                          n=1

(where the derivatives at z = z1 and z = z2 are one-sided) provided that wn is continuous on [z1, z2]
and

                                |wn(z)|  Mn, z1  z  z2, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
where M1, M2, . . . , Mn, . . . , are constants such that the series n=1  Mn converges.

   Theorem 12.1.2, applied twice with z = x and once with z = t, shows that uxx and ut can be obtained
by differentiating u term by term if t > 0 (Exercise 54). Therefore u satisfies the heat equation and the
boundary conditions in (12.1.4) for t > 0. Therefore, since u(x, 0) = S(x) for 0  x  L, u is an actual
solution of (12.1.4) if and only if S(x) = f(x) for 0  x  L. From Theorem 11.3.2, this is true if f is
continuous and piecewise smooth on [0, L], and f(0) = f(L) = 0.

   In this chapter we'll define formal solutions of several kinds of problems. When we ask you to solve
such problems, we always mean that you should find a formal solution.

Nonhomogeneous Problems

A problem of the form

                         ut = a2uxx + h(x), 0 < x < L, t > 0,                                                                   (12.1.9)
                           u(0, t) = u0, u(L, t) = uL, t > 0,                                                                  (12.1.10)
                                 u(x, 0) = f(x), 0  x  L

can be transformed to a problem that can be solved by separation of variables. We write

                                   u(x, t) = v(x, t) + q(x),

where q is to be determined. Then

                                   ut = vt and uxx = vxx + q
                                                             Section 12.1 The Heat Equation 625

so u satisfies (12.1.9) if v satisfies

                              vt = a2vxx + a2q (x) + h(x), 0 < x < L, t > 0,
                              v(0, t) = u0 - q(0), v(L, t) = uL - q(L), t > 0,

                                        v(x, 0) = f(x) - q(x), 0  x  L.

This reduces to       vt = a2vxx, 0 < x < L, t > 0,
                      v(0, t) = 0, v(L, t) = 0, t > 0,
                      v(x, 0) = f(x) - q(x), 0  x  L                                (12.1.11)

if
                                   a2q + h(x) = 0, q(0) = u0, q(L) = uL.

We can obtain q by integrating q = -h/a2 twice and choosing the constants of integration so that
q(0) = u0 and q(L) = uL. Then we can solve (12.1.11) for v by separation of variables, and (12.1.10) is
the solution of (12.1.9).

Example 12.1.5 Solve

                          ut = uxx - 2, 0 < x < 1, t > 0,

                          u(0, t) = -1, u(1, t) = 1, t > 0,
                      u(x, 0) = x3 - 2x2 + 3x - 1, 0  x  1.

Solution We leave it to you to show that

                                          q(x) = x2 + x - 1

satisfies

                      q - 2 = 0, q(0) = -1, q(1) = 1.

Therefore

                      u(x, t) = v(x, t) + x2 + x - 1,

where

                       vt = vxx, 0 < x < 1, t > 0,
                      v(0, t) = 0, v(1, t) = 0, t > 0,

and
                        v(x, 0) = x3 - 2x2 + 3x - 1 - x2 - x + 1 = x(x2 - 3x + 2).

From Example 12.1.1 with a = 1 and L = 1,

                                          12  1 -n22t
                      v(x, t) = 3                 3e         sin nx.
                                           n=1 n

Therefore             2 12  1 -n22t

                      u(x, t) = x + x - 1 + 3         3e     sin nx.
                                            n=1 n

   A similar procedure works if the boundary conditions in (12.1.11) are replaced by mixed boundary
conditions

                                       ux(0, t) = u0, u(L, t) = uL, t > 0

or                                                                  t > 0;
                                      u(0, t) = u0, ux(L, t) = uL,

however, this isn't true in general for the boundary conditions

                       ux(0, t) = u0, ux(L, t) = uL, t > 0.

USING TECHNOLOGY

   Numerical experiments can enhance your understanding of the solutions of initial-boundary value prob-
lems. To be specific, consider the formal solution

                       u(x, t) = ne-n22a2t/L2  sin nx ,
                                   n=1 L

of (12.1.4), where

                                               nx
                                   S(x) = n sin L

                                                 n=1

is the Fourier sine series of f on [0, L]. Consider the m-th partial sum

                       um(x, t) = ne-n22a2t/L2 m sin nx .                           (12.1.12)
                                     n=1 L

For several fixed values of t (including t = 0), graph um(x, t) versus t. In some cases it may be useful to
graph the curves corresponding to the various values of t on the same axes in other cases you may want to

graph the various curves sucessively (for increasing values of t), and create a primitive motion picture on

your monitor. Repeat this experiment for several values of m, to compare how the results depend upon

m for small and large values of t. However, keep in mind that the meanings of "small" and "large" in this
case depend upon the constants a2 and L2. A good way to handle this is to rewrite (12.1.12) as

                                   um(x, t) = ne-n2 m sin nx ,
                                                 n=1 L

where                                    2a2t
                                   = 2 ,
                                                                                    (12.1.13)
                                          L

and graph um versus x for selected values of  .
   These comments also apply to the situations considered in Definitions 12.1.3-12.1.5, except that (12.1.13)

should be replaced by

                                         2a2t
                                   = 2 ,

In some of the exercises we say "perform numerical experiments." This means that you should perform

the computations just described with the formal solution obtained in the exercise.

     if t > t0 > 0, where t0 is an arbitrary positive number. Then argue that since t0 is arbitrary,
     the conclusion holds for all t > 0.

(e) Conclude from (c) and (d) that

                        ut = a2uxx, - < x < , t > 0.

By repeatedly applying the arguments in (a) and (c), it can be shown that u can be differentiated
term by term any number of times with respect to x and/or t if t > 0.

12.2 THE WAVE EQUATION

In this section we consider initial-boundary value problems of the form

                              utt = a2uxx, 0 < x < L, t > 0,                        (12.2.1)
                              u(0, t) = 0, u(L, t) = 0, t > 0,
                      u(x, 0) = f(x), ut(x, 0) = g(x), 0  x  L,

where a is a constant and f and g are given functions of x.
   The partial differential equation utt = a2uxx is called the wave equation. It is necessary to specify

both f and g because the wave equation is a second order equation in t for each fixed x.

   This equation and its generalizations

                      utt = a2(uxx + uyy) and utt = a2(uxx + uyy + uzz)

to two and three space dimensions have important applications to the the propagation of electromagnetic,
sonic, and water waves.

The Vibrating String

We motivate the study of the wave equation by considering its application to the vibrations of a string -
such as a violin string - tightly stretched in equilibrium along the x-axis in the xu-plane and tied to the
points (0, 0) and (L, 0) (Figure 12.2.1).

   If the string is plucked in the vertical direction and released at time t = 0, it will oscillate in the xu-
plane. Let u(x, t) denote the displacement of the point on the string above (or below) the abscissa x at
time t.

   We'll show that it's reasonable to assume that u satisfies the wave equation under the following as-
sumptions:

1. The mass density (mass per unit length)  of the string is constant throughout the string.

2. The tension T induced by tightly stretching the string along the x-axis is so great that all other
    forces, such as gravity and air resistance, can be neglected.

3. The tension at any point on the string acts along the tangent to the string at that point, and the
    magnitude of its horizontal component is always equal to T , the tension in the string in equilibrium.

4. The slope of the string at every point remains sufficiently small so that we can make the approxima-

tion

                     1 + u2x  1.                                                                                 (12.2.2)

   Figure 12.2.2 shows a segment of the displaced string at a time t > 0. (Don't think that the figure is
necessarily inconsistent with Assumption 4; we exaggerated the slope for clarity.)

   The vectors T1 and T2 are the forces due to tension, acting along the tangents to the segment at its
endpoints. From Newton's second law of motion, T1 - T2 is equal to the mass times the acceleration of
the center of mass of the segment. The horizontal and vertical components of T1 - T2 are

                     |T2| cos 2 - |T1| cos 1 and |T2| sin 2 - |T1| sin 1,

respectively. Since

                     |T2| cos 2 = |T1| cos 1 = T                                                                 (12.2.3)

by assumption, the net horizontal force is zero, so there's no horizontal acceleration. Since the initial
horizontal velocity is zero, there's no horizontal motion.

   Applying Newton's second law of motion in the vertical direction yields

                     |T2| sin 2 - |T1| sin 1 = s utt(x, t),                                                      (12.2.4)

                                  x < x < x + x.

From calculus, we know that        x+x
                                  x
                             s =                 1 + u2x(, t) d;

however, because of (12.2.2), we make the approximation

                                              x+x

                             s                     1 d = x,

                                              x

so (12.2.4) becomes

                             |T2| sin 2 - |T1| sin 1 = x utt(x, t).

Therefore                    |T2| sin 2 - |T1| sin 1 = utt(x, t).
                                         x

Recalling (12.2.3), we divide by T to obtain

                             tan 2 - tan 1 =  utt(x, t).                                  (12.2.5)
                                  x                T

Since tan 1 = ux(x, t) and tan 2 = ux(x + x, t), (12.2.5) is equivalent to

                             ux(x + x) - ux(x, t) =  utt(x, t).

Letting x  0 yields             uxx(x, t) =  utt(x, t),

which we rewrite as utt = a2uxx, with a2 = T /.

The Formal Solution

As in Section 12.1, we use separation of variables to obtain a suitable definition for the formal solution of

(12.2.1). We begin by looking for functions of the form v(x, t) = X(x)T (t) that are not identically zero

and satisfy
                                     vtt = a2vxx, v(0, t) = 0, v(L, t) = 0

for all (x, t). Since           vtt = XT and vxx = X T,
vtt = a2vxx if and only if                XT = a2X T,

which we rewrite as                   T =X .
                                      a2T X

For this to hold for all (x, t), the two sides must equal the same constant; thus,

                                      XT
                                           = 2 = -,

                                      X aT

which is equivalent to

                                      X + X = 0

and

                                      T + a2T = 0.                                            (12.2.6)

Since v(0, t) = X(0)T (t) = 0 and v(L, t) = X(L)T (t) = 0 and we don't want T to be identically zero,
X(0) = 0 and X(L) = 0. Therefore  must be an eigenvalue of

                                X + X = 0, X(0) = 0, X(L) = 0,                                (12.2.7)

and X must be a -eigenfunction. From Theorem 11.1.2, the eigenvalues of (12.2.7) are n = n22/L2,
with associated eigenfunctions

                                          Xn = sin nx , n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..
                                                        L

Substituting  = n22/L2 into (12.2.6) yields

                                               T + (n22a2/L2)T = 0,

which has the general solution

                                Tn = n cos nat + nL sin nat ,
                                      L na               L

where n and n are constants. Now let

     vn(x, t) = Xn(x)Tn(t) = n cos nat + nL sin nat                                 sin nx .
                                                 L na               L                     L
                                                                 Section 12.2 The Wave Equation 635

Then   vn (x, t) = - na n sin nat + n cos nat sin nx ,

       t                              L     L                        L         L

so          vn(x, 0) = n sin nx and vn (x, 0) = n sin nx .

                                         L                  t                  L

Therefore vn satisfies (12.2.1) with f(x) = n sin nx/L and g(x) = n cos nx/L. More generally, if
1, 2, . . . , m and 1, 2,. . . , m are constants and

                             m        n cos nat + nL sin nat              sin nx ,
                                            L na                 L              L
       um(x, t) =

                           n=1

then um satisfies (12.2.1) with

                                    m nx                         m nx
            f(x) = n sin L and g(x) = n sin L .
                                 n=1                             n=1

This motivates the next definition.

Definition 12.2.1 If f and g are piecewise smooth of [0, L], then the formal solution of (12.2.1) is

                                      n cos nat + nL sin nat            sin nx ,      (12.2.8)

            u(x, t) =

                             n=1

where               nx                                                   nx
       Sf (x) = n sin L and                                 Sg(x) = n sin L

                       n=1                                                  n=1

are the Fourier sine series of f and g on [0, L]; that is,

       n =  2L                        nx                         2L            nx
                                 f(x) sin dx and            n =         g(x) sin dx.

   Since there are no convergence-producing factors in (12.2.8) like the negative exponentials in t that

appear in formal solutions of initial-boundary value problems for the heat equation, it isn't obvious that

(12.2.8) even converges for any values of x and t, let alone that it can be differentiated term by term to
show that utt = a2uxx. However, the next theorem guarantees that the series converges not only for
0  x  L and t  0, but for - < x <  and - < t < .

Theorem 12.2.2 If f and g are pieceswise smooth on [0, L], then u in (12.2.1) converges for all (x, t),
and can be written as

                               = 2 [Sf (x + at) + Sf (x - at)].

Since it can be shown that a Fourier sine series can be integrated term by term between any two limits,
(12.2.11) implies that

                  nL sin nat sin nx =             1          x+at sin n d

                                                  2a x-at

This and (12.2.12) imply (12.2.9), which completes the proof.
   As we'll see below, if Sg is differentiable and Sf is twice differentiable on (-, ), then (12.2.9)

satisfies utt = a2uxx for all (x, t). We need the next theorem to formulate conditions on f and g such
that Sf and Sg to have these properties.

Theorem 12.2.3 Suppose h is differentiable on [0, L]; that is, h (x) exists for 0 < x < L, and the
one-sided derivatives

                 h+(0) = lim h(x) - h(0) and h-(L) = lim h(x) - h(L)
                        x0+    x                             xL- x - L

both exist.
   (a) Let p be the odd periodic extension of h to (-, ); that is,

             p(x) =     h(x),  0  x  L, and p(x + 2L) = p(x), - < x < .

                        -h(-x), -L < x < 0,

Then p is differentiable on (-, ) if and only if

                                     h(0) = h(L) = 0.                             (12.2.13)

(b) Let q be the even periodic extension of h to (-, ); that is,

             q(x) =      h(x), 0  x  L, and q(x + 2L) = q(x), - < x < .
                        h(-x), -L < x < 0,

Then q is differentiable on (-, ) if and only if

                                  h+(0) = h-(L) = 0.                              (12.2.14)

Proof Throughout this proof, k denotes an integer. Since f is differentiable on the open interval (0, L),
both p and q are differentiable on every open interval ((k - 1)L, kL). Thus, we need only to determine
whether p and q are differentiable at x = kL for every k.

   (a) From Figure 12.2.3, p is discontinuous at x = 2kL if h(0) = 0 and discontinuous at x = (2k - 1)L
if h(L) = 0. Therefore p is not differentiable on (-, ) unless h(0) = h(L) = 0. From Figure 12.2.4,
if h(0) = h(L) = 0, then

                                p (2kL) = h+(0) and p ((2k - 1)L) = h-(L)
for every k; therefore, p is differentiable on (-, ).

   (b) From Figure 12.2.5,

                                 q-(2kL) = -h+(0) and q+(2kL) = h+(0),
so q is differentiable at x = 2kL if and only if h+(0) = 0. Also,

                         q-((2k - 1)L) = h-(L) and q+((2k - 1)L) = -h-(L),
so q is differentiable at x = (2k - 1)L if and only if h-(L) = 0. Therefore q is differentiable on
(-, ) if and only if h+(0) = h-(L) = 0, as in Figure 12.2.6. This completes the proof.

Theorem 12.2.4 The formal solution of (12.2.1) is an actual solution if g is differentiable on [0, L] and

                                               g(0) = g(L) = 0,                    (12.2.15)

while f is twice differentiable on [0, L] and

                                               f(0) = f(L) = 0                     (12.2.16)

and

         f+(0) = f-(L) = 0.                                                        (12.2.17)

Proof We first show that Sg is differentiable and Sf is twice differentiable on (-, ). We'll then
differentiate (12.2.9) twice with respect to x and t and verify that (12.2.9) is an actual solution of (12.2.1).

   Since f and g are continuous on (0, L), Theorem 11.3.2 implies that Sf (x) = f(x) and Sg(x) = g(x)
on [0, L]. Therefore Sf and Sg are the odd periodic extensions of f and g. Since f and g are differen-
tiable on [0, L], (12.2.15), (12.2.16), and Theorem 12.2.3(a) imply that Sf and Sg are differentiable on
(-, ).

   Since Sf (x) = f (x) on [0, L] (one-sided derivatives at the endpoints), and Sf is even (the derivative
of an odd function is even), Sf is the even periodic extension of f . By assumption, f is differentiable
on [0, L]. Because of (12.2.17), Theorem 12.2.3(b) with h = f and q = Sf implies that Sf exists on
(-, ).

   Now we can differentiate (12.2.9) twice with respect to x and t:

     ux(x, t) = 12 [Sf (x + at) + Sf (x - at)] + 12a [Sg(x + at) - Sg(x - at)],

     uxx(x, t) = 12 [Sf (x + at) + Sf (x - at)] + 12a [Sg(x + at) - Sg(x - at)],   (12.2.18)

     ut(x, t) = a2 [Sf (x + at) - Sf (x - at)] + 12 [Sg(x + at) + Sg(x - at)],     (12.2.19)

and  a2                                        a

     utt(x, t) = [Sf (x + at) - Sf (x - at)] + [Sg(x + at) - Sg(x - at)].          (12.2.20)
     2                                         2

Comparing (12.2.18) and (12.2.20) shows that utt(x, t) = a2uxx(x, t) for all (x, t).
   From (12.2.8), u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0 for all t. From (12.2.9), u(x, 0) = Sf (x) for all x, and therefore,

in particular,

         u(x, 0) = f(x), 0  x < L.

From (12.2.19), ut(x, 0) = Sg(x) for all x, and therefore, in particular,

         ut(x, 0) = g(x), 0  x < L.

Therefore u is an actual solution of (12.2.1). This completes the proof.
   Eqn (12.2.9) is called d'Alembert's solution of (12.2.1). Although d'Alembert's solution was useful

for proving Theorem 12.2.4 and is very useful in a slightly different context (Exercises 63-68), (12.2.8)
is preferable for computational purposes.

                        n=1

   Theorem 12.1.2 implies that uxx and utt can be obtained by term by term differentiation, for all (x, t),
so utt = a2uxx for all (x, t) (Exercise 62). Moreover, Theorem 11.3.2 implies that Sf (x) = f(x) and
Sg(x) = g(x) if 0  x  L. Therefore u(x, 0) = f(x) and ut(x, 0) = g(x) if 0  x  L. Hence, u is
an actual solution of the initial-boundary value problem.

REMARK: In solving a specific initial-boundary value problem (12.2.1), it's convenient to solve the prob-
lem with g  0, then with f  0, and add the solutions to obtain the solution of the given problem.
Because of this, either f  0 or g  0 in all the specific initial-boundary value problems in the exercises.

The Plucked String

If f and g don't satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 12.2.4, then (12.2.8) isn't an actual solution of
(12.2.1) in fact, it can be shown that (12.2.1) doesn't have an actual solution in this case. Nevertheless, u
is defined for all (x, t), and we can see from (12.2.18) and (12.2.20) that utt(x, t) = a2uxx(x, t) for all
(x, t) such that Sf (x  at) and Sg(x  at) exist. Moreover, u may still provide a useful approximation
to the vibration of the string; a laboratory experiment can confirm or deny this.

   We'll now consider the initial-boundary value problem (12.2.1) with

                        f(x) =        x,    0  x  2L ,                                         (12.2.21)
                                    L - x,  L    x        L
                                            2

and g  0. Since f isn't differentiable at x = L/2, it does'nt satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 12.2.4,
so the formal solution of (12.2.1) can't be an actual solution. Nevertheless, it's instructive to investigate
the properties of the formal solution.

   The graph of f is shown in Figure 12.2.7. Intuitively, we are plucking the string by half its length at the
middle. You're right if you think this is an extraordinarily large displacement; however, we could remove
this objection by multiplying the function in Figure 12.2.7 by a small constant. Since this would just
multiply the formal solution by the same constant, we'll leave f as we've defined it. Similar comments
apply to the exercises.

   From Exercise 11.3.15, the Fourier sine series of f on [0, L] is

                                   4L  (-1)n+1 (2n - 1)x

This series converges absolutely for all (x, t) by the comparison test, since the series

converges. Moreover, (12.2.22) satisfies the boundary conditions

                           u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0, t > 0,

and the initial condition

                           u(x, 0) = f(x), 0  x  L.

However, we can't justify differentiating (12.2.22) term by term even once, and formally differentiating it

twice term by term produces a series that diverges for all (x, t). (Verify.). Therefore we use d'Alembert's

form                       u(x, t) = 1 [Sf (x + at) + Sf (x - at)]

for u to study its derivatives. Figure 12.2.8 shows the graph of Sf , which is the odd periodic extension

odd multiple of L/2.

   In Figure 12.2.9 the dashed and solid curves are the graphs of y = Sf (x - at) and y = Sf (x + at)
respectively, for a fixed value of t. As t increases the dashed curve moves to the right and the solid

curve moves to the left. For this reason, we say that the functions u1(x, t) = Sf (x + at) and u2(x, t) =
Sf (x - at) are traveling waves. Note that u1 satisfies the wave equation at (x, t) if x + at isn't an
odd multiple of L/2 and u2 satisfies the wave equation at (x, t) if x - at isn't an odd multiple of L/2.
Therefore (12.2.23) (or, equivalently, (12.2.22)) satisfies utt(x, t) = a2uxx(x, t) = 0 for all (x, t) such
that neither x - at nor x + at is an odd multiple of L/2.

   We conclude by finding an explicit formula for u(x, t) under the assumption that

                                  0  x  L and 0  t  L/2a.                                                             (12.2.24)

To see how this formula can be used to compute u(x, t) for 0  x  L and arbitrary t, we refer you to
Exercise 16.

   From Figure 12.2.10,

                                Sf (x - at) =           x - at,          0     x      L  + at,
                                                      L - x + at,                     2
and
                                Sf (x + at) =                            L  +     at     x    L
                                                                         2
if (x, t) satisfies (12.2.24).

                        n=1

of (12.2.1) is defined for all (x, t), we're mainly interested in its behavior for 0  x  L and t  0. In
fact, it's sufficient to consider only values of t in the interval 0  t < 2L/a, since

                                     u(x, t + 2kL/a) = u(x, t)

for all (x, t) if k is an integer. (Verify.)
   You can create an animation of the motion of the string by performing the following numerical experi-

ment.
   Let m and k be positive integers. Let

                                     tj = 2Lj , j = 0, 1, . . . k;
                                            ka

thus, t0, t1, . . . tk are equally spaced points in [0, 2L/a]. For each j = 0, 1 ,2, . . . k, graph the partial sum

                           m         n cos natj + nL sin natj             sin nx

   um(x, tj) =

                         n=1

on [0, L] as a function of x. Write your program so that each graph remains displayed on the monitor for
a short time, and is then deleted and replaced by the next. Repeat this procedure for various values of m
and k.

   We suggest that you perform experiments of this kind in the exercises marked C , without other
specific instructions. (These exercises were chosen arbitrarily; the experiment is worthwhile in all the
exercises dealing with specific initial-boundary value problems.) In some of the exercises the formal
solutions have other forms, defined in Exercises 17, 34, and 49; however, the idea of the experiment is
the same.

12.3 LAPLACE'S EQUATION IN RECTANGULAR COORDINATES

The temperature u = u(x, y, t) in a two-dimensional plate satisfies the two-dimensional heat equation

           ut = a2(uxx + uyy),                                                         (12.3.1)

where (x, y) varies over the interior of the plate and t > 0. To find a solution of (12.3.1), it's necessary to
specify the initial temperature u(x, y, 0) and conditions that must be satisfied on the boundary. However,
as t  , the influence of the initial condition decays, so

           lim ut(x, y, t) = 0

           t

and the temperature approaches a steady state distribution u = u(x, y) that satisfies

           uxx + uyy = 0.                                                              (12.3.2)

This is Laplace's equation. This equation also arises in applications to fluid mechanics and potential
theory; in fact, it is also called the potential equation. We seek solutions of (12.3.2) in a region R that
satisfy specified conditions - called boundary conditions - on the boundary of R. For example, we may
require u to assume prescribed values on the boundary. This is called a Dirichlet condition, and the
problem is called a Dirichlet problem. Or, we may require the normal derivative of u at each point (x, y)
on the boundary to assume prescribed values. This is called a Neumann condition, and the problem is
called a Neumann problem. In some problems we impose Dirichlet conditions on part of the boundary
and Neumann conditions on the rest. Then we say that the boundary conditions and the problem are
mixed.

   Solving boundary value problems for (12.3.2) over general regions is beyond the scope of this book,
so we consider only very simple regions. We begin by considering the rectangular region shown in
Figure 12.3.1.

   The possible boundary conditions for this region can be written as

           (1 - )u(x, 0) + uy(x, 0) = f0(x), 0  x  a,

           (1 - )u(x, b) + uy(x, b) = f1(x), 0  x  a,

           (1 - )u(0, y) + ux(0, y) = g0(y), 0  y  b,

           (1 - )u(a, y) + ux(a, y) = g1(y), 0  y  b,

is a solution of

                               BVP(, , , )(f0, f1, g0, g1).

Therefore we concentrate on problems where only one of the functions f0, f1, g0, g2 isn't identically
zero. There are 64 (count them!) problems of this form. Each has homogeneous boundary conditions on
three sides of the rectangle, and a nonhomogeneous boundary condition on the fourth. We use separation
of variables to find infinitely many functions that satisfy Laplace's equation and the three homogeneous
boundary conditions in the open rectangle. We then use these solutions as building blocks to construct a
formal solution of Laplace's equation that also satisfies the nonhomogeneous boundary condition. Since
it's not feasible to consider all 64 cases, we'll restrict our attention in the text to just four. Others are
discussed in the exercises.

   If v(x, y) = X(x)Y (y) then
                                           vxx + vyy = X Y + XY = 0

for all (x, y) if and only if

                               X = -Y = k
                               X              Y

for all (x, y), where k is a separation constant. This equation is equivalent to

                               X - kX = 0, Y + kY = 0.                                         (12.3.3)

From here, the strategy depends upon the boundary conditions. We illustrate this by examples.

Example 12.3.1 Define the formal solution of

                               uxx + uyy = 0, 0 < x < a, 0 < y < b,                            (12.3.4)
                               u(x, 0) = f(x), u(x, b) = 0, 0  x  a,

                                 u(0, y) = 0, u(a, y) = 0, 0  y  b

(Figure 12.3.4).

Solution The boundary conditions in (12.3.4) require products v(x, y) = X(x)Y (y) such that X(0) =
X(a) = Y (b) = 0; hence, we let k = - in (12.3.3). Thus, X and Y must satisfy

                               X + X = 0, X(0) = 0, X(a) = 0                                   (12.3.5)

and

                               Y - Y = 0, Y (b) = 0.                                           (12.3.6)

From Theorem 11.1.2, the eigenvalues of (12.3.5) are n = n22/a2, with associated eigenfunctions

                               Xn = sin nx , n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..
                                             a

Substituting  = n22/a2 into (12.3.6) yields

                               Y - (n22/a2)Y = 0, Y (b) = 0,

so we could take               Yn = sinh n(b - y) ;

however, because of the nonhomogeneous Dirichlet condition at y = 0, it's better to require that Yn(0) =
1, which can be achieved by dividing the right side of (12.3.7) by its value at y = 0; thus, we take

                         Yn = sinh n(b - y)/a .
                                    sinh nb/a

Then                     vn(x, y) = Xn(x)Yn(y) = sinh n(b - y)/a sin nx ,

                                                sinh nb/a           a

so vn(x, 0) = sin nx/a and vn satisfies (12.3.4) with f(x) = sin nx/a. More generally, if 1, . . . ,
m are arbitrary constants then

                                         m sinh n(b - y)/a nx
                         um(x, y) = n sinh nb/a sin a

                                              n=1

satisfies (12.3.4) with             m nx
                         f(x) = n sin L .

                                       n=1

Therefore, if f is an arbitrary piecewise smooth function on [0, a], we define the formal solution of

(12.3.4) to be            sinh n(b - y)/a nx

                         u(x, y) = n            sinh nb/a  sin a ,             (12.3.8)

                                         sinh nb/a

for large n, so the series in (12.3.8) converges if 0 < y < b; moreover, since also

                                      cosh n(b - y)/a  e-ny/a
                                         sinh nb/a

for large n, Theorem 12.1.2 applied twice with z = x and twice with z = t, shows that uxx and uyy can
be obtained by differentiating u term by term if 0 < y < b. (Exercise 37). Therefore u satisfies Laplace's
equation in the interior of the rectangle in Figure 12.3.4. Moreover, the series in (12.3.8) also converges

on the boundary of the rectangle, and satisfies the three homogeneous boundary conditions conditions in
(12.3.4). Therefore, since u(x, 0) = S(x) for 0  x  L, u is an actual solution of (12.3.5) if and only if
S(x) = f(x) for 0  x  a. From Theorem 11.3.2, this is true if f is continuous and piecewise smooth
on [0, L], and f(0) = f(L) = 0.

Example 12.3.2 Solve (12.3.4) with f(x) = x(x2 - 3ax + 2a2).

Solution From Example 11.3.6,

                                      12a3  1 nx
                               S(x) = 3                  3 sin .
                                                      n=1 n a

Therefore                             12a3  sinh n(b - y)/a nx

               u(x, y) = 3                           n3 sinh nb/a sin a .            (12.3.10)

                                      n=1

To compute approximate values of u(x, y), we must use partial sums of the form

                                      12a3 m sinh n(b - y)/a nx
               um(x, y) = 3                          n3 sinh nb/a sin a .
                                      n=1

Because of (12.3.9), small values of m provide sufficient accuracy for most applications if 0 < y < b.
Moreover, the n3 in the denominator in (12.3.10) ensures that this is also true for y = 0. For graphing

purposes, we chose a = 2, b = 1, and m = 10. Figure 12.3.5 shows the surface

               u = u(x, y), 0  x  2, 0  y  1,

while Figure 12.3.6 shows the curves

               u = u(x, 0.1k), 0  x  2, k = 0, 1, . . ., 10.

X (a) = Y (0) = 0; hence, we let k = - in (12.3.3). Thus, X and Y must satisfy

                          X + X = 0, X (0) = 0, X (a) = 0                                      (12.3.12)

and

                          Y - Y = 0, Y (0) = 0.                                                (12.3.13)

From Theorem 11.1.3, the eigenvalues of (12.3.12) are  = 0, with associated eigenfunction X0 = 1,
and n = n22/a2, with associated eigenfunctions

                                          Xn = cos nx , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
                                                         a

Since Y0 = y satisfies (12.3.13) with  = 0, we take v0(x, y) = X0(x)Y0(y) = y. Substituting
 = n22/a2 into (12.3.13) yields

                          Y - (n22/a2)Y = 0, Y (0) = 0,

so we could take                       Yn = sinh ny .
                                                      a
                                                                                               (12.3.14)

However, because of the nonhomogeneous Neumann condition at y = b, it's better to require that Yn(b) =
1, which can be achieved by dividing the right side of (12.3.14) by the value of its derivative at y = b;

thus,
                                                 Yn = a sinh ny/a .
                                                         n cosh nb/a

Then                      vn(x, y) = Xn(x)Yn(y) = a sinh ny/a cos nx ,
so                                                         n cosh nb/a    a

                                       vn (x, b) = cos nx .
                                       y                   a

Therefore vn satisfies (12.3.11) with f(x) = cos nx/a. More generally, if 0, . . . , m are arbitrary

constants then                                    a m sinh ny/a nx
                          um(x, y) = 0y +  n n cosh nb/a cos a

                                                                n=1

satisfies (12.3.11) with                    m nx
                          f(x) = 0 + n cos L .

                                                  n=1

Therefore, if f is an arbitrary piecewise smooth function on [0, a] we define the formal solution of

(12.3.11) to be                                a  sinh ny/a nx
                          u(x, y) = 0y +  n n cosh nb/a cos a ,

where                                        nx
                          C(x) = 0 + n cos a

                                                   n=1

is the Fourier cosine series of f on [0, a]; that is,

For graphing purposes, we chose a = 2, b = 1, and retained the terms through n = 10 in (12.3.15).

Solution The boundary conditions in (12.3.16) require products v(x, y) = X(x)Y (y) such that Y (0) =

From Theorem 11.1.4, the eigenvalues of (12.3.18) are n = (2n - 1)22/4b2, with associated eigen-

functions         Yn = sin (2n - 1)y , n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..
                                   2b

Substituting  = (2n - 1)22/4b2 into (12.3.17) yields

                  X - ((2n - 1)22/4b2)X = 0, X (a) = 0,

so we could take  Xn = cosh (2n - 1)(x - a) .
                                          2b
                                                                                 (12.3.19)

However, because of the nonhomogeneous Dirichlet condition at x = 0, it's better to require that Xn(0) =
1, which can be achieved by dividing the right side of (12.3.19) by its value at x = 0; thus,

                  Xn = cosh(2n - 1)(x - a)/2b .
                              cosh(2n - 1)a/2b

Then           vn(x, y) = Xn(x)Yn(y) = cosh(2n - 1)(x - a)/2b sin (2n - 1)y ,
so                cosh(2n - 1)a/2b                                        2b

                  vn(0, y) = sin (2n - 1)y .

Therefore vn satisfies (12.3.16) with g(y) = sin(2n - 1)y/2b. More generally, if 1, . . . , m are
arbitrary constants then

                                    m cosh(2n - 1)(x - a)/2b (2n - 1)y
                    um(x, y) = n cosh(2n - 1)a/2b sin 2b

                                            n=1

Thus, if g is an arbitrary piecewise smooth function on [0, b], we define the formal solution of (12.3.16)

to be                             cosh(2n - 1)(x - a)/2b (2n - 1)y
                    n=1 u(x, y) = n cosh(2n - 1)a/2b sin 2b ,

(Figure 12.3.11).

Solution The boundary conditions in (12.3.20) require products v(x, y) = X(x)Y (y) such that Y (0) =
Y (b) = X (0) = 0; hence, we let k =  in (12.3.3). Thus, X and Y must satisfy

                               X - X = 0, X (0) = 0                                         (12.3.21)

and

                          Y + Y = 0, Y (0) = 0, Y (b) = 0.                                  (12.3.22)

                          Figure 12.3.11 The boundary value problem (12.3.20)

From Theorem 11.1.4, the eigenvalues of (12.3.22) are n = (2n - 1)22/4b2, with associated eigen-

functions                 Yn = cos (2n - 1)y , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
                                            2b

Substituting  = (2n - 1)22/4b2 into (12.3.21) yields

                          X - ((2n - 1)22/4b2)X = 0, X (0) = 0,

so we could take                Xn = cosh (2n - 1)x .
                                                    2b
                                                                                      (12.3.23)

However, because of the nonhomogeneous Neumann condition at x = a, it's better to require that

Xn(a) = 1, which can be achieved by dividing the right side of (12.3.23) by the value of its deriva-

tive at x = a; thus,      Xn = 2b cosh(2n - 1)x/2b .
                                  (2n - 1) sinh(2n - 1)a/2b

Then         vn(x, y) = Xn(x)Yn(y) = 2b cosh(2n - 1)x/2b cos (2n - 1)y ,

                                   (2n - 1) sinh(2n - 1)a/2b                   2b

so                              vn (a, y) = cos (2n - 1)y .

                                x                     2b

Therefore vn satisfies (12.3.20) with g(y) = cos(2n - 1)y/2b. More generally, if 1, . . . , m are

arbitrary constants then

                          2b m     cosh(2n - 1)x/2b                      (2n - 1)y

Therefore, if g is an arbitrary piecewise smooth function on [0, b], we define the formal solution of

Laplace's Equation for a Semi-Infinite Strip
We now seek solutions of Laplace's equation on the semi-infinite strip

                                    S : {0 < x < a, y > 0}

(Figure 12.3.12) that satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = a, and a nonhomoge-
neous Dirichlet or Neumann condition at y = 0. An example of such a problem is

                          uxx + uyy = 0, 0 < x < a, y > 0,                              (12.3.24)
                               u(x, 0) = f(x), 0  x  a,

                           u(0, y) = 0, u(a, y) = 0, y > 0,

   The boundary conditions in this problem are not sufficient to determine u, for if u0 = u0(x, y) is a
solution and K is a constant then

                          u1(x, y) = u0(x, y) + K sin x sinh y .
                                                             a          a

is also a solution. (Verify.) However, if we also require -- on physical grounds -- that the solution remain
bounded for all (x, y) in S then K = 0 and this difficulty is eliminated.

Example 12.3.9 Define the bounded formal solution of (12.3.24).

Solution Proceeding as in the solution of Example 12.3.1, we find that the building block functions are

of the form  vn(x, y) = Yn(y) sin nx ,
                                         a

where

                                            Yn - (n22/a2)Yn = 0.

Therefore

             Yn = c1eny/a + c2e-ny/a

where c1 and c2 are constants. Although the boundary conditions in (12.3.24) don't restrict c1, and c2,
we must set c1 = 0 to ensure that Yn is bounded. Letting c2 = 1 yields

             vn(x, y) = e-ny/a sin nx ,
                                            a

and we define the bounded formal solution of (12.3.24) to be

             u(x, y) = bne-ny/a  sin nx ,
                         n=1 a

          if 0 < y0 < y < b, where y0 is an arbitrary number in (0, b). Then argue that since y0 can
          be chosen arbitrarily small, the conclusion holds for all y in (0, b).

12.4 LAPLACE'S EQUATION IN POLAR COORDINATES

In Section 12.3 we solved boundary value problems for Laplace's equation over a rectangle with sides
parallel to the x, y-axes. Now we'll consider boundary value problems for Laplace's equation over regions
with boundaries best described in terms of polar coordinates. In this case it's appropriate to regard u as
function of (r, ) and write Laplace's equation in polar form as

             1              1
          urr + ur + 2 u = 0,                                                     (12.4.1)
             r              r

where  r = x2 + y2 and  = cos-1 x = sin-1 x .

                                              r                    r

We begin with the case where the region is a circular disk with radius , centered at the origin; that is,

we want to define a formal solution of the boundary value problem

       urr + ur + 2 u = 0,  0 < r < ,            -   < ,

          u(, ) = f(), -   < 

(Figure 12.4.1). Note that (12.4.2) imposes no restriction on u(r, ) when r = 0. We'll address this
question at the appropriate time.

668 Chapter 12 Fourier Solutions of Partial Differential Equations

    We first look for products v(r, ) = R(r)() that satisfy (12.4.1). For this function,

                             1  1            1         1
                vrr + vr + 2 v = R  + R  + 2 R = 0
                             rr              r         r

for all (r, ) with r = 0 if

                                r2R + rR = -  = ,
                                   R              

where  is a separation constant. (Verify.) This equation is equivalent to

                                    +  = 0

and

                                r2R + rR - R = 0.                                         (12.4.3)

Since (r, ) and (r, -) are the polar coordinates of the same point, we impose periodic boundary con-
ditions on ; that is,

                 +  = 0, (-) = (),  (-) =  ().                                            (12.4.4)

Since we don't want R to be identically zero,  must be an eigenvalue of (12.4.4) and  must be an
associated eigenfunction. From Theorem 11.1.6, the eigenvalues of (12.4.4) are 0 = 0 with associated
eigenfunctions 0 = 1 and, for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n = n2, with associated eigenfunction cos n and
sin n therefore,

                                             n = n cos n + n sin n

where n and n are constants.
   Substituting  = 0 into (12.4.3) yields the

                                                    r2R + rR = 0,

so                                    R0 = - 1 ,

                                      R0  r

                                      R0 = c1r ,

and

                                   R0 = c2 + c1 ln r.                                     (12.4.5)

If c1 = 0 then

                                    lim |R0(r)| = ,

                                   r0+

which doesn't make sense if we interpret u0(r, ) = R0(r)0() = R0(r) as the steady state temperature
distribution in a disk whose boundary is maintained at the constant temperature R0(). Therefore we now
require R0 to be bounded as r  0+. This implies that c1 = 0, and we take c2 = 1. Thus, R0 = 1 and
v0(r, ) = R0(r)0() = 1. Note that v0 satisfies (12.4.2) with f() = 1.

   Substituting  = n2 into (12.4.3) yields the Euler equation

                                r2Rn + rRn - n2Rn = 0                                     (12.4.6)

for Rn. The indicial polynomial of this equation is
                                        s(s - 1) + s - n2 = (s - n)(s + n),

so the general solution of (12.4.6) is

                                             Rn = c1rn + c2r-n,                                               (12.4.7)

by Theorem 7.4.3. Consistent with our previous assumption on R0, we now require Rn to be bounded as
r  0+. This implies that c2 = 0, and we choose c1 = -n. Then Rn(r) = rn/n, so

                                                          rn
                         vn(r, ) = Rn(r)n() = n (n cos n + sin n).

                                                          

Now vn satisfies (12.4.2) with

                                        f() = n cos n + n sin n.

More generally, if 0, 1,. . . , m and 1, 2, . . . , m are arbitrary constants then

                                               m rn
                         um(r, ) = 0 + n (n cos n + n sin n)

                                                       n=1

satisfies (12.4.2) with                                  m

                                f() = 0 + (n cos n + n sin n).

                                                       n=1

This motivates the next definition.

Definition 12.4.1 The bounded formal solution of the boundary value problem (12.4.2) is

                                              rn                                                              (12.4.8)
                         u(r, ) = 0 + n (n cos n + n sin n),

                                                    n=1

where                                                     

                                F () = 0 + (n cos n + n sin n)

                                                        n=1

is the Fourier series of f on [-, ]; that is,

                                             0 = 1            

                                                                f() d,
                                                    2 -

and 1                                                         1
       n =  - f() cos n d and n =  - f() sin n d, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

Since       nk(r/)n      converges      for  every  k  if  0  <  r  <  ,  Theorem  12.1.2  can  be  used  to  show  that
       n=0
if 0 < r <  then (12.4.8) can be differentiated term by term any number of times with respect to both r

and . Since the terms in (12.4.8) satisfy Laplace's equation if r > 0, (12.4.8) satisfies Laplace's equation

if 0 < r < . Therefore, since u(, ) = F (), u is an actual solution of (12.4.2) if and only if

                                        F () = f(), -   < .

From Theorem 11.2.4, this is true if f is continuous and piecewise smooth on [-, ] and f(-) = f().

From Theorem 11.1.2, the eigenvalues of (12.4.12) are n = n22/2, with associated eigenfunction
n = sin n/, n = 1, 2, 3,. . . . Substituting  = n22/2 into (12.4.11) yields the Euler equation

Dirichlet condition at r = , it's convenient to have r() = 1; therefore we take c1 = -n/ , so

13.1 TWO-POINT BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS

In Section 5.3 we considered initial value problems for the linear second order equation

               P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F (x).                                          (13.1.1)

Suppose P0, P1, P2, and F are continuous and P0 has no zeros on an open interval (a, b). From Theo-
rem 5.3.1, if x0 is in (a, b) and k1 and k2 are arbitrary real numbers then (13.1.1) has a unique solution
on (a, b) such that y(x0) = k1 and y (x0) = k2. Now we consider a different problem for (13.1.1).

   PROBLEM Suppose P0, P1, P2, and F are continous and P0 has no zeros on a closed interval [a, b].
Let , , , and  be real numbers such that

               2 + 2 = 0 and 2 + 2 = 0,                                                   (13.1.2)

and let k1 and k2 be arbitrary real numbers. Find a solution of                           (13.1.3)
                                       P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y = F (x)

on the closed interval [a, b] such that

               y(a) + y (a) = k1                                                          (13.1.4)

and

               y(b) + y (b) = k2.                                                         (13.1.5)

   The assumptions stated in this problem apply throughout this section and won't be repeated. Note
that we imposed conditions on P0, P1, P2, and F on the closed interval [a, b], and we are interested in
solutions of (13.1.3) on the closed interval. This is different from the situation considered in Chapter 5,
where we imposed conditions on P0, P1, P2, and F on the open interval (a, b) and we were interested in
solutions on the open interval. There is really no problem here; we can always extend P0, P1, P2, and
F to an open interval (c, d) (for example, by defining them to be constant on (c, d] and [b, d)) so that
they are continuous and P0 has no zeros on [c, d]. Then we can apply the theorems from Chapter 5 to the
equation

                                         y + P1(x) y + P2(x) y = F (x)
                                                 P0(x) P0(x) P0(x)

on (c, d) to draw conclusions about solutions of (13.1.3) on [a, b].
   We call a and b boundary points. The conditions (13.1.4) and (13.1.5) are boundary conditions, and the

problem is a two-point boundary value problem or, for simplicity, a boundary value problem. (We used

similar terminology in Chapter 12 with a different meaning; both meanings are in common usage.) We

require (13.1.2) to insure that we're imposing a sensible condition at each boundary point. For example,
if 2 + 2 = 0 then  =  = 0, so y(a) + y (a) = 0 for all choices of y(a) and y (a). Therefore
(13.1.4) is an impossible condition if k1 = 0, or no condition at all if k1 = 0.

   We abbreviate (13.1.1) as Ly = F , where

               Ly = P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P0(x)y,

and we denote

               B1(y) = y(a) + y (a) and         B2(y) = y(b) + y (b).

We combine (13.1.3), (13.1.4), and (13.1.5) as

               Ly = F, B1(y) = k1, B2(y) = k2.                                            (13.1.6)
678 Chapter 13 Boundary Value Problems for Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations

This boundary value problem is homogeneous if F = 0 and k1 = k2 = 0; otherwise it's nonhomoge-

neous.

We leave it to you (Exercise 1) to verify that B1 and B2 are linear operators; that is, if c1 and c2 are

constants then

                        Bi(c1y1 + c2y2) = c1Bi(y1) + c2Bi(y2), i = 1, 2.                 (13.1.7)

The next three examples show that the question of existence and uniqueness for solutions of boundary
value problems is more complicated than for initial value problems.

Example 13.1.1 Consider the boundary value problem

                        y + y = 1, y(0) = 0, y(/2) = 0.

The general solution of y + y = 1 is

                                      y = 1 + c1 sin x + c2 cos x,

so y(0) = 0 if and only if c2 = -1 and y(/2) = 0 if and only if c1 = -1. Therefore

                                      y = 1 - sin x - cos x

is the unique solution of the boundary value problem.

Example 13.1.2 Consider the boundary value problem

                        y + y = 1, y(0) = 0, y() = 0.

Again, the general solution of y + y = 1 is

                                      y = 1 + c1 sin x + c2 cos x,

so y(0) = 0 if and only if c2 = -1, but y() = 0 if and only if c2 = 1. Therefore the boundary value
problem has no solution.

Example 13.1.3 Consider the boundary value problem

                        y + y = sin 2x, y(0) = 0, y() = 0.

You can use the method of undetermined coefficients (Section 5.5) to find that the general solution of

y + y = sin 2x is       y = - sin 2x + c1 sin x + c2 cos x.
                                   3

The boundary conditions y(0) = 0 and y() = 0 both require that c2 = 0, but they don't restrict c1.
Therefore the boundary value problem has infinitely many solutions

                                      y = - sin 2x + c1 sin x,
                                                 3

where c1 is arbitrary.

Theorem 13.1.1 If z1 and z2 are solutions of Ly = 0 such that either B1(z1) = B1(z2) = 0 or B2(z1) =
B2(z2) = 0, then {z1, z2} is linearly dependent. Equivalently, if {z1, z2} is linearly independent, then

                               B12(z1) + B12(z2) = 0 and B22(z1) + B22(z2) = 0.
                       Section 13.1 Two-Point Boundary Value Problems 679

Proof Recall that B1(z) = z(a) + z (a) and 2 + 2 = 0. Therefore, if B1(z1) = B1(z2) = 0 then
(, ) is a nontrivial solution of the system

                       z1(a) + z1(a) = 0
                       z2(a) + z (a) = 0.

This implies that

                       z1(a)z2(a) - z1(a)z2(a) = 0,

so {z1, z2} is linearly dependent, by Theorem 5.1.6. We leave it to you to show that {z1, z2} is linearly
dependent if B2(z1) = B2(z2) = 0.

Theorem 13.1.2 The following statements are equivalent; that is, they are either all true or all false.
(a) There's a fundamental set {z1, z2} of solutions of Ly = 0 such that

                       B1(z1)B2(z2) - B1(z2)B2(z1) = 0.                                         (13.1.8)

(b) If {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0 then                                (13.1.9)
                                           B1(y1)B2(y2) - B1(y2)B2(y1) = 0.

(c) For each continuous F and pair of constants (k1, k2), the boundary value problem

                       Ly = F, B1(y) = k1, B2(y) = k2

      has a unique solution.
(d) The homogeneous boundary value problem

                       Ly = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0                                             (13.1.10)

     has only the trivial solution y = 0.

(e) The homogeneous equation Ly = 0 has linearly independent solutions z1 and z2 such that B1(z1) =
     0 and B2(z2) = 0.

Proof We'll show that

                       (a) = (b) = (c) = (d) = (e) = (a).

(a) = (b): Since {z1, z2} is a fundamental set of solutions for Ly = 0, there are constants a1, a2,

b1, and b2 such that

                       y1 = a1z1 + a2z2                                                         (13.1.11)
                       y2 = b1z1 + b2z2.

Moreover,

                       a1 a2 = 0.                                                               (13.1.12)
                       b1 b2

because if this determinant were zero, its rows would be linearly dependent and therefore {y1, y2} would
be linearly dependent, contrary to our assumption that {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly =
0. From (13.1.7) and (13.1.11),

                      B1(y1) B2(y1) B1(y2) B2(y2) = a1 a2 b1 b2  B1(z1) B2(z1) B1(z2) B2(z2) .
680 Chapter 13 Boundary Value Problems for Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations

Since the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of the determinants of the matrices, (13.1.8)
and (13.1.12) imply (13.1.9).

   (b) = (c): Since {y1, y2} is a fundamental set of solutions of Ly = 0, the general solution of
Ly = F is

                                                 y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2,

where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants and yp is a particular solution of Ly = F . To satisfy the boundary
conditions, we must choose c1 and c2 so that

k1 = B1(yp) + c1B1(y1) + c2B1(y2)
k2 = B2(yp) + c1B2(y1) + c2B2(y2),

(recall (13.1.7)), which is equivalent to

c1B1(y1) + c2B1(y2) = k1 - B1(yp)
c1B2(y1) + c2B2(22) = k2 - B2(yp).

From (13.1.9), this system always has a unique solution (c1, c2).
   (c) = (d): Obviously, y = 0 is a solution of (13.1.10). From (c) with F = 0 and k1 = k2 = 0, it's

the only solution.

   (d) = (e): Let {y1, y2} be a fundamental system for Ly = 0 and let

z1 = B1(y2)y1 - B1(y1)y2 and z2 = B2(y2)y1 - B2(y1)y2.

Then B1(z1) = 0 and B2(z2) = 0. To see that z1 and z2 are linearly independent, note that

a1z1 + a2z2 = a1[B1(y2)y1 - B1(y1)y2] + a2[B2(y2)y1 - B2(y1)y2]
                  = [B1(y2)a1 + B2(y2)a2]y1 - [B1(y1)a1 + B2(y1)a2]y2.

Therefore, since y1 and y2 are linearly independent, a1z1 + a2z2 = 0 if and only if

B1(y1) B2(y1)                                    a1 a2 = 00 .
B1(y2) B2(y2)

If this system has a nontrivial solution then so does the system

B1(y1) B1(y2)                                    c1 = 0 .
B2(y1) B2(y2)                                    c2               0

This and (13.1.7) imply that y = c1z1 + c2z2 is a nontrivial solution of (13.1.10), which contradicts (d).
   (e) = (a). Theorem 13.1.1 implies that if B1(z1) = 0 and B2(z2) = 0 then B1(z2) = 0 and

B2(z1) = 0. This implies (13.1.8), which completes the proof.

Example 13.1.4 Solve the boundary value problem

x2y - 2xy + 2y - 2x3 = 0, y(1) = 4, y (2) = 3,                                             (13.1.13)

given that {x, x2} is a fundamental set of solutions of the complementary equation

Solution Using variation of parameters (Section 5.7), you can show that yp = x3 is a solution of the

complementary equation
                                            x2y - 2xy + 2y = 2x3 = 0.
                                     Section 13.1 Two-Point Boundary Value Problems 681

Therefore the solution of (13.1.13) can be written as
                                                 y = x3 + c1x + c2x2.

Then

                                     y = 3x2 + c1 + 2c2x,

and imposing the boundary conditions yields the system

                                     c1 + c2 = 3
                                     c1 + 4c2 = -9,

so c1 = 7 and c2 = -4. Therefore     y = x3 + 7x - 4x2
is the unique solution of (13.1.13)

Example 13.1.5 Solve the boundary value problem                        y(1) = 5e2.
                               y - 7y + 12y = 4e2x, y(0) = 3,

Solution From Example 5.4.1, yp = 2e2x is a particular solution of                  (13.1.14)
                                                y - 7y + 12y = 4e2x.

Since {e3x, e4x} is a fundamental set for the complementary equation, we could write the solution of
(13.1.13) as

                                               y = 2e2x + c1e3x + c2e4x

and determine c1 and c2 by imposing the boundary conditions. However, this would lead to some tedious
algebra, and the form of the solution would be very unappealing. (Try it!) In this case it's convenient to
use the fundamental system {z1, z2} mentioned in Theorem 13.1.2(e); that is, we choose {z1, z2} so that
B1(z1) = z1(0) = 0 and B2(z2) = z2(1) = 0. It is easy to see that

                                   z1 = e3x - e4x and z2 = e3(x-1) - e4(x-1)

satisfy these requirements. Now we write the solution of (13.1.14) as

           y = 2e2x + c1 e3x - e4x + c2 e3(x-1) - e4(x-1) .

Imposing the boundary conditions y(0) = 3 and y(1) = 5e2 yields

           3 = 2 + c2e-4(e - 1) and 5e2 = 2e2 + c1e3(1 - e).

Therefore                            c1 = 3 ,               e4
                                            e(1 - e)
                                                      c2 =  e-1        ,

and        y = 2e2x + 3 (e3x - e4x) + e4 (e3(x-1) - e4(x-1)).

           e(1 - e)                                     e-1

   Sometimes it's useful to have a formula for the solution of a general boundary problem. Our next
theorem addresses this question.
682 Chapter 13 Boundary Value Problems for Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations

Theorem 13.1.3 Suppose the homogeneous boundary value problem

                             Ly = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0                                 (13.1.15)

has only the trivial solution. Let y1 and y2 be linearly independent solutions of Ly = 0 such that
B1(y1) = 0 and B2(y2) = 0, and let

                                                   W = y1y2 - y1y2.

Then the unique solution of

                             Ly = F, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0                                 (13.1.16)

is             b y(x) = y F (t)y 1(x) 2(t) x dt + y F (t)y 2(x) 1(t) dt.

Proof In Section 5.7 we saw that if         y = u1y1 + u2y2                               (13.1.18)
where

                                         u1y1 + u2y2 = 0
                                         u1y1 + u2y2 = F,

then Ly = F . Solving for u1 and u2 yields

                             u1 = - F y2 P and 0W u2 = F y1 P , 0W

which hold if  b u F (t)y 1(x) = 2(t) dt and       x u F (t)y 2(x) = 1(t) dt.
                           x P0(t)W (t)                        a P0(t)W (t)

This and (13.1.18) show that (13.1.17) is a solution of Ly = F . Differentiating (13.1.17) yields

               y (x) = y1(x)         b F (t)y2(t)  dt + y2(x)  x F (t)y1(t)          dt.  (13.1.19)

                                     x P0(t)W (t)              a P0(t)W (t)

(Verify.) From (13.1.17) and (13.1.19),

                             b B F (t)y 1(y) = B1(y1) 2(t) dt = 0
                                                   a P0(t)W (t)

because B1(y1) = 0, and      b B F (t)y 2(y) = B2(y2) 1(t) dt = 0
                                                   a P0(t)W (t)

because B2(y2) = 0. Hence, y satisfies (13.1.16). This completes the proof.               (13.1.20)
   We can rewrite (13.1.17) as

                                                                                  b

   This is the Green's function for the boundary value problem (13.1.16). The Green's function is related

to the boundary value problem (13.1.16) in much the same way that the inverse of a square matrix A is
related to the linear algebraic system y = Ax; just as we substitute the given vector y into the formula
x = A-1y to solve y = Ax, we substitute the given function F into the formula (13.1.20) to obtain the
solution of (13.1.16). The analogy goes further: just as A-1 exists if and only if Ax = 0 has only the
trivial solution, the boundary value problem (13.1.16) has a Green's function if and only the homogeneous
boundary value problem (13.1.15) has only the trivial solution.

   We leave it to you (Exercise 32) to show that the assumptions of Theorem 13.1.3 imply that the unique

solution of the boundary value problem

               Ly = F, B1(y) = k1, B2(y) = k2

is             b y(x) = G(x, t)F (t) dt + k2 y k 1 + 1 y2.

               a                                      B2(y1)         B1(y2)

Example 13.1.6 Solve the boundary value problem

               y + y = F (x). y(0) + y (0) = 0, y() - y () = 0,                            (13.1.21)

and find the Green's function for this problem.

Solution Here

               B1(y) = y(0) + y (0) and B2(y) = y() - y ().

Let {z1, z2} = {cos x, sin x}, which is a fundamental set of solutions of y + y = 0. Then

                                      B1(z1) = (cos x - sin x) x=0 = 1
                                      B2(z1) = (cos x + sin x) x= = -1

and

               B1(z2) = (sin x + cos x) x=0 = 1
               B2(z2) = (sin x - cos x) x= = 1.

Therefore

               B1(z1)B2(z2) - B1(z2)B2(z1) = 2,

so Theorem 13.1.2 implies that (13.1.21) has a unique solution. Let

               y1 = B1(z2)z1 - B1(z1)z2 = cos x - sin x

and
                                    y2 = B2(z2)z1 - B2(z1)z2 = cos x + sin x.

Then B1(y1) = 0, B2(y2) = 0, and the Wronskian of {y1, y2} is

               W (x) = cos x - sin x cos x + sin x - sin x - cos x - sin x + cos x = 2.

Since P0 = 1, (13.1.17) yields the solution

               y(x) = cos x - sin x  F (t)(cos t + sin t) dt
                                             2

                  + cos x + sin x x F (t)(cos t - sin t) dt.

                                 Ly = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0                            (13.1.22)

has a nontrivial solution y1, and let y2 be any solution of Ly = 0 that isn't a constant multiple of y1. Let

W = y1y2 - y1y2. If                   b F (t)y1(t) dt = 0,
                                     a P0(t)W (t)
                                                                                         (13.1.23)

then the homogeneous boundary value problem

                                 Ly = F, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0                            (13.1.24)

has infinitely many solutions, all of the form y = yp + c1y1, where

                     b y F (t)y p = y1(x) 2(t) x dt + y F (t)y 2(x) 1(t) dt
                                     x P0(t)W (t)              a P0(t)W (t)

and c1 is a constant. If              b F (t)y1(t) dt = 0,
then (13.1.24) has no solution.      a P0(t)W (t)

Proof From the proof of Theorem 13.1.3, yp is a particular solution of Ly = F , and

yp(x) = y1(x)                        b F (t)y2(t)  dt + y2(x)        x F (t)y1(t)  dt.

                                     x P0(t)W (t)              a P0(t)W (t)

Therefore the general solution of (13.1.22) is of the form

                                     y = yp + c1y1 + c2y2,

where c1 and c2 are constants. Then

B1(y) = B1(yp + c1y1 + c2y2) = B1(yp) + c1B1(y1) + c2B1y2
          b = B F (t)y 1(y1) 2(t) dt + c1B1(y1) + c2B1(y2)
                           a P0(t)W (t)
          = c2B1(y2)

Since B1(y1) = 0, Theorem 13.1.1 implies that B1(y2) = 0; hence, B1(y) = 0 if and only if c2 = 0.
Therefore y = yp + c1y1 and

                    b B F (t)y 2(y) = B2(yp + c1y1) = B2(y2) 1(t) dt + c1B2(y1)
                                                                      a P0(t)W (t)

                               b = B F (t)y 2(y2) 1(t) dt,
                                                a P0(t)W (t)

since B2(y1) = 0. From Theorem 13.1.1, B2(y2) = 0 (since B2(y1 = 0). Therefore Ly = 0 if and only
if (13.1.23) holds. This completes the proof.

Example 13.1.7 Applying Theorem 13.1.4 to the boundary value problem

      y + y = F (x), y(0) = 0, y() = 0                                                     (13.1.25)

explains the Examples 13.1.2 and 13.1.3. The complementary equation y + y = 0 has the linear inde-
pendent solutions y1 = sin x and y2 = cos x, and y1 satisfies both boundary conditions. Since P0 = 1
and

                                           W = sin x cos x = -1,
                                                     cos x - sin x

(13.1.23) reduces to                 
From Example 13.1.2, F (x) = 1 and
                                       F (x) sin x dx = 0.

                                    0

                                                  

           F (x) sin x dx = sin x dx = 2,

      0                                        0

so Theorem 13.1.3 implies that (13.1.25) has no solution. In Example 13.1.3,

           F (x) = sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x

and                                                         2 3
                                            2
0 0 F (x) sin x dx = 2 sin x cos x dx = 3 0 sin x = 0,

so Theorem 13.1.3 implies that (13.1.25) has infinitely many solutions, differing by constant multiples of
y1(x) = sin x.

13.2 STURM-LIOUVILLE PROBLEMS

In this section we consider eigenvalue problems of the form

            P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y + R(x)y = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0,                  (13.2.1)

where

                B1(y) = y(a) + y (a) and B2(y) = y(b) + y (b).

As in Section 13.1, , , , and  are real numbers, with

                2 + 2 > 0 and 2 + 2 > 0,

P0, P1, P2, and R are continuous, and P0 and R are positive on [a, b].
   We say that  is an eigenvalue of (13.2.1) if (13.2.1) has a nontrivial solution y. In this case, y is an

eigenfunction associated with , or a -eigenfunction. Solving the eigenvalue problem means finding all
eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of (13.2.1).

Example 13.2.1 Solve the eigenvalue problem

                y + 3y + 2y + y = 0, y(0) = 0, y(1) = 0.                                 (13.2.2)

Solution The characteristic equation of (13.2.2) is
                                                  r2 + 3r + 2 +  = 0,

with zeros                                                                

                r1 = -3 + 1 - 4 and r2 = -3 - 1 - 4 .
                                      2                                   2

If  < 1/4 then r1 and r2 are real and distinct, so the general solution of the differential equation in

(13.2.2) is
                                                  y = c1er1t + c2er2t.

The boundary conditions require that

                                         c1 + c2       =0

                                         c1er1 + c2er2 = 0.

Since the determinant of this system is er2 - er1 = 0, the system has only the trivial solution. Therefore
 isn't an eigenvalue of (13.2.2).

   If  = 1/4 then r1 = r2 = -3/2, so the general solution of (13.2.2) is

                                         y = e-3x/2(c1 + c2x).

The boundary condition y(0) = 0 requires that c1 = 0, so y = c2xe-3x/2 and the boundary condition

y(0) requires that c2 = 0. Therefore  = 1/4 isn't an eigenvalue of (13.2.2).

If  > 1/4 then  r1 = - 3 + i and r2 = - 3 - i,

                                         2                             2

4 - 1 1 + 4 with  2
                = 2                         or, equivalently,  = 4 .                     (13.2.3)
                                             Section 13.2 Sturm-Liouville Problems 689

In this case the general solution of the differential equation in (13.2.2) is

y = e-3x/2(c1 cos x + c2 sin x).

The boundary condition y(0) = 0 requires that c1 = 0, so y = c2e-3x/2 sin x, which holds with c2 = 0
if and only if  = n, where n is an integer. We may assume that n is a positive integer. (Why?). From
(13.2.3), the eigenvalues are n = (1 + 4n22)/4, with associated eigenfunctions

                                      yn = e-3x/2 sin nx, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

Example 13.2.2 Solve the eigenvalue problem

x2y + xy + y = 0, y(1) = 0, y(2) = 0.                                          (13.2.4)

Solution If  = 0, the differential equation in (13.2.4) reduces to x(xy ) = 0, so xy = c1,
                                          y = c1 , and y = c1 ln x + c2.
                                                 x

The boundary condition y(1) = 0 requires that c2 = 0, so y = c1 ln x. The boundary condition y(2) = 0
requires that c1 ln 2 = 0, so c1 = 0. Therefore zero isn't an eigenvalue of (13.2.4).

   If  < 0, we write  = -k2 with k > 0, so (13.2.4) becomes

                                                x2y + xy - k2y = 0,

an Euler equation (Section 7.4) with indicial equation
                                            r2 - k2 = (r - k)(r + k) = 0.

Therefore                             y = c1xk + c2x-k.
The boundary conditions require that

                                                    c1 + c2 = 0
                                                 2kc1 + 2-kc2 = 0.

Since the determinant of this system is 2-k - 2k = 0, c1 = c2 = 0. Therefore (13.2.4) has no negative
eigenvalues.

   If  > 0 we write  = k2 with k > 0. Then (13.2.4) becomes

                                                x2y + xy + k2y = 0,

an Euler equation with indicial equation
                                           r2 + k2 = (r - ik)(r + ik) = 0,

so
                                         y = c1 cos(k ln x) + c2 sin(k ln x).

The boundary condition y(1) = 0 requires that c1 = 0. Therefore y = c2 sin(k ln x). This holds with
c2 = 0 if and only if k = n/ ln 2, where n is a positive integer. Hence, the eigenvalues of (13.2.4) are
n = (n/ ln 2)2, with associated eigenfunctions

                                      yn = sin n ln x , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
                                                    ln 2

   For theoretical purposes, it's useful to rewrite the differential equation in (13.2.1) in a different form,

Theorem 13.2.1 If P0, P1, P2, and R are continuous and P0 and R are positive on a closed interval

[a, b], then the equation

                           P0(x)y + P1(x)y + P2(x)y + R(x)y = 0                                  (13.2.5)

can be rewritten as

                           (p(x)y ) + q(x)y + r(x)y = 0,                                         (13.2.6)

where p, p , q and r are continuous and p and r are positive on [a, b].

Proof We begin by rewriting (13.2.5) as

                           y + u(x)y + v(x)y + R1(x)y = 0,                                       (13.2.7)

with u = P1/P0, v = P2/P0, and R1 = R/P0. (Note that R1 is positive on [a, b].) Now let p(x) = eU(x),
where U is any antiderivative of u. Then p is positive on [a, b] and, since U = u,

                                         p (x) = p(x)u(x)                                        (13.2.8)

is continuous on [a, b]. Multiplying (13.2.7) by p(x) yields

                     p(x)y + p(x)u(x)y + p(x)v(x)y + p(x)R1(x)y = 0.                             (13.2.9)

Since p is positive on [a, b], this equation has the same solutions as (13.2.5). From (13.2.8),

                           (p(x)y ) = p(x)y + p (x)y = p(x)y + p(x)u(x)y ,

so (13.2.9) can be rewritten as in (13.2.6), with q(x) = p(x)v(x) and r(x) = p(x)R1(x). This completes
the proof.

   It is to be understood throughout the rest of this section that p, q, and r have the properties stated in
Theorem 13.2.1. Moreover, whenever we write Ly in a general statement, we mean

                           Ly = (p(x)y ) + q(x)y.

The differential equation (13.2.6) is called a Sturm-Liouville equation, and the eigenvalue problem

                     (p(x)y ) + q(x)y + r(x)y = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0,                         (13.2.10)

which is equivalent to (13.2.1), is called a Sturm-Liouville problem.

Example 13.2.3 Rewrite the eigenvalue problem

                           y + 3y + (2 + )y = 0, y(0) = 0, y(1) = 0                              (13.2.11)

of Example 13.2.1 as a Sturm-Liouville problem.

Solution Comparing (13.2.11) to (13.2.7) shows that u(x) = 3, so we take U (x) = 3x and p(x) = e3x.
Multiplying the differential equation in (13.2.11) by e3x yields

                                        e3x(y + 3y ) + 2e3xy + e3xy = 0.

Since

                           e3x(y + 3y ) = (e3xy ) ,

(13.2.11) is equivalent to the Sturm-Liouville problem

                           (e3xy ) + 2e3xy + e3xy = 0, y(0) = 0, y(1) = 0.                       (13.2.12)
                                                        Section 13.2 Sturm-Liouville Problems 691

Example 13.2.4 Rewrite the eigenvalue problem        y(1) = 0,  y(2) = 0    (13.2.13)
                                  x2y + xy + y = 0,

of Example 13.2.2 as a Sturm-Liouville problem.

Solution Dividing the differential equation in (13.2.13) by x2 yields

                                1                    
                                y + y + 2 y = 0.
                                xx

Comparing this to (13.2.7) shows that u(x) = 1/x, so we take U (x) = ln x and p(x) = eln x = x.
Multiplying the differntial equation by x yields

Since                           xy + y +  y = 0.
                                               x

                                xy + y = (xy ) ,

(13.2.13) is equivalent to the Sturm-Liouville problem

       (xy ) +  y = 0, y(1) = 0, y(2) = 0.                                  (13.2.14)
                  x

   Problems 1-4 of Section 11.1 are Sturm-Liouville problems. (Problem 5 isn't , although some authors
use a definition of Sturm-Liouville problem that does include it.) We were able to find the eigenvalues
of Problems 1-4 explicitly because in each problem the coefficients in the boundary conditions satisfy
 = 0 and  = 0; that is, each boundary condition involves either y or y , but not both. If this isn't
true then the eigenvalues can't in general be expressed exactly by simple formulas; rather, approximate
values must be obtained by numerical solution of equations derived by requiring the determinants of
certain 2  2 systems of homogeneous equations to be zero. To apply the numerical methods effectively,
graphical methods must be used to determine approximate locations of the zeros of these determinants.
Then the zeros can be computed accurately by numerical methods.

Example 13.2.5 Solve the Sturm-Liouville problem

       y + y = 0, y(0) + y (0) = 0, y(1) + 3y (1) = 0.                      (13.2.15)

Solution If  = 0, the differential equation in (13.2.15) reduces to y = 0, with general solution
y = c1 + c2x. The boundary conditions require that

                                c1 + c2 = 0
                                c1 + 4c2 = 0,

so c1 = c2 = 0. Therefore zero isn't an eigenvalue of (13.2.15).
   If  < 0, we write  = -k2 where k > 0, and the differential equation in (13.2.15) becomes y -

k2y = 0, with general solution

                                y = c1 cosh kx + c2 sinh kx,                (13.2.16)

so
                                           y = k(c1 sinh kx + c2 cosh kx).

   Figure 13.2.1 u = tanh k and u = -2k/(1 - 3k2)

The boundary conditions require that

                           c1 + kc2 = 0                                                  (13.2.17)
   (cosh k + 3k sinh k)c1 + (sinh k + 3k cosh k)c2 = 0.

The determinant of this system is

   DN (k) =                           1                       k

                                      cosh k + 3k sinh k sinh k + 3k cosh k

   = (1 - 3k2) sinh k + 2k cosh k.

Therefore the system (13.2.17) has a nontrivial solution if and only if DN (k) = 0 or, equivalently,

                                      tanh k = -  2k      2.                             (13.2.18)

The graph of the right side (Figure 13.2.1) has a vertical asymptote atk = 1/ 3. Since the two sides have
different signs if k < 1/ 3, this equation has no solution in (0, 1/ 3). Figure 13.2.1 shows the graphs

of the two sides of (13.2.18) on an interval to the right of the vertical asymptote, which is indicated by

the dashed line. You can see that the two curves intersect near k0 = 1.2, Given this estmate, you can use
Newton's to compute k0 more accurately. We computed k0  1.1219395. Therefore -k02  -1.2587483

is an eigenvalue of (13.2.15). From (13.2.16) and the first equation in (13.2.17),

                                             y0 = k0 cosh k0x - sinh k0x.                + k2y = 0,
                                                                                           (13.2.19)
   If  > 0 we write  = k2 where k > 0, and differential equation in (13.2.15) becomes y
with general solution

                                                y = cos kx + c2 sin kx,
                                                                                Section 13.2 Sturm-Liouville Problems 693

so
                                           y = k(-c1 sin kx + c2 cos kx).

The boundary conditions require that

                                                       c1 + kc2 = 0                                (13.2.20)
                                  (cos k - 3k sin k)c1 + (sin k + 3k cos k)c2 = 0.

The determinant of this system is

                         DP (k) =                               1                          k

                                                                cos k - 3k sin k sin k + 3k cos k

                                        = (1 + 3k2) sin k + 2k cos k.

The system (13.2.20) has a nontrivial solution if and only if DP (k) = 0 or, equivalently,

                                                                tan k = -  2k      2.

                                                                           1 + 3k

Figure 13.2.2 shows the graphs of the two sides of this equation. You can see from the figure that the

graphs intersect at infinitely many points kn  n (n = 1, 2, 3,. . . ), where the error in this approximation
approaches zero as n  . Given this estimate, you can use Newton's method to compute kn more
accurately. We computed

                                                                k1  2.9256856,

                                                                             n

From (13.2.19) and the first equation in (13.2.20),

                                                                yn = kn cos knx - sin knx

is an eigenfunction associated with n
   Since the differential equations in (13.2.12) and (13.2.14) are more complicated than those in (13.2.11)

and (13.2.13) respectively, what is the point of Theorem 13.2.1? The point is this: to solve a specific
problem, it may be better to deal with it directly, as we did in Examples 13.2.1 and 13.2.2; however, we'll
see that transforming the general eigenvalue problem (13.2.1) to the Sturm-Liouville problem (13.2.10)
leads to results applicable to all eigenvalue problems of the form (13.2.1).

Theorem 13.2.2 If

                                                                Ly = (p(x)y ) + q(x)y

and u and v are twice continuously functions on [a, b] that satisfy the boundary conditions B1(y) = 0

and B2(y) = 0, then

By assumption, B1(u) = B1(v) = 0 and B2(u) = B2(v) = 0. Therefore

         u(a) + u (a) = 0                      u(b) + u (b) = 0
         v(a) + v (a) = 0 and v(b) + v (b) = 0.

Since 2 + 2 > 0 and 2 + 2 > 0, the determinants of these two systems must both be zero; that is,

         u(a)v (a) - u (a)v(a) = u(b)v (b) - u (b)v(b) = 0.

This and (13.2.22) imply (13.2.21), which completes the proof.
   The next theorem shows that a Sturm-Liouville problem has no complex eigenvalues.

Theorem 13.2.3 If  = p + qi with q = 0 then the boundary value problem

                                Ly + r(x)y = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0

has only the trivial solution.

Proof For this theorem to make sense, we must consider complex-valued solutions of

                                  Ly + (p + iq)r(x, y)y = 0.                        (13.2.23)

If y = u + iv where u and v are real-valued and twice differentiable, we define y = u + iv and
y = u + iv . We say that y is a solution of (13.2.23) if the real and imaginary parts of the left side of
(13.2.23) are both zero. Since Ly = (p(x) y) + q(x)y and p, q, and r are real-valued,

             Ly + r(x)y = L(u + iv) + (p + iq)r(x)(u + iv)
                                = Lu + r(x)(pu - qv) + i[Lv + r(x)(pu + qv)],

so Ly + r(x)y = 0 if and only if

                                  Lu + r(x)(pu - qv) = 0
                                  Lv + r(x)(qu + pv) = 0.

Multiplying the first equation by v and the second by u yields

                                           vLu + r(x)(puv - qv2) = 0
                                          uLv + r(x)(qu2 + puv) = 0.

Subtracting the first equation from the second yields

                                uLv - vLu + qr(x)(u2 + v2) = 0,

so        b                              b
Since        [u(x)Lv(x) - v(x)Lu(x)] dx + r(x)[u2(x) + v2(x)] dx = 0.
                                                                                    (13.2.24)

       a                              a

                                B1(y) = B1(u + iv) = B1(u) + iB1(v)

and
                                      B2(y) = B2(u + iv) = B2(u) + iB2(v),

B1(y) = 0 and B2(y) = 0 implies that

                                B1(u) = B2(u) = B1(v) = B2(v) = 0.

Therefore Theorem 13.2.2 implies that first integral in (13.2.24) equals zero, so (13.2.24) reduces to

                                                                   b

                                          q r(x)[u2(x) + v2(x)] dx = 0.

                                                                 a

Since r is positive on [a, b] and q = 0 by assumption, this implies that u  0 and v  0 on [a, b].
Therefore y  0 on [a, b], which completes the proof.

Theorem 13.2.4 If 1 and 2 are distinct eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville problem

                   Ly + r(x)y = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0                                  (13.2.25)

with associated eigenfunctions u and v respectively, then

                                   b                                                     (13.2.26)

                                     r(x)u(x)v(x) dx = 0.

                                  a

Proof  Since u and v satisfy the boundary conditions in (13.2.25), Theorem 13.2.2 implies that

                                   b

                                    [u(x)Lv(x) - v(x)Lu(x)] dx = 0.

                                  a

Since Lu = -1ru and Lv = -2rv, this implies that

                                                                                 b

                                         (1 - 2) r(x)u(x)v(x) dx = 0.

                                                                               a

Since 1 = 2, this implies (13.2.26), which completes the proof.
   If u and v are any integrable functions on [a, b] and

                                   b

                                     r(x)u(x)v(x) dx = 0,

                                  a

we say that u and v orthogonal on [a, b] with respect to r = r(x).
   Theorem 13.1.1 implies the next theorem.

Theorem 13.2.5 If u  0 and v both satisfy

                   Ly + r(x)y = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0,

then v = cu for some constant c.

We've now proved parts of the next theorem. A complete proof is beyond the scope of this book.

Theorem 13.2.6 The set of all eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville problem

                   Ly + r(x)y = 0, B1(y) = 0, B2(y) = 0

can be ordered as

                                  1 < 2 <    < n <    ,

and
                                                       lim n = .

                                                                             n

For each n, if yn is an arbitrary n-eigenfunction, then every n-eigenfunction is a constant multiple of
yn. If m = n, ym and yn are orthogonal [a, b] with respect to r = r(x); that is,

                                   b                                                     (13.2.27)

                                     r(x)ym(x)yn(x) dx = 0.

                                  a

You may want to verify (13.2.27) for the eigenfunctions obtained in Examples 13.2.1 and 13.2.2.
In conclusion, we mention the next theorem. The proof is beyond the scope of this book.

Theorem 13.2.7 Let 1 < 2 <    < n <    be the eigenvalues of the Sturm-Liouville problem

Then                                    f(x-) + f(x+) 
                                                 2 = cnyn(x)

                                                                           n=1

for all x in the open interval (a, b).

                                        13.2 Exercises

   In Exercises 1-7 rewrite the equation in Sturm-Liouville form (with  = 0). Assume that b, c, , and
 are contants.

1. y + by + cy = 0
2. x2y + xy + (x2 - 2)y = 0 (Bessel's equation)
3. (1 - x2)y - xy + 2y = 0 (Chebyshev's equation)
4. x2y + bxy + cy = 0 (Euler's equation)

7. (1 - x2)y - 2xy + ( + 1)y = 0 (Legendre's equation)
8. In Example 13.2.4 we found that the eigenvalue problem

                         x2y + xy + y = 0, y(1) = 0, y(2) = 0                                   (A)

      is equivalent to the Sturm-Liouville problem

                                      (xy ) +  y = 0, y(1) = 0, y(2) = 0. (B)
                                                  x

      Multiply the differential equation in (B) by y and integrate to show that

                                        2  y2(x) 2 dx = x(y (x))2 dx.
                                        1x
                                                    1

     Conclude from this that the eigenvalues of (A) are all positive.

       (d) For n = 1, 2, . . . , let yn be an eigenfunction associated with n = kn2 . From Theorem 13.2.4,
       ym and yn are orthogonal over [0, L] if m = n. Verify this directly. HINT: Integrate by parts twice
       and use (B).

where 2 + 2 > 0 and 2 + 2 > 0.

28. Show that  = 0 is an eigenvalue of (SL) if and only if

                                          (L + ) -  = 0.

29. L The point of this exercise is that (SL) can't have more than two negative eigenvalues.

(a) Show that  is a negative eigenvalue of (SL) if and only if  = -k2, where k is a positive

solution of

             ( - k2) sinh kL + k( - ) cosh kL.

(b) Suppose  -  = 0. Show that (SL) has a negative eigenvalue if and only if  and  are
both nonzero. Find the negative eigenvalue and an associated eigenfunction. HINT: Show that in
this case  = p and s = q, where q = 0.

(c) Suppose  -  = 0. We know from Section 11.1 that (SL) has no negative eigenvalues if
 = 0 and  = 0. Assume that either  = 0 or  = 0. Then we can rewrite (A) as

                                      k( - )
                           tanh kL =        2.
                                       - k

By graphing both sides of this equation on the same axes (there are several possibilities for the right
side), show that it has at most two positive solutions, so (SL) has at most two negative eigenvalues.

30. L The point of this exercise is that (SL) has infinitely many positive eigenvalues 1 < 2 <
          < n <    , and that limn n = .

(a) Show that  is a positive eigenvalue of (SL) if and only if  = k2, where k is a positive solution

of

                       ( + k2) sin kL + k( - ) cos kL = 0.                               (A)

(b) Suppose  -  = 0. Show that the positive eigenvalues of (SL) are n = (n/L)2, n = 1,
2, 3, . . . . HINT: Recall the hint in Exercise 29(b).

Now suppose  -  = 0. From Section 11.1, if  = 0 and  = 0, then (SL) has the

eigenvalues
                                 n = [(2n - 1)/2L]2, n = 1, 2, 3, . . .

(why?), so let's suppose in addition that at least one of the products  and  is nonzero. Then

we can rewrite (A) as

                           tan kL =   k( - )
                                            2.                                           (B)
                                       - k

By graphing both sides of this equation on the same axes (there are several possibilities for the
right side), convince yourself of the following:

(c) If  = 0, there's a positive integer N such that (B) has one solution kn in each of the intervals

            ((2n - 1)/L, (2n + 1)/L)) , n = N, N + 1, N + 2, . . . ,                     (C)

and either

            lim kn - (2n - 1) = 0 or lim kn - (2n + 1) = 0.
            n          2L             n                    2L

(d) If  = 0, there's a positive integer N such that (B) has one solution kn in each of the intervals

(C) and                    lim kn - n = 0.

                           n          N

31. The following Sturm-Liouville problems are genera1izations of Problems 1-4 of Section 11.1.

    Problem 1: (p(x)y ) + r(x)y = 0, y(a) = 0, y(b) = 0

    Problem 2: (p(x)y ) + r(x)y = 0, y (a) = 0, y (b) = 0

    Problem 3: (p(x)y ) + r(x)y = 0, y(a) = 0, y (b) = 0

    Problem 4: (p(x)y ) + r(x)y = 0, y (a) = 0, y(b) = 0

Prove: Problems 1-4 have no negative eigenvalues. Moreover,  = 0 is an eigenvalue of Problem 2
with associated eigenfunction y0 = 1, but  = 0 isn't an eigenvalue of Problems 1, 3, and 4. HINT:

Applying variation of parameters to the given initial value problem yields

   y = ue-3x, where (A) u = 7, u(0) = 6. Since u = 0, Euler's method yields the exact

   solution of (A). Therefore the Euler semilinear method produces the exact solution of the

   given problem

.

        y = ue-3x, where (A) u = 1 - 2x, u(0) = 2. Since u = 0, the improved Euler method yields
        the exact solution of (A). Therefore the improved Euler semilinear method produces the exact solution
        of the given problem.
