fab drawings

Interpreting metal fab drawings is a course that introduces
the principles of interpretation and application of industrial
fabrication drawings. Basic principles and techniques of metal
fabrication are introduced by planning and construction of
fixtures used in fabrication from drawings. Basic tools and
equipment for layout fitting of welded fabrications are utilized.
Covers the use and application of the AWS welding symbols.
This course will utilize blueprints and welding symbols and will
apply them in classroom and in shop as practical assignments.

   The largest reason for understanding this information is to
communicate between all parties involved. This could include
the welder, engineer, quality control, as well as many more. This
is a universal language that provides clear instructions for a
quality part.

   American Welding Society has created a detailed publication
(Standard Symbols for Welding, Brazing, and Nondestructive
Examination AWS A2.4) that gives an extended amount of
knowledge in this language.

   Below is an overview of what the elements of a welding
symbol may or may not include. The welding symbol provides a
visualization for the welder or those involved to be able to apply
the applicable weld to the work piece.

                                                                         Interpreting metal fab

                          Blue Print Reading Review
   Understanding blue prints is a vital skill in the metals
industry. Whether it be as a structural welder, pipe fitter, or
quality control, this is the language that is universal for all
individuals involved in a project.
   This chapter is here to recap some line types as well as
visualizing blue prints and plans.
   Line Types
   1. Object Line
   A visible line is a thick line, without breaks, that indicates all
edges and visible surfaces of an object. An object line may also
be called a visible line.

   2. Hidden Line
   A hidden line is a medium weight line, made of short dashes,
to show edges, surfaces and corners which cannot be seen.
Sometimes they are used to make a drawing easier to
understand. Often they are omitted.

   3. Section Line
   Section lines are used on a drawing to show how an object
would look if it were sectioned, or cut apart, to give a better
picture of shape or internal construction. Section lines are very

                                                                          Blue Print Review | 3
thin (size), and are usually drawn at an angle of 45 degrees.
They show the cut surface of an object in a sectional view.
Sections and section lines will be explained in BPR 7.

   4. Center Line
   Center lines are used to indicate the centers of holes, arcs,
and symmetrical objects. They are very thin (size), long-short-
long kinds of lines. (More detail needed?)

   5. Dimension Line
   Dimension lines are thin lines with a break for entering a
measurement of some sort. The ends of the lines will also have
an arrow head pointing to an extension line (below.)

   6. Extension Line
   Extension lines are also thin lines, showing the limits of
dimensions. Dimension line arrowheads touch extension lines.

   7. Leader Line
   Leaders are more thin lines used to point to an area of a
drawing requiring a note for explanation.

   Visualizing parts
   As a welder it is imperative that you can visualize the part
you are building from the print. This is not always an easy task.
Prints may have a variety of parts or are not detailed as well as
they should be but being able to distinguish sides and faces
can help decipher these harder prints.

3. Joint types and
Terminology

Terminology of joints may play a large role in communication
with supervisors and others working on the same weldment.
Understanding the concepts associated with joint design as
well as identification of parts is critical for any metal worker.

   Joint Types
   There are 5 basic joint types used in the metal fabrication
field:
   Butt Joint: A joint type in which the butting ends of one
or more work pieces are aligned in approximately the same
plane. A butt joint has a possibility of many prepared faces. We
will talk about these in subsequent chapters. Represented is a
square groove butt joint.

   Possible Welds for a Butt Joint:
   Square Groove
   Bevel Groove
   V Groove

   J Groove
   U Groove
   Flare Bevel Groove
   Flare Vee Groove
   Flanged Edge
   Scarf (Brazed Joint)
   Corner Joint: being one of the most popular welds in the
sheet metal industry the corner joint is used on the outer edge
of the piece. This weld is a type of joint that comes together at
right angles between two metal parts to form an L. These are
common in the construction of boxes, box frames and similar
fabrications. There are variations of a corner joint, shown is a
closed corner joint.

   Possible welds for a corner joint:
   Fillet
   Edge Flange
   Corner Flange
   Bevel Groove
   V Groove Flare Bevel

   *Braze
   Tee Joint: A joint which are two pieces of metal are
perpendicular to each other. This is one of the most common
joint that will be encountered in the metal fabrication industry.

   Joints may be left as cut but some may have a prepared
surface that is determined by the engineer, designer or welder.
This is commonly seen with a Butt weld when the members
to be joined are larger in thickness. This will be visited in
subsequent chapters.
   Joint terminology
   Outside of specific joint types there are some terms that will
play a role in deciding the correct procedure for welding or
prepping the member(s) of a weldment.
   Joint Root- This is the area which is in closest proximity to
another member making the joint. This could be viewed as a
line, area, or a point depending on the view in front of you.
   Groove Face- The surface within the groove the weld may be
applied to. This can be measured at an angle from the surface
of the part to the root edge.
   Root Edge- This is a root face that has no width (land) to it. In
GTAW it is commonly referred to as a knife edge preparation.
   Root Face- This part of the prepped member is the portion
of the groove face that is also within the joint root. This is
commonly called a flat or land in the industry. This is usually a
predetermined size even though the size is not always called
out. If you take the overall thickness of the member and
subtract the groove depth you will be left with the root face
depth.
   Bevel Angle- an angle between the bevel of a member and a
perpendicular plane in relation to the surface. This may be only
equal to half of a groove angle if the opposite joining member

12 | Joint types and Terminology
is also prepped. If only a single member is prepped this is also
considered the groove angle.

   Depth of Bevel- the distance from the surface of the base
metal to the root edge or beginning of the root face.

   Groove Angle- an included angle of the groove between work
pieces. If both members are prepared this angle is from groove
face to groove face. This dimension is shown in degrees above
or below the welding symbol depending on if it is arrow side or
other side designation.

   Groove Radius-This pertains specifically to J or U groove
welds as these have a radius most commonly specific by
machining.

   Root Opening- a gap between two joining members.
   Joint Root Examples. Some may be shown with hatching.

4. Basics of Welding
Symbols

Understanding Weld vs. Welding symbol
   A weld symbol is not the same as a welding symbol. The

weld symbol specifies the type of weld to be applied to a part.
The welding symbol is made of several parts including the
reference line, arrow, and weld symbol when required. The
symbols in this book are a representation of what weld and
welding symbols look like. There are specific design
requirements when used in accordance to a blueprint.

   Reference Line and Arrow
   There are two parts that make up the main body of a welding
symbol. These include the reference line and the arrow. The
horizontal line that makes up the main body is called the
reference line. This is the anchor to which all the other welding
symbols are tied. The information that is pertinent for making
the weld are place on the reference line in specific places. The
arrow connects the reference line to the joint in which the
weld(s) is (are) to be made. There are several combinations of
the reference line and arrow, but the reference line will always
be placed in a horizontal position. This symbol is also always
read from the left to the right. If you have been around
blueprints the arrow may look a lot like a leader line. They are
not the same thing so be mindful when reviewing welding
symbols.

                                                           Basics of Welding Symbols | 21
   The reference line may include what is called the tail. This
looks like the letter V turned sideways. Such as this >. This
tail gives an area to write specifics about what weld process,
welding procedure, and even material specifications are
required for that specific welding symbol.

   Arrow vs Other Side
   Placement of the weld will depend on placement of the
symbol above or below the reference line. If the symbol has
been placed above the reference line this is calling for the other
side. If it is placed below the reference line this is calling for the
arrow side. Other and arrow side define exactly what it is calling
for. If the arrow is pointing to the right side of the joint the weld
will be placed on the right side if an arrow side weld is called
out. If the arrow is pointing at the right side of the joint and
another side weld is called then the weld will be applied to the
left side of the part.
22 | Basics of Welding Symbols
   If a weld is to be placed on the other side of a joint a symbol
will be placed above the reference line.

   If a weld is to be placed on the arrow side of a joint the symbol
will be placed below the reference line.

                                                          Basics of Welding Symbols | 23
   It is very important to understand the difference of these two
sides as it could finish a product or if done incorrectly send it
back to be reworked in order to get the correct outcome. The
concept behind this may seem very simple at the moment but
as we work through this book and start adding more elements
to the welding symbol it may become more taxing on the
thought process. The most important thing to do is break it
down piece by piece and truly understand what the symbol is
asking/ requiring for the weld.

            At times there may be multiple reference lines. If this
is the case it is important to remember the order of which the
welding is to occur. The reference line nearest the arrow will be
the first operation, followed by the second, and so on until all
operations are complete.

5. Supplementary
Welding Symbols

These are symbols that are added onto a weld symbol to give
further instruction or knowledge of the final product.

   Weld all around
   This symbol is simply a circle at the junction of the arrow
and the reference line. This indicates that on a part that a weld
could be completed around an entire joint. A common place
you could see this is the junction of a square or round tube and
a plate.

   Field Weld
   The symbol is a flag that will be at the junction of the arrow
and reference line. This indicates that the part while may be
assembled in a shop setting, its final welding procedures will
be completed in the field during installation. The flag itself
should point in the direction of the tail (end of reference line.)

                                                                     Supplementary Welding
                                                                                      Symbols | 27
It can also be placed above or below the reference line for an
other or arrow side specification.

   Melt Through
   Melt through is most commonly associated with a groove
weld. This is indicating you are achieving 100% penetration with
a root reinforcement. This symbol can also be seen when sheet
metal is being welded and there is an implied melt through in
seams and joints.

28 | Supplementary Welding Symbols
   Melt through may include a finishing contour as well as
finishing method as parts are often cleaned up before they are
sent to be painted, powder coated, or put into service.

   Consumable Insert
   A consumable insert symbol is used when an insert is used
within a welded joint that becomes part of the weld. These are

                                                Supplementary Welding Symbols | 29
commonly specified in shape, size, and material. The symbol
is placed on the opposite side of the groove weld symbol. The
consumable insert class must be placed in the tail of the
welding symbol. This class is defined by the American Welding
Society.

   Backing
   A backing strip is specified by placing a rectangle on the
opposite side of the reference line from the groove weld
symbol. If the backing must be removed after the welding
operation has been finished, the letter R must be placed inside
of the backing symbol. Material to be used as well as the
dimensions must be placed in the tail of the symbol or
somewhere on the drawing.

30 | Supplementary Welding Symbols
   Spacer
   A spacer may be used on a double groove weld. In this case
both the top and bottom are prepped and a spacer is added to
the middle of the groove. The symbol is a rectangle the breaks
the reference line. A note on the print or in the tail can specify
material and dimensions.

   Weld contour
   There are 3 symbols used for specifying the contour finish of
a weld. This is the final appearance of a weld as it goes into
service. These are commonly associated with fillet welds but
sometimes will present themselves with groove welds. If a "flat"
symbol is used with a groove weld it will then be called a flush
contour rather than flat.

   Contour symbols may also include yet another element
which will show to the right of the fillet weld symbol above
the contour. These are letter designations which will be for
finishing methods.

6. Fillet Weld Symbols

Fillet welds are one of the most common weld types in the
industry. This weld is used when the joint has two members
coming together to form an intersection of commonly 90
degrees. These welds can be applied on varying angles but this
would be the most prominent.

   A fillet weld symbol can be used with an arrow side (below
reference line) other side (above reference line) significance or
on both sides (both sides of the reference line.) When a fillet
weld is required on both sides of the reference line it is called a
double fillet weld. The vertical leg of the symbol will always be
placed to the left regardless of which way the arrow is pointing.

   Fillet welds may have a size associated with them. This size
                                                                     Fillet Weld Symbols | 33
is called out on the left side of the symbol before the vertical
side. The size is indicating the leg length of the weld. If a single
size is called out this is specifying that weld should have equal
leg sizes. If it is an equal leg fillet weld it is not common to
dimension it on the print as shown below for demonstration
purpose.

   If a double fillet weld is called out the size will be shown
for both sides of the joint, depending on the part these welds
could vary in size so it is necessary to provide this information.

   There are times when an unequal leg fillet weld is called
34 | Fillet Weld Symbols
out. In this situation the part must be dimensioned in order to
apply the correct leg size to the right member being welded.
This may include only one of the two leg lengths. If there were
no indication of which leg is which the part could be welded
incorrectly.

   Sometimes fillet welds will not be shown with a size but will
rather have a note in the tail of the symbol that gives required
information for size. This is common when fillet welds will all be
the same size.

            In the case of the length of a weld, this may or may not
have a dimension associated with it. If the weld does not have a

                                                                     Fillet Weld Symbols | 35
dimension the weld will be the continuous length of the joint.
Whether the part is 2" or 60" long if it has no dimension the
weld will run the length of the joint. A weld may be applied only
to a specific length of a joint. This must be shown in the weld
symbol to communicate the information between individuals.
The weld length will be provided on the right side of the fillet
weld symbol.

36 | Fillet Weld Symbols
Fillet Weld Symbols | 37
   This shows a 6" fillet weld to be applied to the arrow side.
   There may be times where a length is given on a part and the
location of the weld will be given with a dimension in order to
achieve the correct location.

   Hatching lines may be used to indicate the length of a weld
instead of using a dimension on the weld symbol itself.

            There are instances when a weld may change direction
because of part geometry. If this happens it will be called out
using multiple arrows off of one reference line.

38 | Fillet Weld Symbols
            When a weld is not required to be continuous it is
common to apply an intermittent weld. This means that there
are gaps between the termination of one weld and the start of
the next. These are called weld segments. They are commonly
referred to as skip welds in the industry.

   When using an intermittent weld there is a call out specified
for the length of the weld and also the pitch that is to be
applied. When this is shown on the right side of the symbol and
it is called as the length of segment a hyphen and then the
pitch of the welds. The pitch of the weld is measured as center
to center of the next segment. (Ex. 1-2)

                                                                     Fillet Weld Symbols | 39
   At times that there are welds on both sides of the joint and
they are intermittent, this now becomes chain intermittent
welding. This can be seen on long sections of a tee joint that
isn't under a large amount of stress.

40 | Fillet Weld Symbols
   When an intermittent fillet is not a chain weld it will then be
called out as a staggered intermittent fillet weld. The welds will
be placed on both sides of the joint but it will be offset with
one another. This offset shows on the reference line as well. It
could be staggered in either direction on the reference line.
Dimensions of these welds must be specified on both sides of
the reference line.

   If the weld is only to be intermittent on one side and a
continuous weld on the other the symbol must be
dimensioned individually.

                                                                      Fillet Weld Symbols | 41
   Not all pitch will be the same, or necessarily common space.
You must be able to calculate the spacing between weld stops
and weld starts in order to apply the correct welds to the
specification. An easy way to find this distance is simply
subtract the pitch from the weld length (segment.)

   7 inches (pitch) - 3 inches (length of segment) = 4 inches
(spacing in between welds)

   At times there will be a mixture of continuous welding as

42 | Fillet Weld Symbols
well as intermittent welding. If this occurs the spacing between
these segments will all be the same.

   If this combination occurs welding symbols should specify
continuous and intermittent on the same side of the joint.
These are also often dimensioned.

7. Groove Welding
Symbols

A groove weld will be used when to parts come together in the
same plane. These welds will be applied in a butt joint and may
have a preparation or not before welding. This is the reason
there are several types of groove welding symbols.

   The symbols for these grooves are nearly identical to the
symbols that represent them.

   When a weld is to be applied to only one side of a joint it will
be called a single groove weld. For example below is a welding
symbol of a single V-Groove weld on the other side. All single

                                                             Groove Welding Symbols | 45
groove welds should be considered complete joint penetration
(CJP) unless otherwise specified.

   If a weld is to be applied to both sides of the joint this is called
a double groove weld. For example below is a welding symbol
of a double bevel groove weld.

   The theory behind the single groove weld and double groove
weld translate to all of the groove weld symbols. It would be
redundant to recreate all of these images.

46 | Groove Welding Symbols
What do these symbols call for?
   In some cases you will see a jog in the arrow. This is called a

break in the arrow that will designate which side of the joint
will be required to have the preparation done to it. For example
if a single bevel is to be applied to the left side of the joint a
broken arrow will be pointing specifically at that side of the
joint.

   If there was not an indicating arrow the welder or fitter would
choose which side should be prepared according to their

                                                             Groove Welding Symbols | 47
knowledge. This could be an issue if an engineer has specific
needs for the part or weld.

   Quiz
   Draw the symbol representing the below groove and name it
(don't forget to specify which side of the joint is prepared):

   Draw the symbol for a V groove on the other side below:
   Groove weld dimensioning

            There are several dimensions that may be added to a
groove weld if it is needed. This can include a groove angle,
root opening, a groove radius, depth of the groove preparation,
and groove weld size. There are times that this information may
not be included at all. This would mean that it is the welder's
discretion as to how the part will be prepared and welded.

            Groove angle is shown in degrees and will include all
of the groove, if it is a V Groove it will be a dimension from
one groove face to the other. This can be confused with bevel
angle. Bevel angle is only one half of a V groove. This dimension
is shown within the weld symbol itself. There is a possibility
for two different angles if you are applying to a double groove
weld. The arrow and other side do not have to necessarily
match in angles.

            A groove weld is the most common weld to have a root

48 | Groove Welding Symbols
opening. This is a gap that is predetermined to have between
two members to be welded. There is not always a root opening
and this dimension can be omitted from the welding symbol. It
is common to put a root opening on a part to ensure complete
penetration or even melt through. The melt through symbol is
included in supplementary welding symbols.

   Grooves that associate with U and J preparations are a rather
special weld. These welds if done to correct standards are
machined with a specific radius of groove as well as root face.
These dimensions must be shown in a detail or section view
that is noted in the tail of the welding symbol.

   The preparation of the groove may be called out for how
deep you are to prepare the part. This is called the depth of
groove. V- Grooves, j- grooves, and u- grooves are the most

                                                             Groove Welding Symbols | 49
commonly sized welds for depth. Although this does not mean
it cannot be applied to others. The dimension will be shown to
the left of the weld symbol.

   As we start adding more elements the symbols get fairly
complicated looking. The easiest thing to do is slow down and
look at each individual piece and apply it to what we have
learned. For example the below weld is a single V-groove weld
on the other side. This weld has a ½ inch groove depth, 1/16inch
root opening, and 90 degree groove angle.

50 | Groove Welding Symbols
   When using a groove depth that is not the full depth of the
part we leave a flat area in the root. This area is called the root
face. A more common term you will hear is the land. In the
diagram above we have a ½ inch groove depth and we have a
¾ inch part. This leaves us a ¼ inch root face.

            Often associated with a groove weld is going to be the
weld size. This weld size is the depth of penetration you will
be getting when applying the weld. When a weld is applied
we should be melting into the root of the part so our weld
should be larger in dimension than the preparation of the joint.
This dimension will show to the left of the weld symbol. When
paired with a groove depth the weld size will be within
parentheses. If no weld size is shown the weld should be
complete joint penetration.

                                                              Groove Welding Symbols | 51
            In the case of a groove that shows a depth of groove
preparation but the weld size does not show. The weld shall not
be less than the depth of preparation. If you did not perform
a weld that was at least this size you will not have completed
adequate fusion or the weld will not fill the groove.

   There are times when dimensions will not be shown on
grooves. If the joint is symmetrical then the weld shall be
52 | Groove Welding Symbols
complete joint penetration. This is easily pictured with a double
v-Groove.

   The above image shown is a double V-Groove weld. There is
no groove depth shown so by welder's discretion the parts are
prepped to ¼ inch on both sides to create a symmetrical joint.

   When working with a double groove that has the same
dimensions on both sides it is required that dimensions are
shown on both sides of the reference line. This is important
because if one dimension is left off there will be an unknown
size and this may compromise the weld.

                                                             Groove Welding Symbols | 53
   There are also times that a weld is not required to penetrate
the depth of the groove. The easiest way to accomplish this
would be to place a weld size dimension to the left of the weld
symbol that is of smaller size than the material thickness.

   There may be a weld applied to both sides in order to get
penetration through the groove thickness without preparation
of the part. This is going to be limited to smaller thickness of
material depending on the process that is used for the welding.

54 | Groove Welding Symbols
   The two flare type grooves including a bevel and a Vee are
going to be very common when working with sheet metal and
also if there are welds being made to tubing that may have
a large radius on the corners. This is fairly common in tubing
that is ¼" and above in thickness. If working with sheet metal
it is common to make a joint type of this type in order to fuse
the parts together. Instead of using filler the material that is
making the flare bevel may have a leg of an 1/8" or so and it will
make up for the filler.

   When using either of these symbols it is important to know
the difference between the preparation of groove depth as
well as the weld size. Similar to a regular bevel or vee the
preparation of groove depth is going to be to the left of the
weld symbol and also to the left of the weld size which will be

                                                             Groove Welding Symbols | 55
shown in parenthesis. Length can be added in a dimension to
the right of the weld symbol.

   Back, Backing weld, Surfacing weld
            A back or backing symbol is the same for both, you

must look in the tail for further information to distinguish
between them.

            A back weld is when a weld is made in the groove of
a joint and followed by a weld applied to the root side. This
is most commonly used to insure complete penetration on
CJP grooves. The Back weld is usually applied after the root
has been ground or gouged out to make sure that the weld
is made to sufficient material. When trying to remember the
difference between a back and backing weld, you must always
go back in order to do a back weld.

            A backing weld is made on the root side of a groove in
order to ensure that the weld that is going to be made in the
groove does not melt through the backside. This may also help
ensure CJP.

   Below is a representation of a backing weld.

56 | Groove Welding Symbols
   Below is a representation of a back weld.

            There are times where the tail will be omitted from the
drawing and in the tail there will be a note that may say which
order the welds are to be made. It may be as simple as "other
side weld made first" or may include true terms such as "other
side bevel groove welded before back weld on arrow side."

   Surfacing welds
   Surfacing welds are made by single or multiple passes to
parts for a variety of reasons. These may include buildup of
worn material, hard facing a part, or increasing part
dimensions. This symbol may be on the arrow side of a joint
only. It is important that the arrow points specifically where the
surfacing shall be added.

   These welds may include a thickness of weld which will be
                                                             Groove Welding Symbols | 57
located to the left of the weld symbol and may also show a
length to the right of the symbol. With this type of weld it will
more than likely have a detail view with dimensions for the
welding.

   When a surfacing weld may need multiple layers this may be
shown in a note on the blueprint or it could also be determined
by the reference lines. There are times where there may be
more than one reference line which gives it an order of
operation. For example if you think of a backing weld this
would be listed on the reference line which is closest to the
arrow, the groove weld would be placed on the second
reference line.

            To show this in surfacing welds it may ask for a specific
size for the first layer of buildup and then a different size for the
second or subsequent layers. If there is a change in direction
this may be shown in the tail of a multi reference welding
symbol.

58 | Groove Welding Symbols
            A surfacing weld will run the entire length of the part
unless there is a dimension, note, or other designating it is not
full. This also plays a part when welding a shaft or other round
object. With a round object rather than a longitudinal (long
dimension) or lateral (short dimension) of the part you may
see axial (the length of the shaft) or circumferential (around
the shaft.) When a weld will be done to a shaft or other round
part this must be called out or an incorrect procedure may be
applied.

8. Plug Weld symbols

Plug welds are a round weld that is made inside of an existing
hole most commonly in one piece of metal, welding that piece
to another member. The plug weld symbol is a rectangle with a
diameter symbol placed to the left of the symbol as well as the
number associated with that diameter.

   Some drawings will not indicate the hole in the print so the
use of dimensions come in to play when locating where a plug
weld will be executed. The location will be indicated by a
centerline through the part.

   Above is indicating a ½" plug weld offset 1" from the edge to
the center of the weld.
60 | Plug Weld symbols
   Some plug welds may include a countersink of the hole of
the plug weld. This is called the included angle of countersink.
This angle is shown below the rectangle of the symbol itself or
if the plug weld is to be on the other side it will be placed above
the weld symbol. When figuring sizing of the hole remember
that the diameter will be the narrow of the hole at the base of
the weld.

   Without a countersink included it will be necessary to follow
shop standards and procedures to dictate what this needs to
be, if any angle. Most shops have a procedure in place for tasks
that will be done often. If it is needed it may be listed on a
welding procedure for the plug welds that are being
completed.

   If a number of plug welds are needed there will be yet
another element added to the symbol. This will be a number
that is surrounded in parentheses, such as (6) for example.

                                                                      Plug Weld symbols | 61
            When applying a plug weld it is important to know the
depth of fill that is required. If the plug weld should fill the hole
provided then the symbol will be left empty. This means there
will be no dimension inside of the rectangle. If the hole should
be filled only so much then this will be placed inside of the
rectangle. This dimension will be in a fraction and indicates the
amount in inches the hole will be filled, not the necessarily how
much the hole will be filled.

   Another element that can be added to this weld symbol may
be the pitch (spacing) for multiple welds. This is located to the
right of the symbol and is a number representing the center to
center spacing for weld location.

62 | Plug Weld symbols
   Plug welds may have a contour symbol which will be added
below the symbol or countersink angle if on the arrow side and
above if it is on the other side of the reference line. There are
many types of contours and finishing designations, these are
covered in supplementary welding symbols.

   This symbol represents:
   Plug Weld
   Arrow Side
   ½ inch in diameter
   1/8" amount of fill
   45 degree included angle of countersink
   Flat contour
   Finished by Machining
   Slot Weld Symbol

            The slot weld symbol is the same that is used for plug
welds. The symbol will not show a diameter symbol before the
size however. The size of the weld will be the slot width instead.

                                                                      Plug Weld symbols | 63
This is shown to the left of the symbol just as it is shown in plug
welds.

1/2" width slot weld
   The length of the slot weld will be presented to the right of

the symbol. This may also include a pitch showing the center
to center spacing of the slot welds. If there is a pitch there will
be a number of slot welds provided in parenthesis under the
symbol on the arrow side or above the symbol on an other side
weld.

            The drawing must show the orientation of the slot
welds as to not confuse direction along the part. The above
image shows the slots with a vertical orientation to the part
versus a horizontal layout as shown below.
64 | Plug Weld symbols
   A slot weld can include any number of elements, these are
very similar to the plug weld symbol that was just explained.

   These can include:
   Arrow or other side
   Size (width)
   Length of slot
   Pitch
   Depth of fill
   Number of welds required
   Contour
   Finish

            Make no mistake on the fill of a plug or slot weld fill.
There is a possibility of having a fillet weld inside of a hole
versus actually filling the hole for a plug weld. This could also
be mistakenly done on a slot weld.

9. Spot, Seam, Stud
Welding Symbols

Spot Weld
   The spot weld symbol is simply a circle that may be placed

above, below, or centered on the reference line. When the
symbol is centered on the reference line this indicates that
there is no side significance. When there is no side significance
this can commonly be applied using a resistance spot welder
which is used widely in sheet metal work.

   A spot weld is simple a weld applied to the surface of one
member that has enough heat input to melt into the material
that is creating the faying surface. This is done with no prior
preparation to the parts.

   An example of arrow side spot weld and a no side
significance resistance spot weld below.

   The size of a spot weld is going to be placed to the left side
of the welding symbol. This number indicates the diameter of
said spot weld at the faying surface. The faying surface is where
two parts are placed on top of each other at close proximity.

                                                                   Spot, Seam, Stud Welding
                                                                                      Symbols | 67
   The number of spot welds required will be added in
parenthesis above or below the symbol depending on location
of the symbol. If it is centered on the reference line the
placement of required welds could be placed above or below
the symbol.

   Pitch can be added to the spot weld symbol as well. This will
be presented to the right of the symbol.

   When a pitch is used this is stating that this will be continued
across the full length of the part. For example if the part is 20
inches long you would be applying welds every 2 inches using
the above symbol for the length of that 20 inch part. If the spot
welding will not be covering the full length of the part this will

68 | Spot, Seam, Stud Welding Symbols
need to be shown with dimension lines on the print in order to
communicate this information properly.

   Full length call out:

Partial  length  of  part:

            There are times when instead of using a diameter
dimension the call out will be for shear strength. This is how
resistant something is to shearing. This can be called out in

                                              Spot, Seam, Stud Welding Symbols | 69
pound-force (lbf) or if the blueprint is in metric it would call for
Newton's (N).

This calls for a spot weld with 500 pound-force shear strength.
   (500 lbf specifies that the part will be able to resist shearing

to a minimum of 500 lbf.
            It may be specified what process will be used to

achieve the weld and this will be put into the tail. Common
processes for this would be resistance spot welding, and gas
tungsten arc welding. The reasoning behind these are there
could be no added filler used with the weld so there will be
less of a chance for lack of fusion. Many other processes may
be used as long as the effects of the weld are known and still
acceptable for the outcome of the weld.

   A contour may be added to the spot symbol in order to
ensure that the surface is flush as if no weld has taken place.
This will go into further detail in supplementary welding
symbols.
70 | Spot, Seam, Stud Welding Symbols
   For an example below is an arrow side weld with a flush
contour by grinding.

   Seam Weld
            The seam weld uses a similar process as a spot weld

but in an elongated fashion. There is no preparation like a plug
or slot weld, rather the weld projects through the top surface
and melts into the other member by means of heat input. The
symbol is similar but it carries two parallel lines through it.

   An example of a seam weld:

                                              Spot, Seam, Stud Welding Symbols | 71
            Seam welds will have a size or shear strength
associated with the welding symbol commonly. This number
will go to the left of the welding symbol. A size is an indication
of width of the bead. Shear strength is the same as a spot weld
and is the amount of pound-force the weld can take minimum
per 1 inch of weld.

   Length can be added to the right side of the symbol to
indicate how long the weld to be made is.

   An additional element can be a pitch if it is needed for
72 | Spot, Seam, Stud Welding Symbols
applying several welds. This will be added to the right side of
the weld symbol after the length with a hyphen.

            Seam welds can also have elements as spot welds do
such as a process associated in the tail as well as a contour. The
contour is shown above or below the symbol depending on the
way the symbol is on the reference line.

            The next image shows a weld call out for a Seam weld
on the arrow side. ½ inch in width with 2.5" segments and a 5.5"
pitch. All intermittent welds (pitch) are made in a lengthwise
pattern unless there is a detail on the print that says otherwise.

   Stud Welds
            Stud welds are a common practice in many shops. This

process often uses a stud welder which is sometimes a
standalone or handheld unit. These welds require the symbol
to be on the arrow side only of a joint. The elements of size,
pitch, and amount of stud welds are placed in the same
locations as spot and seam welds.

   The above weld is calling for six ½" diameter stud welds
placed at a 4" center to center spacing.

   Studs come in all sorts of sizes, shapes, and varieties. For
example there are studs for concrete anchors, threaded bolt
patterns, tapped studs to use as a bolt, insulation hangers, and
even hard faced studs to replace hard facing a part.

   Resistance seam weld with no side significance, 8" pitch, 16"

is 20" long and the first stud is placed 1" from the edge how
many studs are required?

10. Edge Weld Symbols

   Edge weld symbols are most commonly associated with
sheet metal or "gauge" material. This gauge is a system used in
order to call out sheet metal similar to that of electricians and
wire. This chart can range from the largest gauge of carbon
steel at #7 which is a decimal of .1793" all the way to the
smallest which is #28 at a decimal of .0149." This system is
much simpler than using a fraction for how small these
numbers are. It is also important to know that there are specific
charts for carbon steel, aluminum, stainless steel, brass, copper,
and galvanized steel.

   The edge weld may include a weld size which will be shown
to the left of the weld symbol. The weld size is a measurement
of depth of fusion, not necessarily the width of the weld. This
does not mean these dimensions couldn't be the same. If there
is not a size specified it will be up to the welder's discretion.

                                                                     Edge Weld Symbols | 77
   Single sided edge welds are used on edge joints, flanged butt
joints, and flanged corner joints. If there is a double edge weld
it will be used only with a flat edge joint. This is shown below:

78 | Edge Weld Symbols
   For edge welds a length can be associated with the symbol
and it will be shown to the right of the weld symbol. If there
is not a dimension shown to the right it will be full length of
the part. There may be other indicators shown on a print of
what weld length is required by using hatching or notes. Below
shows an edge symbol with an 8" length as well as a detail view
of a part to show specifically where two 2" welds will be located.

                                                                    Edge Weld Symbols | 79
            In chapter 3 Fillet Welds there was a section on length
and pitch. An edge weld can also be welded in this same
manner. This will be shown to the right with length followed
by a hyphen and then the pitch. This can also include a chain
intermittent edge weld for an edge joint. This will be more
common with thicker material when it is a lengthy weld.

   There may be a staggered intermittent edge weld as well.
This is shown the same as a chain intermittent edge weld but
the symbols will be offset.

   When the location for these welds are not obvious it will be
80 | Edge Weld Symbols
called out on the blueprint. This may come from a note or
detail drawing or even by using extension lines.

   Some edge welds will be including more than 2 members. In
this case there will be only one arrow that points at the joint but
encompasses all of the members. This will be more common
with sheet metal.

            With an edge joint on a flanged butt joint or corner
joint there could be the possibility of melt through. This is
talked more in detail in Supplementary Symbols. When this
symbol shows it is an indicator that the weld is by design
supposed to burn through the back side of the material. This is
quite common with sheet metal when the worry of burning a
hole or something of the sort is a concern.

            Melt through may be left as simple as the symbol or it
may include a size. This is shown to the left of the symbol and
indicates how much penetration past the weld joint is required.
This is referred to as melt-through.

                                                                     Edge Weld Symbols | 81
            Another type of weld that is commonly seen with an
edge weld is a flare bevel or flare v groove. This is because the
opposite side of the edge is exactly that type of configuration.
This may be called for on materials that adequate melt through
cannot be achieved or an engineer's request.

There are a lot of processes in the welding industry, in order
to streamline the call out of these there are letter designations
for them. This designation is a letter callout and it commonly
follows the first letter of the process name. For example Flux
Cored Arc Welding is FCAW.

            When a process is specified it will be located in the
tail of the welding symbol. This can be added to several other
components on the welding symbol.

   Method
   The method by which the weld is applied may also be listed
in the welding symbol. This will often be seen after a process

with a hyphen. There are four different methods of applying
a weld and the designation is the first two letters from the
first word for the first three. Number Four comes from the
first two letters of the hyphenated words. These methods vary
depending on process and may not be applicable to all welding
processes.

12. Pipe Symbols

Pipe Drawings are much different from specific weld symbols
but they do have a similar relationship from part to symbol.
Some individuals will not see these in their line of work but it is
important to be aware of them.

   As with weld symbols, pipe symbols are a reflection of what
that part would look like in theory. For example if a 90 degree
elbow is to be placed in service the drawing will reflect a 90
degree angle. There may be multiple symbols for one fitting or
part depending on the fashion it is to be installed (Butt weld,
Socket Weld, Threaded.)

   Below is a breakdown of almost every type of fitting and
connection.

                                                                              Pipe Symbols | 87

13. Pipe Drawings

Pipe drawings differ from common blueprints one would see
in the construction or welding field. The drawings we often
see in these fields would be orthographic views which may
include top, front, right side, left side, bottom, and back views
depending on what is needed to convey information. Pipe
drawings are presented in an Isometric view (ISO.) This view
is drawn in order to show a pictorial view of what is needed.
Commonly these are drawn at a 30 degree angle from the
horizontal plane. This can cause some distortion in dimensions
so it is imperative that the correct dimensions are shown.

   The image below shows a orthographic view of a butt welded
pipe with three sizes (A, B, C).

· The A size is measured from the front to the center line of
   the elbow / pipe.

· The B size is measured from centerline to centerline.
· The C size is like the A size, measured from the front to the

   center line of the elbow / pipe.

Presentations of a Piping System

The image below show the presentation used in drafting. The
isometric view clearly show the piping arrangement, but the
plan view fails to show the bypass loop and valve, and the
supplementary elevation view is needed.

Isometric views in more than one plane

Below are some examples of isometric drawings. The auxiliary
lines in the shape of a cube, ensure better visualization of the
pipeline routing.

Figure 1 shows a pipeline which runs through three planes. The
pipe line begins and ends with a flange.

Figure 2 is almost identical to the drawing above. A different
perspective is shown, and the pipe that comes from above is
longer.
Because this pipe in isometric view, runs behind the other pipe,
this must be indicated by a break in the line.
