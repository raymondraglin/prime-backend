                                                     11
1.1 First Aid & Personal

Protective Equipment

First Things First

Job site accidents and injuries as a result of tools and equipment
being misused or failing are quite common. Cuts and punctures from
sharp objects, contusions from blunt objects or impacts, burns from
open flame torches and hot pipes, splashing of chemicals or debris to
the eyes, and electrical shock are just a few of the common injuries
associated with the building maintenance trade.

   As construction and maintenance processes offer the potential
for many types of traumatic and life threatening injuries, workers
in skilled trades should be aware of the hazards and be prepared
to respond in the event of an injury. While many industry tasks
are performed by a single person, often isolated from others, it is
recommended that industry workers receive First Aid and
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), and Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) 10 or 30 Hour Training for
Construction certificates. Training will enable industry trades-
persons to better assess workplace hazards and respond to them
appropriately, whether an incident involves yourself, a teammate, or
others on the job site. In person, hands-on First Aid/CPR training can
be found through local health and welfare organizations, educational
institutions (credit or non-credit), and medical providers. OSHA in
person courses can be found at local educational institutions (credit
or non-credit), and in online formats through various educational
institutions and commercial providers.

                                                     13
First Aid Kit

Although we all hope that we never need one, a first aid kit should
be kept on the service vehicle or on the job site at all times. Be sure
your first aid kit has you prepared for the type of injuries connected
to your field of work. The size of the first aid kit should reflect the
number of employees kit is intended to service. Most commercial
first aid kits are rated by the amount of people or employees to be
served.

1.2 Eye and Face Protection

Eye & Face Protection

Employees can be exposed to a large number of hazards that pose
danger to their eyes and face. OSHA requires employers to ensure
that employees have appropriate eye or face protection if they are
exposed to eye or face hazards from flying particles, molten metal,
liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors,
potentially infected material or potentially harmful light radiation.

   OSHA suggests that eye protection be routinely considered for
use by carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics, millwrights,
plumbers and pipefitters, sheet metal employees and tinsmiths,
assemblers, sanders, grinding machine operators, sawyers, welders,
laborers, chemical process operators and handlers, and timber
cutting and logging workers. Employers of employees in other job
categories should decide whether there is a need for eye and face
PPE through a hazard assessment.

   Examples of potential eye or face injuries include:

   Dust, dirt, metal or wood chips entering the eye from activities
      such as chipping, grinding, sawing, hammering, the use of
      power tools or even strong wind forces.

   Chemical splashes from corrosive substances, hot liquids,
      solvents or other hazardous solutions.

   Objects swinging into the eye or face, such as tree limbs, chains,
      tools or ropes.

   Radiant energy from welding, harmful rays from the use of
      lasers or other radiant light (as well as heat, glare, sparks, splash
      and flying particles).

                                                     15
Many occupational eye injuries occur because employees are not
wearing any eye protection while others result from wearing
improper or poorly fitting eye protection. Employers must be sure
that their employees wear appropriate eye and face protection and
that the selected form of protection is appropriate to the work being
performed and properly fits each employee exposed to the hazard.

TYPES OF EYE PROTECTION

Selecting the most suitable eye and face protection for employees
should take into consideration the following elements:

   Ability to protect against specific workplace hazards.
   Should fit properly and be reasonably comfortable to wear.
   Should provide unrestricted vision and movement.
   Should be durable and cleanable.
   Should allow unrestricted functioning of any other required

      PPE.

The eye and face protection selected for employee use must clearly
identify the manufacturer. Any new eye and face protective devices
must comply with ANSI Z87.1-1989 or be at least as effective as this
standard requires. Any equipment purchased before this requirement
took effect on July 5, 1994, must comply with the earlier ANSI
Standard (ANSI Z87.1-1968) or be shown to be equally effective. See
the eye protection selection guide for the most recent standard (ANSI
Z87.1-2015).

   An employer may choose to provide one pair of protective eyewear
for each position rather than individual eyewear for each employee.
If this is done, the employer must make sure that employees disinfect
shared protective eyewear after each use. Protective eyewear with
corrective lenses may only be used by the employee for whom the

                                                               1.2 Eye and Face Protection | 16

employees.

   Some of the most common types of eye and face protection include
the following examples:

1.3 Hearing Protection

Hearing Protection

Hearing Protection by Benjamim Souza is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   Some types of hearing protection include:
   Single-use Earplugs - Single-use earplugs are made of waxed
      cotton, foam, silicone rubber or fiberglass wool. They are self-
      forming and, when properly inserted, they work as well as most
      molded earplugs.
   Molded Earplugs - Pre-formed or molded earplugs must be
      individually fitted by a professional and can be disposable or
                                                     18
      reusable. Reusable plugs should be cleaned after each use.
   Earmuffs - Require a perfect seal around the ear. Glasses, facial

      hair, long hair or facial movements such as chewing may reduce
      the protective value of earmuffs.
Note: Audio headphones and earbuds are not approved devices for
hearing protection.
   Determining the need to provide hearing protection for employees
can be challenging. Employee exposure to excessive noise depends
upon a number of factors, including:
   The loudness of the noise as measured in decibels (dB).
   The duration of each employee's exposure to the noise.
   Whether employees move between work areas with different
      noise levels.
   Whether noise is generated from one or multiple sources.

19 | 1.3 Hearing Protection
    Typical Sound Level by OSHA is licensed under Public Domain
   Generally, the louder the noise, the shorter the exposure time
before hearing protection is required. For instance, employees may
be exposed to a noise level of 90 dB for 8 hours per day (unless they
experience a Standard Threshold Shift) before hearing protection
is required. On the other hand, if the noise level reaches 115 dB
hearing protection is required if the anticipated exposure exceeds 15
minutes. Common hearing injuries associated with noise levels in the
construction and maintenance industry include both temporary and

                                                                      1.3 Hearing Protection | 20
permanent partial to total hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the
ear).

   For a more detailed discussion of the requirements for a
comprehensive hearing conservation program, see OSHA Publication
3074 (2002), "Hearing Conservation" or refer to the OSHA standard at
29 CFR 1910.95, Occupational Noise Exposure, section (c).

   Table 5, below, shows the permissible noise exposures that require
hearing protection for employees exposed to occupational noise at
specific decibel levels for specific time periods. Noises are
considered continuous if the interval between occurrences of the
maximum noise level is one second or less. Noises not meeting this
definition are considered impact or impulse noises (loud momentary
explosions of sound) and exposures to this type of noise must not
exceed 140 dB. Examples of situations or tools that may result in
impact or impulse noises are powder-actuated nail guns, a punch
press or drop hammers.

Duration per day (hrs)  Sound level (dB*)
8                       90
6                       92
4                       95
3                       97

1/2                     110
1/4 or less             115

If engineering and work practice controls do not lower employee
exposure to workplace noise to acceptable levels, employees must
wear appropriate hearing protection. It is important to understand
that hearing protectors reduce only the amount of noise that gets

21 | 1.3 Hearing Protection
through to the ears. The amount of this reduction is referred to as
attenuation, which differs according to the type of hearing protection
used and how well it fits. Hearing protectors worn by employees must
reduce an employee's noise exposure to within the acceptable limits
noted in Table 5. Refer to Appendix B of 29 CFR 1910.95, Occupational
Noise Exposure, for detailed information on methods to estimate the
attenuation effectiveness of hearing protectors based on the device's
noise reduction rating (NRR). Manufacturers of hearing protection
devices must display the device's NRR on the product packaging.
If employees are exposed to occupational noise at or above 85 dB
averaged over an eight-hour period, the employer is required to
institute a hearing conservation program that includes regular
testing of employees' hearing by qualified professionals. Refer to 29
CFR 1910.95(c) for a description of the requirements for a hearing
conservation program.

                                                                      1.3 Hearing Protection | 22

1.4 Head Protection

Head Protection

Protecting employees from potential head injuries is a key element
of any safety program. A head injury can impair an employee for life
or it can be fatal. Wearing a safety helmet or hard hat is one of the
easiest ways to protect an employee's head from injury. Hard hats can
protect employees from impact and penetration hazards as well as
from electrical shock and burn hazards.

   Employers must ensure that their employees wear head protection
if any of the following apply:

   Objects might fall from above and strike them on the head;
   They might bump their heads against fixed objects, such as

      exposed pipes or beams; or
   There is a possibility of accidental head contact with electrical

      hazards.

Some examples of occupations in which employees should be
required to wear head protection include construction workers,
carpenters, electricians, linemen, plumbers and pipefitters, timber
and log cutters, welders, among many others. Whenever there is a
danger of objects falling from above, such as working below others
who are using tools or working under a conveyor belt, head
protection must be worn. Hard hats must be worn with the bill
forward to protect employees properly.

   In general, protective helmets or hard hats should do the following:

   Resist penetration by objects.

                                                    24
   Absorb the shock of a blow.
   Be water-resistant and slow burning.
   Have clear instructions explaining proper adjustment and

      replacement of the suspension and headband.
Hard hats must have a hard outer shell and a shock-absorbing lining
that incorporates a headband and straps that suspend the shell from
1 to 1 1/4 inches (2.54 cm to 3.18 cm) away from the head. This type of
design provides shock absorption during anti-impact and ventilation
during normal wear.

   Protective headgear must meet ANSI Standard Z89.1-1986
(Protective Headgear for Industrial Workers) or provide an equivalent
level of protection. Helmets purchased before July 5, 1994 must
comply with the earlier ANSI Standard (Z89.1-1969) or provide
equivalent protection.

BUMP HATS VS. HARD HATS

25 | 1.4 Head Protection
   Hard Hat by Rita Wheeler is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   There are two common classes of protective headgear known as
"bump hats" and "hard hats". Bump Hats are designed for use in
areas with low head clearance and are recommended for areas where
protection is needed from head bumps and lacerations. When the risk
of falling or flying objects are present then an ANSI approved Hard
Hat is required instead.
   There are many types of hard hats available in the marketplace
today and it is essential to check the type of hard hat employees
are using. Each hat should bear a label inside the shell that lists
the manufacturer, the ANSI designation and the class of the hat.
This information should be compared against working conditions to
ensure proper protection against potential workplace hazards with
a requirement for employees to wear the hard hat at all times. It is
important for employers to understand all potential hazards when
making this selection, including electrical hazards. This can be done
through a comprehensive hazard analysis and an awareness of the
different types of protective headgear available.
   Hard hats are divided into three industrial classes:
   Class A hard hats provide impact and penetration resistance along
with limited voltage protection (up to 2,200 volts).
   Class B hard hats provide the highest level of protection against
electrical hazards, with high-voltage shock and burn protection (up
to 20,000 volts). They also provide protection from impact and
penetration hazards by flying/falling objects.
   Class C hard hats provide lightweight comfort and impact
protection but offer no protection from electrical hazards.

SIZE AND CARE CONSIDERATIONS

Head protection that is either too large or too small is inappropriate
for use, even if it meets all other requirements. Protective headgear
must fit appropriately on the body and for the head size of each

                                                                          1.4 Head Protection | 26
individual. Most protective headgear comes in a variety of sizes with
adjustable headbands to ensure a proper fit (many adjust in 1/8-inch
increments). A proper fit should allow sufficient clearance between
the shell and the suspension system for ventilation and distribution
of an impact. The hat should not bind, slip, fall off or irritate the skin.

   Some protective headgear allows for the use of various accessories
to help employees deal with changing environmental conditions,
such as slots for earmuffs, safety glasses, face shields and mounted
lights. Optional brims may provide additional protection from the
sun and some hats have channels that guide rainwater away from
the face. Protective headgear accessories must not compromise the
safety elements of the equipment.

   Periodic cleaning and inspection will extend the useful life of
protective headgear. A daily inspection of the hard hat shell,
suspension system and other accessories for holes, cracks, tears or
other damage that might compromise the protective value of the
hat is essential. Paints, paint thinners and some cleaning agents can
weaken the shells of hard hats and may eliminate electrical
resistance. Consult the helmet manufacturer for information on the
effects of paint and cleaning materials on their hard hats. Never drill
holes, paint or apply labels to protective headgear as this may reduce
the integrity of the protection. Do not store protective headgear in
direct sunlight, such as on the rear window shelf of a car, since
sunlight and extreme heat can damage them.

   Hard hats with any of the following defects should be removed
from service and replaced:

   Perforation, cracking, or deformity of the brim or shell;
   Indication of exposure of the brim or shell to heat, chemicals or

      ultraviolet light and other radiation (in addition to a loss of
      surface gloss, such signs include chalking or flaking).

Always replace a hard hat if it sustains an impact, even if damage

27 | 1.4 Head Protection
is not noticeable. Suspension systems are offered as replacement
parts and should be replaced when damaged or when excessive wear
is noticed. It is not necessary to replace the entire hard hat when
deterioration or tears of the suspension systems are noticed.

                                                                          1.4 Head Protection | 28
1.5 Hand Protection

Hand Protection

If a workplace hazard assessment reveals that employees face
potential injury to hands and arms that cannot be eliminated through
engineering and work practice controls, employers must ensure that
employees wear appropriate protection. Potential hazards include
skin absorption of harmful substances, chemical or thermal burns,
electrical dangers, bruises, abrasions, cuts, punctures, fractures and
amputations. Protective equipment includes gloves, finger guards
and arm coverings or elbow-length gloves.

   Employers should explore all possible engineering and work
practice controls to eliminate hazards and use PPE to provide
additional protection against hazards that cannot be completely
eliminated through other means. For example, machine guards may
eliminate a hazard. Installing a barrier to prevent employees from
placing their hands at the point of contact between a table saw blade
and the item being cut is another method.

   Types of Protective Gloves

   Palm
   Mechanic's
   Latex
   Vinyl
   Nitrile
   Chemical

There are many types of gloves available today to protect against a
wide variety of hazards. The nature of the hazard and the operation

                                                    29
involved will affect the selection of gloves. The variety of potential
occupational hand injuries makes selecting the right pair of gloves
challenging. It is essential that employees use gloves specifically
designed for the hazards and tasks found in their workplace because
gloves designed for one function may not protect against a different
function even though they may appear to be an appropriate
protective device.

   The following are examples of some factors that may influence the
selection of protective gloves for a workplace.

   Type of chemicals handled.
   Nature of contact (total immersion, splash, etc.).
   Duration of contact.
   Area requiring protection (hand only, forearm, arm).
   Grip requirements (dry, wet, oily).
   Thermal protection.
   Size and comfort.
   Abrasion/resistance requirements.

Gloves made from a wide variety of materials are designed for many
types of workplace hazards. In general, gloves fall into four groups:

   Gloves made of leather, canvas or metal mesh;
   Fabric and coated fabric gloves;
   Chemical- and liquid-resistant gloves;
   Insulating rubber gloves (See 29 CFR 1910.137 and the following

      section on electrical protective equipment for detailed
      requirements on the selection, use and care of insulating rubber
      gloves).

                                                                          1.5 Hand Protection | 30

CARE OF PROTECTIVE GLOVES

Protective gloves should be inspected before each use to ensure
that they are not torn, punctured or made ineffective in any way. A
visual inspection will help detect cuts or tears but a more thorough
inspection by filling the gloves with water and tightly rolling the cuff
towards the fingers will help reveal any pinhole leaks. Gloves that are
discolored or stiff may also indicate deficiencies caused by excessive
use or degradation from chemical exposure.

35 | 1.5 Hand Protection
   Any gloves with impaired protective ability should be discarded
and replaced. Reuse of chemical-resistant gloves should be evaluated
carefully, taking into consideration the absorptive qualities of the
gloves. A decision to reuse chemically-exposed gloves should take
into consideration the toxicity of the chemicals involved and factors
such as duration of exposure, storage and temperature.

                                                                          1.5 Hand Protection | 36
1.6 Respiratory Protection

Respiratory Protection

The information in this section will provide basic information to
workers and employers who may find themselves using respiratory
protection for the first time. The guidance provides information on
what respirators are, how they work, and what is needed for a
respirator to provide protection. For additional information see:

   OSHA Bulletin: General Respiratory Protection Guidance for
Employers and Workers

WHAT IS A RESPIRATOR?
A respirator is a device that protects you from inhaling dangerous
substances, such as chemicals and infectious particles. Respirators
are among the most important pieces of protective equipment for
working in hazardous environments. Selecting the right respirator
requires an assessment of all the workplace operations, processes or
environments that may create a respiratory hazard. The identity of
the hazard and its airborne concentrations need to be determined
before choosing a respirator. This assessment should be done by
experienced safety personnel or by an industrial hygienist. There are
several different types of respirators, as described below.

                                                     37
Dust Mask by Rita Wheeler is licensed under CC BY 4.0

HOW DO RESPIRATORS WORK?

Respirators work by either filtering particles from the air, chemically
cleaning (purifying) the air, or supplying clean air from an outside
source.

Particulate Respirators

Particulate respirators are the simplest, least expensive, and least
protective of the respirator types available. These respirators only
protect against particles (e.g., dust). They do not protect against
chemicals, gases, or vapors, and are intended only for low hazard
levels. The commonly known "N-95" filtering facepiece respirator
or "dust mask" is one type of particulate respirator, often used in

                                                                 1.6 Respiratory Protection | 38
hospitals to protect against infectious agents. Particulate respirators
are "airpurifying respirators" because they clean particles out of the
air as you breathe.

   Particulate respirators:

   Filter out dusts, fumes and mists.
   Are usually disposable dust masks or respirators with disposable

      filters.
   Must be replaced when they become discolored, damaged, or

      clogged.

Examples: filtering facepiece or elastomeric respirator.

Chemical Cartridge/Gas Mask Respirator

Gas masks are also known as "air-purifying respirators" because they
filter or clean chemical gases out of the air as you breathe. This
respirator includes a facepiece or mask, and a cartridge or canister.
Straps secure the facepiece to the head. The cartridge may also have
a filter to remove particles.

   Gas masks are effective only if used with the correct replaceable
cartridge or filter (these terms are often used interchangeably) for
a particular biological or chemical substance. Selecting the proper
filter can be a complicated process, but is aided through color-coding
based on the substance being filtered. There are cartridges available
that protect against more than one hazard, but there is no "all-in-
one" cartridge that protects against all substances. You may even
require more than one cartridge to protect against multiple hazards.
It is important to know what hazards you will face in order to be
certain you are choosing the right filters/cartridges.

   There are nine classes of particulate filters which are broken down
into three series: N, R, and P. Each series (N, R, and P) is available
at three efficiency levels: 95%, 99%, and 99.97%. The N series filter

39 | 1.6 Respiratory Protection
is used in environments free of oil mists. The R series filters can be
exposed to oil mists, but should only be worn for one work shift. The
P filter can be exposed to oil mists for longer than one work shift.

Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR)

Powered air-purifying respirators use a fan to draw air through the
filter to the user. They are easier to breathe through; however, they
need a fully charged battery to work properly. They use the same type
of filters/cartridges as other air-purifying respirators. It is important
to know what the hazard is, and how much of it is in the air, in order
to select the proper filters/cartridges.

Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus

Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) is the respirator
commonly used by firefighters. These use their own air tank to
supply clean air, so you don't need to worry about filters. They also
protect against higher concentrations of dangerous chemicals.
However, they are very heavy (30 pounds or more), and require very
special training on how to use and to maintain them. Also, the air
tanks typically last an hour or less depending upon their rating and
your breathing rate (how hard you are breathing).

   Provide clean air from a portable air tank when the air around you
is simply too dangerous to breathe.

   All of these respirators (except for the "dust masks" or filtering face
pieces) are available in either half-mask or full-face pieces.

                                                                 1.6 Respiratory Protection | 44

1.7 Foot Protection

Footwear

Employees who face possible foot or leg injuries from falling or rolling
objects or from crushing or penetrating materials should wear
protective footwear. Also, employees whose work involves exposure
to hot substances or corrosive or poisonous materials must have
protective gear to cover exposed body parts, including legs and feet.
If an employee's feet may be exposed to electrical hazards, non-
conductive footwear should be worn. On the other hand, workplace
exposure to static electricity may necessitate the use of conductive
footwear.

                  An interactive or media element has been
                  excluded from this version of the text. You can
       view it online here:
       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=39

Examples of situations in which an employee should wear foot and/
or leg protection include:

   When heavy objects such as barrels or tools might roll onto or
      fall on the employee's feet;

   Working with sharp objects such as nails or spikes that could
      pierce the soles or uppers of ordinary shoes;

   Exposure to molten metal that might splash on feet or legs;
   Working on or around hot, wet or slippery surfaces; and

                                                     47
   Working when electrical hazards are present.

Safety footwear must meet ANSI minimum compression and impact
performance standards in ANSI Z41-1991 (American National Standard
for Personal Protection-Protective Footwear) or provide equivalent
protection. Footwear purchased before July 5, 1994, must meet or
provide equivalent protection to the earlier ANSI Standard (ANSI
Z41.1-1967). All ANSI approved footwear has a protective toe and
offers impact and compression protection. But the type and amount
of protection is not always the same. Different footwear protects
in different ways. Check the product's labeling or consult the
manufacturer to make sure the footwear will protect the user from
the hazards they face.

   Foot and leg protection choices include the following:

   Leggings protect the lower legs and feet from heat hazards such
      as molten metal or welding sparks. Safety snaps allow leggings
      to be removed quickly.

   Metatarsal guards protect the instep area from impact and
      compression. Made of aluminum, steel, fiber or plastic, these
      guards may be strapped to the outside of shoes.

   Toe guards fit over the toes of regular shoes to protect the toes
      from impact and compression hazards. They may be made of
      steel, aluminum or plastic.

   Combination foot and shin guards protect the lower legs and
      feet, and may be used in combination with toe guards when
      greater protection is needed.

   Safety shoes have impact-resistant toes and heat-resistant soles
      that protect the feet against hot work surfaces common in
      roofing, paving and hot metal industries. The metal insoles of
      some safety shoes protect against puncture wounds. Safety
      shoes may also be designed to be electrically conductive to
      prevent the buildup of static electricity in areas with the

                                                                           1.7 Foot Protection | 48
      potential for explosive atmospheres or nonconductive to
      protect employees from workplace electrical hazards.

SPECIAL PURPOSE SHOES

Electrically conductive shoes provide protection against the buildup
of static electricity. Employees working in explosive and hazardous
locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain
elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static
electricity buildup on the body that could produce a spark and cause
an explosion or fire. Foot powder should not be used in conjunction
with protective conductive footwear because it provides insulation,
reducing the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool and nylon
socks can produce static electricity and should not be worn with
conductive footwear. Conductive shoes must be removed when the
task requiring their use is completed.

   Note: Employees exposed to electrical hazards must never wear
conductive shoes.

   Electrical hazard, safety-toe shoes are nonconductive and will
prevent the wearers' feet from completing an electrical circuit to the
ground. These shoes can protect against open circuits of up to 600
volts in dry conditions and should be used in conjunction with other
insulating equipment and additional precautions to reduce the risk
of an employee becoming a path for hazardous electrical energy. The
insulating protection of electrical hazard, safety-toe shoes may be
compromised if the shoes become wet, the soles are worn through,
metal particles become embedded in the sole or heel, or employees
touch conductive, grounded items.

   Note: Nonconductive footwear must not be used in explosive or
hazardous locations.

49 | 1.7 Foot Protection
CARE OF PROTECTIVE FOOTWEAR
As with all protective equipment, safety footwear should be inspected
prior to each use. Shoes and leggings should be checked for wear and
tear at reasonable intervals. This includes looking for cracks or holes,
separation of materials, broken buckles or laces. The soles of shoes
should be checked for pieces of metal or other embedded items that
could present electrical or tripping hazards. Employees should follow
the manufacturers' recommendations for cleaning and maintenance
of protective footwear.

                                                                           1.7 Foot Protection | 50
1.8 Tool & Shop Safety

Tools are such a common part of our lives that it is difficult to
remember that they may pose hazards. Tragically, a serious incident
can occur before steps are taken to identify and avoid or eliminate
tool-related hazards.

   Five basic safety rules can help prevent hazards associated with the
use of hand and power tools:

   Keep all tools in good condition with regular maintenance.
   Use the right tool for the job.
   Examine each tool for damage before use and do not use

      damaged tools.
   Operate tools according to the manufacturers' instructions.
   Provide and properly use appropriate personal protective

      equipment.

                                                     51
Hand Tool Safety

Hand tools are tools that are powered manually and include anything
from axes to wrenches. The greatest hazards posed by hand tools
result from misuse and improper maintenance.

   Some examples include the following:

   If a chisel is used as a screwdriver, the tip of the chisel may
      break and fly off, hitting the user or other employees.

   If a wooden handle on a tool, such as a hammer or an axe, is
      loose, splintered, or cracked, the head of the tool may fly off and
      strike the user or other employees.

   If the jaws of a wrench are sprung, the wrench might slip.
   If impact tools such as chisels, wedges, or drift pins have

      mushroomed heads, the heads might shatter on impact, sending
      sharp fragments flying toward the user or other employees.

   Guidance on hand tool use:

   Wear safety glasses when striking objects with tools or the
      potential for breakage, chips, dust or any other hazard exists.

   Tap fasteners such as nails to start.
   Remove free hand to avoid impact to hand and fingers before

      striking fastener with force.
   Do not cut towards yourself with sharp tools.
   Avoid storing sharp tools with sensitive tools and equipment.
   Be cautious of wrenches and tools slipping from fasteners to

      avoid hand injuries and loss of balance.
   Use insulated tools when working with energized circuits.
   Do not operate power tools with cut or frayed power cords, or

      inoperable or missing safety guards or devices.
   Never carry sharp tools in your pockets.

                                                                       1.8 Tool & Shop Safety | 52
Power Tool Safety

Employees using electric tools must be aware of several dangers.
Among the most serious hazards are electrical burns and shocks.

   Electrical shocks, which can lead to injuries such as heart failure
and burns, are among the major hazards associated with electric-
powered tools. Under certain conditions, even a small amount of
electric current can result in fibrillation of the heart and death. An
electric shock also can cause the user to fall off a ladder or other
elevated work surface and be injured due to the fall.

   To protect the user from shock and burns, electric tools must have
a three-wire cord with a ground and be plugged into a grounded
receptacle, be double insulated, or be powered by a low-voltage
isolation transformer. Three-wire cords contain two current-
carrying conductors and a grounding conductor. Any time an adapter
is used to accommodate a two-hole receptacle, the adapter wire
must be attached to a known ground. The third prong must never be
removed from the plug.

53 | 1.8 Tool & Shop Safety
Electrical cable diagram by Marekich is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0

   Double-insulated tools are available that provide protection
against electrical shock without third-wire grounding. On double-
insulated tools, an internal layer of protective insulation completely
isolates the external housing of the tool.

   The following general practices should be followed when using
electric tools:

   Wear appropriate eye and hearing protection.
   Read manual and operate electric tools within their design

      limitations.
   Ensure tool is in the off position prior to connecting to outlet.
   Use gloves and appropriate safety footwear when using electric

      tools.
   Always use a GFCI protected device for outside and damp

      location power tool use.
   Do not use electric tools in damp or wet locations unless they

      are approved for that purpose.
   Do not use portable power tools which have cords that are cut,

      frayed, or separated from the tool housing. Such cords should
      be repaired before continued use.
   Keep work areas well lighted when operating electric tools.
   Ensure that cords from electric tools do not present a tripping
      hazard.
   Never place power cords over shoulders or around neck.
   Secure long hair and loose clothing prior to power tool use.
   Allow the tool to do the work. Never force or apply excessive
      pressure to the tool.
   Maintain sure footing and well balanced stance.

Additional practices for storage, transportation and maintenance:

                                                                       1.8 Tool & Shop Safety | 54
   Unplug or remove batteries from power tools before changing
      accessories.

   Keep tools and equipment well maintained, i.e. blades sharp,
      cords well maintained, guards in good working order, etc. Store
      electric tools in a dry place when not in use.

   Do not carry tools by the power cord.
   Make sure that long extension cords are sufficiently large in size

      to carry the current (amps) necessary for the tools being used.
      Sufficiently large wire size in cords will help avoid large voltage
      drop and tool burn-out.

Ladder Safe Step by Viole Multerer is licensed under CC BY 4.0

   Falls from portable ladders (step, straight, combination and
extension) are one of the leading causes of occupational fatalities and
injuries. According to the Department of Labor's (DOL) Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ladder safety guidelines,
following these safety rules can keep you from becoming a statistic:

   Read and follow all labels/markings on the ladder.
   Avoid electrical hazards! - Look for overhead power lines before

      handling a ladder. Avoid using a metal ladder near power lines or
      exposed energized electrical equipment.
   Always inspect the ladder prior to using it. If the ladder is
      damaged, it must be removed from service and tagged until
      repaired or discarded.
   Always maintain a 3-point (two hands and a foot, or two feet and
      a hand) contact on the ladder when climbing. Keep your body
      near the middle of the step and always face the ladder while
      climbing (see diagram below).
   Only use ladders and appropriate accessories (ladder levelers,
      jacks or hooks) for their designed purposes.
   Ladders must be free of any slippery material on the rungs,
      steps or feet.
   Do not use a self-supporting ladder (e.g., step ladder) as a single
      ladder or in a partially closed position.
   Do not use the top step/rung of a ladder as a step/rung unless
      it was designed for that purpose.
   Use a ladder only on a stable and level surface, unless it has
      been secured (top or bottom) to prevent displacement.
   Do not place a ladder on boxes, barrels or other unstable bases
      to obtain additional height.
   Do not move or shift a ladder while a person or equipment is on
      the ladder.

59 | 1.9 Ladder Safety & Fall Protection
 An extension or straight ladder used to access an elevated
   surface must extend at least 3 feet above the point of support
   (see diagram below). Do not stand on the three top rungs of a
   straight, single or extension ladder.

 The proper angle for setting up a ladder is to place its base a
   quarter of the working length of the ladder from the wall or
   other vertical surface (see diagram below).

 A ladder placed in any location where it can be displaced by
   other work activities must be secured to prevent displacement
   or a barricade must be erected to keep traffic away from the
   ladder.

 Be sure that all locks on an extension ladder are properly
   engaged.

 Do not exceed the maximum load rating of a ladder. Be aware of
   the ladder's load rating and of the weight it is supporting,
   including the weight of any tools or equipment.

Safety Harness

Individuals performing tasks at elevations of six (6) feet or higher
should be protected by and specifically trained in the use of an
appropriate fall arrest system. Employers are responsible to ensure
training for employees that are required by OSHA regulations to use
these lifesaving systems. For detailed fall protection requirements
and safety guidelines, refer to the OSHA Technical Manual, Section V:

2.1 Tool Choices and
Applications

Although there are numerous advantages to choosing tools based on
many factors, safety should be the first factor to be considered.

   Always choose the right tool for the job- Remember that tools
have specific functions.

   Screwdrivers are not impact resistant and should never be used
      as a chisel or pry bar.

   Accessories used in cordless impact drivers must be rated for
      impact use.

Determine the scope of work- Consider where you will be working:
   Small or large project?
   What tasks will you be performing?
   How much space do you have to safely perform your tasks?
   What are the tools best suited to the tasks?
   What PPE is required for each task?

   Material type and size- Choice of tools and accessories should be
based on the type and size of material being used.

   Examples:
   Specially designed masonry drill bits, saw blades, and grinding

      wheels are used for masonry, concrete, brick and tile.
   Anchor bolts are rated by the amount of weight they will safely

      support, with many styles available for application with specific
      materials.
   A circular saw may be better suited for the task than a table or
      miter saw for small jobs.
   Do the material and tools to be used require an additional
      person to assist in the safe completion of the task due to the
      weight or physical size of the material?

2.2 Measuring, Marking,
Leveling & Layout Tools

Measuring, Marking, Leveling & Layout Tools

Measuring and marking tools are common to multiple
trades and ensure accuracy and quality craftsmanship in the building
and construction process. Measuring devices are available in
fractional and metric, with classic western construction practices
adopting the fractional inch configuration. While some measuring
tools have the actual fractions printed (1/2, 1/4, and 1/8) next to
each corresponding mark on the scale, many do not and the ability to
read the scale without the printed fractions may take time to develop.
This is one of many reasons for the adage: "Measure twice, cut once",
which is a good habit to develop and will help to avoid costly mistakes
such as over cutting and wasting material or under cutting, resulting
in having to remeasure and cut the material again.

                                                     71

   While many of the following tools may be considered "carpentry"
tools, the majority are regularly used in most all trades. Apparent
common items to all trades include measuring devices like tape
measures, rulers, and basic estimation tools; plumbers and
electricians will use spirit levels, builders levels, and angle finders to
ensure that piping is at an appropriate grade or conduit, fixtures, and
other items are installed to meet industry codes.

2.3 Nails, Hammers &
Pneumatic Nailers

Nails

Nails of all sizes are commonly used to assemble wood products
when glue and adhesives are not of sufficient strength for a project.
They are known by number size, the lesser the number, the smaller
the length and diameter. The number is followed by the letter "d".
The d is the symbol for penny, which can be traced back as far as
the Ancient Roman Empire. There are various theories as to how the
measurement term came to be, but what is confirmed is that the d
stands for the Roman coin denarius, or in English, the penny. The
denarius was the coin which many people used in the Roman empire
at the time when Rome occupied what is now England, so that's why
it's called a penny but uses a "d" as the symbol.

   Some styles of nails have larger heads for greater holding power
while others have smaller or no head so that it can be set flush
with or lower than material surfaces for cosmetic applications. When
"headless" finish or casing nails are used, it is best to drive them
to just slightly above the surface while being careful not to leave
hammer marks on the material's being nailed surface and then use a
"nail set" tool to embed the nail.

Hammers

Hammers are used to strike or cause impact and are available in
traditional designs and in a variety of models, sizes, and weights to
perform specific tasks. Selecting the proper hammer for a particular
task can be the determining factor for being able to complete the task
or be the difference between quality and sub-par craftsmanship. The
following list describes the most common types of hammers and
some of the types of tasks they are often used for.

General Hammer Use

No matter which type of hammer is used, employing proper
techniques will help prevent injury.

                                             2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers | 76
 Wear safety glasses when striking any object with any type of
   hammer or tool.

 For hardwood, before nailing with hammer, drill pilot hole in
   material to prevent splitting.

 Choose a hammer weight that is comfortable.
 "Set" the nail by tapping in the point, remove the free hand

   before driving the nail.
 Using the center of the hammer face, drive the nail with smooth,

   firm blows.
 Striking face should always be parallel with the surface being

   hit.
 Avoid sideways or glancing blows.
 Always strike with the hammer face.
 Avoid impact with handle or shaft of hammer.

   Nail guns are used every day on many construction jobs--especially
in residential construction. Thy boost productivity but also cause
tens of thousands of painful injuries each year. Nail gun injuries
are common--one study found that 2 out of 5 residential carpenter
apprentices experienced a nail gun injury over a four-year period.
When they do occur, these injuries are often not reported or given
any medical treatment. Research has identified the risk factors that
make nail gun injuries more likely to occur. The type of trigger system
and the extent of training are important factors. The risk of a nail
gun injury is twice as high when using a multi-shot contact trigger as
when using a single-shot sequential
trigger nailer.

   The guidance is for residential home builders and construction
contractors, subcontractors, and supervisors. NIOSH and OSHA
developed this publication to give construction employers the
information they need to prevent nail gun
injuries. Types of triggers and key terms are described. The guidance
highlights what is known about nail gun injuries, including the parts
of the body most often injured and the types of severe injuries that
have been reported. Common
causes of nail gun injuries are discussed and six practical steps that

Introduction to Nail Gun Safety

How likely are nail gun injuries?
   Nail guns are powerful, easy to operate, and boost productivity

for nailing tasks. They are also responsible for an estimated 37,000
emergency room visits each year. Severe nail gun injuries have led to
construction worker deaths.

   Nail gun injuries are common in residential construction. About
two-thirds of these injuries occur in framing and sheathing work.
Injuries also often occur in roofing and exterior siding and finishing

   A study of apprentice carpenters found that:

   2 out of 5 were injured using a nail gun during their 4 years of
      training.

   1 out of 5 were injured twice.
   1 out of 10 were injured three or more times.

       Worksite Story - A 26-year-old Idaho construction worker
       died following a nail gun accident in April 2007. He was

                                             2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers | 80
       framing a house when he slipped and fell. His finger was
       on the contact trigger of the nail gun he was using. The
       nosepiece hit his head as he fell, driving a 3-inch nail into his
       skull. The nail injured his brain stem, causing his death. The
       safety controls on the nail gun were found to be intact. Death
       and serious injury can occur using nail guns--even when they
       are working properly.

More than half of reported nail gun injuries are to the hand and
fingers. One quarter of these hand injuries involve structural damage
to tendons, joints, nerves, and bones. After hands, the next most
often injured are the leg, knee, thigh, foot, and toes. Less common
are injuries to the forearm or wrist, head and neck, and trunk. Serious
nail gun injuries to the spinal cord, head, neck, eye, internal organs,
and bones have been reported. Injuries have resulted in paralysis,
blindness, brain damage, bone fractures, and death.

   Nail guns present a number of hazards and risks. NIOSH and OSHA
prepared this publication to provide builders and contractors with
the latest information on nail gun hazards and practical advice on
the steps they should take to prevent nail gun injuries on their
construction jobs.

   This guide covers nail guns (also called nailers) used for fastening
wood, shingles, and siding materials. The guide refers specifically to
pneumatic tools but also applies to nail guns that use gas, electric, or
hybrid power sources. It does NOT cover powder actuated tools used
for fastening material to metal or concrete. The guide assumes that
contractors are generally familiar with how nail guns work and the
various types of specialized nail guns (for example, framing, roofing,
flooring)

   This guide is applicable to all nail guns. The emphasis is on framing
("stick" and "coil") nail guns because they fie the largest nails, are the
most powerful, and are considered to be the most dangerous to use.

81 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
Know Your Triggers

Nail gun safety starts with understanding the various trigger
mechanisms. Here is what you need to know:

   How Triggers Differ
All nailers rely on two basic controls: a finger trigger and a contact
safety tip located on the nose of the gun. Trigger mechanisms can
vary based on: 1) the order in which the controls are activated, and 2)
whether the trigger can be held in the squeezed position to discharge
multiple nails OR if it must be released and then squeezed again for
each individual nail. Combining these variations gives four kinds of
triggers. Some nail guns have a selective trigger switch which allows
the user to choose among two or more trigger systems. Each trigger
type is described below along with a summary of how the controls
are activated.

                  An interactive or media element has been

       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=62

The bottom line: contractors should check the tool label and manual
for
manufacturer-specific trigger names and operating information.

       Worksite Story - Two framers were working together to lay
       down and nail a subfloor. One framer was waiting and holding
       the nail gun with his finger on the contact trigger. The other
       framer was walking backwards toward him and dragging a
       sheet of plywood. The framer handling the plywood backed

                                             2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers | 82
       into the tip of the nail gun and was shot in the back. The nail
       nicked his kidney, but fortunately he recovered. As a result of
       this incident, the contractor switched to using only sequential
       triggers on framing nail guns. Co-workers can get injured if
       they bump into your contact trigger nail gun. You can prevent
       this by using a full sequential trigger.

How do Nail Gun Injuries Happen?

Useful Terms

   Recoil is the rapid rebound or kickback after the nailer is fired.
   A double fire occurs when a second nail unintentionally fires

      because the nailer re-contacted the work piece after recoil. It
      can also occur if the safety contact slips while the user is
      positioning the nail gun. Several tool manufacturers offer "anti-
      double fire" features for their nail guns.

There are seven major risk factors that can lead to a nail gun injury.
Understanding them will help you to prevent injuries on your
jobsites.

   1. Unintended nail discharge from double fire. Occurs with
CONTACT triggers.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) found that
contact trigger nailers are susceptible to double firing, especially
when trying to accurately place the nailer against the work piece.
They found that a second unintended firing can happen faster than
the user is able to react and release the trigger. Unintended nails can
cause injuries.

   Double fire can be a particular problem for new workers who may
push hard on the tool to compensate for recoil. It can also occur

83 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
when the user is working in an awkward position, such as in tight
spaces where the gun doesn't have enough space to recoil. The recoil
of the gun itself can even cause a non-nail injury in tight spaces if the
nail gun hits the user's head or face.

   2. Unintended nail discharge from knocking the safety contact
with the trigger squeezed. Occurs with CONTACT and SINGLE
ACTUATION triggers.

   Nail guns with contact and single actuation triggers will fire if
the trigger is being held squeezed and the safety contact tip gets
knocked or pushed into an object or person by mistake. For example,
a framer might knock his leg going down a ladder or bump into a
co-worker passing through a doorway. Contact trigger nailers can
release multiple nails and single actuation trigger nailers can release
a single nail to cause injury.

   Holding or carrying contact trigger or single actuation trigger nail
guns with the trigger squeezed increases the risk of unintended nail
discharge. Construction workers tend to keep a finger on the trigger
because it is more natural to hold and carry an 8-pound nail gun
using a full, four-finger grip. Tool manufacturers, however, do warn
against it.

   3. Nail penetration through lumber work piece. Occurs with ALL
trigger types.

   Nails can pass through a work piece and either hit the worker's
hand or fly of as a projectile (airborne) nail. A blow-out nail is one
example. Blow-outs can occur when a nail is placed near a knot in
the wood. Knots involve a change in wood grain, which creates both
weak spots and hard spots that can make the nail change direction
and exit the work piece. Nail penetration is especially a concern for
placement work where a piece of lumber needs to be held in place by
hand. If the nail misses or breaks through the lumber it can injure the
non-dominant hand holding it.

85 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
   4. Nail ricochet after striking a hard surface or metal feature.
Occurs with ALL trigger types.

   When a nail hits a hard surface, it has to change direction and it can
bounce of the surface, becoming a projectile. Wood knots and metal
framing hardware are common causes of ricochets. Problems have
also been noted with ricochets when nailing into dense laminated
beams. Ricochet nails can strike the worker or a co-worker to cause
an injury.

   5. Missing the work piece. Occurs with ALL trigger types.
   Injuries may occur when the tip of the nail gun does not make
full contact with the work piece and the discharged nail becomes
airborne. This can occur when nailing near the edge of a work piece,
such as a plate. Positioning the safety contact is more difficult in
these situations and sometimes the fired nail completely misses the
lumber. Injuries have also occurred when a nail shot through plywood
or oriented strand board sheeting missed a stud and became
airborne.

Nail penetration through the lumber is a special concern where the
piece is held in place by hand. Nail gun by OSHA is licensed under
Public Domain

   6. Awkward position nailing. Occurs with ALL trigger types.
Unintended discharges are a concern in awkward position work
with CONTACT and SINGLE ACTUATION triggers.

   Nailing in awkward positions where the tool and its recoil are more
difficult to control may increase the risk of injury. These include
toe-nailing, nailing above shoulder height, nailing in tight quarters,
holding the nail gun with the non-dominant hand, nailing while on
a ladder, or nailing when the user's body is in the line of fie (nailing
towards yourself). Toe-nailing is awkward because the gun cannot
be held flush against the work piece. Nailing from a ladder makes
it difficult to position the nail gun accurately. Nailing beyond a
comfortable reach distance from a ladder, elevated work platform, or
leading edge also places the user at risk for a fall.

87 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
Toe-nailing by OSHA is licensed under Public Domain
   7. Bypassing safety mechanisms. Occurs with ALL trigger types.
   Bypassing or disabling certain features of either the trigger or

safety contact tip is an important risk of injury. For example,
removing the spring from the safety contact tip makes an unintended
discharge even more likely. Modifying tools can lead to safety
problems for anyone who uses the nail gun. Nail gun manufacturers
strongly recommend against bypassing safety features, and voluntary
standards prohibit modifications or tampering. OSHA's Construction
standard at 29 CFR 1926.300(a) requires that all hand and power tools
and similar equipment, whether furnished by the employer or the
employee shall be maintained in a safe condition.

   About 1 in 10 nail gun injuries happen to co-workers. This is from
either airborne (projectile) nails or bumping into a co-worker while
carrying a contact trigger nail gun with the trigger squeezed.

       You Should Know - Studies of residential carpenters found
       that the overall risk of nail gun injury is twice as high when
       using contact trigger nail guns compared to using sequential
       trigger nail guns.
       *Note that the studies could not quantify injury risks associated
       with specific tasks; it is likely that some nailing tasks are more
       dangerous than others.

A voluntary ANSI standard 10 calls for all large pneumatic framing
nailers manufactured after 2003 to be shipped with a sequential
trigger. However, these may not always be FULL SEQUENTIAL
triggers. Contractors may need to contact manufacturers or
suppliers to purchase a FULL SEQUENTIAL trigger kit.

       Worksite Story - A carpenter apprentice on his fist day ever
       using a nail gun injured his right leg. He was working on a step
       ladder and was in the process of lowering the nail gun to his
       side when the gun struck his leg and fired a nail into it. He had

                                             2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers | 88
       no training prior to using the nail gun. New worker training is
       important and should include hands-on skills.

Six Steps to Nail Gun Safety

1. Use the full sequential trigger
   The full sequential trigger is always the safest trigger mechanism

for the job. It reduces the risk of unintentional nail discharge and
double fires--including injuries from bumping into co-workers.

   At a minimum, provide full sequential trigger nailers for
      placement work where the lumber needs to be held in place by
      hand. Examples include building walls and nailing blocking,
      fastening studs to plates and blocks to studs, and installing
      trusses.

        Unintended nail discharge is more likely to lead to a hand or
            arm injury for placement work compared to flat work,
            where the lumber does not need to be held in place by
            hand. Examples of flat work include roofing, sheathing, and
            subflooring.

   Consider restricting inexperienced employees to full sequential
      trigger nail guns starting out. Some contractors using more than
      one type of trigger on their jobs color-code the nail guns so that
      the type of trigger can be readily identified by workers and
      supervisors.

   Some contractors have been reluctant to use full sequential
      triggers fearing a loss of productivity. How do the different
      types of triggers compare?

89 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
        The one available study had 10 experienced framers stick-
            build two identical small (8 f x 10 ft. wood structures--one
            using a sequential trigger nail gun and one using a contact
            trigger nail gun. Small structures were built in this study so
            that there would be time for each carpenter to complete
            two sheds.

        Average nailing time using the contact trigger was 10%
            faster, which accounted for less than 1% of the total
            building time when cutting and layout was included.
            However, in this study the trigger type was less important
            to overall productivity than who was using the tool; this
            suggests productivity concerns should focus on the skill of
            the carpenter rather than on the trigger.

        Although the study did not evaluate framing a residence or
            light commercial building, it shows that productivity is not
            just about the trigger. The wood structures built for the
            study did include common types of nailing tasks (flat
            nailing, through nailing, toe-nailing) and allowed
            comparisons for both total average nailing time and overall
            project time. The study did not compare productivity
            differences for each type of nailing task used to build the
            sheds.

2. Provide training
   Both new and experienced workers can benefit from safety training

to learn about the causes of nail gun injuries and specific steps to
reduce them. Be sure that training is provided in a manner that
employees can understand. Here is a list of topics for training:

   How nail guns work and how triggers differ.
   Main causes of injuries - especially differences among types of

      triggers.
   Instructions provided in manufacturer tool manuals and where

                                             2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers | 90
      the manual is kept.

Hands-on training with the actual nailers to be used on the job. This
gives each employee an opportunity to handle the nailer and to get
feedback on topics such as:

   How to load the nail gun
   How to operate the air compressor
   How to fie the nail gun
   How to hold lumber during placement work
   How to recognize and approach ricochet-prone work surfaces
   How to handle awkward position work (e.g., toe-nailing and

      work on ladders)
   How best to handle special risks associated with contact and

      single actuation triggers such as nail gun recoil and double fires.
      For example, coach new employees on how to minimize double
      fires by allowing the nail gun to recoil rather than continuing to
      push against the gun after it fires.
   What to do when a nail gun malfunctions.

*Training should also cover items covered in the following sections
of the guidance, such as company nail gun work procedures, personal
protective equipment, injury reporting, and fist aid and medical
treatment.

       You Should Know

          Training is important: Untrained workers are more likely
             to experience a nail gun injury than a trained worker.

          Training does not trump triggers: Trained workers using
             contact triggers still have twice the overall risk of injury
             as trained workers using sequential triggers.

91 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
   3. Establish nail gun work procedures
   Contractors should develop their own nail gun work rules and
procedures to address risk factors and make the work as safe as
possible. Examples of topics for contractor work procedures include
but are not limited to the following Do's & Don'ts:

DO's

   Make sure that tool manuals for the nailers used on the job are
      always available on the jobsite.

   Make sure that manufacturers' tool labels and instructions are
      understood and followed.

   Check tools and power sources before operating to make sure
      that they are in proper working order.

   Take broken or malfunctioning nail guns out of service
      immediately.

   Set up operations so that workers are not in the line of fire from
      nail guns being operated by co-workers.

   Check lumber surfaces before nailing. Look for knots, nails,
      straps, hangers, etc. that could cause recoil or ricochet.

   Use a hammer or positive placement nailer when nailing metal
      joinery or irregular lumber.

   For placement work, keep hands at least 12 inches away from
      the nailing point at all times. Consider using clamps to brace
      instead of your hands.

   Always shoot nail guns away from your body and away from co-
      workers.

   Always disconnect the compressed air when:

        Leaving a nailer unattended
        Travelling up and down a ladder or stairs

                                             2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers | 92
        Passing the nail gun to a co-worker
        Clearing jammed nails
        Performing any other maintenance on the nail gun

   Recognize the dangers of awkward position work and provide
      extra time and precautions:

        Use a hammer if you cannot reach the work while holding
            the nailer with your dominant hand.

        Use a hammer or reposition for work at face or head height.
            Recoil is more difficult to control and could be dangerous.

        Use a hammer or full sequential trigger nailer when working
            in a tight space. Recoil is more difficult to control and
            double fires could occur with contact triggers.

        Take extra care with toe-nailing.

              Nail guns can slip before or during firing because the
                  gun cannot be held flush against the work piece.

              Use a nail gun with teeth on the safety contact to bite
                  into the work piece to keep the gun from slipping
                  during the shot.

              Use the trigger to fire only after the safety contact
                  piece is positioned.

   Recognize the dangers of nail gun work at height and provide
      extra time and precautions:

        Set up jobs to minimize the need for nailing at height
        Consider using scaffolds instead of ladders
        If work must be done on ladders, use full sequential trigger

            nailers to prevent nail gun injuries which could occur from
            bumping a leg while climbing up or down a ladder.
        Position ladders so you don't have to reach too far. Your belt
            buckle should stay between the side rails when reaching to

93 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
            the side.
        Maintain three points of contact with the ladder at all times

            to prevent a fall--this means that clamps may need to be
            used for placement work. Holding a nailer in one hand and
            the work piece with the other provides only two points of
            contact (your feet). Reaching and recoil can make you lose
            your balance and fall. Falls, especially with contact trigger
            nailers, can result in nail gun injuries.

Don'ts

   Never bypass or disable nail gun safety features. This is strictly
      prohibited.

        Tampering includes removing the spring from the safety-
            contact tip and/or tying down, taping or otherwise
            securing the trigger so it does not need to be pressed.
            Tampering increases the chance that the nail gun will fie
            unintentionally both for the current user and anyone else
            who may use the nail gun. Nail gun manufacturers strongly
            recommend against tampering and OSHA requires that
            tools be maintained in a safe condition.

        There is NO legitimate reason to modify or disable a nail
            gun safety device.

   Encourage workers to keep their fingers off the trigger when
      holding or carrying a nail gun.
      If this is not natural, workers should use a full sequential nail
      gun or set down the nailer until they begin to nail again.

   Never lower the nail gun from above or drag the tool by the
      hose.

                                             2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers | 94
   If the nail-gun hose gets caught on something, don't pull on the
      hose. Go find the problem and release the hose.

   Never use the nailer with the non-dominant hand.
4. Provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

hat, safety glasses, and hearing protection. Worker by OSHA is licensed
under Public Domain

   Safety shoes, which help protect workers' toes from nail gun
injuries, are typically required by OSHA on residential construction
sites. In addition, employers should provide, at no cost to employees,
the following protective equipment for workers using nail guns:

   Hard hats
   High Impact eye protection - safety glasses or goggles marked

      ANSI Z87.1
   Hearing protection - either earplugs or earmuff
5. Encourage reporting and discussion of injuries and close calls

95 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
   Studies show that many nail gun injuries go unreported. Employers
should ensure that their policies and practices encourage reporting
of nail gun injuries. Reporting helps ensure that employees get
medical attention. It also helps contractors to identify unrecognized
job site risks that could lead to additional injuries if not addressed.
Injuries and close calls provide teachable moments that can help
improve crew safety.

   If you have a safety incentive program, be sure that it does not
discourage workers from reporting injuries. Employers that
intentionally under report work-related injuries will be in violation of
OSHA's injury and illness recordkeeping regulation.

   6. Provide fist aid and medical treatment
   Employers and workers should seek medical attention immediately
after nail gun injuries, even for hand injuries that appear to be
minimal. Studies suggest that 1 out of 4 nail gun hand injuries can
involve some type of structural damage such as bone fracture.
Materials such as nail strip glue or plastic or even clothing can get
embedded in the injury and lead to infection. Barbs on the nail can
cause secondary injury if the nail is removed incorrectly. These
complications can be avoided by having workers seek immediate
medical care.

       Worksite Story - A construction worker accidentally drove
       a 16 penny framing nail into his thigh. It didn't bleed much
       and he didn't seek medical care. He removed the nail himself.
       Three days later he felt a snap in his leg and severe pain.
       In the emergency room, doctors removed a sheared piece
       of nail and found that his thigh bone had fractured. Not all
       injuries are immediately visible. Failure to seek medical care
       can result in complications and more serious injuries.

Other Hazards

Air Pressure
   Pneumatic tools and compressor use are regulated under OSHA's

Construction standard at 29 CFR 1926.302(b). The provisions in this
standard that are relevant for nail guns are provided below:

          1) Pneumatic power tools shall be secured to the hose or
       whip by some positive means to prevent the tool from becoming
       accidentally disconnected.

                  Note: An OSHA letter of interpretation allows the use of
               a quick disconnect with a pull-down sleeve to meet this
               requirement. It is composed of a male fitting (connector)
               and female fitting (coupling) that has a sleeve which must
               be pulled away from the end of the hose to separate the
               two fittings to prevent the tool from becoming accidentally
               disconnected.
          3) All pneumatically driven nailers, staplers, and other similar
       equipment provided with automatic fastener feed, which
       operate at more than 100 p.s.i. pressure at the tool shall have
       a safety device on the muzzle to prevent the tool from ejecting
       fasteners, unless the muzzle is in contact with the work surface.
          5) The manufacturer's safe operating pressure for hoses,
       pipes, valves, filters, and other fitting's shall not be exceeded.
          6) The use of hoses for hoisting or lowering tools shall not be
       permitted.
   Noise
   Pneumatic nail guns produce short (less than a tenth of a second
in duration) but loud "impulse" noise peaks: one from driving the
nail and one from exhausting the air. Most nail gun manufacturers
recommend that users wear hearing protection when operating a
nailer.
   Available information indicates that nail gun noise can vary

97 | 2.3 Nails, Hammers & Pneumatic Nailers
depending on the gun, the work piece, air pressure, and the work
setting. The type of trigger system does not appear to affect the noise
level. Peak noise emission levels for several nailers ranged from 109
to 136 dBA.15,16 These loud short bursts can contribute to hearing
loss. Employers should provide hearing protection in the form of
earplugs or muff and ensure that they are worn correctly. Employers
should also ask about noise levels when buying nail guns--studies
have identified ways to reduce nail gun noise and some
manufacturers may incorporate noise reduction features.

          Note: OSHA's standard for exposure to continuous noise levels
       (29 CFR 1926.52) addresses both the noise level and the duration
       of exposure. In this standard, workers exposed for 15 minutes at
       115 A-weighted decibels (dBA) have the same exposure as workers
       exposed for 8 hours at 90 dBA.

          The NIOSH and OSHA limit for impulse noise is 140 decibels:
       above this level a single exposure can cause instant damage to the
       ear.

          NIOSH recommends that an 8-hour exposure should not exceed
       85 dBA and a one-second exposure
       should not exceed 130 dBA without using hearing protection.
       hearing protection.
   Musculoskeletal disorders
   Framing nail guns can weigh up to 8 pounds and many framing
jobs require workers to hold and use these guns for long periods of
time in awkward hand/arm postures. Holding an 8-pound weight for
long periods of time can lead to musculoskeletal symptoms such as
soreness or tenderness in the fingers, wrist, or forearm tendons or
muscles. These symptoms can progress to pain, or in the most severe
cases, inability to work. No studies have shown that one trigger type
is any more or less likely to cause musculoskeletal problems from
long periods of nail gun use. If use of a nail gun is causing
musculoskeletal pain or symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders,
medical care should be sought.

Conclusion

Nail gun injuries are painful. Some cause severe injuries or death. Nail
gun injuries have been on the rise along with the increased popularity
of these powerful tools. These injuries can be prevented, and more
and more contractors are making changes to improve nail gun safety.
Take a look at your practices and use this guide to improve safety on
your job sites. Working together with tool gun manufacturers, safety
and health professionals, and other organizations, we can reduce nail
gun injuries.

2.4 Threaded Fasteners,
Drivers, Pliers & Wrenches

Threaded Fasteners

Selecting the appropriate fastener for a particular application
involves considering many factors to include: functionality, strength
and durability, exposure to natural elements, and aesthetics.While
most bolts and many screws are designed for the head to press firmly
against flat surfaces of materials and parts, screws with tapered or
bugle style heads are manufactured to be countersunk even with or
below material surfaces. Screws, bolts and other threaded fastener
accessories are normally made of brass; or mild, hardened or
stainless steel; or plastics in some designed for lighter and cosmetic
applications. In many cases, threaded fasteners are treated with
processes such as galvanization, electroplated phosphate, or
chemical primers such as zinc oxide.

   Screws are taper tipped and threaded in a manner that helps wood,
or other materials, draw together as the screw is inserted. They are
used in place of nails when stronger joining power is needed. A screw
makes its own thread pattern in the material. Screw head shapes
(slotted, pan, hex, oval, flat) vary according to the application. Also
the slots or drive types of screws are available in a wide variety
(slotted, Phillips, Robertson, square, Pozidrive, etc.).

Bolts are male threaded fasteners that require a female threaded
counterpart (a "nut" or a threaded hole in a material) in order to
secure themselves. Nuts and bolts allow for future disassembly and
when used with flat and locking style washers, provide strong
mechanical bonds and stability. These threaded fasteners are
available in coarse and fine thread configurations which are
recognized by the amount of threads per inch (tpi) in SAE fasteners
and by pitch in metric fasteners. Cap head and stove type bolts
are also rated by their hardness or shear strength. Various cast or
embossed markings can be found on the head of these kinds of bolts,
with each type of marking symbolizing a bolt's capacity.

   Specialty Anchors
   Specialty anchors such as eye hooks, J-hooks for drywall, masonry,
tile, wood, and other materials are available in both screw and bolt
designs.
   Tap and Die sets can be used to thread materials to accept another
fastener. Taps are tools made to cut female threads while Dies are
tools designed to cut male threads on round stock materials. It is
important that the drilled hole size for tapping, or the diameter of
the material to be threaded with a die, be of a specific size and
tolerance so that the final threaded product fits properly. Taps and
dies are also individually available in each machine fastener diameter
and thread count.

All of the fasteners listed above require tool to tighten when
assembling projects and loosen them when disassembly is required.
Drivers, pliers and wrenches facilitate the assembly of items with
threaded objects such as nuts, bolts, screws, plumbing and electrical
fittings and pipes. Various styles of pliers can also be used to cut,
bend, pull and crimp materials and mechanical fittings. While the
proper selection of tools for particular fastener or fitting will result
in easier and more rapid assembly and disassembly of projects,
improper tool selection may result in material, parts, and tool
damage, lost time, and possible injury.

103 | 2.4 Threaded Fasteners, Drivers, Pliers & Wrenches
Pliers

Pliers are primarily used to grip objects that utilize leverage. Different
configurations of the jaw are also used to grip, turn, pull, crimp
and sometimes cut a variety of things. Many types are commonly
identified by a manufacturer brand or model name and used by
workers in multiple construction trades fields (Channellock is a
registered trademark for a manufacturer that makes numerous styles
of tools, however tongue and groove pliers are commonly referred to
as channel-lock pliers).

       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=66

Wrenches

Wrenches can be used to turn bolts, nuts, or other hard to turn
items. Wrenches provide excellent leverage compared to pliers, and
most are designed to fit specific sized fasteners. The choice of an
appropriate wrench depends upon the torque or leverage required to
perform a function or the design of a fastener. The wrong choice of a
wrench for a task can cause slipping of the wrench, damage materials
and parts, and result in bodily injury. As nuts, bolts, and fasteners
are offered in standardized fractional (SAE (Society of Automotive
Engineers) and metric (millimeter or mm.) sizes, most wrenches are

                            2.4 Threaded Fasteners, Drivers, Pliers & Wrenches | 104
designed to fit hexagonal (six-sided) or hex fasteners and mechanical
fittings. Wrenches can be purchased either individually or in sets
based on style or combinations of styles.

       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=66

TOOL TIPS:
   Only use bits and sockets rated for impact use with impact drivers
      and impact wrenches. Non-impact tools are made of materials
      that can crack, break, or shatter when used with impact tools.
   Apply a penetrating oil according to manufacturer directions to
      rusted fasteners prior to trying to loosen them.
   "Stuck" or rusted nuts, bolts, and screws can sometimes be
      freed by striking them sharply on the head with a steel punch.
   Traditional fasteners turn in a clockwise direction to tighten
      and counter-clockwise to loosen. Fasteners of this design are
      also known as "right-hand" threaded fasteners.
   Specialty fasteners required for certain mechanical applications
      turn counter-clockwise to tighten and clockwise to loosen.
      These are also referred to as "left-hand" threaded fasteners.

105 | 2.4 Threaded Fasteners, Drivers, Pliers & Wrenches
2.5 Saws

Choices

Saws should be chosen based on the material type to be cut and
the particular task being performed. Each type of saw has it's own
purpose, may be available in a variety of sizes, and offer safety and
convenience features which vary by manufacturer, style,
and application. For example: Circular saws are used to cut a wide
variety of construction materials with an appropriate blade. They are
manufactured in a variety of sizes that can be selected according to
the project. Simple projects with 1 x 4 or 1/2 plywood material may
only require a 5-3/8 cordless trim saw, whereas beam construction
could require a circular beam saw with a 21 course toothed blade,
and cement fiber plank siding installation using a 7-1/4 circular saw
with the appropriate blade.

   While most stationary saw models are primarily used in the
carpentry trades, most portable models are also employed in
plumbing, electrical, and other construction and facility maintenance
trades. As in the case of numerous hand tools and accessories, many
of the saws types have become known by industry workers as
common trademark, brand, or model names:

   Circular Saw- SkilsawTM (Skilsaw Inc.)
   Reciprocating Saw- Sawzall (Milwaukee Electric Tool

      Company); TigerSaw (Porter Cable Tool Company)

                                                    106
Saw Blades

Blades come in various sizes and configurations. When choosing a
saw for a particular cut, it is important to consider the type of
material to be cut and the finish desired. Saw blades are rated in
teeth per inch (t.p.i.), The lesser t.p.i., or the lower the revolutions per
minute (r.p.m.), the rougher the finish of the cut will be. Always check
the r.p.m. rating of both the blade and the saw to ensure they are
compatible. Choosing a toothed blade or abrasive cut-off blade that
is not rated for the r.p.m. rating of the saw can result in catastrophic
blade failure and injury.

   The thickness of the saw blade is referred to as the Kerf. This
measurement is the width of the path of the cut where material
will be removed. For accurate final dimensions, the kerf of the blade
should always travel on the waste side of a marked line.

       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=75

Additional Basic Saw Terminology

   Rip Cut- cut follows or goes with the grain of the material.
   Cross cut- cut goes across the grain of the material.
   Push-block/Push Stick- A hand-held device designed to push

      the work piece into and past cutting edges on stationary power

107 | 2.5 Saws
      tools.
   Scroll action- blade strokes perpendicular to material surface.

      Common to saber saws, scroll saws, and reciprocating saws.
   Orbital action- blade follows arcing path. Available option for

      saber and reciprocating saws. Aids in cutting pipe and round or
      circular materials.

Saw Safety

   Never disable manufacturer installed guards or safety devices.
   Always use safety glasses.
   Do not use a saw for any purpose it's features are not intended

      for.
   Always refer to manufacturer's operating instructions and safety

      procedures prior to operating any power tool.

       *Kickback is caused when the material binds with the blade
       or fence of a saw resulting in the material being forcefully
       ejected, often drawing the operator's hand/s toward the
       moving blade, creating the potential for serious injury or
       death. Although kickback is regularly associated with table
       saw use, the same potential hazard exists with circular,
       reciprocating, saber and any other type of saw. In addition to
       material being ejected and the operator being drawn toward
       the blade, kickback can also result in portable saws being
       ejected from the material toward the operator.

                                                                                        2.5 Saws | 108
Saw Types and Applications

CIRCULAR SAW- PORTABLE (FRAMING AND TRIM)
Circular saws are used to cut a wide variety of construction materials
with an appropriate blade. They are constructed in various sizes that
can be selected according to the project. Simple projects with 1 x
4 or 1/2 plywood material may only require a 5-3/8 cordless trim
saw, whereas beam construction could require a beam saw with a 21
course toothed blade.

Drills

Drills are used to bore holes, tighten and loosen fasteners, and, with
some models and accessories, mix paint, mortar, and similar
materials, and to chisel and chip mortar, concrete, and other dense
or hard materials. The selection of the proper dill for a job requires
knowledge of the material being worked, the types and models of
drills and their purposes, and the accessories that are appropriate for
the task. Tool makers offer all of the types of drills in corded models
and the majority of them are also available in variable speed and
battery powered models that offer greater portability and reduced
tool weight with lighter weight DC brushless motor technology.

BASIC DRILL PARTS IDENTIFICATION

Portable Drill Parts by Gwen Arkin & Clifford Rutherford is licensed
under CC BY 4.0
DRILL SAFETY

 1. Wear safety glasses when operating with portable electric drill.
123 | 2.6 Drills & Accessories
 2. Disconnect the drill from the electrical supply when installing
      bits.

 3. Clamp stock so it will not move during the drilling operation.
 4. Before drilling, turn the drill on to see if the bit is centered and

      running true.
 5. Align the bit with the desired hole location before turning the

      drill on.
 6. Hold the drill firmly with both hands while drilling.
 7. When drilling deep holes with a twist drill, move the bit up and

      down several times while drilling to remove cuttings and reduce
      overheating in the bit.
 8. Do not allow the cord to become wrapped around the drill when
      working.
 9. If the electrical cord becomes frayed or starts to separate from
      the drill housing, repair it immediately!
10. Remove the bit from the drill as soon as the work is completed.
11. Select the correct bit for the finish and material being drilled.
      Make sure the bit is securely tightened in the drill chuck.
12. Be extremely careful when using larger portable electric drills
      (3/8 and 1/2). If the bit should hang or get caught the drill will
      twist in the operator's hands causing a sprain or bruised fingers.
13. Always remove the key from the chuck before drilling.
14. To prevent seizing, reduce the feed pressure when the drill bit is
      about to come through the material.

DRILL OPERATING PROCEDURES

 1. Always center punch or make a starting indentation in the
      material being drilled to get an accurate starting point for the
      drill bit.

2.7 Grinders, Sanders, &
Accessories

Grinders

Grinders are normally used to either smooth or cut hard surfaces and
materials depending upon the type of accessory and material being
used. The basic grinding tool consists of a motor with an abrasive
wheel, wire brush or other attachment attached to the arbor (shaft)
by a female threaded fastener (arbor nut). Some manufacturers'
arbor nut configuration requires a propitiatory wrench or spanner
for removal and installation of their own specially designed style
of fastener. Grinders are offered in both portable and stationary
models, and some come with a variable speed option. Each style of
grinder can be accessorized for specific applications and functions
and components differ by manufacturer.

GRINDER SAFETY

When choosing accessories for grinders, it is extremely important to
note the the revolutions per minute (r.p.m.) rating of the accessory
meets or exceeds the r.p.m. of the grinder. An inappropriately sized
grinder accessory can shatter or break resulting in injury. Grinders
should always be unplugged or the battery should be disconnected
from the tool before changing accessories. Portable grinders, like
many other rotating power tools, have the potential for kickback and
operators should take the same basic precautions as when operating
a portable power saw. Bench grinders have tool rests, or tables for
stabilizing items being ground. These should be adjusted as close

                                                    126
to the grinding wheel as possible to prevent injury in the event of
the wheel grabbing the item and pulling the operators hand/s in
the direction of the wheel. Bench grinders are also required to have
adjustable, impact resistant, clear lens guards, protective eye wear
should always be worn by the operator when using any grinder. Due
to the wide variety of grinding tools and applications, be sure to
consult manufacturer directions before operating any power tool you
are unfamiliar with. Although some of these tools are also offered in
special versions that can be used in the presence of water to cool the
blade or stone and flush debris from the cut or material surface, most
grinders are not suited for wet applications.

Sanding Discs for grinders usually require a hard rubber backing

plate to be attached to the grinder and for the disc to be attached to
the backing plate by an adhesive or hook-and-loop fastening system,
to create an orbital sander. The disc's sandpaper material
composition should be selected according to the material being
sanded (see Sandpaper Material Composition).

   Buffing Bonnets and Wheels used for buffing metals, plastics,
quarry stone and other surfaces can be made of cotton, microfiber,
and other materials regularly used in hand polishing items. While
bonnets are mounted to backing plates on portable grinders of
buffers, buffing wheels are mounted to the arbor of stationary
grinders with the arbor nut.

Sanders

Regardless of whether you are sanding by hand or using a power
sander, identifying the right sanding tool and sandpaper to be used
for a project can be a daunting task if you're unfamiliar with the
capability of the sanding tools and the variety of
sandpapers available for specific applications. Sanders can be used to
form and shape a wide variety of materials and to strip or create fine
finishes. When working with electric power sanders, when the tool is
fitted with a variable speed option, the speed should be adjusted to a
speed that creates the best cutting action in order to realize the full
potential of the tool and sandpaper being used based on the material
being sanded and the finish desired. As with other power tools, it is
important to let the tool do the work. Too much pressure on the tool
can slow or dampen the machine's action, creating less cutting action
due to excessive friction or not allowing the tool to rotate or vibrate
at all. Some sanders rotate in one continuous motion (orbital or track)
that can leave sanding lines or swirl marks in materials. Random

orbital and oscillating sanders work in multiple pathways that create
fewer lines and finer finishes.

Sand Paper

Styles

Grit is the term use to identify the coarseness (roughness) of the
material on the sandpaper. Sandpapers are labeled by a number
denoting their coarseness: the lower the number, the coarser the
grit of the sandpaper and rougher finish; the higher the number, the
finer the grit and smoother finish. The sandpaper's cutting material
can consist of aluminum oxide, garnet, or silicon, and can even be
used in emery cloth that resist breakdown in wet applications. For
sanding items that require extensive work, it is best to start with a
coarse sandpaper, graduating incrementally to finer grits to obtain
the desired finish.

          Material Composition

   Garnet quarry stone is crushed to a specified grain size and
      used to coat paper or cloth to make sandpaper and sanding
      belts commonly used for universal applications. Wears out
      faster than other sandpapers but is capable of creating
      smoother finishes.

   Aluminum Oxide works good for sanding wood and metal. As
      aluminum oxide particles flake off during use creating new
      sharp edges, this media lasts longer than garnet sandpaper, but
      does not create as smooth of a finish.

   Silicon Carbide is harder than garnet or aluminum oxide. This
      media is commonly used for metal, plastics, and fiberglass, but
      is a poor choice for applications with wood.

   Emery Cloth is a cloth material coated with a granular mineral
      substance normally consisting of corundum mixed with
      magnetite or hematite. Emery cloth is capable of holding up in

3.1 Required Math Concepts

Numeral System and Notation

It is often said that mathematics is the language of science. If this
is true, then an essential part of the language of mathematics is
numbers. The earliest use of numbers occurred 100 centuries ago in
the Middle East to count, or enumerate items. Farmers, cattlemen,
and tradesmen used tokens, stones, or markers to signify a single
quantity--a sheaf of grain, a head of livestock, or a fixed length of
cloth, for example. Doing so made commerce possible, leading to
improved communications and the spread of civilization.

   Three to four thousand years ago, Egyptians introduced fractions.
They first used them to show reciprocals. Later, they used them to
represent the amount when a quantity was divided into equal parts.

   But what if there were no cattle to trade or an entire crop of grain
was lost in a flood? How could someone indicate the existence of
nothing? From earliest times, people had thought of a "base state"
while counting and used various symbols to represent this null
condition. However, it was not until about the fifth century A.D.
in India that zero was added to the number system and used as a
numeral in calculations.

   Clearly, there was also a need for numbers to represent loss or
debt. In India, in the seventh century A.D., negative numbers were
used as solutions to mathematical equations and commercial debts.
The opposites of the counting numbers expanded the number system
even further.

   Because of the evolution of the number system, we can now
perform complex calculations using these and other categories of
real numbers. In this section, we will explore sets of numbers,

                                                    135
calculations with different kinds of numbers, and the use of numbers
in expressions.

NUMBERS

Natural numbers

The numbers we use for counting, or enumerating items, are the
natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. We describe them in set
notation as {1,2,3,...} where the ellipsis (...) indicates that the numbers
continue to infinity. The natural numbers are, of course, also called
the counting numbers. Any time we enumerate the members of a
team, count the coins in a collection, or tally the trees in a grove, we
are using the set of natural numbers.

Whole numbers

If we add zero to the counting numbers, we get the set of whole
numbers.

   Counting Numbers: 1, 2, 3, ...
   Whole Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

Integers

A set of integers adds the opposites of the natural numbers to the set
of whole numbers:{...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...}. It is useful to note that the
set of integers is made up of three distinct subsets: negative integers,
zero, and positive integers. In this sense, the positive integers are just
the natural numbers. Another way to think about it is that the natural
numbers are a subset of the integers.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 136
FRACTIONS

Often in life, whole amounts are not exactly what we need. A baker

must use a little more than a cup of milk or part of a teaspoon of

sugar. Similarly a carpenter might need less than a foot of wood and a

painter might use part of a gallon of paint. These people need to use

numbers which are part of a whole. These numbers are very useful

both in algebra and in everyday life and they are called factions.

Hence, Fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. It is written

where and are integers and  In a fraction, is called

the numerator and is called the denominator. The denominator

represents the number of equal parts the whole has been divided

into, and the numerator represents how many parts are included.

The denominator, cannot equal zero because division by zero is

undefined.

In (Figure), the circle has been divided into three parts of equal size.

Each part represents of the circle. This type of model is called a

fraction circle. Other shapes, such as rectangles, can also be used to

model fractions.

Doing the Manipulative Mathematics activity Model Fractions will
help you develop a better understanding of fractions, their
numerators and denominators.

What does the fraction  represent? The fraction  means two of
three equal parts.

Improper and Proper Fractions

In an improper fraction, the numerator is greater than or equal to the
denominator, so its value is greater than or equal to one. Fractions
such as , , , and are called improper fractions.

   When a fraction has a numerator that is smaller than the
denominator, it is called a proper fraction, and its value is less than
one. Fractions such as , , and are proper fractions.

Equivalent Fractions

Equivalent fractions are fractions that have the same value. For
example, the fractions and have the same value, 1. Figure shows
two images: a single pizza on the left, cut into two equal pieces, and a
second pizza of the same size, cut into eight pieces on the right. This

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 138
is a way to show that  is equivalent to  . In other words, they are
equivalent fractions.

   Figure #. Since the same amount is of each pizza is shaded, we see
that is equivalent to .

Add or Subtract Fractions

To add or subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator.
If the factions have the same denominator, we just add the
numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. If the
fractions have different denominators, what do we need to do?

   First, we will use fraction tiles to model finding the common
denominator of and

   We'll start with one tile and tile. We want to find a common
fraction tile that we can use to match both and exactly.

   If we try the pieces, of them exactly match the piece, but they
do not exactly match the piece.

139 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
If we try the  pieces, they do not exactly cover the  piece or the
piece.

   If we try the pieces, we see that exactly of them cover the
piece, and exactly of them cover the piece.

If we were to try the pieces, they would also work.

   Even smaller tiles, such as and would also exactly cover the
  piece and the piece.
   The denominator of the largest piece that covers both fractions is
the least common denominator (LCD) of the two fractions. So, the
least common denominator of and is
   Notice that all of the tiles that cover and have something in
common: Their denominators are common multiples of and
the denominators of and The least common multiple (LCM) of
the denominators is and so we say that is the least common
denominator (LCD) of the fractions and . Therefore, the least
common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the least common
multiple (LCM) of their denominators.
   To find the LCD of two fractions, we will find the LCM of their
denominators. We follow the procedure we used earlier to find the
LCM of two numbers. We only use the denominators of the fractions,
not the numerators, when finding the LCD.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 140

multiplied the denominators right straight across.

A model may help you understand multiplication of fractions. We

Start with fraction tiles for three-fourths. To find one-half of

three-fourths, we need to divide them into two equal groups. Since

we cannot divide the three tiles evenly into two parts, we exchange

them for smaller tiles.

three tiles, which is

When multiplying fractions, the properties of positive and negative
numbers still apply. It is a good idea to determine the sign of the

negatives, so the product will be positive.

Divide Fractions

Now that we know how to multiply fractions, we are almost ready to
divide. Before we can do that, that we need some vocabulary.

   The reciprocal of a fraction is found by inverting the fraction,
placing the numerator in the denominator and the denominator in

the numerator. The reciprocal of is .

Notice that  = 1. A number and its reciprocal multiply to 1.

   To get a product of positive 1 when multiplying two numbers, the
numbers must have the same sign. So reciprocals must have the same
sign.

DECIMALS

You probably already know quite a bit about decimals based on your

experience with money. Suppose you buy a sandwich and a bottle of

water for lunch. If the sandwich costs  , the bottle of water costs

, and the total sales tax is            , what is the total cost of your

lunch?

The total is  Suppose you pay with a bill and pennies.

Should you wait for change? No, and pennies is the same as

Because                           each penny is worth of a dollar.

We write the value of one penny as      since

   Decimals are in fact another way of writing fractions whose
denominators are powers of 10.

Just as the counting numbers are based on powers of ten, decimals
are based on powers of ten. (Figure) shows the counting numbers.

                 One ten-thousandth

Add and Subtract Decimals

Let's take one more look at the lunch order from the start of
Decimals, this time noticing how the numbers were added together.

   All three items (sandwich, water, tax) were priced in dollars and
cents, so we lined up the dollars under the dollars and the cents
under the cents, with the decimal points lined up between them.
Then we just added each column, as if we were adding whole

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 146
numbers. By lining up decimals this way, we can add or subtract the
corresponding place values just as we did with whole numbers.
Add or subtract decimals.

 1. Write the numbers vertically so the decimal points line up.
2. Use zeros as place holders, as needed.
3. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers.

      Then place the decimal in the answer under the decimal points
      in the given numbers.

Multiply Decimals

Multiplying decimals is very much like multiplying whole
numbers--we just have to determine where to place the decimal
point. The procedure for multiplying decimals will make sense if we
first review multiplying fractions.

   Do you remember how to multiply fractions? To multiply fractions,
you multiply the numerators and then multiply the denominators.

   So let's see what we would get as the product of decimals by
converting them to fractions first. We will do two examples side-by-
side in (Figure). Look for a pattern.

A                                 B

 Convert to fractions.

 Multiply.
 Convert back to decimals.

There is a pattern that we can use. In A, we multiplied two numbers
that each had one decimal place, and the product had two decimal
places. In B, we multiplied a number with one decimal place by a

147 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
number with two decimal places, and the product had three decimal
places.

   How many decimal places would you expect for the product of
                             If you said "five", you recognized the pattern.

When we multiply two numbers with decimals, we count all the
decimal places in the factors--in this case two plus three--to get the
number of decimal places in the product--in this case five.

Once we know how to determine the number of digits after the
decimal point, we can multiply decimal numbers without converting
them to fractions first. The number of decimal places in the product
is the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors.

   The rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers apply to
decimals, too, of course.
When multiplying two numbers,

   if their signs are the same, the product is positive.
   if their signs are different, the product is negative.

When you multiply signed decimals, first determine the sign of the
product and then multiply as if the numbers were both positive.
Finally, write the product with the appropriate sign.
Multiply decimal numbers

 1. Determine the sign of the product.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 148
2. Write the numbers in vertical format, lining up the numbers on
      the right.

3. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers,
      temporarily ignoring the decimal points.

4. Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the
      product is the sum of the number of decimal places in the
      factors. If needed, use zeros as placeholders.

5. Write the product with the appropriate sign.

Multiply by Powers of
In many fields, especially in the sciences, it is common to multiply
decimals by powers of Let's see what happens when we multiply

             by some powers of

   Look at the results without the final zeros. Do you notice a pattern?

149 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
   The number of places that the decimal point moved is the same
as the number of zeros in the power of ten. (Figure) summarizes the
results.

Multiply by Number of zeros Number of places decimal point moves
                                                place to the right
                                                places to the right
                                                 places to the right
                                                 places to the right

We can use this pattern as a shortcut to multiply by powers of ten

instead of multiplying using the vertical format. We can count the

zeros in the power of and then move the decimal point that same

of places to the right.

So, for example, to multiply    by  move the decimal

point places to the right.

Sometimes when we need to move the decimal point, there are not

enough decimal places. In that case, we use zeros as placeholders.

For example, let's multiply by  We need to move the decimal

point places to the right. Since there is only one digit to the right of

the decimal point, we must write a in the hundredths place.

Multiply a decimal by a power of 10.

 1. Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places
      as the number of zeros in the power of

2. Write zeros at the end of the number as placeholders if needed.

Divide Decimals
Just as with multiplication, division of decimals is very much like
dividing whole numbers. We just have to figure out where the
decimal point must be placed.

   To understand decimal division, let's consider the multiplication
problem

Remember, a multiplication problem can be rephrased as a division
problem. So we can write

We can think of this as "If we divide 8 tenths into four groups, how
many are in each group?" (Figure) shows that there are four groups of
two-tenths in eight-tenths. So

Using long division notation, we would write

   Notice that the decimal point in the quotient is directly above the
decimal point in the dividend.

   To divide a decimal by a whole number, we place the decimal point

151 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend and then
divide as usual. Sometimes we need to use extra zeros at the end of
the dividend to keep dividing until there is no remainder.
Divide a decimal by a whole number.

 1. Write as long division, placing the decimal point in the quotient
      above the decimal point in the dividend.

2. Divide as usual.

Divide a Decimal by Another Decimal

So far, we have divided a decimal by a whole number. What happens
when we divide a decimal by another decimal? Let's look at the same
multiplication problem we looked at earlier, but in a different way.

Remember, again, that a multiplication problem can be rephrased as

a division problem. This time we ask, "How many times does go

into  Because  we can say that                  goes

into four times. This means that divided by is

   We would get the same answer, if we divide by both whole
numbers. Why is this so? Let's think about the division problem as a
fraction.

               3.1 Required Math Concepts | 152
We multiplied the numerator and denominator by and ended
up just dividing by To divide decimals, we multiply both the
numerator and denominator by the same power of to make the
denominator a whole number. Because of the Equivalent Fractions
Property, we haven't changed the value of the fraction. The effect is
to move the decimal points in the numerator and denominator the
same number of places to the right.

   We use the rules for dividing positive and negative numbers with
decimals, too. When dividing signed decimals, first determine the
sign of the quotient and then divide as if the numbers were both
positive. Finally, write the quotient with the appropriate sign.

   It may help to review the vocabulary for division:

Divide decimal numbers.

 1. Determine the sign of the quotient.
2. Make the divisor a whole number by moving the decimal point

      all the way to the right. Move the decimal point in the dividend
      the same number of places to the right, writing zeros as needed.
3. Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the
      decimal point in the dividend.
4. Write the quotient with the appropriate sign.

EXPONENTS
An exponent indicates repeated multiplication of the same quantity.
For example, 24 means to multiply four factors of 2, so 24 means
2222. This format is known as exponential notation.
Exponential Notation

   This is read a to the mth power.
In the expression am, the exponent tells us how many times we use
the base a as a factor.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 154
Square
Do you know why we use the word square? If we construct a square
with three tiles on each side, the total number of tiles would be nine.

This is why we say that the square of three is nine.
   32 = 9
   What happens when you square a negative number?
   (-8)2 = (-8) (-8) = 64
   When we multiply two negative numbers, the product is always

positive. So the square of a negative number is always positive.

Cube

Square Roots
Sometimes we will need to look at the relationship between numbers
and their squares in reverse. Because 102=100, we say 100 is the
square of 10. We can also say that 10 is a square root of 100.

155 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
Square Root of a Number
A number whose square is m is called a square root of m.

   If n2=m, then n is a square root of m.
Notice (-10)2=100 also, so -10 is also a square root of 100. Therefore,
both 10 and -10 are square roots of 100.

   So, every positive number has two square roots: one positive and
one negative.

   What if we only want the positive square root of a positive number?
The radical sign, , stands for the positive square root. The positive
square root is also called the principal square root.
Square Root Notation
m is read as "the square root of m.

   If m=n2, then m = n for n0. If m = n2, then m= n for n0.

We can also use the radical sign for the square root of zero. Because
02=0, 0=0. Notice that zero has only one square root.

Square Root of a Negative Number
Can we simplify -25? Is there a number whose square is -25?
()2 = -25?
None of the numbers that we have dealt with so far have a square

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 156
that is -25. Why? Any positive number squared is positive, and any
negative number squared is also positive. There is no real number
equal to -25. If we are asked to find the square root of any negative
number, we say that the solution is not a real number.
Estimate Square Roots (done)
So far we have only worked with square roots of perfect squares. The
square roots of other numbers are not whole numbers.

We might conclude that the square roots of numbers between 4 and
9 will be between 2 and 3, and they will not be whole numbers. Based
on the pattern in the table above, we could say that 5 is between 2
and 3. Using inequality symbols, we write 2<5<3
Approximate Square Roots with a Calculator
There are mathematical methods to approximate square roots, but
it is much more convenient to use a calculator to find square roots.
Find the  or x key on your calculator. You will to use this key

157 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
to approximate square roots. When you use your calculator to find
the square root of a number that is not a perfect square, the answer
that you see is not the exact number. It is an approximation, to the
number of digits shown on your calculator's display. The symbol for
an approximation is  and it is read approximately.

   Suppose your calculator has a 10-digit display. Using it to find
the square root of 5 will give 2.236067977. This is the approximate
square root of 5. When we report the answer, we should use the
"approximately equal to" sign instead of an equal sign.
5  2.2360679785

You will seldom use this many digits for applications in algebra. So, if
you wanted to round 5 to two decimal places, you would write
52.24

How do we know these values are approximations and not the exact
values? Look at what happens when we square them.
2.2360679782 = 5.000000002
2.242 = 5.0176

The squares are close, but not exactly equal, to 5.

RATIOS

When you apply for a mortgage, the loan officer will compare your
total debt to your total income to decide if you qualify for the loan.
This comparison is called the debt-to-income ratio. A ratio compares
two quantities that are measured with the same unit. If we compare

   and , the ratio is written as

Ratios Involving Decimals

We will often work with ratios of decimals, especially when we have

ratios involving money. In these cases, we can eliminate the decimals

by using the Equivalent Fractions Property to convert the ratio to a

fraction with whole numbers in the numerator and denominator.

For example, consider the ratio                        We can write it

as a fraction with decimals and then multiply the numerator and

denominator by             to eliminate the decimals.

Do you see a shortcut to find the equivalent fraction? Notice that

        and                       The least common denominator of

and is          By multiplying the numerator and denominator of

by      we `moved' the decimal two places to the right to get

the equivalent fraction with no decimals. Now that we understand

159 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
the math behind the process, we can find the fraction with no
decimals like this:

 "Move" the decimal 2 places.
 Simplify.
You do not have to write out every step when you multiply the
numerator and denominator by powers of ten. As long as you move
both decimal places the same number of places, the ratio will remain
the same.

Perimeter, Area, and Volume

PERIMETER AND AREA
The perimeter is a measure of the distance around a figure. The area
is a measure of the surface covered by a figure.

Square
(Figure) shows a square tile that is 1 inch on each side. If an ant walked
around the edge of the tile, it would walk 4 inches. This distance is
the perimeter of the tile. Since the tile is a square that is 1 inch on
each side, its area is one square inch. The area of a shape is measured
by determining how many square units cover the shape.

Figure #. Perimeter = 4 inches Area = 1 square inch
   When the ant walks completely around the tile on its edge, it is

tracing the perimeter of the tile. The area of the tile is 1 square inch.

161 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
Rectangle
A rectangle has four sides and four right angles. The opposite sides of
a rectangle are the same length. We refer to one side of the rectangle
as the length, L, and the adjacent side as the width, W. See (Figure).

Figure #. A rectangle has four sides, and four right angles. The sides
                    are labeled L for length and W for width.

The perimeter, P, of the rectangle is the distance around the
rectangle. If you started at one corner and walked around the
rectangle, you would walk L+W+L+W units, or two lengths and two
widths. The perimeter then is
P=L+W+L+W
or
P=2L+2W
What about the area of a rectangle? Remember the rectangular rug
from the beginning of this section. It was 2 feet long by 3 feet wide,
and its area was 6 square feet. See (Figure). Since A=23, we see that
the area, A, is the length, L, times the width, W, so the area of a
rectangle is A=LW.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 162
Figure #. The area of this rectangular rug is 6 square feet, its length
                                     times its width.

Triangle
We now know how to find the area of a rectangle. We can use this
fact to help us visualize the formula for the area of a triangle. In the
rectangle in (Figure), we've labeled the length b and the width h, so
it's area is bh.

 Figure #. The area of a rectangle is the base, b, times the height, h.

163 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
We can divide this rectangle into two congruent triangles (Figure).
Triangles that are congruent have identical side lengths and angles,
and so their areas are equal. The area of each triangle is one-half the
area of the rectangle, or bh. This example helps us see why the
formula for the area of a triangle is A= bh.

Figure #. A rectangle can be divided into two triangles of equal area.
     The area of each triangle is one-half the area of the rectangle.

The formula for the area of a triangle is A = bh, where b is the base
and h is the height.

   To find the area of the triangle, you need to know its base and
height. The base is the length of one side of the triangle, usually the
side at the bottom. The height is the length of the line that connects
the base to the opposite vertex, and makes a 90 angle with the
base. (Figure) shows three triangles with the base and height of each
marked.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 164
  Figure #. The height h of a triangle is the length of a line segment
 that connects the the base to the opposite vertex and makes a 90

                                  angle with the base.
Isosceles and Equilateral Triangles
Besides the right triangle, some other triangles have special names. A
triangle with two sides of equal length is called an isosceles triangle.
A triangle that has three sides of equal length is called an equilateral
triangle. (Figure) shows both types of triangles.

  Figure #. In an isosceles triangle, two sides have the same length,
   and the third side is the base. In an equilateral triangle, all three

                             sides have the same length.

            An isosceles triangle has two sides the same length.
          An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length.

Trapezoid
A trapezoid is four-sided figure, a quadrilateral, with two sides that
are parallel and two sides that are not. The parallel sides are called
the bases. We call the length of the smaller base b, and the length
of the bigger base B. The height, h, of a trapezoid is the distance
between the two bases as shown in (Figure).

Figure #. A trapezoid has a larger base, B, and a smaller base, b. The
                  height h is the distance between the bases.

The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
Areatrapezoid=1/2h(b+B)
Splitting the trapezoid into two triangles may help us understand the
formula. The area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of the two
triangles. See (Figure).

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 166
    Figure #. Splitting a trapezoid into two triangles may help you
                       understand the formula for its area.

                                triangles. See (Figure).

The formula for the area of a trapezoid is

Circle

The properties of circles have been studied for over  years.

All circles have exactly the same shape, but their sizes are affected by

the length of the radius, a line segment from the center to any point

on the circle. A line segment that passes through a circle's center

connecting two points on the circle is called a diameter. The diameter

is twice as long as the radius. See (Figure).

The size of a circle can be measured in two ways. The distance

around a circle is called its circumference.

        3.1 Required Math Concepts | 168
Archimedes discovered that for circles of all different sizes, dividing

the circumference by the diameter always gives the same number.

The value of this number is pi, symbolized by Greek letter

(pronounced pie). However, the exact value of cannot be calculated

since the decimal never ends or repeats (we will learn more about

numbers like this in The Properties of Real Numbers.)

If we want the exact circumference or area of a circle, we leave

the symbol in the answer. We can get an approximate answer by

substituting  as the value of We use the symbol to show that

the result is approximate, not exact.

Properties of Circles

Since the diameter is twice the radius, another way to find the

circumference is to use the formula

Suppose we want to find the exact area of a circle of radius

inches. To calculate the area, we would evaluate the formula for the

area when     inches and leave the answer in terms of

We write after the  So the exact value of the area is

square inches.

To approximate the area, we would substitute

Remember to use square units, such as square inches, when you
calculate the area.

Sphere

A sphere is the shape of a basketball, like a three-dimensional circle.
Just like a circle, the size of a sphere is determined by its radius,
which is the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on
its surface. The formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere
are given below.

   Showing where these formulas come from, like we did for a
rectangular solid, is beyond the scope of this course. We will
approximate  with 3.14.
Volume and Surface Area of a Sphere

For a sphere with radius r:

Cube or Rectangle

A cube is a rectangular solid whose length, width, and height are

equal. See Volume and Surface Area of a Cube, below. Substituting,

s for the length, width and height into the formulas for volume and

surface area of a rectangular solid, we get:

V=LWH S=2LH+2LW+2WH

V=s톝톝  S=2s톝+2s톝+2s톝
V=s3     S=2s2+2s2+2s2
         S=6s2

So for a cube, the formulas for volume and surface area are V=s3 and
S=6s2.

For any cube with sides of length s,

Cylinder

If you have ever seen a can of soda, you know what a cylinder looks
like. A cylinder is a solid figure with two parallel circles of the same
size at the top and bottom. The top and bottom of a cylinder are
called the bases. The height h of a cylinder is the distance between
the two bases. For all the cylinders we will work with here, the sides
and the height, h, will be perpendicular to the bases.

171 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
 Figure #. A cylinder has two circular bases of equal size. The height
                        is the distance between the bases.

Rectangular solids and cylinders are somewhat similar because they
both have two bases and a height. The formula for the volume of
a rectangular solid, V=Bh, can also be used to find the volume of a
cylinder.

   For the rectangular solid, the area of the base, B, is the area of
the rectangular base, length  width. For a cylinder, the area of the
base, B, is the area of its circular base, r2. (Figure) compares how the
formula V=Bh is used for rectangular solids and cylinders.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 172
Figure #. Seeing how a cylinder is similar to a rectangular solid may
      make it easier to understand the formula for the volume of a
                                          cylinder.

To understand the formula for the surface area of a cylinder, think of
a can of vegetables. It has three surfaces: the top, the bottom, and the
piece that forms the sides of the can. If you carefully cut the label off
the side of the can and unroll it, you will see that it is a rectangle. See
(Figure).

173 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
  Figure #. By cutting and unrolling the label of a can of vegetables,
we can see that the surface of a cylinder is a rectangle. The length of

  the rectangle is the circumference of the cylinder's base, and the
                        width is the height of the cylinder.

The distance around the edge of the can is the circumference of the
cylinder's base it is also the length L of the rectangular label. The
height of the cylinder is the width W of the rectangular label. So the
area of the label can be represented as

   To find the total surface area of the cylinder, we add the areas of
the two circles to the area of the rectangle.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 174

Cone

175 | 3.1 Required Math Concepts
an ice cream cone. There are many other applications of cones (but
most are not as tasty as ice cream cones). In this section, we will see
how to find the volume of a cone.

   In geometry, a cone is a solid figure with one circular base and a
vertex. The height of a cone is the distance between its base and the
vertex.The cones that we will look at in this section will always have
the height perpendicular to the base. See (Figure).

 Figure #. The height of a cone is the distance between its base and
                                        the vertex.

Earlier in this section, we saw that the volume of a cylinder is V=r2h.
We can think of a cone as part of a cylinder. (Figure) shows a cone
placed inside a cylinder with the same height and same base. If we
compare the volume of the cone and the cylinder, we can see that the
volume of the cone is less than that of the cylinder.

                                                             3.1 Required Math Concepts | 176

In fact, the volume of a cone is exactly one-third of the volume of a
cylinder with the same base and height. The volume of a cone is

Since the base of a cone is a circle, we can substitute the formula of
area of a circle, r2 , for B to get the formula for volume of a cone.

3.2 Ohm's Law, Joules Law, and
Series/Parallel Formulas

OHM'S LAW

The current that flows through most substances is directly
proportional to the voltage V applied to it. The German physicist
Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) was the first to demonstrate
experimentally that the current in a metal wire is directly
proportional to the voltage applied: I  V.

   This important relationship is known as Ohm's law. It can be viewed
as a cause-and-effect relationship, with voltage the cause and
current the effect. This is an empirical law like that for friction--an
experimentally observed phenomenon. Such a linear relationship
doesn't always occur.

Resistance and Simple Circuits

If voltage drives current, what impedes it? The electric property
that impedes current (crudely similar to friction and air resistance)
is called resistance R. Collisions of moving charges with atoms and
molecules in a substance transfer energy to the substance and limit
current. Resistance is defined as inversely proportional to current, or
I .

   Thus, for example, current is cut in half if resistance doubles.
Combining the relationships of current to voltage and current to
resistance gives I = .

   This relationship is also called Ohm's law. Ohm's law in this form
really defines resistance for certain materials. Ohm's law (like Hooke's
law) is not universally valid. The many substances for which Ohm's

                                                    182
law holds are called ohmic. These include good conductors like
copper and aluminum, and some poor conductors under certain
circumstances. Ohmic materials have a resistance R that is
independent of voltage V and current I. An object that has simple
resistance is called a resistor, even if its resistance is small. The unit
for resistance is an ohm and is given the symbol  (upper case Greek
omega). Rearranging I = gives R= , and so the units of resistance
are 1 ohm = 1 volt per ampere: 1  = 1 .

   Figure shows the schematic for a simple circuit. A simple circuit
has a single voltage source and a single resistor. The wires
connecting the voltage source to the resistor can be assumed to have
negligible resistance, or their resistance can be included in R.

Making Connections: Real World Connections
Ohm's law (V=IR) is a fundamental relationship that could be
presented by a linear function with the slope of the line being the
resistance. The resistance represents the voltage that needs to be
applied to the resistor to create a current of 1 A through the circuit.
The graph (in the figure below) shows this representation for two
simple circuits with resistors that have different resistances and thus
different slopes.

The figure illustrates the relationship between current and voltage for
two different resistors. The slope of the graph represents the resistance
value, which is 2 and 4 for the two lines shown.

   The materials which follow Ohm's law by having a linear
relationship between voltage and current are known as ohmic
materials. On the other hand, some materials exhibit a nonlinear
voltage-current relationship and hence are known as non-ohmic
materials. The figure below shows current voltage relationships for
the two types of materials.

185 | 3.2 Ohm's Law, Joules Law, and Series/Parallel Formulas
Figure #. The relationship between voltage and current for ohmic
and non-ohmic materials are shown.

   Clearly the resistance of an ohmic material (shown in (a)) remains
constant and can be calculated by finding the slope of the graph but
that is not true for a non-ohmic material (shown in (b)).

   Resistances range over many orders of magnitude. Some ceramic
insulators, such as those used to support power lines, have
resistances of 1012 or more. A dry person may have a hand-to-foot
resistance of 105, whereas the resistance of the human heart is

                     3.2 Ohm's Law, Joules Law, and Series/Parallel Formulas | 186
about 103. A meter-long piece of large-diameter copper wire may
have a resistance of 10-5, and superconductors have no resistance
at all (they are non-ohmic). Resistance is related to the shape of an
object and the material of which it is composed, as will be seen in
Resistance and Resistivity.

   Additional insight is gained by solving I= for V, yielding V=IR.
   This expression for V can be interpreted as the voltage drop across
a resistor produced by the current I. The phrase IR drop is often used
for this voltage. For instance, the headlight in Example has an IR
drop of 12.0 V. If voltage is measured at various points in a circuit,
it will be seen to increase at the voltage source and decrease at the
resistor. Voltage is similar to fluid pressure. The voltage source is like
a pump, creating a pressure difference, causing current--the flow of
charge. The resistor is like a pipe that reduces pressure and limits
flow because of its resistance. Conservation of energy has important
consequences here. The voltage source supplies energy (causing an
electric field and a current), and the resistor converts it to another
form (such as thermal energy). In a simple circuit (one with a single
simple resistor), the voltage supplied by the source equals the voltage
drop across the resistor, since PE=qV, and the same q flows through
each. Thus the energy supplied by the voltage source and the energy
converted by the resistor are equal. (See Figure.)

187 | 3.2 Ohm's Law, Joules Law, and Series/Parallel Formulas
The voltage drop across a resistor in a simple circuit equals the voltage
output of the battery.

Making Connections: Conservation of Energy
In a simple electrical circuit, the sole resistor converts energy
supplied by the source into another form. Conservation of energy
is evidenced here by the fact that all of the energy supplied by the
source is converted to another form by the resistor alone. We will
find that conservation of energy has other important applications in
circuits and is a powerful tool in circuit analysis.

RESISTORS IN SERIES AND PARALLEL
Most circuits have more than one component, called a resistor that
limits the flow of charge in the circuit. A measure of this limit on
charge flow is called resistance. The simplest combinations of
resistors are the series and parallel connections illustrated in Figure.
The total resistance of a combination of resistors depends on both
their individual values and how they are connected.

Image shows (a) A series connection of resistors. (b) A parallel
connection of resistors.

   When resistors are connected in parallel, more current flows from
the source than would flow for any of them individually, and so the
total resistance is lower.

JOULES LAW

Power is associated by many people with electricity. Knowing that
power is the rate of energy use or energy conversion, what is the
expression for electric power? Power transmission lines might come
to mind. We also think of lightbulbs in terms of their power ratings in
watts. Let us compare a 25-W bulb with a 60-W bulb. (See Figure(a).)
Since both operate on the same voltage, the 60-W bulb must draw
more current to have a greater power rating. Thus the 60-W bulb's

189 | 3.2 Ohm's Law, Joules Law, and Series/Parallel Formulas
resistance must be lower than that of a 25-W bulb. If we increase
voltage, we also increase power. For example, when a 25-W bulb that
is designed to operate on 120 V is connected to 240 V, it briefly glows
very brightly and then burns out. Precisely how are voltage, current,
and resistance related to electric power?

   Electric energy depends on both the voltage involved and the
charge moved. This is expressed most simply as PE = qV, where q
is the charge moved and V is the voltage (or more precisely, the
potential difference the charge moves through). Power is the rate at

which energy is moved, and so electric power is P = = .

  Recognizing that current is I = (note that t=t here), the

expression for power becomes P = IV.
   Electric power (P) is simply the product of current times voltage.

Power has familiar units of watts. Since the SI unit for potential
energy (PE) is the joule, power has units of joules per second, or
watts. Thus, 1 AV = 1 W. For example, cars often have one or more
auxiliary power outlets with which you can charge a cell phone or
other electronic devices. These outlets may be rated at 20 A, so that
the circuit can deliver a maximum power P = IV = (20 A) (12 V) = 240
W. In some applications, electric power may be expressed as volt-
amperes or even kilovolt-amperes 1 kAV = 1 kW.

   To see the relationship of power to resistance, we combine Ohm's
law with P = IV. Substituting I = V/R gives P = ( )V = V2/R. Similarly,
substituting V = IR gives P = I(IR) = I2R. Three expressions for electric
power are listed together here for convenience:

   P = IV
   P = V2/R
   P = I2R.

Note that the first equation is always valid, whereas the other two
can be used only for resistors. In a simple circuit, with one voltage
source and a single resistor, the power supplied by the voltage source
and that dissipated by the resistor are identical. (In more complicated

                     3.2 Ohm's Law, Joules Law, and Series/Parallel Formulas | 190
circuits, P can be the power dissipated by a single device and not the
total power in the circuit.)

   Different insights can be gained from the three different
expressions for electric power. For example,P = V2/Rimplies that
the lower the resistance connected to a given voltage source, the
greater the power delivered. Furthermore, since voltage is squared
inP = V2/R, the effect of applying a higher voltage is perhaps greater
than expected. Thus, when the voltage is doubled to a 25-W bulb, its
power nearly quadruples to about 100 W, burning it out. If the bulb's
resistance remained constant, its power would be exactly 100 W, but
at the higher temperature its resistance is higher, too.

4.1 Piping & Fittings

Pipes

Installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting plumbing systems
requires specific knowledge of industry standardized measurements,
construction codes, and specialized components of plumbing
systems. While locally adopted plumbing codes apply to these
systems and components, manufacturer installation and use
instructions should be followed. Many common plumbing parts and
materials like pipes and fittings do not come with instructions and
should be sized and installed to comply with locally adopted
plumbing and building codes.

   A pipe or fitting's ability to hold pressure, survive hot or cold
temperatures, and endure natural elements is limited by it's chemical
composition, wall strength, and integrity of the sealing method used
to join individual components. Schedule is the term used in referring
to "plastic" (PVC, ABS, CPVC) pipe's wall thickness, with lower
numbers representing thinner walled pipes. The most common sizes
used in residential construction are Schedule 40 (thinner wall used
in drain, waste and vent applications) and Schedule 80 (thicker wall
used in pressurized water applications). Several material types are
approved for use in piping system that serve different purposes in a
complete plumbing system to include water supply, and waste, drain
and vent (DWV). The following table indicates the type of plumbing
system that various types of piping are generally allowed in
residential and light commercial construction:

Fittings

Fitting are used to join and redirect pipes and components to form
complete plumbing systems. Due to the variety of designs of
plumbing system components, fittings also facilitate adaptations
from one size diameter of pipe or fitting to another. While many
styles of fittings are used in most all types of systems, plumbing
codes only allow some fittings to be used in particular type of
plumbing system (supply or DWV) and have strict requirements as
to how they are to be incorporated into the system (ex: compression
fittings and unions should never be used inside of walls).

Solvent Cleaners, Primers, & Cements or Glues

Pipe Glues & Primers by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   The use of cleaners, primers, and glues is specific to slip fitting

applications and the chemical composition of the "plastic" piping
being used. Chemical resistant gloves should be worn when using
these chemical process adhesives as prolonged skin contact can
result in irritation or chemical burn. Latex and vinyl gloves are not
chemically resistant when used with some solvents, primers, and
glues.

   Always consult manufacture directions for set times of cements
and glues before pressurizing any glued plumbing assembly. When
assembling fittings and pipes, cleaners, primers and glues should be
swabbed over the entire joint surface of both the male and female
slip fitting. Although manufacturer directions may vary, in most cases
215 | 4.1 Piping & Fittings
a cleaner should be used, followed by a primer and then the solvent
cement. Additionally, after application of the primer, the solvent
cement should be applied immediately before the primer dries.
Before the glue begins to set up, the male pipe or fitting is inserted
fully into the female socket with a slight twisting motion. It is
important to hold the joint firmly together until an initial setting of
the glue is achieved, as glued fittings have a tendency to push apart
as the chemical heats and expands.
COLOR AND MATERIAL
Most manufacturers of these chemically reactive products have
adopted colors in their products that identify the composition of
material it is to be used with.

                                                                         4.1 Piping & Fittings | 216

                             as these types of glues do not

Threaded Pipe Fitting Assembly

Most pipe threads by themselves are not sufficient to create a
complete seal in pressurized piping systems.

219 | 4.1 Piping & Fittings
THREAD TAPE

Teflon Tapes by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   IPS and NPT pipe threads require Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)

tape (TeflonTM by Chemours) to be applied to the male threads of
fittings in order to obtain a complete seal. PTFE tape is available
in widths of 1/2, 3/4 and 1 and different weights or thicknesses
(white-standard duty, pink-high density). The standard duty tape
should be wrapped completely and evenly across the male threads

                                                                        4.1 Piping & Fittings | 220
approximately three to four times in the direction the threads turn to
tighten the fitting. The easiest way to accomplish this is to place the
tape roll in the left hand with the tape feeding toward the right from
the bottom. While holding the male fitting with the right hand, place
the end of the tape across the top of the fitting and turn the fitting
clockwise. After securing the first 1 to 1-1/2 wraps, gently stretch the
tape, continuing to turn while overlapping layers up and down the
threads until 3 to four complete wraps are achieved evenly across the
length of the male threads. Pull the tape firmly to break and thread
male fitting into female fitting, securing with an appropriate wrench.

   Standard or high density PTFE thread pipe cannot, by codes, be
used for natural gas and propane applications. A chemically resistant
yellow version is used for these flammable gas systems.
PIPE DOPE

221 | 4.1 Piping & Fittings
Pipe Dope by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0

   As with thread tape, pipe dope comes in PTFE and other
compositions designed for water lines and for gas lines. While some
people use pipe dope on top of thread tape but many manufactures
claim that the is minimal or no benefit to using both products
simultaneously. Some pipe dopes cannot be used on plastic piping,
be sure to check manufacturer directions prior to use. Pipe dope is
applied with a brush to the male threads of a piping joint and then
the pipe is tightened into the female fitting and secured with an
appropriate wrench.

Copper Pipe Fitting and Soldering

Due to the ever rising cost of copper material, soldering of copper
pipes and fittings in residential construction is rapidly becoming
obsolete as PEX flexible water supply tubing and similar solderless
products, that use crimping system technologies, are being
recognized and approved for installation by industry codes. However,
plumbers and building maintenance technicians should always be
prepared to use soldering techniques to install and repair copper
supply lines of all sizes in commercial and older residential systems.

SIMPLE STEPS FOR SOLDERING

 1. Clean the pipe well.
2. Clean the fitting well.
3. Apply an even coat of flux.
4. Don't get the fitting too hot.

                                                                        4.1 Piping & Fittings | 222

4.2 Domestic Water Service

Potable Water

Often referred to as drinking water or domestic water, potable water
is water that is considered to be safe for human consumption.
Plumbers and maintenance technicians should always be aware of
the potential for contamination of potable water systems and guard
against it when installing, opening, and repairing these vulnerable
systems.

   Plumbing codes are very specific about maintaining the integrity of
potable water systems to be free of harmful contaminants to protect
the health and well being of individuals that rely on them. If a water
service is installed in the same trench as a drain or sewer, the
possibility of back-flow could occur. To protect against this, codes
regulate the installation of a water service in the same trench with or
within a certain distance of waste system piping. Most codes require
that a water service installed at the same elevation as a sewer must be
separated from the sewer by at least 5' of undisturbed or compacted
soil (This code often dictates that a separate trench is to be
excavated). Additionally, lead-free regulations now affect how brass,
bronze, copper, and other metal fittings and components are made
and the solders that are used to assemble some of them.

Specialty Tools

Specialty tools often make tasks easier to perform and there is no

                                                    224
shortage of specialty tools in the plumbing field. Many are specific
to a particular manufacturer, while other perform functions that are
relative to the plumbing field.

Water Meters

Water meters are used by municipal water systems to monitor and
record water usage for billing purposes. Most in-ground water
meters are secured in a meter box that requires a specially shaped
forged key (available at specialty plumbing supply vendors) to open.
Every water meter has a direction of flow and an arrow indicating
which side is the incoming or outgoing connection. A municipal shut-
off valve located before the meter (inlet side) normally has a
rectangular shaped lock-out device that can be turned on or off with
a fitted T-handle device or open end wrench. Turning this valve to
the off position allows for the water supply to the entire property
the meter services to be cut off and for the meter to be removed or
serviced. A ball or gate valve should be installed in a valve box located
outside of the meter box on the outlet side for customers or service
technicians to access in order to shut off water service in the event
of an emergency.

225 | 4.2 Domestic Water Service
Water Meter by Clifford Rutherford is licensed under CC BY 4.0

CHECKING FOR LEAKS WITH A RESIDENTIAL WATER METER:
Be sure all faucets and hose bibs in the residence are turned off.

   Ensure that nobody will be flushing the toilets.
   Turn off supply line to refrigerator ice makers and water
dispensers.
   Watch to see if the small flow indicator dial on the meter is turning.

                                                             4.2 Domestic Water Service | 226
   If the indicator appears to be stopped, make a temporary
      marking that indicates the position of the flow indicator dial and
      wait 5 minutes to see if the indicator moves.

   If the indicator is turning on initial inspection, or has moved
      within 5 minutes of being marked at a fixed position, and
      nobody in the residence is using the water:

        Turn off supply water to any water features one at a time
            including: spas, swimming pools, and ponds; checking the
            flow indicator between each one. If the indicator on the
            meter ceases to turn after turning off a particular water
            feature, check the supply valve/float valve or filling system
            of that feature for leaks.

        Turn off angle stops at toilets one at a time and check the
            water meter flow indicator to see if it has stopped moving
            between turning off the supply at each toilet. If the
            indicator ceases to turn after turning off a particular toilet's
            angle stop, follow procedures for troubleshooting toilet fill
            and flush valves in that toilet.

If all of these procedures have been performed and the flow indicator
dial continues to turn, it is possible that there is an underground,
under-slab, or in-wall leak. As in-wall leaks are usually apparent, it
is more likely that leak would be in the ground or under-slab and a
professional licensed plumber should be consulted.

Residential Piping

Rough-in water supply piping is usually installed after the completion
of the drainage and vent piping because the water piping system

227 | 4.2 Domestic Water Service
consumes less space in walls and ceilings. The drainage and piping
must be installed with specific fittings and in certain positions to
allow the water to flow by gravity, and water supply system
installation requirements are less rigid than drain, waste, and vent
systems.

SYSTEM PIPE SIZE REQUIREMENTS

While the International Plumbing Code (IPC) and the Uniform
Plumbing Code (UPC) differ slightly in their pipe sizing allowances,
both use similar criteria for the sizing of piping systems. The sizing
of an entire system is established based on the quantity and type of
fixtures being served, and designed based on the maximum GPM or
per flushing cycle of a particular fixture and then calculated as per all
the fixtures.

Fixture                  UPC Smallest Size  IPC Smallest Size
Bathtub                  1/2"               1/2"

4.3 Drain, Waste, and Vent
(DWV)

Drain, Waste and Vent (DWV) systems can be complex and extensive
as pipe routes are a result of determining fixture locations, fixture
requirements, relative codes, construction obstacles, and company
installation standards. Understanding of the basic layout of these
systems can be crutial to plumbers and maintenance technicians
when diagnosing and clearing blockages, and troubleshooting other
drain and sewer abnormalities.

DWV Terminology

Building Sewer

A building sewer is the main pipe used to transport sewage and
wastewater from a DWV system to a point of disposal, or termination
(ex. a municipal sewer line).

Clean-Outs

The start of a building sewer is typically where a clean-out is installed
with its connection to the building drain. Clean-outs are installed in
various locations throughout a system and the maximum distances
are found in a code books, they typically cannot be more than 100'

                                                   230
apart. All codes dictate that the base of every stack and the transition
from a building drain and building sewer must have a clean-out
installed. Sizing is based on a clean-out being the same size as the
pipe when serving a stack, building drain, and building sewer, but
some codes allow exceptions for pipe sizes larger than 4".

231 | 4.3 Drain, Waste, and Vent (DWV)
Clean-Out Key by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0

Building Drain

The building drain is the lowest horizontal portion of a drainage
                                                     4.3 Drain, Waste, and Vent (DWV) | 232
system and receives discharge from waste stacks and horizontal
branches. Many codes state that it must extend at least 2'-6"and a
maximum of 10'-0" from the exterior of the building.

Waste Stack

The waste stack is the main vertical pipe that starts with its
connection at the building drain and terminates with its connection
to the stack vent. It receives discharge from all horizontal branches
and must have a clean-out at its base.

Stack Vent

The vent for the waste stack is known as the stack vent and begins at
the highest branch connection to the waste stack. It is a dry piping
system that typically extends through the roof, but can connect with
the vent stack prior to terminating to open air.

Vent Stack

A vent stack is sized based on numerous factors including the total
discharge load of a system and the length it travels. The vent stack
can transition horizontally without requiring a relief vent. Like all
horizontal vents, it must have adequate slope to eliminate moisture
from settling and obstructing its airway. A clean-out is most often
required to be installed at its base by plumbing and building codes .

233 | 4.3 Drain, Waste, and Vent (DWV)
Fixture Drain

The fixture drain serves a single fixture trap and is sized based on
the particular fixture load. Most codes allow a removable joint of a
trap assembly to act as a clean-out for a fixture drain. A floor drain
or shower drain with a removable strainer can also serve as a clean-
out for a fixture drain. Though a drain cannot be smaller than 1 -1/
4" diameter, most codes dictate that the smallest drain size buried
below ground is 2" diameter.

Fixture Branch

The fixture branch is a drainpipe that connects more than one fixture
drain to a horizontal branch or major segment of a DWV system.

Horizontal Branch

A horizontal branch is a drainpipe that connects horizontally to a
major segment of a DWV system. It can either connect to a waste
stack or building drain. It connects more than one fixture drain or a
fixture branch to a main segment of DWV system.

Individual Vent

Individual vents serve one fixture trap and are a vertical extension

                                                     4.3 Drain, Waste, and Vent (DWV) | 234
of a drain. They must be at least half the diameter of the drain they
serve, but no smaller than 1 -1/4".

Branch Vent

The branch vent serves as a vent for a horizontal branch and
connects to the a vent stack or a stack vent. A branch vent is sized
based on the size of the horizontal branch, the drainage load of the
horizontal branch, and the distance it travels.

Circuit Vent

A circuit vent, mainly used in commercial applications, is a branch
vent that is not typical with other standard branch vent types and
has specific code regulations. Single-family residential construction
typically does not use "battery" configurations designed for
institutional style multiple fixture applications due to the minimal
number of fixtures located within one room.

Loop Vent

The loop vent is a circuit vent that is installed on a top floor of a
building or highest branch. All sizing and code regulations are the
same as those for a circuit vent.

235 | 4.3 Drain, Waste, and Vent (DWV)
Relief Vent

A relief vent is required when a waste stack transitions from vertical
to horizontal. The most common relief vent is one serving a battery
of fixtures. A relief vent serving a battery of fixtures is sized based on
being half the diameter of the horizontal branch, but as with all other
vents, it cannot be less than 1 -1/4".

Trap

Every plumbing fixture connected to a drainage system must be
protected by a fitting or device that serves as a protective water seal
to prevent harmful sewer gas from entering an occupied space. This
device is called a trap. A p-trap gets its name from its appearance,
which resembles the letter P, and is installed receiving the outlet
flow of waste water from a fixture. P-traps are available in a variety
of styles, which include one-piece and two-piece designs and are
designed to serve wall entry connections to the branch drain pipe,
whereas S-traps are designed to serve floor entry connections to
the drain pipe. The joints of a trap and it's connections to the drain
and fixture it serves are commonly assembled with compression style
fittings similar to a union.

                                                     4.3 Drain, Waste, and Vent (DWV) | 236
P-Trap by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0

Trap Adapter

A slip-joint p-trap is tubular size and has a smaller outside diameter
than the connecting DWV pipe. The fitting for connecting tubular
sizes to DWV pipe sizes is referred to as a trap adapter and
sometimes also called a desanco. A trap adapter is usually installed
during the fixture installation phase of a project. Cast iron, copper,
and galvanized piping systems use brass trap adapters.

237 | 4.3 Drain, Waste, and Vent (DWV)
Drain Cleaning

If you talk to any plumber or maintenance technician that has long-
term experience with clearing clogged sewer and drain lines, you'll be
amazed with the stories of the unthinkable items they have cleared
or retrieved from DWV systems. Food and human
waste, jewelry, silverware; toys, mop heads, and tree roots; beach
towels, linen, and personal hygiene products; birds' nests, tree waste
and fruit dropped by animals into vent systems, and more, They've
seen it all!

   Chemical drain cleaners, plungers, hooked flexible plastic
extraction devices, and other gadgets can clear clogged p-traps and
other clogs in drain lines relatively close to fixtures, some clogs
require plumbing and maintenance technicians to use a manual or
motorized drum auger to clear them.

If a hand or drill operated auger does not clear a clog, a heavy-duty

auger cable to cut through obstructions like human and food waste,

4.4 Valves & Prevention
Devices

Many devices and faucets are considered to be valves, and numerous
valve designs exist and many have multiple uses. Valves and devices
installed for potable water must be approved by plumbing codes.
Threaded valves and devices typically have female threads, however
soldered connections are used for many valves and devices
connecting to copper tube and plastic valves and devices are available
with solvent welded connections. Backflow devices are installed to
protect a potable water system, but an air gap is the only sure method
of backflow prevention.

Isolation Valves

Every residential dwelling is required by code to be provided with
at least one isolation valve. The valve must be installed in a easily
accessible location, so the homeowner can shut off the water supply
in case of an emergency or a repair. Most codes require that the
minimum size of a residential water service be 3/4". Actual size is
based on the number of plumbing fixtures.

   Many codes dictate that the main isolation valve for a house and
the isolation valve for a water heater be a full port design. A full port
valve has the same inside diameter (ID) as the connecting pipe and
does not drastically restrict the volume of water that flows through
a valve. Some isolation valves and most devices installed in a piping
system have a direction of flow and require an installer to connect
the piping system knowing the flow direction of the water or gas.

                                                    240
Types of Isolation Valves & Residential Uses

Ball Valve- Water and Gas: Utilizes an internal ball with a hole in its
center that creates a flow passageway through the valve, and isolates
flow when the ball is rotated 90 from the flow direction. Some types
of ball valves are available with a T-handle, but the most common
have a lever handle. The internal ball has a vertical stem protruding
from the valve body, to which the lever handle is secured with a
tightening nut.

Ball Valve - Full Port vs. Standard by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC

   Gate Valve- Water: Utilizes a metal gate (disc) that slides vertically
to open and close the valve. A wheel handle that is fixed to a stem
raises and lowers the internal gate when manually turned. The handle
241 | 4.4 Valves & Prevention Devices
is turned counterclockwise to open the valve and clockwise to close
the valve. The two basic self-explanatory types of gate valves are a
rising stem type and a non-rising stem type.

   Stop Valve- Water: A valve design that uses a rubber washer to

stop the flow of water; it is a directional flow isolation valve. A stop is
a restrictive port valve, which is one reason it is no longer widely used
in a piping system. A stop is more popular as an individual fixture
isolation valve. Commonly installed as the connection between the
water distribution system and the fixture tubing connection. Modern
fixture supply stops incorporate a 1/4 turn ball valve design in place
of a rubber washer assembly to shut off the flow of water. Angled
and straight stops for individual fixture isolation are manufactured
with chrome and brass finishes. While stops for modern residential
applications usually use compression style fittings, older residential
and contemporary commercial buildings often are fitted with
threaded stops.

       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=177

Stop and Waste Valve- Water: A stop and waste valve uses the same
design as a stop valve to isolate an entire water distribution system,
except that it also has a draining feature. When freezing is a concern
or the need to drain a small portion of a piping system is required,
a stop and waste valve is installed. A stop and waste valve cannot be
installed in locations where water could enter the water distribution
system through the drain portion. Backflow of non-potable water
could enter the drain port while the water distribution system was
not under pressure. Some ball valves are available with a waste valve
feature.

   Gas Cock- Gas: Used for gas distribution systems, a gas cock is
used more as a means of isolating entire systems, and utility
providers commonly use it for isolating gas meters.. Many ball valve
designs for gas isolation are manufactured with a T-handle design,
which differs from the typical WOG (water, oil, and gas) ball valve
lever handle. Many designs do not have a manual handle such as a
lever or wheel handle, but require a wrench to open and close the gas
cock.A ball valve specifically designed for gas systems is not rated for
use with other systems.

Hose End Outlets

Various types of hose outlet connections are used in a plumbing
piping system to drain equipment and systems and for water usage.
The most common hose outlet designs are known as a hose bibb,
wall hydrant, and boiler drain. Hose threads are different than pipe
threads, and outlets are 3/4" male hose threads. A hose connection

known as backflow. Back siphoning can occur if a hose connected to a
water supply pipe is placed into a contaminated source and the water
system becomes depressurized.

Types of Hose End Outlets

Boiler Drain: A hose outlet connection that is designed to drain
water heater storage tanks is known as a boiler drain. Boilers and
water heaters are protected with other approved backflow devices,
so most codes do not require a boiler drain to incorporate an integral
backflow device in the design.

   Hose Bibb: Hose bibbs are designed to allow water flow from a
pressurized piping system. Some hose bibbs are similar to a boiler
drain, and others are a freeze-proof type. Due to their potential to
have contaminants enter the potable water system through them,
most hose bibbs are required to be protected with a backflow device.

Protective Valves and Devices

Many valves and devices react automatically to temperature and
pressure differences or protect potable water systems from
the reversal of flow within a piping system. Protective safety valves
and devices can also regulate pressure, discharge high pressure, and
discharge high temperature to protect system users and other
plumbing system components.

249 | 4.4 Valves & Prevention Devices
incoming water pressure. For municipal systems or community
systems with a water meter, the incoming water supply pressure
to a house depends on the design of the municipal or community
system. While the optimal operational pressure for most household
water supply systems is 40 to 80 pounds per square inch (psi), many
municipal water system supply more than 100 psi or pressure to
the residence. Excessive pressure in the water supply to a residence
must be regulated to prevent pipes and fittings from bursting, and
to protect valve seals and connected household appliances from
damage due to high pressure. Codes typically allow the water service
piping and hose faucets to exceed 80 psi, but piping that serves
fixtures must be reduced to a maximum pressure of 80 psi. Most
residential PRV styles have an adjustment range from 25 to 75 psi
and are factory set to regulate water pressure to 50 psi and can
be adjusted with a bolt/locking nut mechanism that reduces or
increases the water pressure to the desired setting. An isolation
valve should be installed upstream of PRV devices. PRVs are available
in a variety of sizes, but 3/4" is the minimum size for reducing the
main piping to a standard residence. To check the actual unregulated
water pressure to a building, a simple water pressure gauge can
be temporarily fitted with an adapter to an unregulated hose
bib or faucet on the exterior of the building. Regulated pressure can
be checked by adapting the same gauge to an interior faucet or
washing machine supply valve.

Relief  valve: Relieves  excessive               pressure  or

temperature. Protecting a piping system and attached equipment

from extreme temperatures and pressures is the responsibility of a

relief valve. All relief valves are self-operating and open and close

as they react to the various operating conditions of a system. Many

dual-use relief valves provide protection against both temperature

and pressure. These are known as T&P relief valves. Most codes

require that a water heater be equipped with the proper T&P relief

valves before being shipped. While valves used for water heaters

on conventional and solar water heating incorporate a T&P valve in

the tank design of water heaters, valves for pressure relief only are

used on solar water heating panels. Pressure only style valves can be

differentiated from T&P valves by the absence of a ceramic coated

rod that normally protrudes from the T&P inlet.

   Check valve: Prevents the reverse flow of water or gas. Although

check valves are a form of backflow-prevention devices, a single
check valve is not an approved method to protect a potable water
system from contamination. Swing and spring style check valves are
the two most common installed for residential applications. They are
installed to ensure the water, or gas, flows in one direction. The
swing check style is more common for most water supply
applications. The spring check is used more for gas supply and well
pump systems.

   Vacuum breaker: Prevents back siphoning. When a water
distribution system is isolated or loses pressure, a vacuum is created
and can allow contaminated water to enter a potable water system.
To prevent the possibility of this type of contamination, a vacuum
breakers are installed throughout a piping system. Vacuum breakers
are available in several forms.

   Vacuum relief valve: Prevents back siphoning. Vacuum relief valves
are type of vacuum breaker installed in the cold water piping that
serves a water heater. This form of backflow prevention operates
when sensing a loss of water pressure. It opens to create an
atmospheric condition or to equalize the piping system with
atmospheric pressure (zero gauge pressure).

   Reduced pressure zone valve (RPZ): Prevents backflow. A reduced-
pressure zone valve (RPZ) is the most reliable device installed in a
plumbing system as a prevention method to stop the backflow of
contaminated water from entering a potable water supply system. If
water attempts to backflow in the system, it is discharged from the
RPZ.

Drains

Plumbing codes require that every house must have at least one
toilet, lavatory sink, bathtub or shower, and a kitchen sink. These, and
some other items referred to in this chapter, are known as fixtures.
Clearances from finished walls and other fixtures are strictly
regulated by code and most fixtures are provided with a
manufacturer rough-in sheet and installation instructions. Codes
regulate the materials that are used to manufacture plumbing
fixtures, which must have smooth, impervious surfaces and be defect
free. Fixtures that incorporate porcelain enameled surfaces must be
capable of withstanding acid without damaging the fixture.

   Pay attention to flow rates, volume, and water usage in selecting
fixtures. One key aspect of sustainability in plumbing focuses on
water conservation. Lavatory faucets and shower heads are two
primary focal points of conserving water. The true water saving
aspect of a shower is based on duration of each use. A handheld
shower can be equipped with mechanisms to turn off the water flow
for certain showering activities, such as lathering.

Faucets

Lavatory with 2 handles by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   Selecting which manufacturer's product to install is based on cost,

quality, and preferred faucet design which includes aesthetics, and
functionality. Most master bathrooms and guest bathrooms have
more expensive finishes than other bathrooms in a large house.

Faucet finishes dictate the finishes used for drain assemblies and
bathroom accessories which creates a color theme. Faucet
accessories are available to create various themes. Water
conservation faucets have aerators that reduce the flow of water to
allow only 0.5 gallons per minute as opposed to a 1.0 gallons per
minute. Single-handle faucets blend the hot and cold water with the
use of one handle; two-handle designs require a user to operate both
handles to achieve a desired temperature.

Faucet Installation

A faucet installed on a sink through a countertop or through a tub
platform, instead of through the fixture itself, is considered a deck
mounted faucet. All faucets must be designed to prevent backflow of
wastewater into the water distribution system and plumbing codes
require that a faucet have an air gap or be protected with a vacuum
breaker or approved check valve. Most faucets use a tightening nut
and flat washer to secure the faucet to a fixture. A bathtub and

259 | 4.5 Faucets, Fixtures, & Fixture Drains
shower faucet is usually installed during the rough-in phase of
construction.

   Faucet Water Supply:Connecting a water supply pipe to a faucet
varies with the type of faucet and can be accomplished with many
common connection methods. Some faucets connect to the water
supply with male or female adapters to create a soldered connection,
and others use a specially designed 3/8" OD supply tube that
connects to the male threads of a faucet.

Drain Assemblies

Drain assemblies are purchased based on the specific fixture they
serve. Codes dictate the minimum drain size serving a particular
fixture, and all fixtures and drain assemblies are manufactured based
on minimum code requirements. A trap adapter is installed to
connect the stubout pipe to the p-trap outlet. Most codes dictate
that the largest size foreign object that can enter a drainage system
is 1/2" diameter.

Fixture Types and Assemblies

Toilet

Toilets are also known as water closets. Residential toilets must be
self-cleaning during their flushing cycle and have a toilet
seat installed. Water conservation fixtures ate rated at 1.6 gallons per
flush (gpf) and 1.28 gpf. The most common residential toilet bowl
design uses a siphon-jet flushing action. A tank handle activates a
flushing cycle, and the water flows from the tank and enters the rim
of the bowl. Small holes in the rim are angled to allow the water
to create the vortex. The vortex (swirl) begins a siphoning action
to evacuate waste from the bowl. The jet stream exits the rim and
thrusts into the passageway of the toilet providing the initial thrust in
the flushing process.

   The water supply is located on the left side of all toilets. The stop
and escutcheon are installed the same for a toilet as for other
fixtures. The water is connected to a toilet using a a tank supply. A
tank supply is a chrome-plated soft copper tubing having a flat end
that connects the stop to the fill valve. More modern supply lines are
compression fit, plastic tube, with some having a braided stainless
steel sleeve that protects the line from swelling and bursting. The
toilet is installed onto the closet (toilet) flange and sealed with a wax
ring. Some wax seals have a plastic accessory called a horn molded
into the wax.

   Toilet ADA Requirements: Handicap fixtures must comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The tank handle of an ADA-
compliant toilet must be located on the side of the tank that has the
greatest distance from a sidewall. A handle located on the top of a
tank typically meets ADA handle location regulations. The height of
a toilet bowl from the floor, which includes the seat, is regulated by

261 | 4.5 Faucets, Fixtures, & Fixture Drains
code. ADA codes dictate that the minimum height from a floor to a
toilet seat is 16-1/2"; the maximum is 19-1/2".

   Toilet Piping Locations: The outlet distance of a standard toilet is
12" from the finished wall located behind the toilet (back wall). Lesser
used 10" and 14" rough toilets are available in some toilet
designs. Typically, one-piece toilets have different water rough-in
location requirements than two-piece toilets. When selecting a one-
piece toilet, always request the manufacturer's data sheet, known as
a roughin sheet, to confirm the water and drain pipes' installation
locations.

   Toilet Bowl Shapes & Seats: Residential toilets have round style
bowls. Elongated bowls installed in many homes are
usually considered a fixture upgrade. Codes require that an
elongated (oval) bowl design be installed in commercial
applications. When selecting an elongated bowl in place of a
round bowl, be sure to check your local codes pertaining to the
minimum clearance in front of a toilet. Codes require that
commercial seats be an open front type and not have a lid.

Lavatory sink

Also known as a lavatory, lav, or basin. Many types, shapes, and colors
are available. Many homebuilders install cultured marble solid
surface countertops with pre-molded sink basins, so the plumber
does not install a separate sink. Other models of lavatory sinks
include drop-in, under-mount, and vessel (similar to bowl setting
on the countertop fed by a separate counter mounted faucet), The
stub-out piping serving a lavatory is either 1 - 1/4" or 1 -1/2". Most
residential lavatories use a pop-up drain assembly. The overflow
drain on a residential lavatory is an integral feature provided by the
sink manufacturer.

   Lavatory ADA Requirements: Many lavatories are sold
      specifically for ADA compliance, but they are used more for
      commercial applications. ADA requirements require specific
      codes relating to the countertop height from the floor, the knee
      space under the sink, and the distances from the side and back
      walls.

   Lavatory Styles: Lavatory sinks are ordered based on shape,
      size, color, and mounting requirements, as well as the number of

263 | 4.5 Faucets, Fixtures, & Fixture Drains
   faucet holes and the distance between them.

      One-Piece: Cultured marble or other approved material,
         incorporates the countertop and sink being formed as one
         unit.

      Drop-in: A typical residential home utilizes a drop-in style
         lavatory that is either round or oval. A drop-in type lavatory
         sink requires a specific size hole cut into the countertop for
         the particular sink to be installed into the hole.

      Under Counter Mount: Considered an upgrade, under
         counter mounted sinks attach to the underside of finish
         grade holes based on templates of the sink in granite,
         composite, and other hard countertops. While some of
         these sinks are secured with retaining clip, many rely on
         modern adhesive caulks to adhere them to the countertop
         and support their full weight during use.

      Pedestal: A pedestal sink is a wall-hung sink with a
         decorative vertical leg known as a pedestal. The bowl is
         supported with brackets that are anchored to pieces of
         wood installed in the wall framing. The pedestal is not
         designed to be the sole support of the basin (bowl), but
         instead conceals the drain piping below the sink while
         providing a decorative styling.

 Lavatory Faucets: A lavatory faucet installs onto a plumbing
   fixture with various methods depending on the faucet type and
   manufacturer's design. They can be installed in either fixture
   mount style sinks or deck mount (through the countertop)
   applications. The standard, and most common, lavatory sink has
   a 4" hole spread between the hot and cold handles. The term
   spread refers to the distance between the hot and cold faucet
   inlets. The two most common handle designs are a single-
   handle and a two-handle faucet. The middle hole of a three-hole

                                            4.5 Faucets, Fixtures, & Fixture Drains | 264
      lavatory sink is located in the center in the sink to receive the
      drainage operating assembly (pop-up) and/or a faucet spout
      connection.
   Lavatory Drains: The drain assembly for a lavatory faucet is
      known as a pop-up. The pop-up assembly consists of several
      different operating pieces that function as one unit. The pop-up
      rod is inserted through the faucet within the spout and
      connects to a linkage assembly below the sink that operates the
      pop-up plunger. All lavatory sink pop-up assemblies are 1 -1/4"
      tubular size. Most lavatories have an overflow port to eliminate
      water from rising over the rim of the fixture.

Bathtub

Bathtubs are also known simply as tubs. A standard tub in a home
is 5-0" in length and averages 30" wide. The depth of water a tub
can hold varies with each specific tub design. Some tubs are sold
separately, while others are sold with wall kits as a one-piece tub
and shower unit or with various whirlpool features. A one-piece tub

265 | 4.5 Faucets, Fixtures, & Fixture Drains
and shower unit is a fiberglass tub molded with the walls as a single
unit. A tub is typically installed during the rough-in phase of a
project. However, some drop-in style tubs, whirlpool tubs, and large-
capacity garden tubs, are installed on top of tile or other solid surface
are installed after the finished surface is complete.

   The drain location is typically on one end of the tub that is known
as the head wall. This is usually the same wall where the faucet is
located and tubs are selected based on a left-hand or right-hand
head wall design. The bottom surface of a tub slopes toward the
drain. Every tub has an overflow hole (port) where a waste and
overflow is installed.

   Bathtub Faucets: A tub faucet is intended to fill a tub. A tub
      faucet can either be deck-mounted or installed in a wall. Deck-
      mounted faucets are common for large-capacity tubs and
      whirlpool tubs. A faucet serving a tub or a shower is commonly
      referred to as a tub valve. Tub/shower valves can be used for
      tubs without a shower by installing a plug or cap in the shower
      riser port.

   Tub & Shower Faucets: A tub and shower combination faucet is
      capable of providing water for bathing or showering with the
      use of a diverter. Many different designs are available to divert
      the water flowing through a tub spout to flow through a
      showerhead. Diversion methods of a single-handle tub and
      shower faucet use either a diverter style tub spout or a push
      button diverter usually located directly below the faucet handle.
      A three-handle Tub and shower faucet design uses the middle
      handle as the diverter.

   Bathtub Drains: A bathtub drain assembly is called a bath waste
      and overflow (BW&O). A bathtub has an overflow port hole and a
      drain port that are always connected and installed as a pair
      (usually aligned with each other). Large capacity whirlpool tubs
      are more likely to have the holes in varying locations than a

Shower

Not part of a tub and shower combination.
   Shower ADA Requirements: ADA-compliant shower bases have
      a lower or no threshold and a larger square foot area than a
      typical non-handicap shower base. Many shower designs use a

267 | 4.5 Faucets, Fixtures, & Fixture Drains
      seat within the shower, and most handicap shower designs must
      have a seat. If a seat is constructed in a tiled shower on a wood
      floor, the plumber must provide waterproofing (ex: PVC liner) to
      the seat as well as the shower base. One-piece shower units that
      have a seat are typically premolded into the design of the
      shower.
   Shower Faucets: A shower faucet is intended to serve a shower
      head. Shower faucets and tub valves are interchangeable,
      however a combination tub/shower valve that does not
      incorporate an integrated diverter may be used with the tub
      port plugged or capped.
   Shower Drains: A shower base constructed on a wooden, and
      sometimes concrete, floor prepared to be covered with ceramic
      tile requires a safety pan. Most safety pans use a polyvinyl
      chloride (PVC) liner. A three-piece shower drain is required to
      ensure that water does not seep around the drain. The threaded
      top portion is adjustable to allow various tile thicknesses. The
      middle portion receives the top threaded portion and is bolted
      to the bottom portion. The bottom portion rests flush with the
      wood floor and connects the piping to the p-trap.

Kitchen sink

The most common residential kitchen sinks have either a single bowl
or a double bowl. Most kitchen sinks are surface mounted and are
installed into a countertop during the trim-out phase of
construction. Surface-mounted sinks are also known as self-rimming
sinks and typically have holes for installing the faucet directly onto
the sink. Solid surface countertops can utilize a sink mounted from
under the countertop and incorporate deck mounted faucets. The
common types of kitchen sinks used in residential construction are
stainless steel and cast iron. The weight of a cast iron sink provides
the necessary stability to maintain its permanent position on the
countertop and does not require retainer clips when installed with an
appropriate adhesive caulk. A plumber applies caulking to the edge
of the cutout area of the countertop and places the cast iron sink
into the hole. A stainless steel sink requires the sink to be fastened to
the countertop using fastening clips provided. A kitchen sink can also
serve a garbage disposal and dishwasher

   Kitchen Faucets: A kitchen faucet is usually installed before
      installing a kitchen sink. A kitchen faucet has a swivel spout that
      allows the water flow to be used in each bowl of a kitchen sink.
      The most common type of kitchen faucet requires a sink to have
      three faucet holes that are 4" apart or 8" from the hot and cold
      water supply connections to the faucet. Most kitchen sinks are
      offered as a three-hole design, but many popular faucet designs
      have a pull-out spout that is also the spray unit. If a separate
      handheld sprayer is used, a four-hole model sink must be
      selected. Most pull-out spout faucets are manufactured with an
      integral check valve. The center hole of a three-hole sink is
      normally aligned with the center of the sink.

   Kitchen Sink Drains: The drainage system serving a kitchen

269 | 4.5 Faucets, Fixtures, & Fixture Drains
      sink is connected to the fixture with a basket strainer.
      Regardless of the type or style of kitchen sink, the connection of
      the drainage system is the same, and all have 1 -1/2" drain
      connections. A rubber gasket is placed over the basket strainer
      from under the sink. A fiber (cardboard)-type gasket is placed
      between the tightening nut and rubber gasket.

Laundry Sink

Also known as a laundry tray or utility sink. They are typically
installed in the same room as a washing machine, or in a garage or
workshop. Two most common types of laundry sink
designs are wall mounted, which requires a plumber to install wood
backing in the
wall during the rough-in and a hanger bracket installed during trim-
out; or with the four legs secured to the floor which requires a drill
to install anchors into the floor.

271 | 4.5 Faucets, Fixtures, & Fixture Drains
   Laundry Sink Faucets: Laundry tub faucets usually have a 4"
      spread design and most laundry sink faucets have a swivel
      spout. Some laundry sink faucets have a hose thread on the
      outlet portion of a spout to allow a garden hose to be
      connected. For a hose-end spout to be legally installed, it must
      have a vacuum breaker to prevent backflow into the potable
      water supply.

   Laundry Sink Drains: The minimum size drain allowed by code
      to serve a laundry sink is 1 -1/2". Most quality types of laundry
      sink basket strainers have a removable strainer. Because a
      laundry sink can receive discharge from a washing machine, a
      removable strainer should be installed.

Bidet

A bidet is a personal hygiene fixture that is usually matched in style
and color with, and placed adjacent to, a toilet. A bidet's faucet and
drain assembly are sold based on the fixture design and typically sold
as a pair with the toilet. The water supply must be protected against

backflow with a vacuum breaker assembly. The water supply serving
a bidet is typically a 3/8" supply tube similar to a lavatory. The base
of a bidet, like a toilet, typically has two mounting holes to anchor the
bidet to the floor.

   Bidet Faucets: A bidet faucet must be compatible with the
      fixture based on the faucet hole design for installing a particular
      faucet and a vacuum breaker if required. A vacuum breaker is
      required by code if the hygiene sprayer is located in the bowl
      area of a bidet because it is below the flood level rim of the
      bidet.

   Bidet Drains: A bidet's drain assembly is very similar to a
      lavatory's pop-up assembly. Most bidets that use vacuum
      breakers have a dedicated hole in the fixture while others are
      served with the backflow device installed in the piping system.

4.6 Plumbing for Appliances

Appliances are a vital part of a functioning residential dwelling, and
some appliances connect to plumbing systems. Some appliances
require a plumber to install the piping systems during the rough-
in phase of construction, while other appliances are installed by a
plumber during the trim-out phase of construction.

Dishwashers

A plumber normally installs a dishwasher during the trim-out phase
of construction, typically at the same time as the sink and garbage
disposer. A dishwasher receives hot water from the same water
source that serves the kitchen sink. Many codes require that a
dishwasher drain hose be routed through an air gap device to prevent
wastewater from flowing from the sink into the dishwasher.

   The water supply piping to a dishwasher is typically 3/8" OD

                          274
tubing, with the hot water supply routed from under the kitchen
sink. The drain hose from the dishwasher connects to either a
dedicated connection of a garbage disposer or tailpiece. A
dishwasher has leveling legs that can be adjusted to accommodate
the opening height from the floor to the underside of the dishwasher.

   Although dishwashers can connect to a kitchen sink drain with
a special "Wye" fitting, most dishwashers discharge through garbage
disposals at a designated dishwasher connection located on the side
of a disposer. If a hose end is not compatible with the garbage
disposer, a boot is used for the connection. A rubber dishwasher boot
requires a small piece of copper to be inserted into the boot and
the dishwasher hose, and then all connections are sealed with hose
clamps.

Garbage Disposers

A garbage disposer is a motorized appliance that is activated
manually with electrical current. It has an internal rotating flywheel
to shred food waste which is discharged into the drainage
system. The horsepower of the motor determines the capabilities

275 | 4.6 Plumbing for Appliances
of the garbage disposer. The most common HP sizes for residential
applications range from 1/3" to 3/4". A garbage disposer is commonly
installed in a kitchen sink with a specially designed mounting
assembly where a basket strainer would normally be installed. This
multi-piece assembly consists of a sink flange that is inserted and
sealed into the sink drain outlet where a basket strainer would
normally be installed. The rubber gasket creating the seal between
the disposer and the mounting assembly also serves as a noise
reduction item. A garbage disposer has a designated port to accept
the dishwasher drain hose.

   Biodegradable products can be added to a septic tank to stimulate
the decomposition of food waste within the septic tank. If a
homeowner does not add the biodegradable solution, the food waste
will settle to the bottom of the tank.

Washing Machine Boxes

A washing machine box is used to provide hot water, cold water, and a
drain connection in one central location. Most codes also require that
the smallest size water supply that can be installed serving a washing
machine is 1/2" (5/8"OD). Hose end style valves are integrated into
the box's design to provide hot and cold supply water to the washing
machine. Traditional stops with rubber washers are common in
residential applications, but 1/4 turn ball valve stops are becoming
more commonly used by contractors and over time are more reliable.
A typical residential washing machine box is manufactured to be
recessed in a wall cavity with a hub to receive 2" plastic pipe because

277 | 4.6 Plumbing for Appliances
most codes dictate that the minimum size drain that can be installed
serving a washing machine is 2".

Icemaker Boxes

A plumber routes the cold water piping to the refrigerator area and
installs an icemaker box as the termination point of the potable water
supply. The box is installed between two vertical wood studs and
near the floor during the rough-in phase of construction. A plumber
installs 1/2" pipe to the icemaker box and connects the piping to
the angle valve provided with the box. The outlet of the valve that is
purchased with the box has a 1/4" OD compression connection to
allow the compatible tubing of the refrigerator to connect with the
icemaker valve.

4.7 Water Heating

Conventional Water Heating Systems

The most common residential water heater has a 40 or 50 gallon
storage tank capacity. They are available in electric, natural gas, and
propane (LPG) models. The height and diameter of a water heater
varies with the gallon capacity. When selecting water heaters, it is
important to know the measurements of the space the appliance will
occupy, and to check the water heater manufacturer specifications
and codes for space requirements for ventilation, clearances, and
other installation requirements. The shorter versions water
heaters are known as a "low-boy". that can fit in closet spaces or
under stairs, or as a "squat" water heater that can fit under
countertops. Squat water heaters are generally offered in electric
configurations ranging from 5 to 40 gallons, and gas is not used due
to ventilation and carbon monoxide concerns.

   All water heaters must be installed per local codes and
manufacturer instructions:

   An isolation valve must be installed on the cold water piping
      near the inlet.

   A typical residential water heater has 3/4" male or female
      threaded water supply connections.

   Most codes dictate that any water heater located above a
      finished area must be installed in a safety pan.

   Most relief valve connections of a residential water heater are
      3/4" female and require a plumber to install a 3/4" male
      adapter.

                                                    279
Electric Water Heaters

An electric water heater only requires a plumber to connect the hot
and cold water piping from the rough-in stub-outs to the designated
inlet and outlet connection. They do not require venting or gas piping
and are less expensive to purchase. Most codes allow the safety pan
for an electric water heater to be plastic due to the lack of heat
generated externally from the water heater in comparison to gas
fired models.

   A standard residential electric water heater is classified as a
240-volt, 4500-watt, non-simultaneous water heater. Models with
faster recovery rates may have higher wattage elements. The higher
the wattage rating, the faster a water heater can heat water. Although
most electric water heaters have two elements, each rated at 4500
watts, a non-simultaneous heating cycle has only one of the elements
operating at a time. Each wire providing electricity to a water heater
is known as a leg. The two different wires (legs) that connect to the
high-limit device are identified as line voltage one and two. One wire
eventually provides 120 volts of electricity to one side of a heating
element and the second wire eventually completes the circuit by
providing an additional 120 volts to the same element.The screws that
secure the wire connection to the electrical devices are known as
terminations, poles, or posts.

       No water heater should ever have the ignited gas or electricity
       energized before filling the system with water and removing
       all trapped air from the system.

                                                                           4.7 Water Heating | 280

       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=186

Dip Tube- As heat rises, and the outlet supply of hot water to the
fixtures feeds from the hottest point at the top of the water heater,
manufacturer install a device known as a dip tube into the cold water
connection of a top-fed water heater to route the incoming cold
water to the bottom of the heater. If a dip tube were not used, the
incoming cold water would mix with the hot water located in the top
of the water heater, cooling the exiting water during use.

   Drain- Used to flush the water heater's storage tank during
maintenance.

   Ball valve- Used to shut off the supply water to the tank.
   Mixing Valve- Allows cold water to enter hot water stream to
temper over-temp water to prevent scalding. Mixing valves are

281 | 4.7 Water Heating
normally required to be installed on solar water heating systems as
temperatures can potentially reach in excess of 160.

   Tank Anode Rod- A residential water heater storage tank is
manufactured with carbon steel, with most common residential
water heaters incorporating a very thin coat of porcelain enamel
called a "glass" lining, designed to fill every internal crevice created
by the manufacturing process of the tank, to prevent the carbon steel
tank from corroding. However, over time, this lining breaks down
and the steel tank begins to corrode. An anode rod is a sacrificial
device that dissolves (corrodes) over a period of time. An anode rod is
installed by the manufacturer to prevent from rusting and corrosion
of the inside of the tank due to glass lining imperfections or minor
damage during shipping and handling. Magnesium-based and
aluminum rods are more vulnerable to rust and minerals that would
normally attack the steel walls of a tank and attract corrosives to
attack the anode rod instead of the tank.

   Top Access Cover- The thermostat and the red button are located
in here. The upper heating element is also found here.

   Bottom Access Cover- The lower thermostat and heating element
are located here.

   Upper Thermostat- Limits the temperature that the element will
heat the water up to. Both, upper and lower, thermostats are secured
in place and held against the surface of the tank with a retainer clip,
keeping the thermostat in contact with the external portion of the
storage tank. Most safety standards do not allow a plumber to set
the temperature above 120 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent scalding.
The upper thermostat of a seven-pole design only has three posts.
This three-post design combined with the four posts of the high
limit switch is how the seven-pole design is recognized. The upper
thermostat has a temperature setting feature that is typically either
identified alphabetically from A through D, or identified as warm, hot,
and very hot.

       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=186

Lower Thermostat- The lower thermostat only has two posts and
numbered 1 and 2. It also has a temperature setting feature that is
the same design as the upper thermostat. Like the upper thermostat,

283 | 4.7 Water Heating
lower thermostats can be adjustable and have similarly marked
adjustment points.

   Hi-Limit Device (Red Button Over Temperature Thermostat)-
The high-limit device halts the electrical current to the thermostats
and elements if an unsafe water temperature is present. Most high-
limit devices have a reset button designed to pop out if the
temperature reaches 190. These devices can be reset once the
temperature of the tank cools below the "pop-off" temperature.

   Heating Element- Elements convert electrical energy to heat
energy and transfer heat to the water in the tank. They are rated
in watts and selected for tanks according to tank size and recovery
rate. Residential electric water heating elements are usually a screw-
in type, but bolt-in types are used for certain water heater models.
The elements can vary in length, with 12" being the typical length
provided by a manufacturer in most water heaters. The electrical
voltage and wattage ratings of the element are indicated by a
manufacturer on the element so its identification of replacement
parts specifications is available on the exterior.

   Lined and Dielectric Pipe Nipples- Many water heaters are
manufactured with pipe nipples that are lined with corrosive-
resistant material such as PEX. These pipe nipples are manufactured
to resist corrosion due to electrolysis from joining dissimilar metals
to the iron tank (copper to iron = rust). Brass pipe fittings can also be
used between iron pipe fittings and copper to resist electrolysis. A
plumber must take precautions when connecting copper tube to a
lined nipple as heating the lining of the pipe nipple directly with
a torch or by connecting a fitting that has been soldered and not
allowed to cool can melt the internal lining of the nipple. Brass to
copper unions provide the same benefit in non-concealed
applications.

   Expansion Tank- Every water heating system must be protected
against dangerous occurrences that exist when water is heated. As
a heating cycle occurs, water expands and can cause the pressure

                                                                           4.7 Water Heating | 284
relief valve to begin dripping. Expansion tanks are installed, mainly
in solar water systems, to absorb the expansion of a system. An
expansion tank used for a potable hot water system has an internal
rubber membrane known as a bladder. Most codes require that an
expansion tank be installed near a water heater to protect the piping
system from high pressure caused by the heating cycle.

GAS WATER HEATERS

Natural gas and propane (LPG) are the two types of gas used
for water heating. A water heater designed for natural gas cannot
be used with propane unless the particular water heater can be
converted. The internal gas regulating orifice is different for each
type of gas. The venting requirements of a gas water heater are
dictated by code. The exhaust fumes from a gas water heater contain
carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide fumes are odorless and can kill
occupants of a home or building. Conventional gas water heaters
are vented atmospherically, that is, to the exterior of the
building. Atmospheric water heater venting must terminate in
specific locations through, and heights above a roof. Gas water
heaters must have adequate space around the water heater and
replacement air to create proper draft conditions that allow the
fumes to be exhausted to the exterior of the building. If adequate
air is not provided in the room where an atmospheric vented water
heater is located, the exhaust fumes could enter the occupied space.

   Selecting a gas water heater based on its capabilities requires
manufacturer's specifications for the specific appliance and
knowledge of the load demand. The recovery rate is the most
important aspect of determining if a certain gas water heater is
capable of being installed for a specific home or use. Gas water
heaters are rated by the gallons of hot water they can produce.
One British Thermal Unit (BTU) is the amount of heat required

285 | 4.7 Water Heating
to raise one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. One gallon
of water weighs 8.33 pounds, and 8.33 btus are required to raise
the temperature of one gallon of water by one degree
Fahrenheit. Temperature rise is the difference between the
incoming cold water and the desired temperature expected from
a water heater. Temperature rise determines the capabilities of a
certain Btu rating of a gas water heater. A length of time is used to
clarify the recovery capabilities of a gas water heater, and gallons per
hour (gph) is the most common method used in rating a hot water
heater.

   Codes vary pertaining to the gas supply connections and
      venting regulations.

   A gas water heater uses a metal safety pan.
   The gas supply configuration is fairly consistent with most

      residential water heaters: black iron pipe or approved
      polyurethane tubing, brass fittings, gas-cock, flex supply line,
      and regulator

Gas Regulators

A gas regulator is an automated device that controls the gas flow
to a burner assembly. The gas supply pipe is connected to the gas
regulator which regulates the flow of gas to the burner A
thermocouple must sense a pilot flame in order to allow the gas to
flow through a gas regulator. The design of a gas regulator is based
on safety, and most codes do not allow anyone not certified to repair
a gas regulator to disassemble one for repair. Another feature of the
regulator is to control the gas flow to a pilot flame. The gas regulator
for a residential gas water heater typically has a 1/2" female threaded
connection.

                                                                           4.7 Water Heating | 286

Tankless Water Heaters

A tankless heater design can be suitable for many residential
applications. Water flow is regulated to ensure that the desired
temperature leaves the heater. They are becoming more desirable
and are considered environmentally friendly. Tankless models are
also known as an instantaneous water heaters.

   The two basic types of tankless water heaters are interior or
exterior, defining whether the installation location is inside or
outside of the building structure. Tankless water heaters are available
in electric models for interior applications. Tankless water heaters
can be installed inside or outside a building, but units
installed outside must be gas. The units are not interchangeable.
Interior units require venting of the flue gas and exterior units may
require freeze protection in certain climates.

287 | 4.7 Water Heating
Solar Water Heaters

Although a solar thermal water heating system can save a residence
up to a 40% savings on utility bills, the initial investment to install
a solar water heating system may deter many homeowners. Federal,
and sometimes state, tax credits are available for installing alternate
energy systems and utility savings over time are a good return on
investment (ROI).

   Solar water systems use solar collector panels, usually mounted
on the roof to heat the system water. When the temperature of the
water in the collector reaches a specific higher temperature than the
water in the tank, a pump circulates the cooler water from the tank
which pushes the hotter water in the roof panel back into the tank
until the temperature of the panel and the temperature in the tank
are equal.

   The location and angle of the solar panel (orientation and tilt for
optimal sun exposure) is crucial to obtaining optimal efficiency of the
entire system. Most solar systems are directly connected to gas or a
single electric heating element to provide adequate hot water during
non-solar heating periods.

Diagnosing Common Water Heater Problems

Water heaters should be flushed annually to remove contaminates
and scale from the tank. Anode rod should be inspected every 2 years
and replaced approximately every 5 years, or sooner if conditions
show significant corrosion of the rod. Troubleshooting gas and
electric water heaters must be performed by qualified individuals.
Basic electrical knowledge must be known to safely troubleshoot an
electric water heater, and a plumber must have an electrical voltage/

                                                                           4.7 Water Heating | 288
amperage meter to diagnose and service an electric water
heater. Always remember that a water heater must be always be filled
with water before igniting the gas supply or electrically energizing
the system and only a certified technician can repair gas regulators.

2. Locate the electrical access panels, one near the base of the
      tank and one nearer the top (solar water systems only have one
      back-up element and thermostat located in the upper access).
      Beginning with the top element, remove the panel's screws with
      a screwdriver. Take off the panel and remove insulation behind
      it to uncover the heating element.

3. Disconnect either of the two electrical wires screwed into the
      element terminals. It is not necessary to disconnect both wires
      to test the element.

4. Set the multimeter or Ohmeter to read Ohms, and set the scale
      to RX1. Touch one probe to each of the two terminal screws. If
      the needle moves at all, or if there is any reading besides
      "infinity" on a digital readout, the element is good. If it doesn't
      move, or displays "infinity," no electricity is flowing through the
      element and it should be replaced.

5. Complete replacement or repairs as necessary. Reconnect the
      wire to the element terminal. Replace the insulation and
      reinstall the access panel.

6. Repeat the process on the bottom element. Restore power to

                                                                           4.7 Water Heating | 290

5.1 Electrical Safety

Electrical Safety Considerations

Electrical Shock

Electricity flows along a circuit that consists of a power source, a
load, and conductors. The human body can become a conductor and
a part of the electric circuit which can result in electrical shock.
Exposure to electrical energy may result in no injury at all or may
result in physical and/or neurological damage or death. An minor
electrical shock may cause muscle pain and may trigger mild muscle
contractions or startle people, causing a fall. However, high
resistance contact may cause dielectric breakdown at the skin,
lowering skin resistance, causing surface damage, but more often
tissues deeper underneath the skin have been severely damaged.
Electric shocks can paralyze the respiratory system or disrupt heart
action, causing instant death.

   The outcome of an electrical shock depends on several factors that
are determined by the relationship between current, voltage, and
resistance, also known as Ohm's Law.

                                          Ohm's Law
                            Voltage or Electrical Force (V)
                          Amperage or Current Flow (I)
                           Resistance or Ohms ( or R )

                                                    301
          CURRENT=ELECTRICAL FORCE/RESISTANCE OR I=V/R

Exposure Conditions play an important role in the extent of injuries
sustained as a result of electric shock. These factors include:

   Duration- The longer a human body remains part of an
      electrical circuit, more tissue and neurological damage can
      occur.

   Pathway- Electricity is always seeking the path of least
      resistance to ground. If both hands of a person are part of the
      pathway, the current has more potential to affect the heart
      resulting in ventricular fibrillation. If the current chooses
      another path such as hand-to-foot, tissue and internal organ
      damage still may occur.

   Humidity/Saturation- Electricity can easily flow through water
      or moisture in the air. Humidity also can effect how much a
      body sweats, which can lower a persons resistance to electrical
      current.

   Skin Condition- The human body's resistance to current is
      affected moisture content:

        Dry Skin- 100,000 to 500,000 ohms of resistance
        Perspiring (sweaty hands)- 1000 ohms of resistance
        In Water (completely wet)- 150 ohms of resistance

Amperage Kills

                                                                        5.1 Electrical Safety | 302
Current                 Effect
<1 Milliampere          No sensation
1 Milliampere           Tingling sensation
5 Milliamperes          Slight shock felt
6 to 30 Milliamperes    Definite shock
                        Could cause muscle contraction causing you to
50 to 100 Milliamperes  hang on
                        Painful shock
1000 to 4300            Breathing can stop
Milliamperes            Severe muscle contractions
                        Possible death
10,000 Milliamperes     Ventricular fibrillation
                        Respiratory paralysis
                        Possible death
                        Cardiac arrest
                        Severe burns
                        Probable death

Example:
A worker is using a faulty 120 volt tool on a hot and humid day and is
sweating heavily. The worker's body resistance is approximately 1,000
ohms.
Using Ohm's law:
 Current = 120 volts / 1,000 ohms.
 Current = 0.12 amps or 120 mA.
According to the above table, this amount of current will cause a
painful shock, the workers's breathing may stop, there will be severe
muscle contractions, and death is possible.

Arc Flash and Arc Blast

Arc-Flash-Arc- Flash burn can occur when an electrical equipment
malfunction causes an extremely high temperature area around the

303 | 5.1 Electrical Safety
arc that can reach as high as 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Electrical
burn can also occur any time an electrical current flows through
bone or tissue.

   Arc-Blast- When an arc occurs, a blast causes molten metal to be
thrown through the air and onto the skin or into the eyes. The speed
of the molten metal in an arc-blast is estimated at approximately 700
mph.

Lockout-Tagout

Lock Out & Tag Out Code Book by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY
4.0

   Lockout-tagout is a safety procedure used in industry settings to
ensure that dangerous machines and circuitry are properly shut off
and not started up again prior to the completion of maintenance or
service work. It requires that hazardous power sources be "isolated
and rendered inoperative" before any repair procedure is started.
"Lock and tag" works in conjunction with a lock securing the device
or the power source with the hasp, and placing it in such a position
that no hazardous power sources can be turned on. The procedure
305 | 5.1 Electrical Safety
requires that a tag be affixed to the locked device indicating that it
should not be turned on.

   When two or more subcontractors are working on different parts
of a larger overall system, the locked-out device is first secured with
a folding scissor-like clamp that has many padlock holes to hold it
closed. Each subcontractor secures their own padlock to the clamp.
The locked-out device cannot be activated until all workers have
signed off on their portion of the project and removed their padlock
from the clamp. A lock selected by color, shape or size (e.g. red
padlock) is used to designate a standard safety device, locking and
securing hazardous energy. No two keys or locks should ever be the
same. A person's lock and tag must not be removed by anyone other
than the individual who installed the lock and tag unless removal is
accomplished under the direction of the employer.

   Identify the energy source(s)
   Isolate the energy source(s)
   Lock and Tag the energy source(s)
   No keys alike
   May only be removed by the installer
   Prove that the equipment isolation is effective

Electrical Systems and Testing Terminology

   Continuity- presence of a complete path for current to flow.
   Resistor- implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.

      In electrical circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow,
      adjust signal levels, and to divide voltages.

        Fixed value- have a single value of resistance.
        Potentiometer- provides variable resistance by adjustment.

                                                                        5.1 Electrical Safety | 306
   Open Circuit- has intended interrupted path.
   Closed Circuit- has a complete path.
   Short Circuit- unintended path between two conductors.
   Ground Fault- unintended path to ground.
   Arc Fault- Normal when motor brushes spark and at receptacles

      when plugging in appliances and equipment that are in the "on"
      position.

        Series- conductor is series with load is unintentionally
            broken.

        Parallel- caused by short circuit or ground fault.

General Safety Rules for Electrical Maintenance
Technicians

   Safety glasses, goggles, or face shields must be worn any time a
      hazard exists that can cause foreign objects to get in your eyes
      from the front or the sides.

   Head protection must be worn whenever there is a potential for
      objects to fall from above, for bumps to your head from objects
      fastened in place, or for accidental contact with electrical
      hazards.

   Hand protection must be worn any time your hands are exposed
      to a potential hazard.

   Do not wear clothing with exposed zippers, buttons, or other
      metal fasteners.

   Remove rings, wristwatches, and any other metal jewelry before
      beginning work.

   Make sure that tools used on energized electrical equipment are
      nonconductive and have the proper voltage rating.

   Install all electrical wiring according to the current NEC

307 | 5.1 Electrical Safety
      codes.
   Work with a buddy. Avoid working alone.
   Always turn power off and lock it out before working on any

      electrical circuits or equipment.
   Never cut off the grounding prong from a three-prong plug on

      any power extension cord or from a power cord to any piece of
      equipment.
   Do not defeat the purpose of any safety devices such as fuses or
      circuit breakers.
   Do not open and close switches under load unless absolutely
      necessary.
   Assume all electrical equipment to be "live" and treat it as
      such.

Non-Energized Testing

Never test an energized circuit when individual components of the
circuit can normally be tested by other means. Most electrical
components and pathways of electrical systems can
be individually tested for continuity and resistance.

Insulated Tools

Insulated tools are designed for safety and are rated for live use up
to 1000 VAC or 1500 VDC. They must be tested at 10 times that
value (more than 10,000 V). Insulated tools should be used and stored
differently from conventional, non-insulated tools. When being used,
they should be kept isolated from other tools, including other
insulated tools, to prevent them from getting scraped or nicked. They

                                                                        5.1 Electrical Safety | 308
should be inspected prior to each use and discarded or tested by a
reliable authority if damage is suspected.

   Tool Rating: 1000 VAC or 1500 VDC
   Glove Rating: Tested: 20000VAC/50,000V DC., Max

Electrical Meters and Testers

   Direct Current (DC)- DC is an electric current that is uni-
      directional, so the flow of charge is always in the same
      direction.

   Alternating Current (AC)- Alternating current changes its
      direction of flow at a specific frequency known as its' Hertz (Hz)
      rating. In the United States, AC current changes 60 times per

                                                    310
      second or a rate of 60 Hz. In Europe the rating for AC current is
      50 Hz
   Continuity- A complete pathway for current to flow.
   Polarity- Refers to the north and south poles of magnetic
      fields. Direction of flow of the current in DC circuits. Referred
      to as positive and negative.

Meter Safety

   Make sure the meter you are using has a rating equal to or
      exceeding the highest value of electrical quantity you are
      measuring.

   Always wear safety glasses when using test and measurement
      instruments.

   Wear rubber gloves when testing or measuring "live" electrical
      circuits or equipment.

   Keep your clothing,hands, and feet as dry as possible when
      taking measurements.

   Never work on energized circuits unless absolutely necessary.
   Don't work alone, especially on "`live" circuits.
   If you must take measurements on energized circuits, make sure

      you have been properly trained to work with "live" circuits.
   Recalibration is necessary from time to time to bring a meter

311 | 5.2 Electrical Tools & Testing Equipment
      back to its intended level of accuracy.

Meter Care

   Handle all meters with care; they are fragile, sensitive
      instruments.

   Keep the meters clean and dry.
   Don't store analog meters next to strong magnets; magnets can

      cause the meters to become inaccurate.
   Don't expose meters to large temperature changes.
   Make sure you know the type of circuit you are testing (AC or

      DC)
   Never let the value being measured exceed the range of the

      meter.
   Multimeters and ohmmeters will need to have their batteries

      changed from time to time.
   Many meters have fuses to protect them from exposure to

      excessive voltage or current values.
   Re-calibrate measuring instruments once a year.

Lighting

Terminology

Ground- is a safety conductor with a low impedance path to earth. It
is often called the "ground wire" or safety ground. It is either bare or
has green insulation.

   Hot- is any conductor connected that has electric potential relative
to electrical ground or neutral. In 110/220 volt systems this
conductor is either black or red, and in some instances, blue. The hot
conductor terminates on brass colored terminals.

   Neutral- is also called the "grounded conductor" and is
represented by the white insulated conductor. It will terminate on
the silver terminal (longer slot on a receptacle face) of receptacles,
and at the neutral bus bar in circuit breaker panels.

   Leg-, as in "hot leg", refers to one of multiple hot conductors in a
circuit. Example: 240 volt circuits feature a neutral and two hot legs,
240 V to each other, and 120 V each to the neutral.

   Line- is the "in" side of the device where the wires from the panel
(or other equipment feeding the device) are connected.

   Load- is the "out" side of the device where any items that are to be
serviced by the device are connected.

   Hard-wire- refers to directly wiring to an appliance's terminal
block or by wire nuts in a junction box instead of attaching it by using
a receptacle and cord/plug assembly.

   Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)- Disconnects a circuit
when it detects that the electric current is not balanced between
the energized conductor and the return neutral conductor. Could

                                                    313
be caused by current leakage through the body of a person who is
grounded and accidentally touching the energized part of the circuit.

Lighting

LUMINAIRE

A luminaire is a complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or
lamps together with the fixture (parts designed to distribute
the light, to position and protect the lamps and ballast (where
applicable), and to connect the lamps to the power supply). The
overall performance of a lighting system is a combination of the
quantity and quality of light the lamps produce. Light output is
measured in lumens. The amount of energy used by a lamp type is
measured in watts. Efficacy is an indicator of performance which is
rated in LPW (lumens per watt). The higher LPW, the more efficient
the light source is.

LIGHTING FIXTURES

Lighting fixtures are designed to meet a variety of applications and
aesthetic requirements. Each fixture comes with specific
installation instructions provided by the manufacturer that should
be red prior to installing the lighting fixture. Some can be both wall
and ceiling mount, wile other fixtures may be designed for only one
method or the other. Each fixture also comes with labeling
listing installation restrictions pertaining to location, mounting
requirements, and wiring methods. Always connect fixtures to the
electrical system with the proper polarity.

   Common information found on a lighting fixture label:

      fixtures that are often called "can" fixtures)

*Type NON-IC- Installed so the insulation is no closer than 3 (75
mm) to any part of the fixture.

   **Type IC- Designed to be in direct contact with thermal
insulation.

LAMP TYPES

Light is the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Lamp
manufacturers are concerned with three factors: color temperature,
color rendering, and lamp efficacy.

   Color temperature of a light source is a measurement of its color
appearance measured in degrees Kelvin (캩). Light at higher-
temperature wavelengths (blue and white) is referred to as "cool",
whereas light from lower-temperature wavelengths is referred to as
"warm". These descriptions have nothing to do with temperature, but
with the way the colors appear. Warm light sources are commonly
used for residential applications because they make colors
appear more natural and vibrant.

   Incandescent- Relies on the resistance of a tungsten filament to

315 | 5.3 Electrical Terminology & Lighting
create light. Least efficient as it produces more heat than light.
Standard household incandescent bulbs are being phased out of
production.

   Florescent-Requires a magnetic or electronic ballast to provide
voltage surge required to start the lamp and current control that
allows the lamp to operate efficiently. Consists of a tube filled with
inert gas like argon or krypton, and small amount of
mercury. Electrons emitted from cathodes strike particles of
mercury vapor, producing ultraviolet radiation causing a phosphor
coating on the inside of the glass tube to glow and produce light
energy. More efficient than incandescent lighting.

   Compact Florescent- These bulbs were developed to save up to
75% in energy cost and last 10 times longer than incandescent
models. CFLs have heavy metal environmental disposal concerns to
include lead, zinc, copper and mercury.

   Light-Emitting Diode (LED)- LEDs offer energy savings of 80% to
90% over incandescent lamps with a reported operating life of up
to 100,000 hours. They are offered in most all bulb sizes and base
configurations.

5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring

Conduit

Raceways are defined as enclosed channels of metal or nonmetallic
material designed expressly for holding wires or cables. Branch-
circuit installation using a raceway (conduit) wiring method is seldom
used in residential wiring. However, some areas of the country
require that all wiring in a house be installed in a raceway wiring
method. Raceways should be installed as a complete system and be
securely fastened in place and supported by an approved retainer.

   Use individual conductors when installing a circuit in a raceway
wiring method. It is common wiring practice to install a green
insulated equipment grounding conductor in every raceway. Electric
codes have specific requirements for wiring in different types of
conduit that include allowable fill rates that vary depending upon
wire size and insulation type.

   The following conduits are used primarily in light to heavy
commercial application and are listed here for your reference:

   Rigid metal conduit (RMC)- RMC is generally made of steel with
a protective galvanized coating. It is a threadable raceway designed
for the physical protection and routing of conductors and cables and
for use as an equipment grounding conductor when installed with
appropriate fittings. It can be used in all atmospheric conditions and
forms of occupancy. Requires pipe and thread cutting specialty tools.

   Intermediate metal conduit (IMC)- IMC is a thinner-walled
version of rigid metal conduit and can be used in all locations in
a house where rigid metal conduit is permitted to be used. It can
be used as an equipment grounding conductor when installed with

                                                    317
associated couplings and appropriate fittings. Requires pipe and
thread cutting specialty tools.

Raceways used in residential wiring include:

EMT Conduit Bending

Bending conduit is a skill that improves with practice. The most
common electrical conduit installed in houses is EMT and, for this
reason, the discussion that follows on conduit bending will focus on
EMT. The bending techniques described may also apply to the other
types of circular metal raceways.

   EMT is bent in the field using either a hand bender, a hydraulic
bender, or an electric bender. Bend sizes 1/2 through 1-1/4 are
usually formed with a hand bender. A hydraulic or electric power
bender is generally used for larger sizes. Since most EMT installed in
houses will be 1/2, 3/4, or 1 trade sizes, we will focus on bending
with a hand bender.

   When making a bend using a hand bender:

                                                            5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring | 318
   Wear safety glasses and observe all applicable safety rules.
   Bend on a flat surface that is not slippery.
   Mark the locations on the conduit where you wish to make the

      bends clearly and accurately.
   Apply heavy foot pressure on the foot pedal to keep the conduit

      tightly in the bender.
   When making multiple bends on the same pipe length, keep all

      bends in the same plane.

Boxes

Electrical Boxes by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   Electrical boxes have many mounting options that range from

configurations designed to be nailed or screwed to framing members
or blocking, to models for remodeling (called an "old work" box) that
attach to the sheetrock that encloses a wall pocket.

   Device Boxes- are used to install receptacles or switches at
specific locations on an electrical circuit. Standard box openings are
approximately 3 x 2 with a depth that ranges from 1-1/2 to 3-1/2.

   Outlet Boxes- are used when installing lighting fixtures in a ceiling
or on a wall and when connecting small or large appliances. They are
larger than a device box and provide more room for different wiring

321 | 5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring
situations. Outlet boxes are offered in round, octagon, or square
shapes.

   Junction Boxes (J-Box)- These are used when several conductors
are spliced together at a point on the wiring system. The NEC
requires junction boxes to be accessible after installation without the
finish of a building having to be altered. Junction boxes must always
be covered.

   Heavy Load Boxes- Specifically designed and tested to
support heavier loads. Used for heavier loads such as ceiling
suspended paddle fans. Heavy load boxes can be manufactured with
metal or nonmetal material.

Metal Boxes

A metal device box often includes the capability of having the sides
of the box removed and the boxes ganged together to make a box
that can accommodate multiple devices. The most common metal
device box size 3 x 2 x 3-1/2. Another type of metallic device box
recognized by the NEC is the "handy" or "utility" box. This type of
box is primarily used for surface mounting and can accommodate one
device such as a receptacle or switch.

Nonmetallic Device Boxes

Nonmetallic boxes are usually made of PVC, phenolic, or
polycarbonate. The specific advantages of using these boxes include
that they are lightweight, strong, very easy to install,
and inexpensive. Most all nonmetallic boxes are wired using a
nonmetallicsheathed cable wiring method. Nonmetallic boxes are

                                                            5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring | 322
offered in single-gang, two-gang, three-gang device box, and fixture
mounting styles.

PVC Conduit Boxes

Although PVC boxes are designed and used for glue-up assembly,
some models have female threaded fittings to accommodate a variety
of threaded connectors.

Wires (Conductors)

Conductors in residential wiring are usually installed in a cable
assembly. They are made of copper, aluminum, and copper-clad
aluminum. Copper is preferred because of its great ability to conduct
electricity, its strength, and its low instance of problems over the long
term.

   Conductors are sized according to the American Wire Gauge
(AWG). Conductors used in residential wiring typically range in size
from 14 AWG to 2/0 copper. The larger the number, the smaller
the conductor. The smaller the number, the larger the conductor.
Conductor sizes larger than 4/0 are listed in kcmil (1000 circular
mils).

   Ampacity is the current in amperes that a conductor can carry
continuously under the conditions of use without exceeding its
temperature rating. A residential electrician or maintenance
technician must be able to choose the correct conductor size based
on the ampacity needed for each circuit they are working with. The
ampacity of a conductor depends not only on the diameter size of

323 | 5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring
the conductor, but also on the length of the conductor, and what
insulation type the conductor has.

Stranded Wire vs Solid Wire by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   THHN and THWN are codes for the two most common types of

insulated wire used inside conduit. These types of conductors are
often used in conjunction with flexible conduit in unfinished areas,
such as basements and garages, and for short exposed runs inside
the home, such as wiring connections for garbage disposers and hot
water heaters. They are also used in solid material conduit branch
circuits. The letters indicate specific properties of the wire
insulation:

          T: thermoplastic
                                                            5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring | 324
       H: heat-resistant; HH means highly heat-resistant
       W: rated for wet locations
       N: nylon-coated, for added protection
   Solid Core VS. Stranded Wire- While solid wire consists of a single
metal core, while a stranded wire is composed of numerous thinner
wires twisted together into a cohesive bunch. Both types of wire
are appropriate for commercial and residential installation, however
each has particular advantages and disadvantages that lead to the
choice of one over another for each particular application.

USE                             SOLID WIRE  STRANDED WIRE
Where flexibility is important  NO          YES
Protection against corrosion    YES         NO
Outdoor use                     YES         NO
Repetitive motion               NO          YES
Price advantage                 YES         NO

Wire Color and Use

Color choice for the insulation of the conductors installed in a
raceway depends on the type of circuit it serves.

    For a 120-volt branch circuit, use a white insulated wire and a
black insulated wire.
 For a straight 240-volt circuit (like an electric water heater), use two
black conductors or a black and a red conductor.
 If the circuit is a 120/240-volt circuit (like an electric clothes dryer),
run a white insulated wire, a black insulated wire, and a red insulated
wire.

   The NEC requires that each conductor be color coded to indicate
the function that it performs in a circuit.

325 | 5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring
   Black- Used as an ungrounded or "hot" conductor and carries the
current to the load in 120-volt circuits.

   Red- Also used as an ungrounded or "hot" conductor and carries
current to the load in 120/240-volt circuits like an electric clothes
dryer circuit.

   White- Used as the grounded circuit conductor
- Returns current from the load back to the source
- Called "neutral" conductor, but only true "neutral" when used with
black and red wire in multi-wire circuit

   Bare- Used as equipment grounding conductor that bonds all non-
current carrying metal parts of a circuit together; never carries
current.

   Green (can be green with yellow stripes)- Used as an insulated
equipment grounding conductor; never carries current.

Conductor Installation

Conductors are usually pulled into the conduit, but in shorter runs
between electrical boxes conductors they may be pushed through
the raceway. Conductors are taken off spools in a way that results
in the conductors coming off the spools easily and not becoming
tangled with each other. One of the easiest ways to do this is to use a
wire cart that allows several spools of wire to be put on at one time.

   If the length of conduit between boxes is fairly long, use a fish tape.
If the conduit already contains wires, be sure the circuits that supply
them are de-energized. Pull the fish tape out of its reel. Insert it into
a raceway and push it through until it comes out at a box location.
The fish tape will have a hook on the end of it. Attach the conductors
to the fish tape end. While one person pulls the conductors slowly off
the spools, another person will pull the fish tape with the attached
conductors back through the raceway.

                                                            5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring | 326

       http://pressbooks.oer.hawaii.edu/buildingmaint/?p=202

If the length of a conduit run is longer than the length of your longest
fish tape, another technique can be used. One technique uses a
vacuum/compression device to blow or suck a "mouse" with a string
tied to it though the length of conduit. Once the mouse has been
blown or sucked through the conduit, the attached string is removed
from the mouse and tied to a stronger pulling rope, which is then
pulled though the conduit. The pulling rope is then attached to the
wires and they are pulled into the conduit.

327 | 5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring
Cable Types

Cable wiring methods are easier to install than raceway wiring
methods, and this is the main reason why most houses are wired
using as little conduit as possible. Cable wire contains all of the
conductors needed for the circuit in a single insulated unit.

   When purchasing cable wiring system the cable is referred to by
two numbers: the first number specifies the gauge; the second the
number of current carrying conductors in the wire. Additionally,
there's usually another wire that is used for grounding (green or
bare). "12-2" means 12 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires,
and a bare ground. 12-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare
ground wire. Black, red, and a ground with no white wire is used for
220V circuits without neutral. 12-3 wire usually has a black, red, white
and bare ground wire and is used for 220V with neutral or in three-
way switch applications as the traveler between the switches where
an additional wire is required.

   Nonmetallic-Sheathed Cable (Type NM)- Also known as
"Romex". Least expensive and most used residential wiring method to
purchase and install.

                                                            5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring | 328
Romex Cable by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   Types of Type NM cable:

   Type NM-B (white outer jacket)- Most common type; use in dry
      locations only. Has a flame-retardant, moisture-resistant,
      nonmetallic outer jacket.

   Type NMC-B (yellow outer jacket)- Not used often in residential
      work ; use in dry or damp locations. Has a flame retardant,
      fungus and corrosion resistant, nonmetallic outer jacket.

   Type NMS-B (orange outer jacket)- Used in new homes with
      home automation systems. Contains power conductors,
      telephone wires, coaxial cable for video, and other data
      conductors all in the same cable. Has moisture-resistant, flame-
      retardant, nonmetallic outer jacket.

Underground Feeder Cable (Type UF)- Used for underground

329 | 5.4 Conduit, Boxes, & Wiring
installation of branch circuits and feeder circuits. Also used in
interior installations, but must be installed following the installation
requirements for Nonmetallic-Sheathed Cable.

   Armored-Clad (Type AC) and Metal-Clad (Type MC)
Cable- Certain locations in the United States may not allow

Nonmetallic Sheathed Cable in residential construction. Both have
a metal outer sheathing and provide very high levels of physical
protection for the conductors in the cable. Electricians sometimes
find it hard to tell Type AC (also known as "BX" cable) and Type MC
apart. Type AC cable has brown paper covering each conductor and
Type MC cable has a clear plastic wrap around all of the conductors.

5.5 Fuses & Breakers

In residential wiring, overcurrent protection devices consist of fuses
or circuit breakers. The NEC states that overcurrent protection
for conductors and equipment is provided to open the circuit if the
current reaches a value that will cause an excessive or dangerous
temperature in conductors or conductor insulation. Both circuit
breakers and fuses are used for this purpose. However, circuit
breakers are used in most building electrical systems.

Panelboards and Loadcenters

The following items are used to contain and organize overcurrent
devices in residential, commercial, and industrial wiring applications:

   Panelboard- A single panel that includes automatic overcurrent
devices used for the protection of light, heat, and power circuits.

                                                    334
335 | 5.5 Fuses & Breakers
Panelboard by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   Loadcenter-A type of panelboard that contains the main

disconnecting means for the residential service entrance as well as
the fuses or circuit breakers used to protect circuits and equipment
like water heaters, ranges, dryers, and lighting.

   Safety Switches- A safety switch is used as a disconnecting means
for larger electrical equipment. It is typically mounted on the surface
of or near the equipment and is operated with an external handle.
Safety switches can simply be an On/Off device or can have overload
protection devices incorporated in their design. Safety switches can
be found in both cartridge fuse or breaker configurations.

                                                                       5.5 Fuses & Breakers | 336

Fuses

A fuse is a overcurrent protection device that opens a circuit when
a fusible link is melted away by the extreme heat caused by an over
current. Causes can include a short circuit or excessive
load. Electricians and maintenance technicians may encounter two
styles of fuses protecting circuits:

   Plug fuses- These fuses "screw" into a socket device, either an
Edison base model or a Type S model. These devices are seldom used
as circuit breakers can be reset and are considered more reliable and
tamper resistant. Some codes may restrict the use of plug fuses in
building electrical systems.

                                                                       5.5 Fuses & Breakers | 338
Plug Fuse by Gwen Arkin is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   Cartridge fuses- Cartridge fuses are available as a ferrule model or

a blade-type model. Fuses must be plainly marked, either by printing
on the fuse barrel or by a label attached to the barrel showing the
amperage and voltage ratings. Often used in equipment safety
switches.

Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers- are available as a single-pole device for 120-volt
applications and as a two-pole device for 240-volt applications. They
also come as a twin or dual device that fits in the space of a regular
single-pole breaker. Circuit breakers are designed so that any fault
must be cleared before the circuit breaker can be reset. Even if the
handle is held in the "ON" position, the circuit breaker will remain
tripped as long as there is a trip-rated fault on the circuit. In some
cases, time is required for the breaker to cool before it can be reset.

   Most branch circuits are 120-volt circuits. These are wired with
      14 AWG or 12 AWG copper conductors and require 15 or 20 amp
      single-pole circuit breakers. A single-pole circuit breaker takes
      up one space on a panelboard.

   Many branch circuits serve appliances like electric water
      heaters, air conditioners, and electric heating units. These loads
      require 240 volts to operate properly. since it is a 240-volt

                                                                       5.5 Fuses & Breakers | 340
      circuit, it needs a two-pole circuit breaker. A two-pole circuit
      breaker takes up two spaces on the panelboard.

20 Amp Circuit Breaker by Mako Shimada is licensed under CC BY 4.0
   It is important to note the manufacturer and style of a breaker

when replacing it. Different manufacturers produce propitiatory
designs that can only be used in their own panels and are not
compatible with others.

341 | 5.5 Fuses & Breakers
        20-amp circuit breaker when wired with 12 AWG wire
        30-amp circuit breaker when wired with 10 AWG wire
   Appliance Circuits- There may be a need for 120/240 volts to be
supplied to appliances such as electric clothes dryers and electric
ranges. This installation requires a two-pole circuit breaker, just like
the 240-volt-only application. The difference is that a three-wire
cable with a grounding conductor is used.
   Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)- Although GFCIs look
very similar to regular circuit breaker, there are two very evident
differences: A GFCI breaker has a white pigtail attached to it that
is wired to the neutral bar in the panel; and a GFCI breaker has a
"Push to Test" button located on the front. GFCIs are also available as
receptacle devices that can be placed in-line with standard breakers.

to trip when they sense rapid fluctuations in the current flow that
are typical of arcing conditions. AFCI protection is provided with
AFCI circuit breakers and new codes require that all residences be
constructed with them. AFCI circuit breakers look very similar to

and will be wired with a dedicated branch circuit with 12 AWG
conductors and a 20-ampere overcurrent protection device.

Circuit Breaker Replacement

Always turn off electrical power at the main service breaker when
working in an energized main breaker panel.
 The LOAD side of the panel will be disconnected, but the LINE side
will still be energized.
 If you are working in an energized subpanel, find the circuit breaker
in the service panel, turn it off, and lock it in the OFF position.

   Test the panel you are working on with a voltage tester to verify

                                                                       5.5 Fuses & Breakers | 344
that the electrical power is off.
 NEVER assume the panel is de-energized.

   Circuit breakers are installed by attaching them to the main bus
bar assembly in the panel. The bus bar assembly is connected to the
incoming service entrance conductors and distributes the electrical
power to each of the circuit breakers located in the panel. In the
case of a subpanels, bus bars are connected to the incoming feeder
conductors.

   Circuit breakers are attached to the bus bar by contacts in the
breakers being snapped onto the bus bar at specific locations,
commonly called stabs.
 A single-pole circuit breaker has one stab contact.
 A two-pole circuit breaker has two stab contacts.

5.6 Receptacle & Switch
Wiring

Receptacles and switches are known as devices. A device is defined as
a unit of an electrical system intended to carry, but not use, electric
energy. Components that distribute or control energy, but do not
consume electricity include:

   Switches
   Receptacles
   Attachment plugs
   Lamp holders or sockets

       Always de-energize the electrical circuit first before servicing
       or installing any of the following devices.

Receptacles

Receptacles are contact devices installed at the outlet for the
connection of an attachment plug. While many people (including
electricians) refer to a receptacle as an "outlet", "socket", or "plug,"
they are the wrong terms to use.

   A single receptacle is a single contact device.
A duplex receptacle has two contact devices.
A multiple receptacle has more than two contact devices.

When connecting circuit conductors to a receptacle (or switch):

                                                        5.6 Receptacle & Switch Wiring | 352
Form terminal loops in the wire, put the loop under a terminal
screw, looping the wire around the terminal screw in the direction
the screw tightens (clockwise in almost all cases), and tighten the
screw the proper amount. A terminal screw that is not tightened
properly or a wire not looped properly around a screw will typically
be the cause of future problems. Push-in terminations are available
but are not as good a termination as a terminal loop termination.

   The listing instructions for devices like receptacles and switches
normally allow only one wire to be terminated to each terminal
screw. However, many electrical boxes containing receptacles or
switches could have many circuit conductors requiring connections
to the device terminal screws. The best way to make the necessary
connections so that only one conductor gets connected to a terminal
screw is to use a pigtail.

   Once the particular receptacle you are installing is connected to
the electrical system, secure it to the device box. Make sure the
conductors inside the box are pushed to the back of the device box,
leaving enough room to install the receptacle.

   Carefully push the receptacle into the device box, checking that
the ears on the top and bottom of the receptacle yoke will rest
against the sheetrock when the receptacle is installed. Once you have
determined that the receptacle ears will rest against the drywall or
finish surface properly, attach the receptacle to the device box using
the properly sized machine screws. Make sure the receptacle is flush
with the wall and straight, then attach the cover.

   Duplex Receptacles (3 Wires): The most common type of
receptacle used in residential wiring is a duplex receptacle rated for
15 amperes at 125 volts. It consists of two single receptacles on the
same mounting strap. As many of these devices are installed close
to ground level, Tamper-Resistant (T-R) receptacles are required in
some locations to protect children.

Split-Wired Duplex Receptacle- A split-wired duplex receptacle
usually has a switch controlling half of the receptacle and the other
half is hot all the time. They are often used to provide an accessible
switching device near a doorway that controls a plug-in table lamp
across the room (ex: bedside table- split-wire receptacle allows the
light to be turned on and off by the doorway, but the alarm clock
plugged into the same duplex receptacle remains on at all times).
Before installing, remove the tab connecting the terminal screws on
the hot side of the receptacle. Do not remove the tab connecting the
silver terminal screws.

   Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter GFCI- Connect GFCI
receptacles to the electrical system in much the same manner as
regular duplex receptacles. However, on the back of the GFCI
receptacles, one of the brass screw terminals and one of the silver
screw terminals are marked for the "Line," or incoming power
conductors. The other set of screw terminals are marked as "Load"
terminals, or the outgoing power conductors that protect other
receptacles downstream of the GFCI.

Two appliances typically require a special 125/250 volt receptacle
installation. These receptacles are larger and have different
configurations than the single or duplex receptacles.

Switches

Switches are used to control the various lighting accessories, and
sometimes receptacles or equipment, installed in residential wiring.
The procedures for installing a switch are very similar to receptacle
installation procedures. The main difference is the number of

363 | 5.6 Receptacle & Switch Wiring
switches installed in multi-gang boxes: In residential installations,
two- and three-gang switch boxes are common. Take care to ensure
there is enough room in the device box for all conductors and
switches.

   There are two styles of switches commonly used residential and
commercial construction: toggle and rocker (also known as decor).
While rocker switches are also considered decorative and may be
more desirable in some cases, they often have a wider profile than
toggle switches and may require more space in the switch box.
Because there are so many multi-gang switch boxes, make sure all
the switches are level so the faceplate will be level when it is installed.

   Switch rating must be matched to the voltage and current you
encounter with the circuit on which you are using the switch. Many
residential lighting circuits are wired with 14 AWG conductors
protected with a 15-amp circuit breaker and will require switches
with a 15 amp, 120 volt rating. This switch rating is the most common
found in residential wiring.

   Single-pole, three-way, and four-way switches are to be wired so
that all switching is done in the ungrounded circuit conductor. There
is no need to connect a white insulated grounded conductor to any
switch in a residential switching circuit.

   Single Pole Switch- The single-pole switch used in 120- volt
circuits to control a lighting outlet or outlets from only one location
is the most common. On a single-pole switch, two wires will be
connected to the two terminal screws on the switch. Both wires
will be considered "hot" ungrounded conductors.One is the incoming
power wire and the other wire runs to the light fixture or receptacle.

   Connect two conductors (usually black or re-identified as
      such*) to the switch

   Ground the switch.
   Set up the switch so it will read "OFF" when the toggle is in the

      down position.

                                                        5.6 Receptacle & Switch Wiring | 364
Single Pole Switch by Clifford Rutherford are licensed under CC BY 4.0

          *Switch Loop
       It is very common for residential electricians to run the power
       source to the lighting outlet first and then to run a two-wire
       cable to the single-pole switching location. When employing
       a switch loop, use the white wire as an ungrounded conductor
       and identify it as such. It is required that the white conductor be
       identified at both ends as a hot conductor. Use black electrical
       tape, although another color tape (like red or blue) may also be

365 | 5.6 Receptacle & Switch Wiring
       used, or a permanent marker to mark the conductor. The mark
       must completely encircle the conductor.
   Three-Way Switch- Connects three conductors to the switch to
control a light fixture or receptacle from two locations, such as at
the top and bottom of a stairway. Three and four-way switches do
not have On/Off markings on them. Beginning electricians and
maintenance technicians often find the connections for three-way
switches confusing. Learning some basic rules can make the process
much easier.
   Rules For Three-Way Switches

   Three-way switches must always be installed in pairs.
   A three-wire cable must always be installed between the two

      three-way switches.
   When wiring with conduit, three separate wires must be pulled

      into the conduit between the two three-way switches.
   The black colored "common" terminal on a three-way switch

      should always have a black insulated wire attached to it.

        One three-way switch will have a black "hot"
            feed conductor attached to it.

        The other three-way switch will have the black insulated
            conductor that will be going to the lighting load attached to
            it.

   Connect the two traveler conductors to the two brass colored
      "traveler" terminals and the conductor that provides power.

   When using nonmetallic sheathed cable:

        When the power source feed is brought to the first three-
            way switch, the traveler wires that interconnect the traveler
            terminals of both switches will be black and red.

        When the power source feed is brought to the lighting

                                                        5.6 Receptacle & Switch Wiring | 366
            outlet first, the traveler wires will be red and white.

              Re-identify the white traveler conductors with
                  black tape at each switch location.

   Ground the switch.

Four-Way Switch- Four-way switches have four conductors
connected to them. Four-way switches are used in 120-volt circuits
to control a lighting load from three or more locations, such as
in a room with three doorways that calls for switches controlling
the room lighting to be located at each doorway. They are used in
conjunction with two three-way switches. Two conductors will come
from one three-wire cable and two conductors will come from a
second three-wire cable.

   Connect the conductors from one cable to the two screw
      terminals that are the same color (traveler terminal screws).

   Connect the remaining two conductors to the two screw
      terminals that are a different color (traveler terminal screws).

Double-Pole Switch- These switches are used on 240-volt circuits
to control a load from one location (ex: electric water heater). The
double-pole switch has four terminals on it and, at first glance, looks
like a four-way switch. Unlike a four-way (or three-way) switch, the
toggle on the double-pole switch does have the words "ON" and
"OFF" written on it. This means that like a single-pole switch, there
is a correct mounting position for the switch so when it is "ON",
the toggle will indicate it. The double-pole switch also has markings
that usually indicate the "load" and the "line" sides of the switch.
Usually the "line" set of terminals is colored black and the "load" set
of terminals is colored a brass or bronze.

   Dimmer Switches- are used to brighten or dim a lighting fixture's
lamps. Found in both a singlepole and a three-way configurations,

367 | 5.6 Receptacle & Switch Wiring
both are available with either a rotating knob style or sliding
switch that varies the resistance in the circuit. Dimmer switches
differ from regular switches in that they do not have terminal screws,
but instead have colored insulated pigtail wires coming off the switch
installed by the manufacturer. To install a dimmer switch, connect
the dimmer switch pigtails to the appropriate circuit conductor with
a wirenut. Single-pole or three-way dimmer switches are connected
in a switching circuits exactly as regular single pole and three-way
switches.

Combination Devices

Combination devices have a combination of two devices, both of
which are mounted on the same strap. There could be two single-
pole switches, a single-pole switch and a three-way switch, a single-
pole switch and a receptacle, or a single-pole switch with an
indicator light.

5.7 Outdoor Wiring
Considerations

Wiring for Outdoors

Outdoor electrical wiring in residential situations includes installing
the wiring and equipment for lighting and power equipment located
outside of the house. Wiring may be installed overhead or
underground. Most underground receptacle and lighting circuits
installed in residential wiring are done using Type UF (Underground
Feeder) Cable. Type UF Cable must be physically marked as
underground feeder cable and is available from 14 AWG through 4/
0 AWG copper and from 12 AWG through 4/0 aluminum. Type UF
can be used outdoors in direct exposure to the sun only if listed
as being sunlight-resistant with a sunlight-resistant marking on the
cable sheathing. It can be buried directly in the ground or installed
according to the same rules as for Nonmetallic Sheathed Cable when
used as an interior wiring method.

   Any wiring installed in an underground conduit must have a `W'
in its insulation designation, such as "THWN" or "XHHW". The `W'
means that the conductor insulation is suitable for installation in
a wet location. Rigid PVC Conduit (PVC) is used for underground
conduit installation with these wires. Minimum burial depths for both
Type UF Cable and for any of the conduit wiring methods can be
found in the NEC code book.

                                                    370
Outdoor Receptacles

Receptacle outlets located outdoors must be installed in
weatherproof enclosures. The electrical boxes are usually made of
metal and are often called a "Bell Box". They typically have threaded
openings or hubs that allow attachment to the box with conduit or
a cable connector. These boxes come from the factory with a few
threaded plugs that are used to seal any unused threaded openings
to make the box truly weatherproof. Outdoor boxes can be mounted
on the surface of an outside wall or on some other structural support
such as a wooden post rising from the ground. They are often
installed with underground wiring and supported by conduits coming
up out of the ground.

371 | 5.7 Outdoor Wiring Considerations

   When a receptacle is installed outdoors, the enclosure and cover
combination must maintain its weatherproof characteristics whether
a cord plug is inserted into the receptacle or not. This is
accomplished by installing a self-closing cover that is deep enough
to also cover the attached plug cap on a cord. PVC boxes can also
be used for outdoor applications when secured with an approved

                                                   5.7 Outdoor Wiring Considerations | 372
weatherproof or weather resistant cover. The receptacle must be a
listed and marked weather-resistant (WR) type.

   Outdoor Receptacle Cover by Clifford & Rosemary Rutherford is

Outdoor Lighting

Outdoor lighting can be mounted on the side of building structures,
on poles, or even on trees. According to codes, any luminaire (lighting
fixture) installed outdoors and exposed to the weather must be listed
as suitable for the location and have a label with a marking that states
"Suitable for Wet Locations". If a luminaire is to be installed under a
canopy or under an open porch, it is considered a "damp" location
373 | 5.7 Outdoor Wiring Considerations
and the fixture only needs a label that states "Suitable for Damp
Locations."

   Although codes allow outdoor lighting fixtures to be mounted on
trees, they also mandate that overhead conductor spans cannot be
supported by trees or other living or dead vegetation. This means
that when installing wiring to a tree-mounted lighting fixture, an
underground wiring method must be used between each tree.

PART 6: MAINTENANCE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

                                                    375
6.1 Maintenance Categories

Maintenance procedures can be classified in three basic categories:

Corrective Maintenance is known as reactive maintenance. In

other words, waiting for something to break down before worrying

about repairing or replacing it. While this process may require

less expense in manpower, it can contribute to longer than normal

downtime while waiting on replacement parts or equipment to

arrive, or a need to have an extensive inventory of

those replacement parts or equipment on hand.

Preventive Maintenance is also referred to as scheduled

maintenance. This form of maintenance is based on a time based

understanding of when breakdown occurs, when specific preventive

measures are not taken. Preventive maintenance focuses on

replacing or repairing worn or expended system parts before failure

occurs, extending the life of mechanical systems. Common scheduled

maintenance tasks include changing filters and lubricants, cleaning

and flushing of contaminants, correcting tolerance discrepancies,

and other items that keep machinery and buildings operating at their

peak efficiency.

Predictive Maintenance relies on regular analysis of data collected

from in-service system equipment and components to determine

when maintenance will be required or a time when failure will

occur. Predictive  maintenance  procedures     often

include computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS)

to gather information from data loggers or sensors which are placed

on equipment to track temperature, humidity, speed, pressure,

voltage, amperage, flow rates, occupancy, and a multitude of other

factors related to the performance of a piece of equipment or

building system. When a data logger records a measurement that is

outside of a set parameter, the computer sends an alarm that can be

                   377
programmed to perform many functions to include but not limited
to: create a work order, send out digital information to maintenance
staff via text or email, and shut down equipment to prevent
catastrophic failure.

   Although initial setup of CCMS systems can be quite costly, over
time this form of maintenance can result in significant savings from
not having to keep a large inventory of replacement parts on hand,
efficient scheduling of people and ordering of parts, and less
unplanned failure of equipment. CCMS systems are commonly found
in commercial buildings such as hospitals, office and institutional
buildings, and resorts.

                                                             6.1 Maintenance Categories | 378
6.2 Work Order Process

Commercial Maintenance Process

Service Request

A service request can be occupant or operator generated due to a
system failure or for preventive/predictive maintenance scheduling.

   Work Order- Informs technician of the failure or maintenance
      procedure for corrective action.

   Inspection- Technician assessment for restoring failed
      component or service of equipment to operable or optimal
      condition.

   Repair- Process of restoring failed component or equipment to
      operable or original condition.

Repairs often requires the acquisition of parts or materials that may
not be immediately available. This may result in "down time" for a
necessary piece of equipment or facility component until the item
can be obtained. In order to restore operation in a timely manner, it
is important to obtain the parts that are right for the job by knowing
where to look and knowing how to properly describe the item(s)
when ordering.

                                                    379
Service Call Procedures

A service call is required if a building or equipment operator finds
something wrong with a building system or appliance's operation.

   There are a few steps to follow for a successful service call:
           Display a professional, courteous, and intelligent attitude

       when dealing with customers.
        Don't track dirt or mud into the service location.
        Make sure your tools do not cause damage to walls, floors,
       furniture, or other items.
        Be prepared to show some identification.
        Find the problem.
        Fix the problem.
        Explain what you found and how you fixed it to the customer.
        Fill in the appropriate paperwork in a legible manner.
        Make one last inspection of the work area.
        Clean up any mess you made.

                                                                  6.2 Work Order Process | 380
6.3 Parts and Material
Resources

Maintenance technicians have numerous resources at their disposal
to obtain repair instructions, replacement parts, and other resources
that can contribute to safe, successful, and timely repairs.

Manufacture and Vendor Parts and Repair
Resources

   Owner's Manual- General customer orientation of equipment
      or component. Often contains safety precautions, operating
      instructions, basic troubleshooting and warranty information.

   Technical/Service Manual- Professional field technician repair
      reference. Contains complete troubleshooting instructions,
      schematics, and technical information related to
      the manufacturer.

   Vendor- Store or source where part might be obtained. Many
      vendors carry items from multiple manufactures, however,
      many manufactures may act as sole distributors for their own
      items.

   Catalog/Internet- Manufacturer or vendor itemization of
      available parts, description, and price.

                                                    381
Part Types

   Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)- manufactures
      products or components that are purchased by a company and
      retailed under that purchasing company's brand name.

   Replacement (aftermarket)- Item made to perform the same
      function as original part, not manufactured by original
      equipment manufacturer.

   Universal- part made by a manufacturer that may replace
      similar parts on multiple manufacturers' items or models of
      equipment.

Procurement

In many commercial settings, the technician is required to provide
a purchase order (PO) to a vendor in order to obtain the necessary
items to perform the service.

   Requisition- The service technician must submit a request
(requisition) to their employer or business office for the purchase of
the required item(s). The requisition most often requires an accurate
description of the item(s), price, part number, quantity, vendor, and
vendor contact information.

   Purchase Order- Once the technician has submitted the
requisition for materials, the business office will generate a purchase
order. This is an agreement between the purchaser and vendor for
placing the purchase on a payment account. The business office will,
in most all cases, issue a purchase limit or specified amount to be
attached to the order based on previously quoted prices from the
vendor.

                                                      6.3 Parts and Material Resources | 382
Ordering Parts & Materials

When creating requisitions or ordering parts, equipment, and
building materials from vendors, be specific. If any of the data on
a replacement part does not match the original manufacturer's
requirements, the part/s may not provide adequate service for the
application and could potentially damage other components of
equipment and machinery. Manufacturers' information is often
available on the manufacturer's tag or nameplate found
on equipment, motors, pumps, propellers, blower motors, and other
components. This information can be key to identifying and finding
parts that are specific to an individual piece of equipment. Technical
manuals provide more in-depth information, can be helpful in
identifying specific parts and repair procedures, but do not always
offer a way to obtain parts for repairs. Remember that manufacturers
and parts vendors do not stock repair items forever. After production
runs of various items end, the parts resource no longer carries
specific parts and the item being repaired becomes obsolete or
beyond economic repair (a similar item can be purchased at a cost
that is cheaper than repairing the broken one).

   Some of the most important things that can help a technician
find the parts they need for repairs can be found on equipment
nameplates or tags, or even on individual equipment parts and
components include:

   Brand/Manufacturer- Maker or registered trademark holder
   Serial Number- Unique to the individual piece of equipment,

      often associated with ownership
   Model- Model numbers can signify a difference in power, size,

      accessories, or a wide variety of other options found in the
      terminology in this chapter
   Part number- Specific to the part, can often be cross-
